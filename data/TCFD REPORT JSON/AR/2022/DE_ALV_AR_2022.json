It monitored the activities of the company's Board of Management, addressed the succession planning for the Board of Management, and advised it on business management issues. It intensively dealt with the resolution of the U.S. governmental investigations and the lawsuits over the Structured Alpha Funds of AllianzGI U.S. LLC and the internal review of this matter.\n\nIn the financial year 2022, the Supervisory Board held six regular meetings as well as three extraordinary meetings. In addition, following the elections to the Supervisory Board, a constitutive meeting was held after the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022. The regular meetings took place in February, March, May, June, September, and December, and the extraordinary meetings were held in January, March, and May. Seven of the total number of ten meetings were held as video conferences. The other three meetings were held as in-person meetings.\n\nAt all of the regular meetings held in the financial year under review, the Board of Management informed the Supervisory Board about the development of business at Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. In particular, the Board of Management presented the development of Group revenues and results as well as business developments in the individual business segments. The Board of Management provided comprehensive information about the development of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, including deviations of actual business developments from the planning. In this context, the Board of Management also regularly discussed the adequacy of capitalization and the solvency ratio of Allianz SE and the Group as well as the corresponding stress and risk scenarios with the Supervisory Board. The annual and consolidated financial statements, including the respective auditor's reports as well as the half-yearly and quarterly reports, were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board after preparation by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe meetings focused in particular on the ongoing discussion of the civil and administrative proceedings in connection with the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha Funds and the internal review of this matter, in particular the resulting internal investigations launched, and the measures adopted by the Board of Management of Allianz SE. In this context, the Supervisory Board also regularly monitored the progress of the measures initiated by the Board of Management on the basis of the findings from the investigations. In order to ensure the appropriate and close monitoring of the Structured Alpha proceedings and of the internal clarification and review of the matter, including the root causes of the incurred fund losses in the spring of 2020, in accordance with the duties of the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board delegated to the Audit Committee the tasks of closely monitoring the Structured Alpha matter on an ongoing basis and of regularly reporting to the full Supervisory Board. In this context, it continued to be supported by the working group of the Audit Committee, which had already been set up in the previous year. The Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board again obtained independent advice relating to the Structured Alpha matter in the financial year 2022 from the law firm commissioned by the Supervisory Board. At its five regular and additional four extraordinary meetings, the Audit Committee comprehensively discussed questions related to the Structured Alpha matter/uni003B the working group of the Audit Committee met a total of ten times in the financial year. At its six regular meetings and in three additional extraordinary meetings, the full Supervisory Board extensively dealt with the matter. In the first half of 2022, a special focus was on the progress of the negotiations and talks with investors in the Structured Alpha Private Funds in the U.S. and the targeted settlement of the proceedings with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At several meetings, the Supervisory Board comprehensively discussed with the Board of Management the deliberations and considerations of the Board of Management relating to the conclusion of settlements with investors and the U.S. authorities, supported in each case by the law firm commissioned. The Supervisory Board also extensively dealt with the question of potential responsibility at the level of the Board of Management of Allianz SE and commissioned the external legal advisors to conduct independent investigations and analyses relating to potential claims for damages against former or current Board of Management members of Allianz SE. The legal advisors concluded that such claims for damages did not exist in connection with the Structured Alpha matter and discussed this in detail with the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition to the impact of the war in Ukraine on overall economic conditions as well as on the insurance industry and Allianz employees, the reports and deliberations also focused on a range of strategic topics, including the risk",

Cyber risk security and the effects of rising inflation rates and interest rates on the insurance business were also regularly discussed. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board dealt extensively with personnel matters relating to the Board of Management as well as succession planning for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The deliberations of the Supervisory Board and various committees also included establishing target achievement and setting targets for the remuneration of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received regular, timely and comprehensive reports from the Board of Management. The Board of Management's oral reports at the meetings were prepared with written documents, sent to each member of the Supervisory Board in good time before the relevant meeting. The Board of Management also informed the Supervisory Board in writing about important events occurring between meetings. In addition, the Chairmen of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management held regular discussions about key developments and decisions. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board held separate discussions with each member of the Board of Management on each individual's status of target achievement, both for the respective half-year and the full year.\n\nAs before, individual and group training sessions were implemented in the financial year 2022 on the basis of a development plan adopted for the further training of the members of the Supervisory Board, for example on the topics of reinsurance, sustainability, accounting - especially regarding the new accounting standards IFRS 9 and 17 applicable from the financial year 2023, the internal model for calculating the solvency capital requirement, and investment management.\n\nAt an extraordinary meeting held on 26 January 2022, the Supervisory Board obtained a comprehensive progress report from the Board of Management on the status of the civil and administrative proceedings in the U.S. concerning the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha Funds and was informed by the lawyers mandated by the Supervisory Board about the various legal options for terminating proceedings with the U.S. authorities. In addition, a detailed report was provided at that meeting on the preparatory extraordinary Audit Committee meeting on the Structured Alpha matter.\n\nAt the meeting of 17 February 2022, the Supervisory Board dealt extensively with the preliminary business figures for the financial year 2021 and the Board of Management's dividend proposal. The appointed audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (PwC), Frankfurt am Main, reported in detail on the preliminary results of its audit. In the further course of the meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed the harmonization and improvement of claims-handling processes at Allianz. The Supervisory Board also discussed the target achievement of the individual members of the Board of Management and, on that basis, set their variable remuneration for the financial year 2021, subject to the approval of the annual financial statements. Against the backdrop of the Structured Alpha proceedings, the Supervisory Board also discussed the question of the applicability of the so-called compliance caveat in paying variable remuneration components to members of the Board of Management. As the ongoing investigations of potential breaches of duties by members of the Board of Management did not give rise to any indications of misconduct by members of the Board of Management, there was no reason for this. However, in the light of the foreseeable high financial impact of the Structured Alpha proceedings, the Supervisory Board set a discount of ten percentage points on the individual contribution factor of all members of the Board of Management when assessing their individual performance. As part of the performance assessment, a fit and proper assessment of the members of the Board of Management was carried out. Moreover, the Supervisory Board extended the Board of Management appointments of Ms. Wagner by five years to 31 December 2027 and of Dr. R\u00f6hler by four years to 31 December 2026. Deliberations at that meeting also focused on the status of the various Structured Alpha proceedings. The Board of Management initially informed the Supervisory Board in detail about the status of the talks with the U.S. authorities and the settlement negotiations with U.S. investors. It subsequently discussed its considerations regarding the short-term conclusion of settlements with several large investors in the U.S. and the resulting potential impact on the formation of provisions, and therefore the annual financial statements for the financial year 2021 with the Supervisory Board. To that end, the Supervisory Board also obtained a detailed report from the lawyers in the U.S. and Germany engaged by the Board of Management and additionally obtained the legal assessment of the independent law firm it had commissioned. At the end of the meeting, the Supervisory Board held an executive session without the Board of Management members and discussed the talks of the Supervisory Board Chairman with investors and proxy advisors.",

At both meetings, the committee discussed the current risk situation of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE with the Board of Management. In the March meeting, the Risk Report and other risk-related statements in the annual and consolidated financial statements as well as management and Group management reports were reviewed with the auditor and approved. The appropriateness of the early risk recognition system at Allianz SE and Allianz Group and the result of further risk assessments by the auditor were also discussed. It recommended to the Audit Committee to include the Risk Report, as presented and discussed, in the Annual Report.\n\nAt both meetings, the Risk Committee also extensively dealt with the risk strategy, risk appetite, capital management, the external rating as well as the effectiveness of the risk management system for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE. In this context also enhancements of the risk and control framework, including professional external reviews were discussed. The committee also obtained a report on Allianz's own risk and solvency assessment and changes to the internal Solvency II model, and discussed the reports in detail with the Board of Management and the head of the Risk function. Moreover, the Risk Committee intensively dealt with the impact of the war in Ukraine on the risk situation of Allianz, inflation and interest rates as well as the assessment of rising government debt due to expansive monetary policy, in particular in the eurozone, and potential impacts on Allianz. Other key topics were the risk situation and stress resilience at Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG in Germany, and the realignment of the internal reinsurance relationships between Allianz companies. The committee also again addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the management of non-financial risks. In addition, the Risk Committee intensively dealt with the impact of the Structured Alpha matter on the risk situation at Allianz and subsequently with the cost structure of unit-linked insurance products in the German market. It again discussed a range of special regulatory topics and business policy issues. In the light of the war in Ukraine, it also discussed the risk of cyberattacks as a form of state warfare and, in general, the development of geopolitical risks. The committee also obtained reports from the Board of Management on current areas of focus of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, in particular digitalization and IT security, climate risks and risks from natural disasters, consumer protection (sales compliance) and the fulfillment of capital requirements, and the respective position of Allianz in any of these topics.\n\nThe Technology Committee held two meetings in the financial year 2022, both of which were held as in-person meetings. At these meetings, the committee discussed in detail the Allianz innovation program launched by the Board of Management, which comprises the transformation programs Allianz Customer Model (ACM) and Business Master Platform (BMP) as well as an application for data analysis and other innovative tools. Detailed discussions were held regarding data analytics and artificial intelligence and their potential to contribute to profits. The Technology Committee also received reports from the Board of Management on cyber-security and the realignment of activities in the Syncier subsidiary, which had originally been intended to externally market the IT platform, and comprehensively discussed the technology approaches of competitors with the Board of Management. The committee also engaged in discussions with the Board of Management on the status of the replacement of legacy systems and considerations regarding blockchain technology.\n\nThe Nomination Committee held four meetings in the financial year 2022, two of which were held as video conferences and two of which were held in person. At the beginning of the year, the committee first dealt with the 2022 Supervisory Board elections. Another major focus was on the general succession planning for the Supervisory Board, in particular the requirements regarding the competences and independence of the Supervisory Board members communicated by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and by investors. Taking account of these requirements, the Nomination Committee again intensively discussed potential candidates to succeed the members of the Supervisory Board who will be retiring in the coming years and identified suitable persons.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee held four meetings in the financial year 2022. Three meetings were held as video conferences with one meeting held in person. The committee prepared the assessment of target achievement by the Board of Management regarding the sustainability targets for the financial year 2021 and the definition of sustainability targets for the financial year 2023 by the Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board. The committee also dealt in detail with the sustainability-related statements in non-financial reporting with a special focus on the reporting requirements under the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Sustainability Report as well as the Tax Transparency Report for the financial year 2021.

auditor: Since the audit for the financial year 2022, at insurance companies too, the Annual General Meeting is responsible for the appointment of the auditor. Unlike in the past, the appointment is no longer the responsibility of the Supervisory Board. Upon a proposal submitted by the Supervisory Board, the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 4 May 2022 appointed PwC as auditor for the annual and consolidated financial statements as well as the review of the half-yearly financial report for the financial year 2022. PwC audited the financial statements of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group as well as the respective management reports, and issued an unqualified auditor's report in each case. The management reports also contain the respective non-financial statements. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE were prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards. PwC performed a review of the half-yearly financial report. In addition, PwC was also mandated to perform an audit of the solvency statements according to Solvency II",

The preliminary financial statements and PwC's preliminary audit results were discussed in the Audit Committee on 15 February 2023, as well as in the Supervisory Board's plenary session on 16 February 2023. The finalized financial statements and PwC's audit reports (dated 20 February 2023) were reviewed by the Audit Committee on 1 March 2023 and discussed in the Supervisory Board plenary session on 2 March 2023. The auditors participated in the discussions and presented the results of their audit. Particular emphasis was placed on the key audit matters described in the auditor's report and on the audit procedures performed. No material weaknesses in the internal financial reporting control process were discovered. There were no circumstances that might give cause for concern about the auditor's independence. In addition, the solvency statements dated 31 December 2022 for both Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, as well as the related reports by PwC, were reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nOn the basis of its own reviews of the annual Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements, the management and Group management reports, and the recommendation for the appropriation of earnings, the Supervisory Board has raised no objections and agreed with the results of the PwC audit. It has also approved the Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Board of Management. The financial statements have thus been formally adopted. The Supervisory Board agrees with the Board of Management's proposal on the appropriation of earnings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to express its special thanks to all Allianz Group employees for their great personal commitment over the past financial year.\n\nThe term of office of the Supervisory Board ended with the close of the ordinary Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022.

There was also an increase of \u20ac 455 mn in the external reinsurance business,\n\nprimarily  stemming  from  motor  reinsurance.  In  total,  \u20ac 12,383 mn (2021: \u20ac 11,480 mn) of gross premiums were attributable to Property-Casualty  reinsurance  and  \u20ac 840 mn  (2021:  \u20ac 671 mn)  to Life/Health reinsurance.\n\nWith 90.8 % (2021: 90.7 %), the net retention ratio remained almost unchanged compared to the previous year. Premiums earned (net) increased to \u20ac 11,909 mn (2021: \u20ac 10,915 mn).\n\nThe accident year claims 1 ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance increased to 76.7 % (2021: 71.1 %). This was mainly driven by increased business volume in the proportional motor reinsurance business. While in the previous year the extraordinary high losses from natural catastrophe events caused in particular by floods and storms in Europe had been mitigated by significant recoveries under our retrocession program, in 2022 the losses from natural catastrophe events before retrocession remained at a lower level compared to 2021 but were also mitigated by retrocession to a lower degree. As a result, net losses from natural catastrophes after retrocession were higher than in the previos year.\n\nThe  run-off result (net) in Property-Casualty  reinsurance amounted to \u20ac 1,201 mn (2021: \u20ac 439 mn) and was mainly influenced by  fire  and  property  reinsurance  (\u20ac 401 mn),  liability  reinsurance (\u20ac 293 mn) as well as credit and bond reinsurance (\u20ac 132 mn). Overall, the calendar year claims ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance decreased to 66.2 % (2021: 67.0 %).\n\nThe expense ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance decreased to 28.2 % (2021: 29.0 %), driven by a lower commission ratio of 27.4 % (2021: 28.2 %). The administrative expense ratio remained constant at 0.8 % (2021: 0.8 %).\n\nIn Life/Health reinsurance, the net underwriting result remained stable at \u20ac 43 mn (2021: \u20ac 44 mn).\n\nThe total net underwriting result amounted to \u20ac 701 mn (2021: \u20ac 458 mn), mainly driven by the positive development of the calendar year loss ratio and expense ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance in 2022.\n\nIn  2022,  the change  in  claims  equalization  and  similar  reserves amounted to \u20ac 486 mn (2021: \u20ac (435) mn). This was mainly driven by the release of the claims equalization and similar reserves in the motor reinsurance business. On the other hand, a strengthening of the claims equalization and similar reserves occurred in particular in the fire as well as credit and bond reinsurance lines of business.\n\nThus,  the net  technical  result amounted  to  \u20ac 1,187 mn  (2021: \u20ac 24 mn).",

The overall decrease was partially offset by a higher profit transfer from Allianz Asset Management GmbH, which increased by \u20ac 129 mn to \u20ac 779 mn.\n\nIncome from affiliated enterprises and participations increased by \u20ac 895 mn to \u20ac 7,051 mn, driven by higher dividend payments from our subsidiaries Allianz Europe B.V., Allianz Holding France SAS, and Allianz Holding Eins GmbH, which rose by \u20ac 250 mn to \u20ac 5,150 mn, by \u20ac 125 mn to \u20ac 730 mn, and by \u20ac 172 mn to \u20ac 550 mn respectively, as well as by a 2022 dividend payment from Allianz Finance II Luxembourg S.A.R.L., amounting to \u20ac 278 mn.\n\nIncome from other investments slightly declined by \u20ac 6 mn  to \u20ac 480 mn, mainly consisting of income from bonds (\u20ac 195 mn), funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed (\u20ac 95 mn), intragroup cash pooling (\u20ac 87 mn), and intra-group loans (\u20ac 67 mn).\n\nRealized gains went up by \u20ac 395 mn to \u20ac 669 mn and were primarily  related  to  the  sale  of  bonds  (\u20ac 304 mn)  and  participations (\u20ac 329 mn).\n\nIncome from reversal of impairments increased by \u20ac 43 mn  to \u20ac 61 mn and was almost entirely attributable to write-ups on participations.\n\n## Expenses  for  the  management  of  investments,  interest,  and\n\nother investment-related expenses rose by \u20ac 67 mn  to  \u20ac 1,000 mn, driven by higher interest expenses (\u20ac 120 mn) particularly related to intra-group cash pooling (\u20ac 112 mn). The overall increase of this position  was  partly  offset  by  lower  other  investment-related  expenses (\u20ac 54 mn).\n\nDepreciation and impairments of investments strongly increased by \u20ac 2,258 mn to \u20ac 2,758 mn, mainly because write-downs on bonds grew by \u20ac 2,055 mn to \u20ac 2,222 mn as a result of the sharp rise in interest rates in 2022. Further impairments in 2022 were particularly attributable to write-downs on investment funds (\u20ac 266 mn) and shares in affiliated enterprises (\u20ac 250 mn).\n\nRealized losses grew by \u20ac 329 mn to \u20ac 477 mn and were primarily related to the sale of bonds (\u20ac 282 mn) and the intra-group sale of shares in affiliated enterprises (\u20ac 133 mn).\n\nExpenses for losses taken over increased by \u20ac 85 mn to \u20ac 143 mn, driven by a \u20ac 95 mn loss taken over from our service provider Allianz Technology SE in 2022 (2021: 0 \u20ac).\n\n## Other non-technical result\n\nThe other  non-technical  result deteriorated  slightly  by  \u20ac 50 mn  to \u20ac (2,473) mn. This was caused by offsetting developments. On the one hand, the  development of the other non-technical result was positively driven by the foreign currency translation result, which improved by \u20ac 282 mn, and the significant reduction of interest expenses on pensions by \u20ac 465 mn. On the other hand, the development was negatively affected by the result on derivatives, which deteriorated by \u20ac 765 mn. The improved foreign currency translation result was mainly driven by foreign currency translation gains related to liabilities denominated in GBP after losses in the previous year. The decrease of interest expenses on pensions was primarily caused by a lower addition to pension provisions compared to the previous year resulting from a smaller change in the discount rate. The deterioration of the result from derivatives was predominantly caused by losses from interest rate swaps held for the purpose of managing duration and hedging interest rate risk.\n\nAs far as legally permissible, Allianz SE acts as the controlling company ('Organtr\u00e4ger') of the German tax group that most German subsidiaries belong to. As the controlling company, Allianz SE is liable for the income taxes of this German tax group.\n\nThe current tax charge of Allianz SE amounted to \u20ac (532) mn (2021: \u20ac (352) mn). Moreover, Allianz SE received a tax allocation of \u20ac 550 mn  (2021:  \u20ac 543 mn)  from  Allianz SE  tax group companies that recorded taxable income. Taking into account other taxes, the income from taxes amounted to \u20ac 6 mn (2021: \u20ac 195 mn).\n\nNet  income decreased  by  \u20ac 559 mn  to  \u20ac 4,792 mn  (2021: \u20ac 5,351 mn).",

        "page_content": "## Economic outlook 1\n\nThe effects of the war in Ukraine will continue to impact economic development in 2023. This applies in particular to inflation, which will remain at a high level. We expect an average rate for the year of over 6 % in the eurozone and over 4 % in the United States. Central banks are therefore unlikely to ease their restrictive monetary policy, especially in Europe. By the end of the year, key interest rates in the eurozone are likely be to be around 3 %/uni003B in the United States, they will remain above 4 %.\n\nThe consequences will be a drop in household purchasing power and tighter financing conditions for companies, both of which will have a dampening effect on consumption and investment. We therefore expect a recession in both the eurozone and the United States in 2023, with economic output expected to decline by 0.4 % and 0.3 %, respectively. In China growth is likely to accelerate slightly again in 2023/uni003B in the second half of the year in particular, the end of the zero-COVID policy is expected to provide more stimulus. Nevertheless, the anticipated growth of 4 % is quite modest by Chinese standards. Overall, the global economy should grow by about 1.4 %.\n\nFinancial markets are likely to remain very volatile in view of the high level of uncertainty about the progress of inflation and monetary policy response. However, yields in the bond markets should stay at their current high levels, offering more opportunities again for longterm investors.\n\nIn 2023, the crises that already existed  will continue to pose a challenge. One is the war in Ukraine, where further escalation cannot be ruled out. The gas supplies in Europe also remain precarious, with the risk of shortages in the winter of 2023/24. In addition, the abrupt end to China's zero-COVID policy also harbors considerable risks for global supply chains, particularly in case numbers increase dramatically over the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, it is also important to keep an eye on political and social tensions, which could escalate in view of the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n## Insurance industry outlook\n\nThe key question for the insurance industry in 2023 is the extent to which it will be able to absorb the inflation-related increase in claims expenses through higher premiums and more flexible product designs. Against the backdrop of recessionary developments in key markets with rising corporate insolvencies and unemployment, this is unlikely to be an easy challenge to overcome.\n\nAt the same time, however, the industry is also benefiting from the global increase in risks across the board - be it natural catastrophes and cyber-attacks or ruptured supply chains and sociopolitical tensions. The need for risk protection and prevention is unprecedentedly high and is likely to persist in the foreseeable future. This is an opportunity  for  the  insurance  industry  to  position  itself  as  a  partner  for strengthening social resilience.\n\nIn terms of the investment environment, the situation should be more favorable than in 2022. Although high volatility is still to be expected in the stock markets, the rapid rise in interest rates is unlikely to be repeated and the risk of valuation losses is therefore much lower. In actual  fact,  the  yield  level  offers  good  opportunities  for  higher\n\ninvestment returns on new investments/uni003B this is also more likely to be reflected in earnings over the next few years.\n\nIn the non-life sector , premium growth will continue/uni003B however, as in the previous year, this will be driven primarily by rising prices. Investment income is expected to increase. In view of high inflation, claims development will also remain at a high level. As wages react to inflation, there is a risk of higher operating costs, hence productivity gains through fully digital processes remain the order of the day.\n\nIn the life sector , the cost-of-living crisis will continue to make itself felt: Falling savings rates are having a negative impact on new business (savings and pension products), and an increase in lapses and premium exemptions cannot be ruled out. Higher interest rates are only likely to have a positive impact on demand in the medium term/uni003B in 2023, real interest rates will still remain deep in the red. The risk businesses should continue to benefit from greater awareness of the need for protection, as the higher investment income will strengthen profitability.\n\n## Business outlook\n\nOur outlook assumes no significant deviations from our underlying assumptions - specifically:\n\n- -interest rate environment to remain at a high level compared to previous years,\n- -no major volatility in the capital markets,\n- -no disruptive fiscal or regulatory interference or major litigation,\n- -level of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average levels,\n- -an average U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 1.045.\n\nAllianz SE provides a wide range of reinsurance coverage, primarily to Allianz Group's insurance entities (group-internal business), but also to third-party  customers  (external  business).  This  includes  PropertyCasualty  as  well  as  Life/Health  reinsurance  business  on  both  a proportional and non-proportional basis. Due to the broad spread of exposures underwritten by line of business and geography, Allianz SE's portfolio is diversified.\n\nAllianz Group uses Allianz SE, in particular, as a vehicle for actively managing its overall exposure to catastrophes. Under a group-wide risk management framework, each operating entity is responsible for managing its exposure to individual catastrophes and defining its local reinsurance requirements, based on its local risk appetite and capital position. The respective cover is then provided by Allianz SE or one of its subsidiaries. At the Group level, the Allianz SE's Board of Management reviews and approves the risk appetite. The reinsurance division is then responsible for designing and implementing Group catastrophe protection within given exposure limits. These covers take various forms and aim to protect the Group against excessive losses from major natural or man-made catastrophes. However, despite measures to limit or mitigate our risks, there is still a potential for an unexpected frequency and/or severity of catastrophic events that may materially impact the results of Allianz SE. The top five residual risk exposures at the Group level are summarized in the paragraph 'Premium risk' in the Risk and Opportunity Report.",

        "page_content": "Compared to the plan for 2022 which was compiled in 2021, net premiums earned were 3 % higher than expected, mainly due to higher than planned quota share cessions from European Allianz entities. In addition, higher than expected natural catastrophe losses were offset by improved profitability in liability and other property and casualty business, a higher run-off contribution, as well as a slightly better expense ratio due to lower commissions paid on some quota share cessions. This led to a combined ratio that was slightly better than plan. Consequently, the net underwriting result before change in equalization reserve was higher than plan.\n\nFollowing many years of low profitability in the industry, rates started moderately hardening in 2020 and 2021. After pandemic related underwriting losses during the course of 2020, a high level of global natural catastrophe events in the last three years and increasing inflation, the hardening trend has continued in both the 2022 and 2023 renewals. We expect improved risk-adjusted prices during the course of the year.\n\nAllianz SE/acute.cases technical result largely depends on group-internal cessions resulting from quota share agreements with European Allianz entities. Based on our estimates, we expect higher premiums but a lower  net  underwriting  result  before  equalization  reserve  for  the Property-Casualty reinsurance in 2023. This is also due to increased cost  for  our  outgoing  reinsurance  programs  after  Allianz Group reinsurance programs had been triggered in the last three years and following the overall market hardening and lower market capacity. It should be noted that the actual result may vary significantly from our expectations as the reinsurance business is, by nature, volatile in terms of frequency and severity of losses.\n\nCompared  to  our  outlook,  the  net  technical  result  deviated negatively for 2022, while we observed a positive development in our investment  result  for  2022.  Other  non-technical  result  and  in consequence net income were below the planned result, while the net earnings  were  overall  in  line  with  our  expectations.  For  2023,  we predict a moderately increasing net income with almost stable net earnings.  Based  on  our  current  expectations,  a  significantly  lower underwriting result driven by the development of the equalization reserve will be more than offset by a significantly higher other nontechnical result, with the investment result tending to remain constant. We are not planning a specific foreign currency result, nor are we able to anticipate any net gains or losses from derivatives. These could, however, considerably impact the net income of Allianz SE. Given the susceptibility of our non-technical result to adverse capital market developments,  we  do  not  provide  a  precise  outlook  for  the development  of  our  net  income.  Nevertheless,  we  are  ultimately planning and managing the Allianz SE net earnings in line with the Allianz Group dividend policy. To this end, we take advantage of the opportunity  to  make  use  of  the  dividends  of  our  subsidiaries,  in particular  those  of  Allianz  Europe  B.V.,  in  order  to  generate  net earnings for Allianz SE that match the dividend policy of Allianz Group.

The combined ratio increased slightly to 101.5 % (2021: 101.0 %), mainly due to a worsening of the accident year claims ratio to 78.7 % (2021: 75.8 %). This was mitigated by a lower expense ratio of 24.6% (2021: 26.3%). A full release of the equalization reserve of \u20ac 885 mn (2021: strengthening of \u20ac (120) mn) led to a net technical result of \u20ac 811 mn (2021: \u20ac (167) mn).\n\nThe household and homeowner reinsurance portfolio increased by 3.3 % to gross premiums written of \u20ac 1,225 mn (2021: \u20ac 1,186 mn), mainly from business with Allianz Versicherungs-AG. The combined ratio grew to 101.8 % (2021: 101.4 %), driven by an increase in the expense ratio to 30.1% (2021: 28.7 %). The net technical result increased slightly to \u20ac (18) mn (2021: \u20ac (19) mn).\n\nThe  increase  of  the fire  reinsurance portfolio  was  caused  by growth of internal as well as external business volume. The combined ratio improved to 82.9 % (2021: 91.8 %), driven by a decrease of the calendar year claims ratio to 55.9 % (2021: 66.5 %) due to a higher run-off result of \u20ac 237 mn (2021: \u20ac 8 mn). After a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac (92) mn (2021: \u20ac (32) mn), the net technical result amounted to \u20ac 35 mn (2021: \u20ac 22 mn).\n\nEngineering reinsurance gross premiums decreased by 2.2 %. The combined ratio significantly improved and amounted to 77.3 % (2021: 101.3 %), driven by a positive run-off result of \u20ac 67 mn (2021: \u20ac (9) mn). The net technical result increased to \u20ac 100 mn (2021: \u20ac (21) mn).\n\nThe premiums written in the business interruption reinsurance increased by 23.8 % to \u20ac 285 mn (2021: \u20ac 230 mn), mainly due to internal business volume. The combined ratio improved to 58.6 % (2021: 73.6 %) which was primarily driven by the decrease of the accident year claims ratio to 58.3 % (2021: 76.7 %). As a result, the net technical result grew to \u20ac 109 mn (2021: \u20ac 58 mn).\n\nOther property reinsurance includes extended coverage for fire and business interruption as well as hail, storm, water damage, livestock, burglary, and glass reinsurance. The premiums written increased by 21.2 %,  mainly due to internal cedents like Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE and Allianz Versicherungs-AG. Despite an improvement of the run-off result by \u20ac 88 mn (2021: negative run-off result of \u20ac (8) mn), the combined ratio deteriorated to 124.0 % (2021: 103.6 %). This was owed to an increase of the accident year claims ratio to 108.9 % (2021: 74.5 %). The net technical result amounted to \u20ac (158) mn (2021: \u20ac (19) mn).\n\nPremiums written for liability reinsurance increased by 2.1 % to \u20ac 1,138 mn (2021: \u20ac 1,114 mn), mainly driven by internal cessions. The combined ratio rose to 74.9 %  (2021: 72.6 %), mainly due to an increased calendar year claims ratio of 44.3 % (2021: 40.7 %). After a further  strengthening  by  the  equalization  reserve  of  \u20ac (4) mn  (2021: \u20ac (243) mn), the net technical result amounted to \u20ac 255 mn  (2021: \u20ac 33 mn).",

The net technical result increased to \u20ac 42 mn (2021: \u20ac 39 mn).\n\nThe premium revenue of personal accident reinsurance increased by 2.8 %. This development results in particular from internal reinsurance business. The combined ratio improved to 85.8 % (2021: 87.9 %), mainly driven by a better run-off result. The net technical result thus increased to \u20ac 58 mn (2021: \u20ac 50 mn).\n\nThe gross premiums written in marine and aviation reinsurance decreased slightly to \u20ac 331 mn (2021: \u20ac 339 mn). The combined ratio improved,  mainly  due to a higher run-off result of  \u20ac 105 mn  (2021: \u20ac 9 mn). Despite a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac (39) mn (2021: \u20ac (20) mn), the net technical result rose to \u20ac 39 mn (2021: \u20ac 15 mn).\n\nGross premiums written in credit and bond reinsurance increased by 29.4 % to \u20ac 313 mn (2021: \u20ac 242 mn), which was mainly caused by growing premium income from Allianz Trade. The worse calendar year claims ratio of 30.4 % (2021: 24.6 %) was partially compensated by a better expense ratio of 40.5 % (2021: 44.5 %). Overall, this resulted in a slightly  increased  combined  ratio  of  71.0 %  (2021:  69.1 %).  The  net technical result amounted to \u20ac (1) mn  (2021: \u20ac 25 mn), following a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac (80) mn (2021: \u20ac (36) mn).\n\nThe premium revenue of legal expenses reinsurance increased by 5.0 % to \u20ac 295 mn (2021: \u20ac 281 mn), driven by cessions from Allianz Versicherungs-AG.  The  combined  ratio  improved  to  94.2 %  (2021: 116.6 %) due to a decrease in the calendar year claims ratio to 58.3 % (2021:  80.8 %).  A  strengthening  of  the  equalization  reserve  by \u20ac (22) mn occurred in the financial year, while the net technical result improved to \u20ac (5) mn (2021: \u20ac (46) mn).\n\nIn health reinsurance, the premium revenue increased by 33.6 % to \u20ac 257 mn (2021: \u20ac 192 mn), mainly driven by external business. The net technical result declined to \u20ac 1 mn (2021: \u20ac 6 mn).\n\nOther reinsurance lines include:\n\n- -emergency assistance,\n- -fidelity & political risk,\n- -motor extended warranty,\n- -other property and casualty business.",

While loans\n\n- 1\\_The shares repurchased until mid-July with acquisition costs of \u20ac 1.0 bn were cancelled without reducing the issued capital at the end of November.\n\nalso fell by \u20ac 0.4 bn, the overall decrease in this position was partially offset by increases in investment funds (\u20ac 0.7 bn) and deposits with banks (\u20ac 0.2 bn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, \u20ac 21.5 bn of other investments were invested in debt securities, of which \u20ac 7.8 bn were government bonds. We reduced our overall government bond exposure by \u20ac 1.6 bn compared to 31 December 2021, thereby decreasing our investments in Spanish and Italian government bonds from \u20ac 0.8 bn to \u20ac 0.6 bn and from \u20ac 0.7 bn to \u20ac 0.3 bn respectively.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the fair value of investments amounted to \u20ac 124.2 bn (2021: \u20ac 144.4 bn), compared to a carrying amount of \u20ac 118.3 bn (2021: \u20ac 123.0 bn). The decrease of valuation reserves to \u20ac 5.9 bn (2021: \u20ac 21.4 bn) is primarily driven by lower net asset values of our shares in affiliated enterprises.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables increased from \u20ac 5.3 bn to \u20ac 5.7 bn, driven by a growth of \u20ac 0.2 bn in other receivables and a growth of \u20ac 0.2 bn in receivables on reinsurance business. The increase in other receivables resulted from higher cash pool receivables of \u20ac 0.4 bn reduced by \u20ac 0.2 bn in profit transfer agreements.\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nAs  of  31 December 2022,  our shareholders'  equity amounted  to \u20ac 40.1 bn  (2021:  \u20ac 41.0 bn).  A buy-back of own shares at acquisition costs of \u20ac 1.3 bn led to a decrease. 1 This decrease was partly offset by a rise of \u20ac 0.4 bn, due to net income being higher than the dividend paid. The net income decreased by \u20ac 0.6 bn to \u20ac 4.8 bn (2021: \u20ac 5.4 bn). \u20ac 0.5 bn (2021: \u20ac 0.8 bn) were transferred from the net income to the revenue reserves.\n\nThe Board of Management proposes to use the net earnings of \u20ac 4,930 mn for dividend payments in the amount of \u20ac 4,578 mn. 2 The unappropriated earnings of \u20ac 352 mn will be carried forward.\n\nOur disclosures concerning treasury shares as required in our financial statements in accordance with \u00a7 160 (1) No. 2 AktG can be found in note 11.\n\n- 2\\_The proposal reflects the number of shares entitled to the dividend as of 31 December 2022.",

Furthermore, the total  of other  provisions rose  by  \u20ac 1,246 mn.  This  growth  resulted mainly from the  additions  to  the  provisions for anticipated losses, which went up by \u20ac 696 mn and resulted exclusively from derivative transactions.

This increase was mainly driven by higher short-term liabilities from unsettled security transactions, which grew by \u20ac 0.4 bn to \u20ac 0.5 bn, and higher margin payments in connection with financial derivative transactions, which went up by \u20ac 0.2 bn to \u20ac 0.3 bn.",

The main sources of liquidity available to Allianz SE are dividends received from subsidiaries as well as reinsurance premiums received, and external funding raised in the capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily available assets - specifically cash, money market securities, and highly liquid fixed-income securities. Funds are primarily used for paying interest expenses on our debt funding, claims arising from the reinsurance business, operating costs, internal and external growth investments, and dividends or share buybacks to our shareholders.\n\n## Funding sources\n\nAllianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors, such as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings, and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE are both equity and debt funding. Equity can be raised by issuing ordinary no-par value shares. The issuance of debt in various maturities as well as group-wide liquidity management are the main sources of our debt funding.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the share capital registered at the Commercial Register was \u20ac 1,169,920,000. This was divided into 403,313,996 no-par  value  shares.  As  of  31 December 2022,  Allianz SE  held 1,724,834 (2021: 238,720) own shares.\n\nAllianz SE has the option to increase its share capital base according to authorizations provided by the AGM. The following table outlines Allianz SE's capital authorizations as of 31 December 2022:\n\n## Capital authorizations of Allianz SE\n\n| Capital authorization         | Nominal amount   | Expiry date of   the authorization   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Authorized Capital  2022/I 1  | \u20ac 467,968,000    | 3 May 2027                           |\n| Authorized Capital  2022/II 2 | \u20ac 15,000,000     | 3 May 2027                           |\n| Conditional Capital  2022 3   | \u20ac 116,992,000    | 3 May 2027                           |\n\n- 1\\_For issuance of shares against contribution in cash and/or in kind.\n- 2\\_For issuance of shares to employees (without shareholders' subscription rights).\n- 3\\_To cover conversion or option rights of holders of bonds.\n\nThe cost and availability of debt funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or to Allianz SE. Our main sources of debt funding are senior and subordinated bonds. Among others, money market securities, letter-of-credit facilities, and bank credit lines allow Allianz SE to fine-tune its capital structure.\n\nIn the first half-year of 2022, we issued a \u20ac 1.25 bn subordinated bond. In the second half-year of 2022, we issued another \u20ac 1.25 bn subordinated bond and called a \u20ac 1.5 bn subordinated bond. Overall, subordinated  liabilities  increased  to  \u20ac 17.1 bn  (2021:  \u20ac 15.8 bn)  at year-end.\n\nOther financial liabilities decreased compared to the previous year to \u20ac 33.9 bn (2021: \u20ac 38.7 bn), mainly due to lower intra-group loans.",

While capital requirements imposed by regulators constitute a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies' capital requirements and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic business objectives.\n\nWe closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations of the Group, Allianz SE and its other related undertakings, and apply regular  stress  tests  (including  standardized,  historical,  and  reverse stress test scenarios, as well as stress and scenario analyses focusing on current and possible future developments). These analyses allow us to take appropriate measures to preserve our continued capital and solvency strength. For example, the risk capital reflecting the risk profile and the cost of capital is an important aspect that is considered in business decisions. Furthermore, we ensure a close alignment of the risk and business strategy by taking business decisions to achieve our set targets within the determined risk appetite and in line with the risk strategy. The implemented sound processes to steer the business and assess and manage associated risks ensure a continuous alignment of the risk and business strategy, and enable us to detect and address any potential deviations.\n\nIn addition, our liquidity risk management framework ensures that all legal entities in scope are responsible for managing their liquidity risks and maintaining a sufficient liquidity position under both market and business conditions (expected as well as stressed).\n\n## Risk Management System and Internal Control System\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, we consider risk management, including an internal control system (ICS), to be a core competency and an integral part of our business. Our risk management framework covers all operations and business units of Allianz SE in proportion to the inherent risks of the activities, ensuring that risks across Allianz SE are consistently identified, analyzed, assessed, and adequately managed. The key elements of our risk management framework and internal control system are:\n\n- -Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a robust risk governance structure.\n- -Consistent and proportional application of an integrated risk capital framework to protect our capital base and support effective capital management.\n- -Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into management and decision-making processes by attributing risk and allocating capital to business segments, products, and strategies.\n\nOur risk management system is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- -Risk identification, assessment and underwriting: A robust system of risk identification, assessment and underwriting forms the foundation for appropriate risk management decisions. Supporting activities include standards for underwriting, valuation methods, individual transaction and new product approvals, emerging/operational/top risk assessments, liquidity risk and scenario analyses, amongst others.\n- -Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk appetite in line with our business strategy. It ensures that rewards are appropriate based on the risks taken and the required capital. It also ensures that delegated decision-making bodies work in line with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy.\n- -Risk  reporting  and  monitoring: Our  comprehensive  qualitative and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework provides  management  with  the  transparency  needed  to  assess whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits and to identify emerging issues and risks quickly. For example, risk dashboard and limit utilization reports as well as scenario analyses and stress tests are regularly prepared and communicated.\n- -Communication  and  transparency: Transparent  risk  disclosure provides the basis for communicating our strategy and performance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strengthens the risk awareness and risk culture.\n\nIn order to support these pillars, especially risk identification, assessment and monitoring, Allianz Group has established an ICS, which consists of both specific risk controls and further control elements, and which is also applied at Allianz SE level. Its objectives are:\n\n- -Safeguarding the Group's existence and business continuity.\n- -Creating a strong internal control environment, ensuring that all personnel are aware of the importance of internal control and their role within the internal control system.\n- -Conducting control tasks commensurate to the risks arising from activities and processes in the Group.\n- -Providing the management bodies with the relevant information for their decision-making processes.\n- -Ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nNotwithstanding the oversight exercised by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, controls are performed within Allianz Group in terms of control areas, activities and reporting, taking into account independence requirements, where applicable. The controls are embedded into the operational and organizational set-up throughout the Allianz Group and are subject to periodic reviews. Where appropriate, internationally recognized control framework  are used,  such as the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) or the IT-related Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT).\n\nInternal controls, therefore, describe the set of activities undertaken  by  and  within  Allianz Group  to  achieve  defined  control",

These controls help to continuously review the effectiveness of the relevant processes and procedures (including operations and reporting), their coherence and proportionality within the Group, and to identify potential actions for the timely rectification of deficiencies. The ICS of the Allianz Group encompasses the entirety of activities undertaken to perform controls in different areas.\n\nThe ICS comprises various control concepts. Besides general elements related to any control activities and in addition to the Risk Management Framework, specific controls are utilized, in particular, but not exclusively, around entity level controls, financial reporting, IT, risk capital calculation, underwriting (including products and distribution), investments,  and protection/resilience. These are supplemented by management reports.\n\nThe  following  information  is  provided  pursuant  to  \u00a7 289 (4)  and \u00a7 315 (4)  of  the  German  Commercial  Code  ('Handelsgesetzbuch  HGB'). For general information on our integrated risk and control system (IRCS) and Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), please refer to the 'Operational risk' section in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\n## Accounting processes\n\nThe accounting processes we use to produce financial statements are based on a group-wide IT solution and local general ledger. Access rights to accounting systems are managed according to strict authorization procedures.\n\n## Control system for financial reporting\n\nSpecific internal controls for financial reporting, which follow the general Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) approach, are embedded in the accounting and consolidation processes to safeguard the accuracy,  completeness,  and  consistency  of  the  information  provided in our financial statements.\n\nThe dedicated financial reporting control system approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n- -A centrally developed risk catalog is linked to individual accounts. This risk catalog is reviewed on a yearly basis and is the starting point for the definition of the Group's as well as Allianz SE's scope of financial reporting risks. The methodology is described in the IRCS guideline. In the course of the scoping process, both materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement are considered simultaneously. In addition to the quantitative calculation, we also consider qualitative criteria.\n- -Based on the centrally provided risk catalog, we identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements.\n- -Preventive and detective key controls to address financial reporting risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial misstatements. If a potential risk materializes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstatement. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting processes on IT systems, we have also implemented IT controls.\n\n1\\_Unaudited.\n\n- -Internal Audit ensures that these controls are subject to regular control testing, in order to assure reasonable design and operating effectiveness. Internal Audit does so through a comprehensive risk-based approach that assesses the key controls of the company's  internal  procedures  and  processes,  including  local  and group-internal controls over financial reporting risks, from an integrated perspective.\n\nThe risk management system encompasses a set of principles for specifically addressing the operational and reputational risks stemming from non-compliance  with laws, regulations,  and other external requirements (hereafter referred to as 'compliance risks').\n\nFor the management of compliance risks, Allianz  maintains a Compliance Management System (CMS). At the center of the CMS, Allianz  has  established  compliance  functions  at  the  levels  of Allianz Group and the local operating entities as part of the Second Line of Defense. For details of the CMS, or more specifically of anti-corruption and bribery matters, please refer to the Non-Financial Statement.\n\nThe management feels comfortable with Allianz SE's overall risk profile, has no indication that, as of 31 December 2022, our risk management system or internal control system is not appropriate or effective, and therefore is confident to meet both the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and day-to-day business needs.\n\nThis assessment is based on several factors:\n\n- -We run an established system to monitor the effectiveness of the internal control system and to report and timely address deficiencies, such as control failures, operational loss events, financial limit breaches, or system of governance issues. On a quarterly basis, the Group's  'Internal  Control  System  Report',  which  also  covers Allianz SE, is jointly prepared by the Allianz SE key control functions, and shared with the Supervisory Board Audit Committee and members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE. The report aggregates and rates the severity of known weaknesses in the internal control system, while also tracking their timely and satisfactory resolution.\n- -Our risk management framework, including the internal control system, are regularly subject to audit activities performed by our internal audit function.\n- -An assessment of the effectiveness of the Allianz SE Risk Management function, as well as of the implementation maturity of the risk management  framework  and  corresponding  risk  management processes, is performed following the Risk Assessment, Diagnostics, Analysis and Reporting (RADAR) process.\n- -Allianz has dedicated guidelines and policies that clearly define the general principles, the roles and responsibilities, as well as the processes, for both the risk management framework and the internal control system.",

        "page_content": "## Our strategy\n\nAllianz SE's business strategy is aligned with the business aspirations and strategy of the Allianz Group. Allianz SE's main tasks are the ownership of legal entities, in particular subsidiaries, the provision of central financing functions, and offering reinsurance services to mostly internal but also external counterparties.\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE has defined the following objectives for the Allianz Group's medium-term strategy, building on the success of the efforts to simplify the company, with the motto 'Simplicity at Scale':\n\n- -Growth: We consistently seek to capture growth opportunities for our business, and to create growth opportunities for our employees. This is how we ensure our leading market position. Due to our full breadth of products and services, we offer comprehensive solutions that meet our customers' needs and make us a trusted partner.\n- -Margin Expansion: We need to be profitable and efficient. To do so, we are continuously improving our productivity, including in our distribution channels, while seeking to grow in high margin business segments. Additionally, we will continue our transformation so our processes are simpler, digital and scalable.\n- -Capital Efficiency: We consistently seek ways to use our capital in the most effective way and take action when it falls below our RoE threshold.\n\nThese objectives have been translated into clear ambitions for the 2022 to 2024 period. With regard to financial performance, we strive for a return on equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds 1 ) of more than 13 %, while growing our earnings per share from \u20ac 21 (baseline full-year 2021, as communicated in the Allianz Capital Markets Day 2021) to approximately \u20ac 25 2 by 2024 (reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 5 % to 7 %).\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of our performance, we have set ourselves non-financial targets that reflect strong underlying organizational health: For customer loyalty, our ambition is for more than 50 % of the business segments of our entities to be or become rated by their customers as a 'loyalty leader' in terms of the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS). In terms of employee engagement, our ambition is to score above 75 % on the Inclusive Meritocracy Index. At the same time, we have also set the target to become a clear leader in sustainability and diversity.\n\nAllianz Group including Allianz SE face an altered environment on insurance markets. Reinsurance rates, in particular in the area of retrocession, are generally rising, as the market is characterized by an overall hardening due to large losses. Business areas such as cyber coverage are experiencing greater demand. Cover for pandemic risks is generally not in the risk appetite of the reinsurance division and is only granted after a strict review and with clear limits.\n\nTo implement these strategic objectives, to realize our growth ambition, and to accelerate our value creation, we have defined five additional strategic areas of focus for Allianz Group:\n\n- -Transforming the Life/Health and Asset Management franchise : Fully address protection and savings needs and accelerate transformation to a capital efficient model, leveraging our strengths in Asset Management to deliver investor-defined risk/return requirements through various investment disciplines.\n- -Expanding our Property-Casualty leadership position :  Beat the best players in each market, building on productivity gains and scale, in retail motor and beyond.\n- -Boosting growth through scalable platforms: Scale our customerfacing platforms and build new operating platforms to grow our business volume and margin.\n- -Deepening the global vertical integration and execution of agility: Verticalize operating models across lines of business to unleash value from our skills and scale.\n- -Reinforcing capital productivity and resilience: Retain industryleading financial strength and unlock further value creation potential  through  an  improved  risk/return  profile  and  an  active management and reduction of tail-risk exposure. Our focus on capital resilience is matched with a focus on talent development and diversity that also strengthens our organizational resilience.\n\nAllianz SE's Board of Management has also defined a strategy for the management of risks. This risk strategy places particular emphasis on ensuring the integrity of the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining solvent even in the event of extremely adverse scenarios, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations, and providing resilient profitability.\n\nOur financial strength renders us resilient against market stress, and our ongoing transformation creates capabilities allowing us to profit from new opportunities in a fast-changing business environment.\n\nAllianz SE's role - as laid out in our business strategy - includes in particular providing central financing functions to Allianz Group companies, and acting as a reinsurer with predominantly group-internal business. Opportunities management is principally a responsibility for the Allianz Group's primary insurance and asset management entities.\n\nAllianz SE's  activities  in  support  of  the  Allianz Group's  opportunity management mainly fall in the following areas:\n\n- -Supporting the local Group companies' efforts to continuously harmonize and simplify products and processes across all business segments via development of centralized expertise in data analytics, product design, and distribution platforms.\n- -Supporting the Allianz Group's growth strategy via provision of financing for acquisition of M&A targets.\n- -Reinsurance pooling from Group companies and optimization via retrocessions,  as well as reinsurance solutions to optimize their capital needs.",

        "page_content": "- -Provision of reinsurance solutions to business partners outside the Allianz Group.\n\nFor a detailed description of the Allianz Group's opportunities, see the annual reports of our subsidiaries.\n\nThe  pooling  of  internal  reinsurance  on  the  balance  sheet  of Allianz SE is an important strategy which has been pursued for many years. As a Group reinsurer, the reinsurance division not only provides guidance and tools to Group companies to manage exposures as effectively as possible, but also provides most of the reinsurance covers to Group companies. The large and diversified portfolio at Allianz SE allows for acceptances of a wide range of reinsurance solutions on proportional and non-proportional basis. Larger risk concentrations are actively managed via retrocessions on a per risk and per event basis in order to protect our capital. In addition, the reinsurance area within  Allianz SE  provides reinsurance solutions to external business partners.\n\nDue to the expertise available at Allianz SE, important services to Group companies are provided, for example, via the Global Commercial unit for the MidCorp business segment with tools for pricing, accumulation management, and loss control engineering services, or via the Global P&C and Global Life units for their respective business segments.\n\nIn 2022, Allianz SE also supported Group efforts for simplification and digitalization, among others, by further developing centralized expertise in product development and digital distribution platforms.\n\nFor  further  details  on  opportunities  envisaged  by  Allianz SE, please refer to the section 'Business Outlook'.\n\n## Risk governance structure\n\nOur approach to risk governance permits integrated management of local and global risks, and ensures that our risk profile remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to bear risks.\n\nWithin our risk governance system, the Supervisory Board and Board of Management of Allianz SE have both Allianz SE and groupwide responsibilities. The Board of Management formulates business objectives and a corresponding risk strategy/uni003B the core elements of the risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group  Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board advises, challenges, and supervises the Board of Management in the execution of its management activities. The following committees support the Board and the Supervisory Board on risk issues:\n\n## Supervisory Board Risk Committee\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  Risk  Committee  reports  to  the  Supervisory Board, where the information and the findings are discussed with the Board of Management. It monitors the effectiveness of the Allianz risk management framework. Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as general risks and specific risk exposures, and ensures that the business strategy is aligned with the risk strategy.\n\nFor  more  information  please  refer  to  the  paragraph  'Risk Committee' in the Supervisory Board Report.\n\n## Group Finance and Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) provides oversight of the Group's and Allianz SE's risk management framework, acting as a primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's risk profiles, as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC also ensures that an adequate relationship between return and risk is maintained. Additionally, the GFRC defines risk standards, is the limitsetting authority within the framework set by the Board of Management, and approves major financing and capital management transactions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Management with recommendations regarding the capital structure, capital allocation, liquidity position, and investment strategy, including the strategic asset allocation for the different business segments.\n\nThe Allianz Re Risk Committee supports the GFRC on issues relating to Allianz SE's reinsurance business.\n\nA comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appetite, limit systems, documentation, and reporting. These standards ensure the accurate and timely flow of risk-related information and a disciplined approach towards decision-making and execution at both the global and local levels.\n\nAs a general principle, the responsibility for the First Line of Defense rests with business managers in the related undertaking. They are responsible for both the risks taken and the returns from their decisions. The Second Line of Defense is made up of independent oversight functions including Risk, Actuarial, Compliance, and Legal, which support the Board in defining the risk frameworks within which the business can operate. Audit forms the Third Line of Defense, independently and regularly reviewing risk governance implementation, compliance with risk principles, performing quality reviews of risk processes, and testing adherence to business standards, including the internal control framework.\n\nAllianz SE  has  established  dedicated  responsibilities  for  the three lines of defense with its departments (including reinsurance).\n\n## Risk management function\n\nIndependent risk oversight for Allianz SE is performed by risk control units  within  Group  Risk  and  within  the  reinsurance  department  of Allianz SE.\n\nGroup Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer, who also serves as the Chief Risk Officer of Allianz SE. Group Risk supports Allianz SE's Board of Management, including its committees, by performing various analyses, communicating information relating to risk management, and preparing and implementing committee decisions.\n\nGroup Risk also supports the Board of Management in developing the risk management framework - which covers risk governance, risk strategy and appetite - and risk monitoring and reporting. Group Risk's operational responsibility encompasses assessing risks and monitoring limits and accumulations of specific risks across business lines, including natural and human-caused (regulatory terminology: manmade) disasters and exposures to financial markets and counterparties.",

        "page_content": "## Other functions and bodies\n\nIn addition to Group Risk and the local risk functions, legal, compliance, and actuarial functions established at both the Group and the entity levels constitute additional components of the Second Line of Defense.\n\nGroup Legal and Group Compliance seek to mitigate legal risks for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE with support from other departments. The objectives of both functions are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation, and to provide legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes. In addition, Group Compliance - in conjunction with Group Legal and other experts involved - is responsible for integrity management, which aims to protect the Allianz Group as well as Allianz SE and our other related undertakings and employees from regulatory and reputational risks.\n\nGroup Actuarial, Planning and Controlling contributes towards assessing and managing risks of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE in line with regulatory requirements, in particular for those risks whose management requires actuarial expertise. The range of tasks includes, amongst others, the calculation and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assistance in business planning, reporting and monitoring of the results, and supporting the effective implementation of the risk management system.\n\n## Risk-based steering and risk management\n\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks, including market, credit, underwriting,  business,  operational,  strategic,  liquidity,  and  reputational risks.\n\nWe consider diversification across different business segments, lines of business and regions to be an important element in managing our risks efficiently, as it limits the economic impact of any single event and contributes to relatively stable results. Our aim is to maintain a balanced risk profile without any disproportionately large risk concentrations and accumulations.\n\nWith  Solvency II  being  the  regulatory  regime  relevant  for  the Group, our risk profile is measured and steered based on our approved Solvency II internal model 1 . We have introduced a target solvency ratio range in accordance with Solvency II, based on pre-defined stress scenarios for both the Group and related undertakings, supplemented by ad-hoc  scenarios,  historical  and  reverse  stress  tests,  and  sensitivity analyses.\n\nIn addition, central elements of Allianz's dividend policy are linked to Solvency II capitalization based on the internal model. This helps us to ensure a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line with the Solvency II framework.\n\nAllianz steers its business portfolio taking a comprehensive view of risk and return, which is based on the internal model and is supported by scenario analyses. Risk and concentrations are actively restricted by limits based on our internal model. The Life/Health insurance business segment is steered by a return on risk capital 2 (RoRC)\n\napproach at the product level, while a return on equity (RoE insurance) at the portfolio level is used for the Property-Casualty insurance business segment.\n\nRoRC as well as RoE insurance are indicators that allow us to identify profitable lines of business and products on a sustainable basis. For new Life/Health insurance business, RoRC reflects the expected average return against the capital commitment over the lifetime of the products, and is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions. For the Property-Casualty insurance business, the RoE insurance reflects the return against the underlying equity which is allocated to the specific portfolios based on the respective risk capital requirements. This allows us to take appropriate risk-based decisions.\n\nAs a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in business steering, and its application satisfies the so-called 'use test' requirement under Solvency II.\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, Allianz SE  holds  and  uses  a  broad  range  of  financial  instruments, which are reflected on our balance sheet as both assets and liabilities.\n\nFor our holding activities (i.e., to hold participations, provide financing for Group companies, cover internal pension liabilities, invest cash pooled from subsidiaries, and as the lender of last resort within Allianz Group), Allianz SE predominantly invests in participations and fixed-income assets.\n\nAs an inherent part of our reinsurance operations, we collect premiums from our customers and invest them in a wide variety of assets. The resulting reinsurance investment portfolio backs the future claims payments and benefits to our cedents. In addition, we also invest shareholders' capital, which is required to support the reinsured risks and the holding activities. Our market risk from liabilities primarily relates to fixed-income instruments held for financing as well as to internal pensions and reinsurance liabilities. Finally, we use derivatives for various  purposes.  A  principal  example  would  be  the  hedging  of planned dividend income from non-euro subsidiaries against adverse currency market movements. In the case of high capital market volatility, or especially adverse market conditions, Allianz SE may also undertake hedge overlays to support the solvency of the Allianz Group. Generally, the use of derivatives at Allianz SE is for the purpose of risk reduction. Guidelines are in place regarding the use of derivatives, for which adherence is monitored by the risk management function of Allianz SE.  Asset/liability  management  (ALM)  decisions  are  taken based on the internal model, considering both risks and returns on the financial markets.\n\nAs the fair values of our assets and liabilities depend on changes in the financial markets, we are exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments. Allianz SE's most important market risk results from changes in the value of its participations in Group companies. The long-dated internal pension liabilities of German Group companies on Allianz SE's balance sheet contribute to interest rate risk in particular, as they cannot be fully matched by available investments due to long maturities. In addition, we are also exposed to adverse changes in equity  and  real  estate  prices,  credit  spread  levels,  inflation,  implied",

        "page_content": "volatilities, and currency values, which might impact the value of our assets and liabilities.\n\nTo measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models 1 for the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios for all the risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the sorted portfolio  profit  and  loss  distribution  at  a  certain  confidence  level (99.5 %) defines the market Value at Risk (VaR).\n\nStrategic asset allocation benchmarks and risk limits - including standalone interest rate and equity sensitivity limits, and foreign exchange exposure limits - are defined for the Group, Allianz SE, and other  related  undertakings.  Limits  are  closely  monitored  and,  if  a breach occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include escalation to the respective decision-making bodies and/or the closing of positions.\n\nMarket risk from Allianz SE's material M&A transactions is evaluated by assessing risk capital implications.\n\nFinally, guidelines are in place regarding certain investments, new investment products, and the use of derivatives.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nIf the duration of our assets is shorter than our liabilities, we may suffer an economic loss in the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing assets at lower rates prior to the maturity of liability contracts.\n\nBy contrast, opportunities may arise when interest rates increase. Interest rate risk is managed within our ALM process and controlled via an interest rate sensitivity limit.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nWe are exposed to changing inflation rates, predominantly due to our Property-Casualty insurance obligations but also due to inflation-indexed internal pension obligations. While inflation assumptions are taken into account in our underwriting, unexpected rising rates of inflation will increase both future claims and expenses, leading to higher liabilities/uni003B conversely, if future inflation rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be lower than anticipated. The risk that inflation rates deviate from inflation assumptions is incorporated in our internal model. Potential severe structural breaks are monitored via historical and ad-hoc stress tests.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nAllianz SE's equity risk predominantly results from the performance of our strategic insurance participations. Other material risk exposures reflect listed and unlisted equities, equity derivatives, own shares, and management incentive plans.\n\nRisks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As the performance of our participations might exceed expectations and stock values might also increase, opportunities may arise from participations and other equity investments.\n\nIn 2022, Allianz SE had profit and loss transfer agreements with fourteen German subsidiaries. Risks from these contracts are reflected in the risk capital calculation for participations.\n\n1\\_Internal pensions are evaluated and modeled based on deterministic models, following IAS 19 principles.\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nFixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads widen. However, our risk appetite for credit spread risk takes into account the underlying economics of our business model: As a liabilitydriven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets until maturity. This  implies  that  we  are  less  affected  economically  by  short-term changes in market prices. In our capacity as a long-term investor, this gives us the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nAllianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group typically invest in assets which are denominated in the same currency as their liabilities. However, some foreign currency exposures are allowed to support portfolio diversification and tactical investment decisions. Our largest exposure to foreign currency risk comes from our non-euro Group companies: Whenever the euro strengthens, the euro equivalent net asset value of our foreign subsidiaries will decline from an Allianz Group and Allianz SE perspective/uni003B however, at the same time the capital requirements in euro will decrease, partially mitigating the total impact on Allianz Group and Allianz SE capitalization. Based on the Allianz Group's foreign exchange management limit framework, currency  risk  is  monitored  and  managed  at  the  levels  of  the Allianz Group,  Allianz SE,  and  the  other  operating  entities  of  the Allianz Group.\n\nThe planned dividend income from non-euro subsidiaries is an important additional source of currency risk.\n\n## Real estate risk\n\nDespite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a suitable addition to our investment portfolio due to good diversification benefits, as well as to the contribution of relatively predictable, longterm cash flows.\n\nAllianz's Group Investment Committee has defined a framework for standard transactions for real estate equity and commercial real estate loan investments. These standards outline diversification targets, minimum-return thresholds, and other qualitative and quantitative requirements. All transactions that do not meet these standards or have a total investment volume (including costs) exceeding a defined threshold  must  be  reviewed  individually  by  Group  Risk  and  other Group center functions. In addition, all applicable limits must be respected, in particular those resulting from strategic asset allocation as well as its leeways and risk limits, with regards to an investing entity's portfolio.\n\nCredit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality of our counterparties ('migration risk') or the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations ('default risk').\n\nAllianz SE's credit risk profile comes from three sources: our investment portfolio, guarantees, and retrocession.\n\nInvestment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and receivables whose value may decrease depending on the credit quality of the obl i g or.",

        "page_content": "Guarantees: Credit risk is caused by the potential default of Group companies on commitments from contracts with external stakeholders, which are backed by guarantees from Allianz SE.\n\nRetrocession: Credit risk to external reinsurers arises when parts of Allianz SE's reinsurance business are retroceded to external reinsurance  companies  to  mitigate  risks.  Credit  risk  arises  from  potential losses from non-recoverability of reinsurance receivables, or due to default on benefits under in-force reinsurance treaties. Our retrocession partners are carefully selected by a team of specialists. Besides focusing on companies with a strong credit rating, we may further require letters of credit, cash deposits, funds withheld or assets held in trust, or other financial measures to further mitigate our exposure to credit risk.\n\nThe internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major determinants of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parameters assigned to obligors are migration probabilities and obligor asset correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are assigned to single obligors using a clearly defined assignment process. The central components of this assignment process are long-term ratings from external rating agencies, and internal rating models in case of specific internal investment strategies. If available, a dynamic adjustment using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualitative information available is applied.\n\nThe loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and exposure concentrations per obligor segment.\n\nTo ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the lower investment-grade and non-investment-grade area.\n\nOur group-wide country and obligor group limit management framework (CRisP 1 ) allows us to manage counterparty concentration risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the Group, Allianz SE, and other operating-entity levels. This limit framework forms the basis for discussions on credit actions and provides notification services featuring the quick and broad communication of credit-related decisions across the Group.\n\nClearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed. The setting of country and obligor exposure limits from the Group's perspective (i.e., the maximum concentration limit), which are adopted by Allianz SE and serve as maximum local limits for the other operating entities, takes into account the Allianz Group's portfolio size and structure, as well as the overall risk strategy.\n\nAllianz SE's underwriting risk consists mainly of premium risk and reserve risk in the Property-Casualty reinsurance business, biometric risk from the Life/Health reinsurance business, and from internal pension obligations.\n\n## Property-Casualty\n\nThe  Property-Casualty  primary  and  reinsurance  business  of  the Allianz Group is exposed to premium-risk-related adverse\n\ndevelopments in the current year's new and renewed business, as well as to reserve risks related to the business in force.\n\nAs  part  of  our  Property-Casualty  reinsurance  operations,  we receive  premiums  from  our  customers  and  provide  reinsurance protection in return. Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the current year develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios.\n\nAllianz SE actively manages premium risk from its reinsurance business. The assessment of risks as part of the underwriting process is a key element of our risk management framework. There are clear underwriting guidelines, limits  and restrictions in place, which are regularly monitored. Excessive risks are not taken or mitigated by external retrocession agreements. All these measures contribute to a limitation of risk accumulation. We also monitor concentrations and accumulation of non-market risks on a standalone basis (i.e., before diversification effects) within an Allianz Group global limit framework in order to avoid substantial losses from single events, such as natural catastrophes, and from man-made catastrophes, such as terror or large industrial risk accumulations.\n\nPremium risk is further divided into three categories: natural catastrophe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including manmade catastrophes.\n\nPremium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are used to derive loss distributions. Non-catastrophe risks are modeled using frequency and severity models for large losses and aggregate loss distribution models for attritional losses. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, storms, and floods, represent a significant challenge for risk management due to their high accumulation potential for higher return periods. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location, characteristics of insured objects, and their values) with simulated natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses. Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses. Similar approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror events and man-made catastrophes, including losses from cyber incidents and industrial concentrations. These loss distributions are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\nReserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in bestestimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from fluctuations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. We estimate and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not yet been settled. In case of unexpected developments, we would experience a reserve gain or loss dependent on the assumptions applied for the estimate.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  unexpected  reserve  volatility, Allianz SE  and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group constantly monitor the development of reserves for insurance claims on a line-of-business level. In addition, related undertakings generally conduct annual reserve uncertainty analyses based on similar methods used for reserve risk calculations. The Allianz Group performs regular independent reviews of these analyses and Group representatives participate in the local reserve committee meetings.\n\nAnother important instrument to mitigate reserve risk is retrocession.",

The reserve distributions derived are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\n## Life/Health\n\nRisks in Allianz SE's Life/Health segment include risks assumed from reinsurance transactions and from our internal pension obligations.\n\nUnderwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks) include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality, disability, and morbidity risks are associated with an unexpected increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims. Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and pension products might not be sufficient due to longer life expectancies of the insured.\n\nLife/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower than expected. As profitability calculations are based on several parameters - such as assumptions on future mortality rates, or morbidity claims - the actual development may differ from the expected one. For example, lower-than-expected mortality rates would lead to additional annuity payments in the future. However, beneficial deviations are also possible/uni003B for example, a trend towards healthier lifestyles will most likely result in lower overall health insurance claims.\n\nWe measure these risks within our internal model, distinguishing, where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and trend development of the actuarial assumptions on the one hand and pandemic risk scenarios on the other.\n\nBusiness risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks. They are mostly driven by the Life/Health business and to a lesser extent by the Property-Casualty business. Cost risks are associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering insurance policies are higher than expected, or that new business volume decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz to absorb its fixed costs. Business risk is measured relative to baseline plans.\n\nFor the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks related to unpredictable, adverse behavior of policyholders in exercising their contractual options, for instance, early termination of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, and annuity take-up options.\n\nAssumptions on policyholder behavior are set in line with accepted actuarial methods and based on own historical data, where available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on industry data or expert judgment. These are used as a basis to determine the economic impact of policyholder behavior under different scenarios within our internal model.\n\nConsidering  the  business  model  of  Allianz SE  as  primarily  a group-internal reinsurer, business risk is moderate and is only significant for large contracts with long durations.\n\nOperational risks refer to losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, system failures, and external events, and can stem from a wide variety of sources, including the following:\n\n- -'Clients, Products and Business Practices': potential losses due to a failure to meet the professional obligations or from the design of\n\nproducts. Examples include mis-selling, non-compliance with internal or external requirements related to products, anti-trust behavior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes, etc. These losses tend to be less frequent but, when they occur, can have a high financial (and reputational) impact.\n\n- -'Execution, Delivery and Process Management': potential losses arising from transaction or process management failures. Examples include interest and penalties from non-payment or underpayment of taxes, or losses associated with broker and agent distribution processes. These losses tend to be of a relatively higher frequency but with little financial impact (although single largeloss events can occur).\n- -Other operational risks including, for example, internal or external fraud, financial misstatement risk, a cybersecurity incident causing business disruption or fines, a potential failure at our outsourcing partners causing a disruption to our working environment, etc.\n\nIn view of Allianz SE's tasks as holding company for the Allianz Group and reinsurer, the operational risk capital of Allianz SE is dominated by the risk of potential losses within the areas of 'execution, delivery and process management' and 'clients, products and business practices'.\n\nOperational risk capital is calculated using a scenario-based approach based on expert judgment as well as internal and external operational loss data. The estimates for frequency and severity of potential loss events for each material operational risk category are assessed and used as a basis for our internal model calibration.\n\nAllianz has developed a consistent operational risk management framework, which is applied across the Group based on proportionality and focuses on the early recognition and proactive management of material operational risks. The framework defines roles and responsibilities as well as management processes and methods: Local risk managers at Allianz SE  and at the other operating entities of the Allianz Group, in their capacity as Second Line of Defense, identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control deficiencies via a dialogue with the First Line of Defense, report operational risk events in a central database, and ensure that the framework is implemented in their respective operating entity.\n\nThis framework triggers specific mitigating control programs. For example, compliance risks are addressed with written policies and dedicated compliance programs monitored by compliance functions across the Allianz Group. The risk of financial misstatement is mitigated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting. Outsourcing risks are covered by our Outsourcing Policy, Service Level Agreements, and Business Continuity and Crisis Management programs to protect critical business functions from these events. Cyber risks are mitigated through investments in cybersecurity, cyber insurance that Allianz buys from third-party insurers, and a variety of ongoing control activities, developed and implemented along the following main themes: slow down hackers, increase threat detection, reduce the damage of attacks, and enhance the skills as well as the organizational structure.\n\nThe ICS for operational risk encompasses the management of compliance, financial reporting, and other operational risks. The effectiveness of this internal control system is monitored along two dimensions:\n\n- -Monitoring the effective implementation of the Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) framework.",

        "page_content": "- -Monitoring the resolution of identified weaknesses in the internal control system.\n\nThe IRCS is an integral part of the overall ICS, whose fundamentals are described in the section \"Risk Governance System and Internal Control System\".\n\nThrough the IRCS, the Second Line of Defense oversees and supports the First Line of Defense with respect to the identification, assessment and mitigation of operational risks associated with Allianz's business activities.\n\nOperational risks are identified in the IRCS through reference to multiple sources of information, including a standardized group-wide operational risk catalog, internal and external operational risk event data, and the results of internal and external audit or other third-party reviews. Dialogues leveraging the professional knowledge and experience of risk owners, process owners and risk experts throughout the company also contribute towards risk identification. All identified risks suspected of having a potentially large operational or reputational impact are subject to a further detailed assessment that enables the formulation of appropriate risk management responses. Risk responses typically include either accepting the risk as adequately managed within the given level of risk tolerance, or deciding upon a course of action to further mitigate the risk (i.e., an action plan).\n\nThe IRCS is a framework by which operating entities' Second Lines of Defense contribute to ensure that key controls for the business's most significant operational risks have been identified and tested for design and operating effectiveness. At the Allianz Group level, it is important to monitor the quality of the local implementation of this framework as a means of ensuring that internal control system weaknesses are identified prior to the occurrence of operational risk events (ex-ante).\n\nTo assess the IRCS on Allianz SE level, an IRCS Rating is compiled anually. Based on the 2022 rating, we have no indication that the IRCS is not adequately designed or not effective. No material weaknesses have been identified.\n\nDespite the fact that the IRCS already addressed all non-financial risks 1 in a very robust way, the framework was further enhanced, which resulted in the development of the so-called Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) framework.\n\nNFRM will further strengthen the internal control system by using a new risk taxonomy consistent across the Group, which helps to aggregate the risks at Group level, and by using an even more rigorous testing approach. It is being rolled out in so-called waves, and the operating entities of wave 1 in 2022 comprise more than 40 %  of the Group's total operational risk capital. With close monitoring by Group Risk and Group Compliance, insurance and asset management operating entities of wave 1 have undergone important implementation steps to further bolster assurance activities. Operating entities not part of wave 1 have continued to apply the IRCS framework.\n\nThe full implementation of the new framework across the Group is expected to be completed by year-end 2024. Meanwhile, Group Risk and Group Compliance are closely monitoring all waves, seamlessly bridging an effective migration between IRCS and NFRM.\n\nAllianz SE has conducted an NFRM Dry Run in 2022 during the first wave to prepare the full implementation in 2023.\n\nOperational risk events are reported in a central database.\n\nThere are risks which, due to their nature, cannot be adequately addressed or mitigated by setting aside dedicated capital. These risks are therefore not considered in the internal model. For the identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks we also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. The most important of these other risks are strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company's value arising from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their implementation.\n\nStrategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Group's Top Risk Assessment process, and discussed in various Board of Management-level committees (for example, GFRC). We also monitor market and competitive conditions, capital market requirements, regulatory conditions, etc., to decide if strategic adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe most important strategic risks are related to the value creation levers, which focus on three themes: Growth, Margin Expansion, and Capital Efficiency. Progress on mitigating strategic risks and meeting the value creation levers is monitored and evaluated in the course of the Strategic and Planning Dialogues between the Allianz Group and Allianz SE and the other related undertakings.\n\nTo the extent that the strategic objective 'Growth' leads to takeover and acquisition transactions and large single investments, it is of particular importance to Allianz SE.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that current or future payment obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of adversely altered conditions.\n\nLiquidity risk can arise primarily if there are mismatches in the timing of cash in- and outflows. The liquidity risk profile of Allianz predominantly originates from the uncertainty about the volume and timing of cash needs from insurances liabilities (especially from the coverage of various types of catastrophes in the property-casualty business) and of cash inflows from investments. Major risks can also result from derivative transactions used by Allianz to hedge specific market risks.\n\nThe investment strategy of Allianz SE particularly focuses on the quality of investments, and ensures a significant portion of liquid assets in  the  portfolio  (for  example,  high-rated  government  or  covered bonds). We employ actuarial methods to estimate our liabilities arising from reinsurance and internal pension contracts. In our liquidity planning process, we reconcile liquidity sources (such as dividends received from subsidiaries, cash from investments and premiums) and liquidity needs (including payments due to dividends to shareholders, reinsurance claims and expenses) under a best-estimate plan, as well as under idiosyncratic and systemic adverse liquidity scenarios.\n\nThe main goal of planning and managing Allianz SE's liquidity position is to ensure that we are always in a position to meet payment obligations.  To  comply  with  this  objective,  the  liquidity  position  of Allianz SE is monitored and forecasted on a daily basis.",

The accumulated short-term liquidity forecast is updated daily. The cash position in this portfolio is subject to an absolute minimum liquidity threshold and an absolute target liquidity threshold. Both thresholds are defined for the Allianz SE cash pool in order to be protected against short-term liquidity crises.\n\nAs part of our liquidity stress testing framework, contingent liquidity requirements and sources of liquidity are considered to ensure that Allianz SE is able to meet any future payment obligations, even under adverse conditions. Major contingent liquidity requirements include non-availability of external capital markets, combined market and catastrophe risk scenarios for subsidiaries, as well as lower than expected profit transfers and dividends from subsidiaries.\n\nIn order to protect Allianz Group against the liquidity impact of adverse risk events beyond those covered by the capital and liquidity buffers at our subsidiaries, Allianz SE holds a strategic liquidity reserve for which the target level is reevaluated annually.\n\nThe strategic liquidity planning for Allianz SE, which covers the periods of one calendar year (in increased granularity) and three calendar years, is regularly reported to the Board of Management.\n\n## Reputational risk\n\nAllianz's reputation as a well-respected and socially aware provider of financial services is influenced by our behavior in a range of areas, such as product quality, corporate governance, financial performance, customer service, employee relations, intellectual capital, and corporate responsibility.\n\nReputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of the  Allianz SE  share price, the value of the in-force business, or the value of future business caused by a decline in our reputation in internal or external stakeholders' judgment.\n\nThe identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of the  annual  Top  Risk  Assessment  process,  undertaken  by  the Allianz Group and all operating entities. As part of this process, senior management approves the risk strategy for the most significant risks and their potential reputational impact.\n\nThe reputational risk to which Allianz SE and Allianz Group are exposed particularly results from strategy execution, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks, cyber risks, litigation risks, and sales compliance. Any sensitive topic from an Allianz entity can also cause reputational risk for the holding company Allianz SE.\n\nThe Allianz Group has defined sensitive business areas and corresponding risk guidelines that are binding for Allianz SE and the other affiliated companies of the Allianz Group. All affected Allianz SE functions cooperate in identifying reputational risk. Group Communications (GCOM) assesses reputational risks for Allianz SE  based on a group-wide methodology.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks\n\nEnvironmental, Social or Governance events and conditions (ESG factors), such as climate change, loss of biodiversity or human rights abuses, are increasingly becoming a relevant source of adverse impacts on our balance sheet, profitability or reputation. These ESG-related risks are characterized by their transversal nature, meaning they may materialize within any of Allianz's existing risk categories (e.g., market  risk,  underwriting  risk,  operational  risk)  as  either  a  consequence of societal responses to ESG factors -  including regulatory\n\nchanges, litigation, technological developments and changes in human behavior - or due to events causing physical damage, such as droughts, floods or storms, whereby the magnitude or likelihood is attributable to an ESG factor.\n\nAllianz's strategy for the management of these risks begins with establishing a comprehensive understanding of all the ways ESG factors can trigger adverse events within the investment, underwriting, and operations areas of our business, as well as from a broader reputational perspective. For this purpose, a dedicated ESG risk inventory has been established and a corresponding risk assessment performed, which enables us to take a risk-based view in terms of evaluating the adequacy of mitigation measures in place.\n\nESG-related mitigation measures may vary substantially depending on the precise nature of the underlying risk/uni003B ranging from establishment of specific controls at the business process level through to adjustments in Allianz's long-term business strategy. Given that all adverse impacts attributable to ESG factors are ultimately realized within one of Allianz's existing risk categories, we aim - to the greatest extent possible - to embed the identification and management of these risks directly within risk management processes already in place.\n\nAt both the Allianz Group and Allianz SE level, the GFRC is responsible for overseeing ESG-related risks. In addition, a Group Sustainability Board is in place, which is responsible for Allianz's overall ESG strategy and steering the integration of ESG aspects into core investment and insurance activities.\n\nFor a broader perspective on our key ESG integration processes, please refer to the sections 'ESG Integration Approach' and 'Climate Change Strategy' in the Non-Financial Statement.\n\n## Climate change\n\nAmongst  a  broad  landscape  of  ESG  factors,  we  consider  climate change to be the most critical in terms of its potential to materially affect the global economy and our business, especially in the long run. Risks arising from climate change can already be seen today and their relevance will increase over the mid- and long-term.\n\nThe most significant risks that have a material impact on our business, or we expect will have in the future, are:\n\n- -Physical risks: These can for instance be acute and chronic, such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves and droughts, or a change in vector-borne diseases, with impacts on property, life or health.\n- -Transitional risks : These risks result from the cross-sectoral structural change stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Transitional risks include changes in climate policy, technology, or market sentiment, and the impact of this on the market value of financial assets as well as the impact from climate change litigation.\n\nThese risks impact Allianz's business in two key ways:\n\n- -As a (re-)insurer, providing coverage for e.g., fatality and health impacts, property damage or litigation claims, and through changes in the sectors and business models it underwrites.\n- -As a large-scale institutional investor with significant stakes in various economies, companies, infrastructure, and real estate that might be affected by the physical impact of climate change and",

        "page_content": "by the transition to a low-carbon economy. This can directly influence the ability of assets to generate long-term value.\n\nWe address immediate risks from climate change factors following the management approach for the primary underlying risks (i.e., financial risks, premium or reserve risks, reputational risks, etc.), e.g., building on our long-term expertise in the modeling of extreme weather events or analyzing emission profiles of our proprietary investments. For example, the carbon footprint of our investee companies reported in our climate disclosure serves as a starting point for an analysis of the exposure to emissions pricing. Our commitment to align our proprietary investment portfolio to 1.5\u00b0C climate scenarios is an effective means to address our transitional risk exposure over the years. As another example, as part of our reputational risk management, we review and evaluate social and environmental effects, including climate change issues, arising from our business activities and business relations through the ESG business integration approach described above.\n\nOn  a  forward-looking  basis,  we  consider  risks  from  climate change factors under emerging risks, where we closely monitor the development of the risk landscape supported by selective analyses on our portfolios. In this regard, we are developing different approaches towards scenario analysis to further educate our understanding of how climate change risks may unfold in the future.\n\nClimate change also creates opportunities - be it in connection with financing a low-carbon and climate-resilient future, e.g., by investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency in real estate, and electric vehicle infrastructure, or by providing insurance solutions to protect against physical climate impacts and to support low-carbon business models.\n\nFor more information on the impact of Allianz's activities on the climate, please refer to the section 'Environmental matters' in the NonFinancial Statement.\n\n## Internal risk capital framework\n\nWe define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the basis for determining our Solvency II regulatory capitalization. We calculate and consistently aggregate internal risk capital across all business segments on a quarterly basis. We also regularly project risk capital requirements between reporting periods in times of financial market turbulence.\n\nFor the management of our risk profile and solvency position, we utilize an approach that reflects the Solvency II rules in that it comprises our approved internal model covering Allianz SE and all other major insurance operations.\n\n## Internal model\n\nOur internal model is based on a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss of portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe ('holding period', set at one year) and probability of occurrence ('confidence level', set at 99.5 %). We simulate risk events from all risk categories ('sources of risk') modeled, and calculate the portfolio value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including risk-\n\nmitigating measures such as reinsurance contracts or derivatives, under each scenario.\n\nThe risk capital required is defined as the difference between the current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse conditions at the 99.5 % confidence level. As we consider the impacts of a negative or positive event on all risk sources and covered businesses at the same time, diversification effects across products and regions are taken into account. The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk both separately and in aggregate. We also analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios representing historical events, reverse stress tests, and adverse scenarios relevant for our portfolio. Furthermore, we conduct ad-hoc stress tests to reflect current political and financial developments and to analyze specific non-financial risks more closely.\n\n## Coverage of the risk capital calculations\n\nAllianz SE's  internal  risk  capital  model  covers  the  activities  of Allianz SE as the holding company for Allianz Group, as well as its activities as a reinsurer.\n\nWhereas the model treats most subsidiaries as participations, it applies a look-through rule for 34 subsidiaries and investment funds, which are ancillary to Allianz SE's operations (mainly by holding assets), and reflects their risks - either in full or in part - on a granular level.\n\nThe risk capital model covers all relevant assets (including fixedincome instruments, equities, real estate, and derivatives) and liabilities (including the run-off of all technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt and other liabilities such as guarantees).\n\nIn view of the above, Allianz's risk capital framework covers all material and quantifiable risks. Risks not specifically covered by the internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\n## Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment\n\nWhen calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the assumptions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial in determining and discounting future cash flows. For liability valuation, we apply the methodology provided by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) as part of its technical documentation (EIOPA-BoS-20/109) to extrapolate the risk-free interest rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor.\n\nIn addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility adjustment (VA) in most markets where a volatility adjustment is defined by EIOPA and approved by the local regulator. This is done to better reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash flows of our insurance liabilities are largely predictable. The advantage of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being a long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of having to sell debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity.\n\nWe take account of this by applying the volatility adjustment to mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less meaningful for long-term investors than the default risk. Allianz also models the volatility adjustment dynamically within our approved internal model, which differs from the static EIOPA VA concept applied in the standard formula. For risk capital calculations, we assume a dynamic movement of the volatility adjustment broadly consistent with the way the VA",

To account for this deviation, Allianz applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the dynamic volatility adjustment.\n\n## Diversification and correlation assumptions\n\nAs Allianz is an integrated financial services provider offering a variety of products across different business segments and geographic regions, diversification is key to our business model.\n\nDiversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification factors include regions (for example, windstorm in Australia vs. windstorm in Germany), risk categories (for example, market risk vs. underwriting risk), and subcategories within the same risk category (for example, commercial vs. personal lines of property and casualty risk). Ultimately, diversification is driven by the specific features of the investment or (re-)insurance products in question and their respective risk exposures. For example, an operational risk event in Australia can be considered highly independent of a change in credit spreads for a French government bond held as investment.\n\nThe internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and correlation  effects  when  aggregating  results  at  the  Group  level, Allianz SE level, or at the level of other Group companies. The resulting diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses are not likely to materialize at the same time.\n\nWhere possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair of market risks through statistical analysis of historical data, considering observations over more than a decade. In cases where historical data or other portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or unavailable, correlations are set by the Correlation Settings Committee, which combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined and controlled process. In general, when using expert judgment we set the correlation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these correlations, we use an industrystandard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nOur internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability inflation,  mortality,  longevity,  morbidity,  policyholder  behavior,  expenses, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial assumptions wherever possible, additionally considering recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods. Our internal risk capital and financial reporting framework incorporates comprehensive processes and controls to ensure the reliability of these assumptions.\n\n## Model limitations\n\nAs the internal model is based on a 99.5 % confidence level, there is a low statistical probability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this threshold in the course of one year.\n\nWe use model and scenario parameters derived from historical data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past, for\n\n1\\_Whole account stop loss reinsurance contract between Allianz SE and Allianz Re Dublin dac.\n\nexample, in an unprecedented crisis or as a possible result of severe structural breaks resulting from climate change, our VaR approach might be too conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order to mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis with stress testing.\n\nFurthermore, we validate the model and parameters through sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews, and, where appropriate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for selecting parameters and control processes. Overall, we believe that our validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately assesses the risks to which we are exposed.\n\nSince the internal model takes into account the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate the market value of each item accurately. For some assets and liabilities, it may be difficult, if not impossible - notably in distressed financial markets - to either obtain a current market price or apply a meaningful mark-to-market approach. For such assets we apply a mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their values also depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair values are appropriately assessed.\n\nWhile the aggregate risk capital is exactly modeled, the whole account stop loss construction 1 leads to the use of approximations when reporting contributory risk capital figures for the sub-categories of underwriting risk, as the individual contributions have to be approximated based on the underlying distributions.\n\nIn 2022, our internal model was further enhanced based on regulatory developments, model validation results, and the feedback received in the course of our consultations with regulators.\n\nOverall, the model changes implemented in 2022 increased the Solvency II risk capital of Allianz SE by \u20ac 14 mn, compared to the risk profile figures for 2021.\n\nIn the subsequent sections, the risk figures for 2021 after model changes will form the basis for the analysis of the changes in our risk profile in 2022.\n\n## Allianz SE: Impact of model changes/uni003B allocated risk according to the risk profile\n\n\u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2021/uni00B9   | 2021/uni00B2   |\n|---------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Market risk         | 35,169         | 35,169         |\n| Credit risk         | 625            | 581            |\n| Underwriting risk   | 3,946          | 3,931          |\n| Business risk       | 144            | 144            |\n| Operational risk    | 619            | 619            |\n| Diversification     | (4,104)        | (4,060)        |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 36,398         | 36,384         |\n\n- 1\\_2021 risk profile figures recalculated based on model changes in 2022.\n- 2\\_2021 risk profile figures as reported previously.\n\nThe changes to our internal model affected the risk categories and diversification as follows:",

        "page_content": "## Market, credit, and underwriting risk\n\nMarket risk was not affected by model changes with an impact on risk capital and remained stable. Several model changes (e.g., change in the credit correlation framework) increased the credit risk by \u20ac 43 mn. Further model changes (e.g., change in the segmentation within the reserve risk) increased the underwriting risk by \u20ac 15 mn.\n\n## Diversification\n\nDiversification between risk categories increased by \u20ac 44 mn,  which was primarily driven by the increases of credit as well as underwriting risk following the model changes.\n\nBusiness  and  operational  risk  were  not  affected  by  model changes and remained stable.\n\n## Risk profile and management assessment\n\nThe quantitative risk profile of Allianz SE is primarily dominated by market risk that results from its non-traded insurance participations when measured in a manner consistent with the treatment of participations under Solvency II (e.g., without looking through to the underlying risks behind the participations). In order to provide greater transparency, the Group Risk figures as reflected in the Allianz Group Annual Report can be interpreted as a 'look-through' view at the consolidated risk profile represented by all of the Group's participations, as well as those risks unique to Allianz SE. The second largest risk for Allianz SE from an internal model perspective is the underwriting risk arising from its reinsurance business and from internal pension obligations.\n\nFrom a broad perspective, the overall risk profile of Allianz SE has remained and is expected to remain stable. 'Stable' in this context means a high exposure to market risk, in particular from participations equity generated by our holding of Allianz Group subsidiaries, a moderate exposure to underwriting risk, and relatively low exposures to operational risk and credit risk (i.e., measured as a share of the Allianz SE's Solvency II risk capital). Please refer to the section 'Solvency II regulatory capitalization' for further details.\n\nTo support the development of a risk appetite and a risk management framework for these core risks, Allianz SE has elaborated the following risk management philosophy:\n\n- -Financial risks: Allianz SE's objective is to support the Group strategy while ensuring that financial risk-taking is in line with its riskbearing capacity. To manage financial risk effectively, it is essential to clearly identify, measure, monitor, and control the inherent risks, especially in the investment portfolios, financing transactions, the reinsurance portfolio, and the internal pension obligations.\n- -Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are accepted when acting as a reinsurer for predominantly group-internal business. Quality control mechanisms are applied to ensure adherence to the  Allianz Group's  underwriting  standards  and  to  monitor  the quality of the portfolio, the underwriting and retrocession processes. These processes must support sustainable and profitable business decisions, and need to be aligned with the risk appetite of Allianz SE  and the Allianz Group,  as well as to avoid undesired\n\nand/or excessive risks and accumulations. The full economic consequences of a pandemic event such as COVID-19 are uninsurable. The required capital for effective protection against such an accumulation of risks would require premium rates that are unattractive for customers, if not unaffordable. In addition, a pandemic affects multiple lines of business,  such as business interruption, travel, event cancellations, but also liability lines,  as well as increases in medical costs and mortality. On top of this, the impact on capital markets needs consideration.\n\n- -Other non-financial risks: These risks are inherent to the core business and need to be carefully managed via continuous improvements in risk identification, risk assessment, and control environments. This occurs through elements of the Group Risk management framework,  such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA), Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS), Reputational Risk Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management.\n\nAllianz faces a challenging financial market and operating environment.\n\nMarkets are characterized by the risk of a persistently high volatility. Interest rates have recovered from historically low levels, reflecting monetary policy tightening by key central banks to counter strong inflationary pressure from energy prices and supply chain disruptions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bonds and equity markets are fragile, as central bank rates in Europe and the United States are below inflation rates, and there is the risk of further global political and economic destabilization.\n\nGeopolitical crises dominate the political and economic agenda, having forced an energy crisis, high inflation, and recessionary pressure. First and foremost, there is no clear resolution on the horizon for the war in Ukraine, encompassing the risks of a lasting energy crisis, a persistently high inflation, and upcoming social tensions. Furthermore, there is the risk of a deterioration in the United States-China relationships, as well as of a further hardening of China's attitudes towards Taiwan.\n\nIn addition to the geopolitical crises, there are several other factors that may lead to lasting high financial market volatility. Further momentum for radical parties around the globe could make international cooperation and coordination more challenging and complex, leading to a lower chance of impactful political action on issues such as climate change, due to conflicting objectives. The risk factors also include further disruptions in global supply chains (possibly triggered by  remaining  challenges  from  COVID-19),  which  could  weigh  on global trade, with the potential to prompt long-term structural shifts in global supply chains. Lasting risk factors include the challenges of implementing long-term structural reforms in key eurozone countries, as well as rising populism.\n\nThe increasing reliance on digital technologies, which has been greatly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic - to ensure business continuity and enhance efficiency and competitiveness, increases the risk of technology obsolescence, cyberattacks, data breaches, system failures, as well as the risk of non-compliance with increasing regulation covering IT-related business processes.\n\nThe ongoing uncertainty around the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic remains a risk. It seems that most major countries have achieved effective protection against the mortal impact of the current",

There is some uncertainty about future regulatory requirements resulting from the potential introduction of future global capital requirements and from the current Solvency II review.\n\nThe frameworks for potential future capital requirements for Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) and Global Systemically Important Insurers (G-SIIs) are yet to be finalized by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB).\n\nIn addition, the European Commission is conducting a review of the Solvency II directive as foreseen in European legislation. The review covers an extensive list of topics from a wide variety of areas, from capital requirements to reporting, to proportionality and to insurance recovery and resolution, for which EIOPA provided technical advice to the  European  Commission  in  December 2020,  suggesting  amendments in each area. Based on this and further input from stakeholders, the European Commission published its legislative proposal in September 2021. While following the EIOPA advice in general, the European  Commission introduced some changes. In particular, the proposal includes a phase-in until year 2032 for the new interest rates extrapolation, and a less conservative approach for calculating the risk margin of the technical provisions. The legislative proposal is subject to trilogue negotiations at the European level before changes to the directive become effective. A further transposition into national law will be required, so that final implementation is expected at the earliest for 2025. In this context, the Allianz Group is actively participating in discussions with the European Commission, EIOPA, local regulators, Insurance Europe, and the GDV.\n\nTherefore, future Solvency II capital requirements are expected to change as result of the review of the Solvency II framework. Concrete effects of the Solvency II review, however, can only be assessed after final results have been made available.\n\nFinally, the potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements will increase operational complexity and costs.\n\n## Management assessment\n\nAllianz SE's management feels comfortable with Allianz SE's overall risk profile and capitalization level. This confidence is based on several factors:\n\n- -Due to its effective capital management, Allianz SE is well-capitalized. We have met our internal and regulatory solvency targets as of 31 December 2022.\n- -Allianz SE  has a conservative investment profile and disciplined business practices in the reinsurance business, leading to sustainable operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.\n- 1\\_Own funds and capital requirement are calculated under consideration of volatility adjustment and yield curve extension, as described in the section 'Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment assumptions'.\n\n- -Allianz SE is well-positioned to deal with potentially adverse future events - such as those related to the ongoing war in Ukraine - due to  our  strong  internal  limit  framework,  stress  testing,  internal model, and risk management practices.\n\nBased on the information available to us at the moment of report completion, we expect to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the Minimum Capital Requirement. However, Allianz is carefully monitoring the further development of the war in Ukraine and manages its portfolios to ensure that the Group, Allianz SE, and the other Group companies have sufficient resources to meet their solvency capital needs.\n\nAllianz SE's own funds and capital requirements are based on the market value balance sheet approach consistent with the economic principles of Solvency II. 1 Our regulatory capitalization is shown in the following table:\n\n## Allianz SE: Solvency II regulatory capitalization\n\n| as of 31 December    |      |   2022/uni00B9 |   2021/uni00B2 |\n|----------------------|------|----------------|----------------|\n| Own funds            | \u20ac bn |           76.7 |           94.8 |\n| Capital requirement  | \u20ac bn |           29.3 |           36.4 |\n| Capitalization ratio | %    |          262   |          260   |\n\n- 1\\_Excluding the application of transitional measures for the valuation of technical provisions at other Allianz Group companies.\n- 2\\_2021 risk profile figures as reported previously.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Solvency II capitalization of Allianz SE stands at 262 %. The increase of 2 percentage points in 2022 results from a decrease in own funds by 19 % and a relatively higher decrease in solvency risk capital by 20 %, both mainly driven by lower participation values.\n\nThe  Allianz Group  companies  Allianz  Lebensversicherungs-AG and Allianz Private Krankenversicherungs-AG have been granted approval for the application of transitionals on technical provisions. The resulting change in participation values impacts Allianz SE's own funds and  capital  requirements.  Including  the  application  of  transitional measures for technical provisions at these Allianz Group companies, Allianz SE's own funds and capital requirement amounted to \u20ac 88.0 bn and \u20ac 32.9 bn, leading to a Solvency II ratio of 267 %. However, the general capital steering for both the Allianz Group and Allianz SE continues to focus on the previous approach, i.e., excluding the application of transitional measures for technical provisions at Allianz Group companies. Consequently, the figures in all subsequent sections exclude transitional measures applied at Allianz Group companies unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Quantifiable risks and opportunities by risk category\n\nThis Risk and Opportunity Report outlines Allianz SE's risk figures, reflecting  its  risk  profile  based  on  pre-diversified  risk  figures  and Allianz SE diversification effects.",

The results provide an overview of how our risk profile is distributed over different risk categories, and determine the regulatory capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II.\n\nThe pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effects within each modeled risk category (i.e., within market, credit, underwriting, business, and operational risk), but do not include the diversification effects across risk categories. The Allianz SE diversified risk also captures the diversification effects across all risk categories.\n\nThe Allianz SE diversified risk is broken down as follows:\n\nAllianz SE: Allocated risk according to the risk profile\n\n\u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2022    | 2021/uni00B9   |\n|---------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Market risk         | 28,142  | 35,169         |\n| Credit risk         | 524     | 625            |\n| Underwriting risk   | 3,442   | 3,946          |\n| Business risk       | 145     | 144            |\n| Operational risk    | 531     | 619            |\n| Diversification     | (3,314) | (4,104)        |\n| Tax                 | (206)   | -              |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 29,263  | 36,398         |\n\n1\\_2021 risk profile figures adjusted based on the 2022 model changes.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, Allianz SE's diversified risk capital amounted to \u20ac 29.3 bn (2021: \u20ac 36.4 bn). The decrease in Solvency II capital requirements is mainly due to lower market risk. Capital requirements were also reduced to a lesser extent by lower underwriting risk, credit risk, and operational risk. In contrast to previous years, there is a tax relief in the capital calculation due to a deferred tax liability.\n\nThe following sections outline the evolution of the risk profile per modeled risk category. All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis, and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly.\n\nThe following table presents the market risk of Allianz SE related to the source of risk:\n\nAllianz SE: Risk profile - Market risk by source of risk pre-diversified, \u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2022   | 2021/uni00B9   |\n|---------------------|--------|----------------|\n| Interest rate       | 69     | (3)            |\n| Inflation           | (349)  | (425)          |\n| Equity              | 27,980 | 35,283         |\n| Equity Volatility   | (93)   | -              |\n| Credit spread       | 334    | 146            |\n| Real estate         | 155    | 128            |\n| Currency            | 46     | 39             |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 28,142 | 35,169         |\n\n1\\_2021 risk profile figures adjusted based on the 2022 model changes.\n\nFor  Allianz SE,  the  pre-diversified  market  risk  as  of  year-end  2022 shows a decrease of \u20ac 7,027 mn, driven by reduced equity risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nIn 2022, the interest rate risk increased the market risk by \u20ac 69 mn. The change in comparison to the previous year (+\u20ac 72 mn) is mainly the result of higher interest rate shocks due to increased interest rates and interest rate volatilities, as well as changes in diversification effects.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, Allianz SE's interest-rate-sensitive assets amounting to a market value of \u20ac 39.1 bn would have gained \u20ac 1.9 bn or lost \u20ac 1.7 bn in value in the event of interest rates changing by -100 and + 100 basis points respectively.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nIn comparison to the previous year, the market risk relief that results from inflation risk decreased by \u20ac 76 mn. This results mainly from lower sensitivity against inflation shocks.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nIn 2022, the contribution of equity risk to market risk decreased by \u20ac 7,303 mn. This mainly results from lower market values of participations in Group companies.\n\n## Equity volatility risk\n\nEquity volatility risk relieves market risk by \u20ac 93 mn. The entire equity volatility risk arises from equity put hedges established in the second and third quarters of the year.\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nAt the end of 2022,  credit spread risk increases the market risk by \u20ac 334 mn. The increase of \u20ac 188 mn compared with the previous year is mainly due to changes in diversification effects.\n\n## Real estate risk\n\nThe burden on market risk from real estate risk increases by \u20ac 27 mn to \u20ac 155 mn due to changed diversification effects.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nAt year-end 2022, currency risk contributes \u20ac 46 mn to market risk, a similar level to the previous year (\u20ac 39 mn).\n\nThe \u20ac 101 mn decrease in credit risk is mainly driven by a lower fair value of the bonds, predominately due to the discounting effect of higher interest rates. A lower average maturity of the bond portfolio also contributed to the risk reduction.\n\nThe following table presents the pre-diversified risk calculated for underwriting risks stemming from our reinsurance business and internal pensions: 1",

The Chairperson can also veto decisions, but he/she cannot enforce a decision against the majority vote.\n\nIn the financial year 2022, the following Board of Management committees were in place:\n\n## Board committees\n\n| Board committees                                                                                                                         | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group Finance and Risk Committee  Giulio Terzariol (Chairman),   Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler,  Dr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger,  Christopher Townsend. | Preparing the capital and liquidity planning for  the Group and Allianz SE, implementing and  overseeing the principles of group-wide capital  and liquidity management as well as risk  standards and preparing risk strategy.

The holding company and the operating entities first define the business strategies and goals. On that basis, joint plans are prepared, to be considered by the Supervisory Board in setting targets for the performance-based remuneration of the members of the Board of Management. For details, please refer to the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Board of Management reports regularly and comprehensively to the Supervisory Board on business development, the company's  net  assets,  financial  position  and  earnings,  planning  and achievement of objectives, business strategy, and risk exposure. Details on the Board of Management's reporting to the Supervisory Board are laid down in the information rules issued by the Supervisory Board.\n\nImportant decisions of the Board of Management require approval by the Supervisory Board. Approval requirements are stipulated by law, by the Statutes, or in individual cases by decisions of the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Supervisory Board approval is required,  for  example,  for  certain  capital  transactions,  intercompany agreements, and the launch of new business segments or the closure of existing ones. Approval is also required for acquisitions of companies and holdings in companies as well as for divestments of Group companies that exceed certain threshold levels. Moreover, the Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE in the version dated June 2021 (hereinafter 'SE Agreement') requires the approval of the Supervisory Board for the appointment of the member of the Board of Management responsible for labor and social affairs.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management is described in Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management. The composition is also available on the Allianz company website . It also provides a general description of the function of the Board of Management.",

        "page_content": "## Diversity concept for the Board of Management and succession planning\n\nIn accordance with the legislation implementing the EU Directive on the  disclosure  of  non-financial  and  diversity  information  (CSR  Directive), the diversity concept for the Board of Management, its objectives, implementation, and results achieved are to be reported.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has adopted the following diversity concept for the Board of Management of Allianz SE:\n\nFor the composition of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board aims for an adequate 'Diversity of Minds'. This comprises broad diversity with regard to gender, internationality, and educational as well as professional background.\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the achievement of such target, inter alia, on the basis of the following specific indicators:\n\n- -adequate proportion of women on the Management Board,\n- -adequate share of members with an international background (e.g., based  on  origin  or  extensive  professional  experience abroad),  ideally  with  connection  to  the  regions  in  which  the Allianz Group is operating,\n- -adequate diversity with regard to educational and professional background, taking into account the limitations for the Supervisory Board by regulatory requirements (fitness).\n\nThis diversity concept is implemented in the Supervisory Board's procedure of appointing members to the Board of Management. For the purpose of long-term succession planning, a list of candidates is prepared and updated on an ongoing basis by the CEO in consultation with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board. The procedure ensures that the list of successors will comprise an appropriate proportion of female candidates and male candidates with international experience. This is especially taken into account by the Personnel Committee in succession planning. The list of candidates includes internal and external candidates generally meeting the requirements for a mandate on the Board of Management. In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Management, the Personnel Committee, after thorough examination, recommends a suitable candidate to the Supervisory Board plenary session and reports on the selection process and, if necessary, alternative candidates. Prior to an appointment to the Board of Management, all members of the Supervisory Board are given the opportunity to meet the candidate in person.\n\nCurrently,  the  Board  of  Management  of  Allianz SE  comprises three female members, accounting for 33.3 % of all members. Four members of the Management Board have international backgrounds. There is an appropriate level of diversity in terms of educational and professional background. The Board of Management of Allianz SE is therefore composed in accordance with the diversity concept.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nThe Allianz Group has an appropriate and effective internal risk and control system for verifying and monitoring its operating activities and business processes, in particular financial reporting, as well as compliance with regulatory requirements. The requirements placed on the internal control system are essential, not only for the resilience and value of the company, but also to maintain the confidence of the capital market, our customers, and the public. An assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the System of Governance is conducted regularly in the course of the review of the business organization.\n\nIn addition, the Allianz Group has implemented an adequate and effective framework and measures to identify, assess, manage, and communicate risks. For further information on the internal control system and risk management system of Allianz, please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nIntegrity is at the core of our compliance programs and the basis for the trust of our customers, shareholders, business partners, and employees. The Compliance function fosters a corporate culture of individual and collective responsibility for ethical conduct and adherence to the rules. For further information on the compliance management system, please refer to the Non-Financial Statement.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nOur  Code  of  Conduct  and  the  internal  compliance  policies  and guidelines derived from it provide all employees, managers, and executive board members with clear and practical guidance, enabling them to act in line with the values of the Allianz Group. The rules of conduct established by the Code of Conduct are binding for all employees worldwide and build the basis for our compliance programs. The Code of Conduct is available on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Function of the Supervisory Board and the composition and functions of committees\n\nThe  German  Co-Determination  Act  ('Mitbestimmungsgesetz')  does not apply to Allianz SE because it has the legal form of a European Company (SE). Instead, the size and composition of the Supervisory Board are determined by general European SE regulations. These regulations are implemented in the Statutes and via the SE Agreement.",

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board comprises twelve members, including six shareholder representatives appointed by the AGM. The six employee representatives are appointed by the SE Works Council. The specific procedure for their appointment is laid down in the SE Agreement. This agreement stipulates that the six employee representatives must be allocated in proportion to the number of Allianz employees in the different countries. The Supervisory Board currently in office comprises four employee representatives from Germany and one each from France and Italy. According to \u00a7 17 (2) SEAG, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE shall be composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men. The regular term of appointment for the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE is four years. In addition, a staggered board with different appointment periods was introduced with the elections to the Supervisory Board on 4 May 2022.\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Board of Management on managing the business. It is also responsible, in particular, for appointing the members of the Board of Management, determining the overall remuneration for the Board of Management members, succession planning for the Board of Management, and reviewing the annual financial statements of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. The Supervisory Board's activities in the financial year 2022, including individualized disclosure of meeting participation, are described in the\n\n## Supervisory Board Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board takes all decisions with a simple majority. The special requirements for appointing members to the Board of Management, as stipulated in the German Co-Determination Act, and the requirement to have a Conciliation Committee, do not apply to an SE. In the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who at Allianz SE must be a shareholder representative. If the Chairperson is not present in the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the Vice Chairperson, representing the shareholder side. A second Vice Chairperson is elected upon proposal of the employee representatives.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities.  The review is carried out either on the basis of a selfevaluation using a questionnaire or by consulting an external consultant. At a plenary meeting, the full Supervisory Board discusses recommendations  for  improvements  and  adopts  appropriate measures on the basis of recommendations from the Standing Committee. In addition, the fitness and propriety of the individual members of the Supervisory Board is assessed in the framework of an annual self-evaluation required by supervisory law, and a development plan for the Supervisory Board is drawn up on that basis. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee regularly also hold sessions without the presence of any of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nPart of the Supervisory Board's work is carried out by its committees.

        "page_content": "The objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board (in the version  of  September 2022),  as  specified  to  implement  legal  requirements and the recommendation of the Code, are set out below. In\n\n## Objectives for the composition of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board\n\n'The aim of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board is to have members who are equipped with the necessary skills and competence to properly supervise and advise Allianz SE's management. Supervisory Board candidates should possess the professional expertise and experience, integrity, motivation and commitment, independence, and personality required to successfully carry out the responsibilities of a Supervisory Board member in a financial services institution with international operations.\n\nThese objectives take into account the regulatory requirements for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the relevant recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code ('GCGC'). In addition to the requirements for each individual member, a profile of skills and expertise ('Kompetenzprofil') as well as a diversity concept are provided for the entire Supervisory Board.\n\n## I. Requirements relating to the individual members of the Supervisory Board\n\n## 1. Propriety\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must be proper as defined by the regulatory provisions. A person is assumed to be proper as long as no facts are to be known which may cause impropriety. Therefore, no personal circumstances shall exist which - according to general experience - lead to the assumption that the diligent and orderly exercise of the mandate may be affected (in particular, administrative offenses or violation of criminal law, especially in connection with commercial activity).\n\n## 2. Fitness\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must have the expertise and experience necessary for a diligent and autonomous exercise of the Allianz SE Supervisory Board mandate, in particular for exercising control of and giving advice to the Management Board as well as for the active support of the development of the company. This comprises in particular:\n\n- -  adequate expertise in all business areas,\n- -  adequate expertise in the insurance and finance sector or comparable relevant experience and expertise in other sectors,\n- -  adequate expertise in the regulatory provisions material for Allianz SE (supervisory law, including Solvency II regulation, corporate and capital markets law, corporate governance),\n- -ability to assess the business risks,\n- -  knowledge of accounting basics and insurance specific risk management basics.\n\n## 3. Independence\n\nThe GCGC defines a person as independent who, in particular, does not have any business or personal relations with Allianz SE or its executive bodies, a controlling shareholder, or an enterprise associated with the latter, which may cause a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest.\n\nThe Supervisory Board of Allianz SE states the following with regard to the further specification of independence:\n\n- -  Former members of the Allianz SE Management Board shall not be deemed independent during the mandatory corporate law cooling-off period.\n- -  Members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE in office for more than 12 years shall not be deemed independent.\n- -  Regarding employee representatives, the mere fact of employee representation and the existence of a working relationship with the company shall not itself affect the independence of the employee representatives.\n\nApplying such definition, at least eight members of the Supervisory Board shall be independent. In case shareholder representatives and employee representatives are viewed separately, at least four of each should be independent.\n\nIt has to be considered that the possible emergence of conflicts of interests in individual cases cannot generally be excluded. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board and will be resolved by appropriate measures.\n\n## 4. Time of availability\n\nEach member of the Supervisory Board must ensure that he/she has sufficient time to dedicate to the proper fulfillment of the mandate of this Supervisory Board position.\n\nIn addition to the mandatory mandate limitations and the GCGC recommendation for active Management Board members of listed companies (max. two mandates), the common capital markets requirements shall be considered.\n\nWith regard to the Allianz SE mandate, the members shall take into account that:\n\n- -  at least four, but as a rule six, ordinary Supervisory Board meetings are held each year, each of which requires adequate preparation,\n- -  sufficient time must be set aside for the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements,\n- -  participation in the General Meeting is required,\n\nThe Supervisory Board pursues these objectives, and thus also the diversity concept, when nominating candidates for shareholder representatives. As employee representatives are appointed according to different national provisions, the potential to influence the selection of\n\nemployee  representatives  is  limited.  The  Supervisory  Board  of Allianz SE is currently composed in accordance with these objectives, including the diversity concept. According to the assessment of the Supervisory Board, all shareholder representatives, i.e., Ms. Boissard,\n\naddition to the skills profile for the overall Supervisory Board to be drawn up under the Code, the diversity concept in accordance with the legislation implementing the CSR Directive is also included. The objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board can be found on the Allianz company website .\n\nEmployee representation within Allianz SE, according to the Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE, contributes to the diversity of work experience and cultural background. Pursuant to the provisions of the German SE Participation Act (SEBG), the number of women and men appointed as German employee representatives should be proportional to the number of women and men working in the German companies. However, the Supervisory Board does not have the right to select the employee representatives.\n\nThe following requirements and objectives apply to the composition of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board:\n\n- -  depending on possible membership in one or more of the Supervisory Board Committees, extra time planning is required for participation in these Committee meetings and to do the necessary preparation for these meetings/uni003B this applies in particular for the Audit and Risk Committees,\n- -  attendance of extraordinary meetings of the Supervisory Board or of a Committee might be required to deal with special matters.\n\n## 5. Retirement age\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board shall, as a rule, not be older than 70 years of age.\n\n## 6. Term of membership\n\nThe continuous period of membership for any member of the Supervisory Board should, as a rule, not exceed 12 years.\n\n## 7. Former Allianz SE Management Board members\n\nFormer Allianz SE Management Board members are subject to the mandatory corporate law coolingoff period of two years.\n\nAccording to regulatory provisions, no more than two former Allianz SE Management Board members shall be members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## II. Requirements for the entire Supervisory Board\n\n## 1. Profile of skills and expertise for the entire Supervisory Board\n\nIn addition to the expertise-related requirements for the individual members, the following shall apply with respect to the expertise and experience of the entire Supervisory Board:\n\n- -  familiarity of members in their entirety with the insurance and financial services sector,\n- -  adequate expertise of the entire Board with respect to regulatorily required areas of investment management, insurance actuarial practice, accounting,\n- -  adequate expertise of the entire Board with respect to technology, including cybersecurity, employee engagement and sustainability (especially Environment, Social responsibility and Governance as well as data privacy),\n- -  at least one member with considerable experience in the insurance and financial services fields,\n- -  at least one member with comprehensive expertise in the field of accounting and at least one other member with comprehensive expertise in the field of auditing. The expertise in the field of accounting shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing shall consist of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance,\n- -  at least one member with comprehensive expertise in the field of digital transformation,\n- -  specialist expertise or experience in other economic sectors,\n- -  managerial or operational experience.\n\n## 2. Diversity concept\n\nTo promote an integrative cooperation among the Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board strives for an adequate diversity with respect to gender, internationality, different occupational backgrounds, professional expertise, and experience:\n\n- -  The Supervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men. The representation of women is generally considered to be the joint responsibility of the shareholder and employee representatives.\n- -  At least four of the members must, on the basis of their origin or function, represent regions or\n- cultural areas in which Allianz SE conducts significant business. For Allianz SE as a Societas Europaea, the agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE provides that Allianz employees from different EU member states are considered in the allocation of employee representatives' Supervisory Board seats.\n- -  In order to provide the Board with the most diverse sources of experience and specialist knowledge possible, the members of the Supervisory Board shall complement each other with respect to their background, professional experience, and specialist knowledge.'",

        "page_content": "Ms. Bosse, Ms. Chatterjee as well as Mr. Diekmann, Dr. Eichiner and Mr. Hainer, are independent within the meaning of the objectives (see No. I.3). All shareholder representatives on the Audit Committee, including the Chairperson of the Committee, have comprehensive expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing. The expertise in the field of accounting consists of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing consists of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance.\n\nThe Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr. Eichiner, is a business administration graduate. He gained extensive knowledge and experience in both accounting and auditing during his many years as Chief Financial Officer of a DAX-listed company. Ms. Boissard was also able to acquire extensive knowledge and experience in both of these areas during her many years as a member of the Audit Committee and in the\n\nframework of her work as CEO of Korian S.A.. Finally, Mr. Diekmann also has in-depth knowledge and experience in both areas due to his many years of service first as CEO and later as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and long-standing member of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nThe  employee  representatives  on  the  Audit  Committee,  Ms. Grundler and Mr. Le Goa\u00ebr, also have expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing due to their long-standing membership of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nMoreover, with five female and seven male Supervisory Board members, the gender ratio of 30 % required under the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions is being met. In addition, the Supervisory Board has five members with international backgrounds. The skills profile is also met by the current composition of the entire Supervisory Board.

These disclosures are published on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nShareholders exercise their rights at the AGM. When adopting resolutions, each share confers one vote. Shareholders can follow the AGM's proceedings on the internet and be represented by proxies exercising their voting rights exclusively on the basis of instructions given by the shareholders. Shareholders are also able to cast their votes via (electronic) absentee vote.\n\nThe AGM elects the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board and resolves on the approval of the actions taken by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. It decides on the appropriation of net earnings, capital transactions, the election of the auditor, approval of intercompany agreements, as well as on the approval of the remuneration  system  presented  by  the  Supervisory  Board  for  the members of the Board of Management, the remuneration of the Supervisory Board, and the approval of the Remuneration Report prepared by the  Board  of  Management  and  the  Supervisory  Board,  as  well  as changes to the Company's Statutes. Resolutions of the AGM shall be passed, unless mandatory legal provisions require otherwise, by a simple majority of the valid votes cast. In accordance with European regulations and the Statutes, changes to the Statutes require at least a twothirds majority of the votes cast, which at the same time represents the majority of the capital stock represented at the time of the resolution, if less than half of the share capital is represented at the AGM at the time of adoption of the resolution relating to an amendment to the Statutes. Each year, an ordinary general meeting is held at which the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board give an account of the preceding financial year. For special decisions, the German Stock Corporation Act provides for the convening of an extraordinary AGM.\n\n## Accounting and auditing\n\nThe Allianz Group prepares its accounts according to \u00a7 315e HGB on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE are prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards.\n\nThe auditor of the annual financial statements and the auditor in charge of the review of the half-yearly financial report were elected by the AGM on 4 May 2022. The audit of the financial statements covers the individual financial statements of Allianz SE and the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group.\n\nWe inform our shareholders, financial analysts, the media, and the general public about the Company's situation on a regular basis and in a timely manner. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group, and the respective Management Reports are publicly available within 90 days of the end of each financial year. Additional information is provided in the Allianz Group's half-yearly financial reports and quarterly statements. Information is also made available at the AGM, at conference calls for analysts and journalists, and on the corporate website. Allianz's website also provides a financial calendar listing the dates of major publications and events, such as annual reports, half-yearly financial reports, and quarterly statements, AGMs, and analyst conference calls as well as financial press conferences.\n\nThe 2023 financial calendar is available on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Information in accordance with the German Act on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions in the Private and Public Sectors\n\nThe section below outlines the targets set by Allianz SE and the other companies of the Allianz Group in Germany that are subject to codetermination  (the  'subsidiaries  concerned')  for  the  Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the two management levels below the Board of Management.\n\nPursuant  to  \u00a7 17 (2)  SEAG,  as  of  1 January 2016,  the  share  of women and men among the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has to be at least 30 % each. The Supervisory Board currently in office fulfills this requirement as it includes five women (41.7 %) and seven men (58.3 %).\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 16 (2) SEAG, since 1 August 2022 it has to be ensured that the Board of Management includes at least one female and at least one male member when appointing members to the Board of management. This legal requirement is met by the current Board of Management of Allianz SE. As at 31 December 2022, the proportion of women on the Board of Management was 27.3 %. Since 1 January 2023, the proportion of women on the Board of Management has been 33.3 %.\n\nAs regards the proportion of women on the first and second management levels below the Board of Management, the Board of Management has set targets of 30.6 % and 30 %, respectively, to be met by 31 December 2024. As at 31 December 2022, this target was already met for the first management level with a percentage of women of 30.6 %, but was not yet met for the second level with a percentage of 24.8 %. The first two management levels below the Board of Management comprise a very small comparative group of executives. No suitable female candidates were identified for the very few positions that became vacant in the period under review.\n\nWith regard to the Supervisory Boards of the subsidiaries concerned, the target quotas for nine of the eleven subsidiaries concerned were set at 33 %, the target quota for one subsidiary concerned was set at 35 %, and the target quota for the remaining subsidiary concerned",

This is compiled in accordance with the standards set out by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).\n\nThis non-financial chapter of our 2022 Annual Report covers the entire  Allianz Group  and  relevant  non-financial  information  for Allianz SE, according to the Non-financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), which has been adopted into German law by the CSR Directive Implementation Act. All measures, activities and key figures refer to the 2022 financial  year  (1 January 2022  to  31 December 2022).  We  have slightly amended our approach for the presentation of our targets and achievements tables compared with previous years. For targets relevant for the remuneration of the Board of Management, we disclose the comparison for targets set this year with the achievements from this year and we define targets for next year and beyond if relevant. For all other topics, we present the objectives and actions taken in the reporting year. Unless otherwise stated, we use the control principle defined  by  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS) when determining the scope of reporting for the Allianz Group.\n\nThis Non-Financial Statement is an integral part of the management report and is subject to the statutory audit of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft.\n\nAny references to information published outside the Group Management Report and Allianz SE's Management Report are supplementary, do not form an integral part of this non-financial information, and are not subject to any assurance engagement (unless specified in the respective document).\n\nWe use SAP data collection for all non-financial information disclosed in this statement, with an interface to financial data systems for some data points. The P&C Line of Business reporting process in SAP is used to collect Sustainable Solutions and EU Taxonomy data. The governance process for non-financial reporting is aligned with financial reporting and follows the same review rounds as the Annual Report engaging with the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Non-Financial Statement is structured along the following main chapters:\n\n- -Corporate sustainability governance and strategy,\n- -Environmental matters,\n- -Social matters,\n- -Cybersecurity,\n- -Human rights matters,\n- -Employee matters,\n- -Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters,\n- -EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n## Company description\n\nAllianz provides property-casualty and life/health insurance as well as asset management products and services to our customers around the world. In our activities as a financial services provider, we take sustainability-related risks such as climate change into consideration and pursue opportunities from sustainability trends. We describe our management approach to these matters in this section.\n\nFor further information on our business model, see our Business Operations  chapter in the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2022 and section 01.3 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\n\nOur purpose 'We secure your future' - guides our actions across the Allianz Group and drives us to pursue constant innovation and collaboration. It also guides our interaction with our customers, partners, employees, investors, governments, regulators, civil society, people with disabilities, and the next generations across all our businesses.\n\nOur ambition is to support the transformation towards sustainable economies as a partner to our stakeholders. In doing so, we want to drive real world impact across societies, economies, and the environment. This includes helping to shape the economy to provide the social minimum for all while not breaching ecological barriers.\n\nWe are committed to responsible and transparent governance. Allianz has increased the importance of sustainability with the ambition to fully integrate sustainability across the company. Ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE as the Group's parent company. To support the Board of Management in its decision-making, Allianz SE established  a  dedicated  Group  Sustainability  Board  (known  until  January 2022 as the Group ESG Board). It is composed of members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE and Group Center heads, and meets quarterly. The core objectives of the Group Sustainability Board are:  preparing  the  overall  framework  for  sustainability  for  the Allianz Group/uni003B integrating sustainability into the Group's business processes with Allianz as an organization (operations and organization)",

The core objectives of the Sustainability Committee include: advising the Supervisory Board on sustainability-related issues to support economically sound and sustainable development and positioning of the Allianz Group/uni003B closely monitoring and supporting oversight of the Management Board's sustainability strategy, in particular the management and execution of the strategic framework for Group-wide sustainability measures/uni003B and preliminary examination of the sustainability-related disclosures,  including the non-financial statement as part of the Supervisory Board's review. It also supports the Personnel Committee in the preparation of the sustainability-related target setting, as well as the review of the set targets' fulfillment for the Management Board's remuneration. In 2022, the Sustainability Committee prepared the incorporation of sustainability targets and reviewed the achievements of the Board of Management in order to give its recommendation to the remuneration committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Global Sustainability function supports the Group Sustainability Board in the execution of its responsibilities. This includes preparation, coordination, and application of the decisions by the Group Sustainability Board. It also supports Allianz's Group Centers and operating entities to effectively integrate the Group's sustainability strategy into their business processes and policies. The Global Sustainability function drives the integration of sustainability-related matters across the organization and business in the societies and economies in which Allianz operates.\n\nGroup Centers take responsibility for sustainability within their functions with the purpose to embed sustainability across the Allianz organization and business. Global Sustainability and Group Centers work with an expansive network of sustainability and business experts located across Allianz's operating entities, globally providing guidance and setting minimum standards to ensure they embed sustainability in their strategies and approaches. This network supports implementation of the group-wide sustainability approach, shares best practice, for example in the field of corporate citizenship activities, and scales positive impacts across the organization.\n\nOther Board of Management committees play an important role in decision-making processes:\n\n- -The Group Finance and Risk Committee oversees risk management and monitoring, including sustainability risk.\n- -The Group Underwriting Committee monitors the underwriting business, its risk management and development of underwriting policies and strategies. This includes the integration of sustainability into these processes.\n- -The Group Investment Committee focuses on fundamental investment-related topics, including sustainability-related matters.\n\nIn 2022 and for 2023 the targets for the Board of Management have been further developed to reflect the sustainability priorities.\n\nTargets for 2022:\n\n- -18 % reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per employee by 2022 (versus 2019) and 88 % renewable electricity as share of total electricity consumption in 2022.\n- -Proprietary Investment: Establish a quantitative roadmap to reach minus 25 % GHG emissions (absolute reduction on public equity and listed corporate debt by year-end 2024 versus 2019).\n\nOn top of these specific sustainability-related targets, other non-financial factors,  such as customer loyalty (NPS), employee engagement (IMIX) and sustainability reputation (measured by external rating), also contribute to board members' remuneration, as do ratings.\n\n## Targets and achievements: sustainability ratings\n\n| Rating                  | Board targets  2022                            | Achievements  2022                                              | Targets 2023   | Targets and  commitments  2024 and beyond   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| DJSI/ S&P Global  CSA 1 | Top 5                                          | 3rd              (2021: 1st)                                    | Top 5          | Top 5                                       |\n| MSCI 2                  | AA - AAA                                       | AA               (2021: AAA)                                    | AA - AAA       | AA - AAA                                    |\n| Sustainalytics 3        | Top 5 at  diversified  insurance sub- industry | No. 4 diversified  insurance sub- industry level  (2021: No. 7) | n.a. 4         | n.a. 4                                      |\n\n- 2\\_The use by Allianz of any MSCI ESG research LLC or its affiliates ('MSCI') data, and the use of MSCI logos, trademarks, service marks or index names herein, does not constitute a sponsorship, endorsement, recommendation, or promotion of Allianz by MSCI. 3\\_MSCI services and data are the property of MSCI or its information providers, and are provided as-is and without warranty.

        "page_content": "Our most recent assessment was carried out in 2021 in line with the GRI (2016) Standards requirements and is still applicable for 2022. For 2022, there are no significant changes to the process or list of material topics compared to the previous year. Our assessment approach used a variety of data sources, and we improved our methodology in 2021 by increasing the number of data sources and the number of data points within these sources.\n\nWe identified 19 material issues which were prioritized as having either high or medium importance. Topics are ranked and presented in a materiality matrix according to the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch  -  HGB')  requirements  and  based  on  stakeholder views on their importance to society and to our business. The highestranked topics for all stakeholders were:\n\n- -climate change,\n- -ethics and responsible business,\n- -cybersecurity.\n\nFor a full description of the materiality assessment process and its matrix, please refer to the Materiality analysis chapters in the Group Sustainability Reports 2021 and 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\nWe have set ourselves the target of conducting a comprehensive update of the materiality analysis every three years in line with regulatory, reporting, and rating agency guidelines.\n\nWe intend to undergo, latest for fiscal year 2024, a comprehensive materiality assessment process which will be in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) provisions, which will include identifying material sustainability matters from an impact perspective (our impact on the environment and people) and a financial perspective (risks and opportunities related to sustainability matters).\n\nFor information on the financial implications of the war in Ukraine on the Allianz Group, please refer to note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur purpose drives our sustainability priorities. This means supporting the transformation of economies that do not breach ecological barriers. It also means aspiring to achieve a social minimum for everyone. Building on our business strategy, we have set sustainability priorities that reflect our values and the areas where we think we can make an impact across Environment, Social, and Governance (E, S, and G).\n\nEnvironment -  our priority is Climate/SDG 13. Our businesses spanning insurance, investment, and asset management are focused on understanding and shaping the climate transformation.\n\nSocial - our priority is Decent work and economic growth/SDG 8, including  education upskilling and employability. We want to be a partner to our customers, governments, regulators, and societies. Our goal is to support the next generations and people with disabilities so that they can access high-quality employment. Investing in learning and development for our diverse workforce is key to making all of this happen in a changing world of work.\n\nGovernance - our priority is to create trust through strong leadership. We aspire to be a trusted partner for protecting and growing our stakeholders' most valuable assets. Against that background, strong leadership is a key contributor to a company's culture and governance.\n\nWe prioritize three U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to guide the integration of sustainability across Allianz and help us to contribute to societal, environmental, and economic change. In addition to SDG 13, Climate action, we have chosen SDG 8, Decent work and economic growth, as an orientation for our work. We believe that delivering the sustainability agenda is only possible through stakeholders working together. This is why we also prioritize SDG 17, Partnership for the goals.\n\nIn everything we do across our priorities of E, S, and G, we strive to embed the sustainability principles and activities that are outlined in our Group Sustainability Report 2022.\n\nWe ground our strategy in proactive risk management to detect and address risks across the businesses. Group Risk is responsible for this process. We have not identified any remaining principal risks resulting from our operations, business activities, and business relations that could have severe adverse effects on material non-financial matters. Any potential risks and impacts identified throughout our risk assessment have been addressed by the respective concepts we have  in place, which we describe in this report.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding sustainability issues allows us to reduce risks and capture opportunities in underwriting, claims, proprietary investment management, and asset management. For information on climate-related risks and opportunities, please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report. Our concepts for all other matters for which reporting is required will be addressed in subsequent chapters. The ESG approach provides part of the foundation for these concepts and is managed by Global Sustainability.\n\nOur commitment to tackling ESG topics - here referred to as sustainability topics - ensures we embed sustainability in our own operations and across our insurance, investment and asset management activities. The types of sustainability risks Allianz considers to be material in its insurance, and investment activities are summarized in the Allianz ESG Integration Framework . We published the fourth version of the Framework in 2021.\n\nIn the Allianz Group Risk Policy , we define sustainability risks as events or conditions which, if they occur, could have significant negative impacts  on  the  assets,  profitability  or  reputation  of  the Allianz Group or one of its companies. Sustainability topics are integrated  in  our  insurance,  investment,  and  asset  management  businesses through multiple instruments. Key processes include the internal Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk and Issue Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules, such as the Allianz Standards for P&C Underwriting and Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI).",

        "page_content": "An overview of the Group's key ESG integration processes is described below:\n\n- -ESG risks are managed through the ESG-sensitive business guidelines outlined in the AS RRIM, in underwriting, proprietary investments in non-listed asset classes, and operations.\n- -For investments in listed asset classes, the Allianz ESG scoring approach (defined in EFRI) is applied to manage related risks.\n- -For proprietary investments, Allianz has excluded investments in companies involved in controversial weapons since 2011. Additionally, we do not provide insurance cover for activities related to such weapons.\n- -We have restricted proprietary investments in coal-based and oil and gas business models and related property-casualty insurance business.  Our  criteria  for  the  exclusion  of  coal-based  business models  were  further  expanded  in  May 2021.  Furthermore,  we have  also  excluded  oil  sands-based  business  models  since May 2021. 1 In the fight against global warming, any additional unit of renewable energy is needed. Therefore, we are revising our thermal coal guideline to allow ring-fenced insurance of renewable energy projects not looking at legacy business of the utility.\n- -ESG  integration  in  property-casualty  insurance  is  carried  out through the application of ESG guidelines and processes in the underwriting process.\n- -Further ESG-related measures, including the prevention of human rights violations, are part of our systematic engagement with investee companies as well as ESG considerations in our selection and management of asset managers and in our procurement processes.\n\nWe continue to expand and strengthen our sustainability risk management approach to ensure it is current and relevant in the context of our core businesses. The data related to our ESG integration approach is included in our Group Sustainability  Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .  An in-depth  overview of our approach and processes for integrating ESG is published in the Allianz ESG Integration Framework on the Allianz company website .\n\nIn  our  Asset  Management  business  segment,  AllianzGI  and PIMCO have developed and implemented entity-specific processes to manage risks and capture opportunities from ESG issues. For proprietary assets that AllianzGI  and  PIMCO  manage on behalf of other Allianz Group entities, group-level requirements are observed in combination with the asset management entities' specific approaches, as shown in section 02.3 in our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the\n\nAllianz company website\n\n.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThe following section describes the impact of environmental matters on our business activities and relationships, as well as the impact of Allianz's activities and relationships on the environment. We also describe our concepts for managing these impacts and related achievements.\n\nWithin our global sustainability approach, the pillar 'Low carbon economy, climate change, and decarbonization' addresses climate change, and environmental issues. Both were identified as top risks in our materiality analysis. As a company dealing with risk, managing impact on environmental matters - and their impact on us - is a key element of our business approach.\n\nClimate change is a major risk for societies and economies, and it directly affects our business, from our insurance products to our proprietary and third-party investments, and our own operations. We are tackling climate change challenges by promoting the transition to a low carbon economy through our investments and insurance solutions. In addition, we actively manage emissions from our operations.\n\nIn  2022,  the  decrease  in  measured  GHG  emissions  was  mainly caused by increasing the share of renewable power in our energy mix, delivering a structured approach to energy management, and reduced business travel resulting from COVID-19.\n\n## Climate Change Strategy\n\nOur  climate  approach  is  grounded  in  the  Allianz Group  Climate Change Strategy. The strategy is built around the three pillars through which we can have an impact: Anticipate. Care. Enable.\n\nOur ambition is to be a partner for our clients, investees and different sectors in the transition towards net-zero. We do this with our own activities, and we contribute through partnerships, including the U.N.-Convened  Net-Zero  alliances:  Net-Zero  Asset  Owner  Alliance (NZAOA) as well as Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA). Allianz Global Investors is part of the Net-Zero Asset Manager initiative (NZAM, not U.N.-convened).\n\nOur climate approach is an integral part of our core business. By committing to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, we are working to set long-term and intermediate targets across our operations and business lines in line with the 1.5\u00b0C ambition. 2\n\nThe Allianz SE Board of Management's remuneration is tied to the attainment of climate-related targets, among other things, which include the successful execution of our Climate Change Strategy.\n\nWe measure our GHG emissions from our own operations (Scope 1, 2 and relevant scope 3) and from our proprietary investment portfolio (Scope 3 category 15) and are continuously working to increase the covered asset classes. Based on our current model, the total GHG emissions from Allianz amount to 16.4 mn t CO2e. We have increased the scope by including the following asset classes: sovereigns, buildings and infrastructure equity, but have limited assurance for these asset classes to date. We provide more details in this chapter. For further information, please refer to 'Sustainability in proprietary investments' (section 02.2) and 'Own operations' (section 02.6) in our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Climate targets for proprietary investments\n\nFor our proprietary investment portfolio, we have committed to reduce GHG emissions to net-zero by 2050. Our initial set of intermediate 2025 targets covered listed equities, corporate bonds,  and direct real estate,  including Joint Ventures. We are constantly expanding the scope of targets in line with the Target Setting Protocol of the NZAOA.",

        "page_content": "As an intermediary target, we aim to reduce our emissions in our listed equities and tradeable corporate bonds by 25 % by year-end 2024 compared to 2019.\n\nWe also target that our direct real estate portfolio will be aligned with science-based 1.5\u00b0C pathways by year-end 2024. In 2021, we introduced new targets for our equity and debt infrastructure investments. For direct equity infrastructure investments, we are targeting a 28 % reduction by the end of 2025 against the 2020 base year.\n\nIn 2022, we set targets covering fund investments in infrastructure, real estate, and private equity, as well as our European Commercial Real Estate Lending (EU CREL) business. For all investments in these asset classes, we commit to carbon transparency on financed emissions, at the latest by reporting for the 2024 fiscal year. For new investments in these asset classes, we will phase in net-zero targets by 2025. For EU CREL, our targets are to ensure Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) alignment for all new loans. For all existing assets, we apply an engagement approach.\n\nTo set targets and measure achievement, we calculate the carbon footprint of the respective asset classes. While we have already been reporting the carbon footprint of our Corporates and Listed Equities portfolios, we now also calculate the carbon footprint of our (direct) Real Estate, (direct) Infrastructure Equity and Sovereign bond portfolios in line with the latest PCAF recommendation. For further details on our targets and our carbon footprint, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website , sections 02.2.2 and 03.1.\n\nTo complement our portfolio climate targets for investments, we have also set targets for two of the highest-emitting industries, namely utilities, and oil and gas.\n\n## Utilities\n\nComplementing our coal phase-out commitment by gradually increasing our investments in renewables and following at least the necessary annual growth rate of 5.85 % as proposed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) as a minimum. As of 2023, there will be stricter thresholds for coal-based business models.\n\n## Oil and gas\n\nSupporting the commitment set out by the industry-led Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) to limit the emission intensity for Scope 1 and 2 emissions of oil and gas companies in their exploration and production business ('upstream') to less than 20 kg CO/uni2082e per barrel of oil, and aligning our oil and gas exposure on average-listed equity and corporate bonds portfolio to this intensity level.\n\nBy 2025, we aim for at least 50 % of our assets under management in the oil and gas sector to have set net-zero targets on Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050.\n\n## Anticipating climate risks\n\nOur Climate Change Strategy aims to anticipate the risks of a changing climate. We systematically consider climate and sustainability criteria in our insurance and investment business. We continuously update and develop our approach to identifying and managing climate change risks and opportunities. Using internal models and external tools, we perform sensitivity and scenario analyses with time horizons extending to 2050, and with global warming scenarios ranging from 1.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C. For more details on climate scenario analyses, see section 03.4 of our\n\nGroup Sustainability Report 2022 on the\n\nAllianz company website\n\n.\n\nIn pursuing our investment business, we consider climate-related criteria  such  as  carbon  emissions,  energy  efficiency,  vulnerability  to\n\nclimate change, and opportunities in clean tech as part of our ESG integration approach for listed and non-listed assets. We also systematically engage with investee companies exposed to high ESG risks, offering advice and encouraging them to define and pursue their own climate strategies in line with the latest scientific findings. For further insights into the Allianz Group's ESG engagement approach, please refer to section 02.2.1 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\nAs part of our decarbonization strategy, we have enacted fossil fuel guidelines which have targeted restrictions and company expectations for companies with business models based on oil and gas as well as thermal coal. These guidelines apply to proprietary investment and Property-Casualty portfolios (see Allianz Statement on the Allianz company website on business models based on coal , oil and gas ).\n\nFor more information on our current state of progress, please see section 02.2.1 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Climate targets for our insurance business\n\nFor our insurance portfolio, we were one of the founding members of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA). Currently, we are working on the development of the targets and methodologies within NZIA. These methodologies are expected to be published in early 2023, after which Allianz and other members will set their first near-term targets.\n\n## Caring for our customers\n\nWe support our insurance customers so that they can reduce climaterelated risks by minimizing damage and insure low-carbon developments. This is particularly important as we see natural catastrophes increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change. Furthermore, we are piloting new approaches that combine insurance offerings with measures that strengthen their resilience. This includes incentivizing people to reduce risk and advise on opportunities.\n\nOn the insurance side, we invest in data and technology for understanding the different natural catastrophe perils that will affect the world. Many people still do not have any insurance, and we collaborate with our peers, governments, and civil society to help close the protection gap in more vulnerable parts of society. We also support scientific research and innovation that improves society's understanding of climate-related risks, for example through the InsuResilience initiative.\n\n## Enabling the low carbon transition\n\nWe strive to enable the journey to net-zero for our own operations, for our investees, and for our insurance customers. Our ambition is to be an insurance and investment partner for the net-zero transformation that different industries and customers need to make.\n\nOur business strategy aims to systematically enable a low-carbon and climate-resilient future. We focus on key sectors with high emissions and the need for transformation. The energy and transportation sectors are prime examples. We strategically invest in low-carbon assets and are insuring low-carbon technologies. Grounded in our belief in science-based decision making, we support partners, investees, and clients along the path to net-zero. In addition, we support transitioning to net-zero by investing in blended finance vehicles and climate positive solutions like forestry and hydrogen (for more on our approach towards financing the transition, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the",

Further, to achieve the net-zero target by 2030, we aim to reduce emissions by 70 % versus 2019.\n\nKey drivers will be sourcing 100 % renewable electricity by 2023, implementing energy-efficiency and reduction measures, shifting to a fully electric corporate car fleet by 2030 at the latest, and achieving a 40 % reduction of GHG emissions from travel activities by 2025 against a 2019 baseline. To address the remaining 30 % of the emissions, we will use high-quality carbon removal solutions. Beyond our own operations, we will ask 100 % of the global framework vendors in our supply chain that provide services globally to establish a public commitment to net-zero GHG emissions in line with a 1.5\u00b0C path by 2025.\n\nEmbedding sustainability in our buildings encompasses renewable energy and energy efficiency, as well as waste and water management, together with additional actions on areas such as food and infrastructure for green commuting and ensuring that the environmental management processes are in place.\n\nWe apply targeted environmental management system (EMS) and energy-efficiency processes based on ISO14001 and ISO50001 standards to improve environmental management governance practices at some of our major locations and entities. Mandatory requirements of such certification help strengthen our approach - for example, it is a requirement of ISO14001 to have a board-level sponsor for our EMS. At Allianz SE, this sponsor is our Chief Operations Officer. Entities such as Allianz France or Allianz Germany are already ISO14001 and/or ISO50001 certified. Our main locations also pursue certifications such as LEED, BREEAM, etc.\n\nThe scope of our environmental reporting includes all entities that, at the time of writing the reports, have been part of Allianz for at least a full reporting year. In 2022, we collected environmental data for entities corresponding to 95 % of our total employee base.\n\nIn 2022, we included GHG emissions from remote working to reflect the increased shift towards hybrid working. We also included emissions from our use of public cloud services following our IT strategy. For further details on scope and methodology, please refer to the 2022 explanatory notes on the Allianz company website .\n\nThis permits performance monitoring as well as the comparison and benchmarking of entities based on comparable system boundaries. GHG values reported refer to the sum of Scopes 1, 2, and 3, as defined in the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. GHG emissions considered under Scope 3 include business travel, paper use, and energy-related emissions such as transmission and distribution losses. Scope 2 emissions are calculated applying market-based factors.\n\nFor our approach on carbon credits, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website , section 02.6.\n\nTargets and achievements: environmental management of our operations\n\n| Topic                        | Board targets 2022                                                                     | Achievements 2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Targets 2023                                                                                     | Targets and commitments 2024 and  beyond                                                                                         |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GHG emissions per employee 1 | Reduce GHG emissions by 50 % per  employee by year-end 2025, against a  2019 baseline. | - Our carbon footprint per employee  was 1.0 tons (2021: 0.9).

        "page_content": "Our long-term approach as an investor and insurer is an opportunity to offer measures that can mitigate future risks and shape societies for generations, for example through pension systems, environmental and climate protection. As a global insurer, we uphold the principle of solidarity. Pooling risks is part of our core business model, and we have a keen interest in supporting stable communities. We have a role to play in enabling next generations and people with disabilities to overcome the economic and social impacts of the pandemic and other systematic social risks. For further insights into our concepts, see \"Our social approach' (in section 01.6) of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Responsible Tax\n\nThe taxes we pay are relevant contributions to the economic and social development of the countries in which we operate. Information on our Tax Strategy and our approach to taxes is provided through section 04.4 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website and the Tax Transparency Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Corporate Citizenship\n\nWe deliver social impact through our business, customers, employees, and corporate citizenship activities. Our Corporate Citizenship Strategy aligns with our company purpose 'We secure your future' - and ensures we deliver our responsibility towards society. Next generations and people with disabilities are our priority focus groups and we deliver corporate citizenship activities across our operating entities.\n\nAllianz has 12 foundations around the world which support universities and academia. We also provide emergency relief, with a high\n\nfocus on the Ukraine war in 2022. Our social activities align with our commitment to SDG 17, Partnerships for the goals. We actively participate in a wide range of initiatives, from global U.N.-backed initiatives to  collaborations  with  regional  non-governmental  organizations (NGOs) and local charities, see section 02.7 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\nOur Corporate Citizenship Strategy was concluded in 2021 and set targets for 2022 and beyond, along with guidance and criteria for activities under SDG 8, Decent work and economic growth. Leveraging our experience and partnerships in sports, we create programs that promote well-being, resilience and job-readiness for youth and people with disabilities. To support education efforts through our academic partnerships, we offer various scholarships, including those with ESMT and  MIB  Trieste.  We  use  the  Allianz  Social  Impact  Measurement Framework to support local entities in setting their ambitions and measuring and reporting on the impact of corporate citizenship activities locally.\n\nIn 2021, we launched a Social Impact Fund to replace the previous Social Innovation Fund. The fund is our key program which supports strategic opportunities to deliver social impact beyond charitable donations by focusing on creating measurable impact through intersectoral partnerships. In 2022, the fund provided resources for 15 local partnerships that focus on SDG 8. This year's funded programs cumulatively  expect  to  reach  over  700,000  youths  and  more  than 1,000 schools by 2024.\n\nFor more information on our Social Impact, please see section 02.7 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Objectives and actions: societal impact\n\n| Topic                            | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Progress and actions 2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate citizenship strategy   | Continue with the implementation of the new strategy and roll out of the  impact measurement framework.                                                                                                                    | Integrated Social Impact Measurement Framework into data collection  process to enhance input-output-outcome-impact (IOOI) reporting in support  of local entities setting their ambitions and measuring the impact of corporate  citizenship activities. |\n| Long-term global partnerships    | Continued review of our global partnership and development of a  partnership framework for local corporate citizenship activities to increase  the resilience and equal opportunities of children and young people.        | Global Partnership approach is under discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Corporate citizenship activities | - Continue to contribute to society through corporate giving and employee  volunteering in alignment with our strategy.  - Identify and launch activities that would be supported through the Allianz  Social Impact Fund. | Social Impact Fund supported 15 corporate citizenship programs led by  operating entities (OEs) in partnership with NGOs in delivery of social impact  locally in alignment with global strategy.                                                         |\n\n## Responsible consumer / sales\n\nOur strong reputation is built on the trust our customers, shareholders, employees,  and the general public place in our integrity. This trust hinges on the quality of our products, information, and advice, and on the personal conduct and capabilities of our sales employees and representatives.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct (CoC) is at the core of our corporate culture. The Code emphasizes that fairness towards customers and transparent communication about our products and services - including their limitations - maximizes our opportunity to earn the longstanding trust of customers. This is expressed through our Global Sales Compliance Framework program, which specifies standardized processes and controls for communication, monitoring and review, and is regularly updated to reflect regulatory developments.\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Sales Compliance aims to promote and protect the interests of our customers. It is designed to ensure transparency and the fair, honest, and responsible treatment of Allianz customers in their purchase of our financial products and their dealings with us. The Standard sets the foundation for a comprehensive customer protection framework designed to ensure all Allianz entities adhere to its prudential norms and robust protection. It covers five key areas to address conduct risk: Product Oversight and Governance, Incentives and Steering of Distributors, Standard of Distribution, Sales Force Selection and Training, and Monitoring and Reporting.\n\nWe use the globally recognized Net Promoter Score\u00ae (NPS) as our key metric for measuring customer loyalty through customers' willingness to recommend Allianz. In 2022, we switched to digital NPS tracking. Digital NPS allows us to measure customer loyalty continuously, eliminating  seasonality,  and  deepening  our  understanding  of",

Our Group ambition is to reach 50 % of loyalty leaders by 2024.\n\nOur Voice of the Customer program applies a holistic and standardized methodology to monitor and improve the customer experience by collecting real-time qualitative and quantitative feedback. After each touch point a customer has with Allianz, they are invited to state their satisfaction on a five-star scale at predefined touch points along five customer journeys. They map the main interactions a customer has with Allianz along the following journeys: Sales & Onboarding/uni003B Claims/uni003B Issue Resolution & Contract Management/uni003B Renewal, Cancelation & Termination/uni003B and Outbound Communication. If customers rate their experience with three stars or less, we follow up with them to resolve the issue directly and gather more insights.\n\nWe use insights from Voice of the Customer and NPS to improve our products, services, communications, and processes. We combine and analyze sources of customer data in strict accordance with applicable  privacy  laws to prioritize and implement structural improvements. Local operating entities use customer feedback to derive concrete  actions,  such  as  improving  proactively  informing  customers about the status of their claims.\n\nLearnings gained through Voice of the Customer and NPS programs are also helping us design the global Allianz experience for customers. In 2022, we rolled-out a set of global guidelines (Xperience\n\nHabits) in contact centers to ensure our customers are treated with appreciation, empathy,  and helpfulness. In addition, we launched two more initiatives to improve customer interactions and provide a consistent Allianz experience across markets. We created and distributed to our operating entities guidelines and digital communication templates on when and how to proactively inform customers about the status of their claims. We also launched the Annual Policy Review, as a service communication to engage with customers in their best interest.\n\nThe Allianz Customer Model (ACM) is our end-to-end global business model which puts the customer at the center of our business and enables Allianz to be simple, digital, and scalable. Our ambition is to simplify and harmonize our business globally, which involves transforming the whole value chain across products, sales, claims, and operations. Within this context, the ACM was  designed first for Retail Property and Casualty lines and then extended to Health, Life, B2B2C, MidCorp, Large Corporate, and Reinsurance. Our aim is to continuously roll out the model across Allianz operating entities.\n\nRather than selling individual insurance products, our vision is to evolve our products into full ecosystems and offer customers relevant and trusted solutions. In parallel, we are collaborating with the Allianz Customer Model to systematically analyze customer pain points and upgrade customer journeys at the Group level.\n\nFor more information on our approach to customer responsibility and compliance, please see section 02.5 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\nTargets and achievements: responsible consumer / sales\n\n| Topic                  | Board targets 2022    | Achievements 2022              | Targets 2023                                                                                                                                                                    | Targets and commitments 2024 and  beyond                     |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Global NPS performance | Digital NPS tracking. | Achieved 58 % Loyalty Leaders. | Our ambition for 2023 is to continue  working on the Allianz customer  experience so we improve our global  Loyalty Leaders performance and  meet the 2024 digital NPS targets. | Our Group ambition is to reach 50 %  Loyalty Leaders by 2024 |\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nThe following section describes the impact of cybersecurity  on our business  activities  and  relationships,  as  well  as  the  impact  of  the Allianz Group's activities and relationships with regard to IT topics. In addition, we describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts with a focus on information security, data privacy, and data ethics.\n\n## Information security\n\nInformation security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices,  and data from unauthorized access and against cyberattacks, and meeting related regulatory requirements. Our approach is closely monitored by a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) function and the Allianz Group Board of Management. An executive accountability regime supports the enforcement of the governance framework for all entities.\n\nThe Allianz  Information Security Governance  Framework comprises multiple layers of corporate rules and processes. An overall policy  establishes  core  principles,  roles,  and  responsibilities  and  the\n\norganizational framework Information Technology and Information Security within the Allianz Group.\n\nTo fulfill our commitment, cyber risk is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz and is closely managed along key risk indicators covering security maturity, risk exposure,  and security operations across the Allianz Group. Performance against these indicators is discussed, reviewed, and reported quarterly to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board. Monitoring for cyber incidents, and measures to prevent them from occurring, are implemented at a global level and supplemented locally where required, together with the local CISOs that exist in all Allianz operating entities.\n\nSpecific actions to improve security controls are continuously evaluated and developed with priorities assigned on a global, risk-based view that is informed by the current and expected threat landscape. Actions to achieve our cyber risk targets focus on five key risk areas: reducing the likelihood of incidents/uni003B increasing detection likelihood/uni003B reducing damage from incidents/uni003B streamlining compliance/uni003B and training/educating the organization to further improve security awareness.\n\nAll  employees  are  required  to  participate  in  cyber-awareness training at least quarterly. These include activities like simulated phishing  e-mails,  awareness  campaigns  or  regularly  offered  dedicated",

We  also  participate  in  industry  and global/regional initiatives to support the security of the overall internet ecosystem.\n\nFor more information on our commitment to information security, please see section 04.1.1 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Data privacy\n\nProtecting our customers' data and maintaining trust in our processes are top priorities. Our customers, employees, and other stakeholders expect us to treat their data with the utmost care and we take this responsibility  extremely  seriously.  We  are  committed  to  the  highest standards to protect customer privacy and we cooperate closely with other stakeholders involved in the update and modernization of European privacy legislation, including industry associations, members of parliament, and authorities. Our group-wide privacy program ensures compliance with all relevant data privacy laws and regulations. All data privacy matters are overseen by Group Data Privacy. Our 2022 focus was on furthering the automation of data privacy within our organization, enhancing the Privacy Monitoring and Assurance Program (PMAP), and continuing to embed privacy within the business through our network of privacy champions.\n\nThe Allianz Privacy Framework (APS) is our global standard for data privacy. It defines rules and principles for collecting and processing personal data, and includes a global standard for data privacy, a privacy impact assessment and risk management process, integration with information security standards and practices, and dedicated training programs for employees. Digital  Privacy  Guidelines provide guidance on privacy-related topics that affect digital projects, both for privacy by design as part of new-product and service design processes, and for privacy by default - this means that wherever individuals are given choices on the use and sharing of their personal data, default settings restrict the disclosure. In addition to the APS, our data protection  authority  has  approved  our Binding  Corporate  Rules (BCRs). These BCRs allow Allianz Group companies to lawfully transfer personal data from within the European Economic Area to other jurisdictions, where it is required for business purposes.\n\nOur employees play a critical role in upholding our commitment to  protect  personal  data.  To  ensure  they  have  the  knowledge  to properly use and safeguard personal data, all employees are required to complete annual privacy training which covers the Allianz Privacy Framework requirements in detail and ensures a solid foundational understanding of core privacy concepts and the proper handling of personal data. For Privacy Experts, five-day Privacy Expert Training is focused on providing Data Protection Professionals and Data Protection Officers with the practical knowledge to effectively conduct their day-to-day activities. For Privacy Champions, two-day Privacy Champion Training is focused on the practical knowledge and exercises of the  Privacy  Champion  role  to  ensure  data  protection  compliance within the business.\n\nAs part of our Privacy Risk Management , we identify and manage privacy risks at the operational process level to ensure they are measured, monitored, and mitigated across our core businesses. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) of processes that use personal data such as customer health data and employee data - enable the early identification of privacy risks and ensure they are managed appropriately.\n\nWe are also committed to ensuring that adequate and effective controls are in place to address privacy risks associated with the processing of personal data by external suppliers on behalf of Allianz. We have undertaken case-by-case Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs) for processes that transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to suppliers in third countries. In 2022, we designed a TIA template in our privacy management platform which will be rolled out to all our operating entities in the EEA to ensure such assessments are conducted in a consistent, semi-automated way.\n\nFor more information on our commitment to data privacy, please see section 04.1.2 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Data ethics\n\nOur aim is to maintain stakeholder trust and position Allianz  as a leader in conducting data-driven business in a trustworthy and ethical manner. This includes elevating data ethics and selected data and analytics-related  topics  in  the  governance  and  decision-making  processes of the Allianz Group.\n\nWe strive for a responsible use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in our business activities based on a strong AI Governance Framework . This includes ensuring a human-centric approach in our usage of AI systems: For each AI system, an appropriate level of human control must be determined according to the inherent risks of harm for individuals as part of a Privacy and Ethics Impact Assessment.\n\nEnsuring compliance with current and upcoming regulations and embedding best practices in anticipation of regulatory change are also high priorities in fulfilling our data ethics commitments.\n\nFollowing its establishment in 2021, the Data Advisory Board (DAB) has continued work to elevate and integrate data ethics into governance and decision-making, as well as supporting both the positioning of Allianz as a leading insurer and investor in the data ethics space and wider sustainability efforts. The DAB supported EU operating entities which are members of the Renewal Agenda Committee in their roll out of the Practical Guidance for AI by end of 2022.\n\nOther measures include Privacy and Ethics Impact Assessments to identify and address AI-specific risk through the determination of the appropriate level of human involvement and mandatory training for relevant employees who develop and/or use AI in applicable operating entities (OEs).\n\nFor more information on our commitment to data ethics, please see section 04.1.3 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .\n\n## Cyber risk\n\nWe are constantly evolving our solutions to enable customers to manage cyber threats. As an example, Allianz, (within its commercial Property and Casualty products) has eradicated around 98 % of silent cyber exposure, therefore providing clarity to customers on what is and isn't covered within the products. As an insurer, we combine policy and service  improvements  to  help  businesses  understand  the  need  to strengthen their controls. We continue to evolve cyber risk exposure coverage across P&C policies spanning commercial, corporate, and specialty insurance segments. The Cyber Underwriting Strategy addresses exposures to cyber risks and is reviewed regularly to ensure policies are updated and clarified in response to cyber risks.\n\nFor more information on cyber risk, please see section 04.1.4 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website .",

This is an expectation that is reflected by expanding legislation on human rights and is applied across our global operations. The following section describes how we handle human rights risks in our business activities and relationships. We also describe our activities and achievements related to the management of those risks. As we are a financial services provider, these activities mainly relate to insurance transactions, proprietary investments, and our operations. The topic of human rights is managed by Global Sustainability and is overseen by the Sustainability Board.\n\nWe aim to identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate adverse human rights impacts linked to our business activities and operations, including our supply chain. This is in line with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), which provide a framework for responsible business operations and activities. We are committed to respecting various human rights standards and Allianz SE has been a participant in the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) since 2002. We annually communicate our progress against these principles. Please refer to our latest UNGC annual communication on the Allianz company website .\n\nWe also apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an employer throughout our worldwide operations. We have integrated the 10 principles of the UNGC into our globally binding Allianz Group Code of Conduct and we respect the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We endorse the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including the International Labour Organization (ILO) declaration on the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. We are a supporter of the U.N. Women's Empowerment Principles and the B Team's Principles for Equality.\n\nTo manage our human rights risks, we look across each of our roles as an insurer and investor, as an employer, as a company including our supply chain, and as a corporate citizen. For each of these roles, we embed specific processes to manage human rights risks and act on opportunities to drive positive change.\n\nWe  published  our  Human  Rights  Approach  embedded  in  the Allianz Group  ESG  Integration  Framework in  2021.  The  document\n\nhighlights our human rights governance, most critical human rights risks, processes and measures in place to protect human rights, among others. We continue to apply ESG and Human Rights Guidelines for sensitive countries across all business lines and core processes dealing with insurance, investment, and procurement decisions.\n\nAs a corporate insurer and investor, our human rights due diligence process forms part of our overall sustainability approach, which is integrated into our broader risk management system. Our first Human Rights Impact Assessment was carried out in 2021 and based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP)'s methodology to identify gaps in our approach. In 2022, we continued to work on improvement points based on the findings of this assessment. For further information, please see our Summary Report - Human Rights Impact Assessment on the Allianz company website .\n\nThe Allianz Code of Conduct reflects our values and principles and gives our employees guidance in their actions and decisions, including actions to uphold human rights, such as treating people fairly and with respect. In 2022, we updated our Vendor Code of Conduct to ensure suppliers meet our human rights standards and regulatory expectations in line with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act ('Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz'). Specific areas of focus include discrimination in the workplace, child labor, and providing a safe working environment. We also created a Sustainability Charter to help our suppliers understand our supply chain strategy when it comes to sustainability and the expectations of being a partner of Allianz, now and in the future. Further details can be found in the Allianz Group Vendor Code of Conduct on the Allianz company website .\n\nHuman rights due diligence in our operations is a key part of our ESG referral and assessment process . We assess current and potential suppliers to ensure they abide by the ESG guidelines outlined in the Allianz  Vendor  Code of Conduct (VCoC), which is aligned with ILO standards, UNGP, and UNGC. For further details on the Allianz Group's referral process and our Human Rights Guideline, see the Allianz ESG Integration Framework on the Allianz company website .\n\nAllianz is also committed to compliance with the Modern Slavery Act in the U.K., both from the perspective of our U.K. business and the interactions of our wider Group. No issues were raised regarding human rights issues in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act in 2022, as reported in the Allianz Group Modern Slavery Statement on the Allianz company website .",

We describe the concepts, actions, and achievements in managing these impacts. All employee matters are managed by the Group HR function.\n\nDelivering our purpose 'We secure your future' starts with 159,253 1 employees who are part of our diverse and global workforce. Our purpose anchors our Group strategy, employee value proposition, brand promise and customer experience principles, and it drives our decisions and actions. We held our third global Purpose & Strategy Day in summer 2022 to engage our employees on our purpose.\n\nA diverse workforce enables us to understand and fulfill the needs of our equally diverse  customer base. Allianz  fosters a culture and working  environment  where  people  and  performance  matter,  and where everyone has a voice. We take a strong stance regarding employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and gender equality. We focus on managing talent, rewarding personal achievements, and promoting employee rights. The health, safety, and well-being as well as the  training  and  development  of  our  employees  is  of  utmost  importance.\n\n## Our new initiatives in 2022\n\n## Our response to the multi-crisis situation\n\nIn  2022,  the  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  war  in  Ukraine,  a prevailing energy crisis, and rising inflation constituted a multi-crisis situation associated with increased uncertainty. Our goal at Allianz is to ensure our employees' health and safety as a basis for sustainable economic  success.  Therefore,  Allianz  has  implemented  several initiatives in 2022, such as Q&A sessions to inform employees about the political and economic implications of the current situation, offers to strengthen  mental  health,  and  pulse  surveys  to  identify  issues regarding engagement and well-being. The feedback we received indicates that our employees were very satisfied with our response to the crisis situation.\n\n## 'Engagement Matters' Program\n\nWith  our  'Engagement  Matters'  Program,  introduced  in  2022,  we connect  local  and  global  engagement  opportunities  under  one umbrella across five pillars: 1) Health & Well-being, 2) Strategy & Top Management, 3) Jobs, Processes, Innovation & Change, 4) Learning & Development, 5) Recognition & Reward. As part of the program, we launched a central engagement hub and a digital magazine, which summarize opportunities and resources, such as listening sessions with board members, mindfulness moments and trainings, mental health\n\n1\\_Total employees (core and non-core business).\n\ntalks  and  podcasts,  learning  and  development  opportunities,  and benefits beyond pay.\n\n## Ways of Working\n\nAmidst the shifts in how we work and do business, we have established across Allianz our Ways of Working (WOW). Our WOW standards are centered across five categories: 1) Flexible work & Reduced travel, 2) Digital tools, 3) Health & Well-being, 4) Learning, 5) Organization & Culture. For instance, employees across the globe have the opportunity to spend a minimum of 40 % of their working hours working from home (depending on the position, e.g., mobile worker, office worker, etc.) and the opportunity to work up to 25 days a year abroad in accordance with local regulations. In 2022, we focused especially on the implementation  of  a  flexible  hybrid  work  environment.  It  is  our conviction that hybrid is here to stay and is therefore central to the Allianz WOW. In the course of implementing hybrid working we, for example,  carried  out  test  pilots  and  offered  special  learning opportunities for our employees. Further, we rolled out a user-friendly and newly developed tool enabling employees to check compliance of their cross-border remote work requests quickly and automatically.\n\n## Business as usual\n\n## Allianz Engagement Survey\n\nThe annual Allianz Engagement Survey (AES) is our formal employee platform for gathering employee feedback and promoting a high performance culture. The results of the AES are directly linked to the performance targets for the Group's Board of Management. This year, two of the three main indices reached record highs in Allianz Group history and the third remained stable at the second highest level.\n\nOne part of the AES is the Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX). It measures our progress in building a culture where both people and performance matter, as we seek to enable employees to unlock their full potential. The IMIX score comprises 10 AES questions covering the areas of leadership, performance, and corporate culture.\n\n## Targets and achievements: employee matters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Topic                                | Board targets  2022   | Achievements  2022   | Targets 2023   | Targets and  commitments  2024 and beyond   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Inclusive  Meritocracy  Index (IMIX) | 75 % plus             | 79 % (2021:  78 %)   | 75 % plus      | 75 % plus                                   |\n\n## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nWe believe in creating an inclusive workplace with equal opportunities for all and shaping a diverse workforce.",

It oversees the implementation of our D&I strategy built around three pillars: Employees, Customers, and Stakeholder Trust.\n\nWe take a strong stance to increase the diversity of our leadership and management, and our targets and ambitions for December 2024 extend beyond gender representation to cover the dimensions of disability inclusion, nationality and ethnicity, generations, and LGBTQ+.\n\nWe engage with our employees through inclusion networks to raise awareness, support employees, advocate for change, and help shape the  DE&I  agenda.  These  networks  bring  together  colleagues  who share an identity or experience and their friends and allies. Five global employee networks are in place with 18 new locally operating networks added in 2022:\n\n- -Allianz NEO - gender inclusion,\n- -Allianz Beyond - disability inclusion,\n- -Allianz GRACE - ethnicity and cultural inclusion,\n- -Allianz Engage - generations inclusion,\n- -Allianz Pride - LGBTQ+ inclusion.\n\nOur ambition for equity and fairness also includes ensuring equal pay for equal work in the same or comparable roles for all genders. As part of our commitment to promote transparent and comparable reporting, we have adopted the World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics on pay equality. We have an annual global Equal Pay review to monitor equal pay across the organization and prevent any Equal Pay gaps from arising in the future. The Allianz insurance business segment and several global lines are EDGE (Economic Dividends for Gender Equality) Assess certified. The certification covers 76 % of the Allianz Group's global headcount and is valid until yearend 2023.\n\nFor more information, please see section 02.4.3 of our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz company website . Furthermore, we have created an Allianz website , which deals specifically with DE&I topics.\n\n## Strategic workforce planning\n\nThe purpose behind our strategic workforce planning initiative is to understand what the transition to a digital future means for Allianz and its people, and how we can equip our workforce with the skills they need for the future. This initiative is closely linked to our Allianz Group Strategy and the Allianz  Customer Model. Our strategic workforce planning approach compares workforce supply by job profile against projected workforce demand over the next five years. It is a structured annual process that is integrated into the annual planning. As a result, we are able to steer the skills that we need in our workforce in order to drive our business strategy via, for instance, targeted and strategic recruiting  measures  and  major  re-  and  upskilling  initiatives.  We consider digital, data, and agile working skills, as well as leadership and functional skills, to be as key for the future.\n\n## Learning and development\n\nLearning and development is a key differentiator also in the financial services industry. We focus on promoting lifelong learning through our global #learn initiative, and offer our employees one hour each week dedicated to learning. We employ a wide range of learning and development  approaches,  including  on-the-job  learning,  mentoring  and coaching, classroom training, peer circles, and digital/mobile learning. Digital  opportunities  such  as  LinkedIn  Learning  and  our  AllianzU Learning  Platform  (Degreed)  are  available  to  all  employees worldwide. We have targeted programs for key areas, such as property and casualty, life and health, IT, strategy, finance, communications, market management, and operations.\n\n#lead Ignite is our global program designed to equip the next generation of Allianz leaders with the knowledge, mindset, and skills needed to lead in Allianz's inclusive, meritocratic environment. #lead Transform is a program newly introduced in 2022. It is created for our future and recently appointed top executives and aims to develop the leadership skills and mindsets required to lead in a global, complex, and ever-changing environment. #sheleads ran for the second year in its  new  design  in  2022.  It  is  recognized  as  setting  a  standard  for effective gender balance via sponsorship, peer coaching, and learning sessions with our alumni community. Our Allianz Leadership Passport is the 'license' to be a people leader at Allianz. The program aims to set a minimum standard for all people leaders with an equal focus on hard and soft skills, in order to ensure the balance between the IQ (intelligence quotient) and EQ (emotional quotient) of our leaders. 2022 was  the  year  of  the  refresh,  i.e.,  after  attaining  their  Leadership Passport, leaders had to complete 45 hours of learning per year to 'refresh' their passport.\n\nIn addition, our Active Human Capital Management ensures that we have and grow outstanding leaders - leaders who not only have a proven track record in business, but also the ability to engage their organization and develop top talent. With this approach, we promote a broad professional background and mobility across all businesses and countries, and strive for inclusion and diversity in our top leadership.\n\n## Employee health and well-being\n\nOur goal is to maintain and improve employee health and well-being across our global workforce. Our global Allianz Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Policy gives strategic guidance on health and wellbeing standards and premises which are implemented by local operating entities, including risk, and hazards assessments, dedicated action plans to manage risks and emergency actions. Based on this policy, we also provide a consistent Health in Action Framework with the following minimum requirements for all Allianz entities :\n\n- 1. Access to professional psychological support for all employees worldwide,\n- 2. Training people leaders to maintain health and well-being in their teams,\n- 3. Touch points to collect employee feedback on their health and well-being,\n- 4. Meeting Free Calendar Days @Allianz.\n\nWe also continue to monitor the developments related to COVID-19 and its impact on our people.",

In 2022, the following health and well-being initiatives were, among others, additionally launched: The Allianz Health Talks series - a monthly webinar series to inform our employees about different health and well-being topics, and the meeting etiquette rule to shorten meeting times by five minutes and, therefore, to ensure short breaks in between meetings.\n\n## Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\n\nThis section describes the impact of ethics, responsible business, and compliance matters on the Allianz Group's activities. Further, it describes the impact of the Allianz Group's activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption, and bribery matters. All compliance matters are overseen by the Group Compliance team.\n\nOur Compliance Management System helps ensure compliance with internationally recognized laws, rules and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive stance, working with organizations such as the German Institute for Compliance and the Global Insurance Chief Compliance Officers Forum to enhance our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\n\nCompliance risk is part of the operational risk category, as laid down in the Allianz Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS). OEs in scope of IRCS are defined by Group Risk. They are required to conduct an annual compliance risk assessment based on Group-defined risk scenarios. Together with the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE), they form the annual cycle of our integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities .\n\nIn 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE) program was initiated. In 2022, the Compliance Function continued to evolve the way it assesses Group and local Compliance departments. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope, assure adequate skills to ensure complete and effective scope coverage,  and confirm compliance with global programs in addition to local specificities. While CARE is primarily a self-assessment exercise, it is reinforced with compliance reviews of operating entities, completed and coordinated by Group Compliance. Compliance reviews are completed on a risk-based, five-yearly cycle. Starting 2023, this review cycle will be reduced to a three-year cycle\n\nCompliance  Reviews  are  supplemented  by  Targeted  Reviews. These assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual programs such as Antitrust, Sales Compliance, etc. The benefit of this multi/uni2011faceted  review  and  confirmation  strategy  is  that  operating\n\nentities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities. Additionally, the frequent interactions with operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide and, if necessary, enforce remedial activities. An additional benefit is the ability to learn from local and Group best practices, further bolstering our overall Compliance Culture.\n\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview of issues detected in the course of the above activities. It requires reporting on mitigating activities as well as on follow-up procedures, including a review of actions undertaken and documented in the tool.\n\nThe gathered information provides the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the Allianz SE Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee, chaired by Group Compliance, reviews all activities and issues related to misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.\n\nAs part of our global compliance program, we follow international standards and applicable laws related to corruption and bribery, money laundering and terrorism financing, trade and financial sanctions, capital markets, data privacy, customer protection, antitrust, and other relevant compliance risk areas. We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianzspecific rules.\n\nThe Allianz Group CoC outlines the basic principles and values that guide the everyday decisions and conduct of all employees. As part of a project led by Group Compliance, the CoC was fundamentally renewed in 2020 and approved by the Board of Management. The new CoC has since then been rolled out across the Group, along with training for operating entities to raise awareness about the principles established by the CoC, namely mutual respect, integrity, transparency, and responsibility.\n\nOur target is zero fraud and corruption across our business and our principle is zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption. We consider fraud and corruption as a serious offence. The aforementioned principle is of absolute and of a primary nature. It applies regardless of whether Allianz itself or any other internal party (such as an employee, tied agent, intermediary and/or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz) benefits from the fraud. Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption. This principle expresses Allianz's stance towards the abuse of a position of power for an improper personal advantage (corruption) or when a corrupt offer, solicitation or promise is made to obtain an improper personal or business advantage (bribery). Employees are strictly prohibited from directly or indirectly offering, requesting, accepting, providing, paying, soliciting, promising, authorizing or receiving 'Anything of Value' (defined broadly to include anything - monetary or non-monetary - that provides a benefit of any kind) to or from any public official or anyone in the private sector, in order to obtain or retain business or an improper personal or business advantage.\n\nAnti-corruption  training  must  be  provided  at  least  once  every three years to all employees.",

The regulation came into effect last year and Allianz is reporting the eligibility (described subsequently) for the second time.\n\nEU Taxonomy recognizes as ''green'', or 'environmentally sustainable' economic activities that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the EU's climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of these objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards. It is a transparency tool that will introduce mandatory disclosure obligations on some undertakings (namely, the ones in scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) prospectively) for financial market participants. The disclosure of the proportion of taxonomy-aligned activities will allow for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios. In addition, it can guide market participants in their investment decisions. However, the EU Taxonomy is not a mandatory list of economic activities for investors to invest in. Nor does it set mandatory requirements on  environmental performance for companies or for financial products. Investors are free to choose what to invest in.\n\nEconomic activities that are not recognized by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the EU's climate and  environmental  objectives  are  not  necessarily  environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that could generally make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are already part of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Rather, the first Delegated Act (namely, the Climate Delegated Act) under the EU taxonomy sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant  for  achieving  climate  neutrality  and  delivering  on  climate change objectives. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings.\n\nAt this stage, the regulation has only established ''Technical Screening Criteria'' for (a) climate change mitigation and (b) climate change adaptation, which are laid out in the Climate Delegated Act. Criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives will follow in a future Delegated Act, in line with the mandates outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn addition, extensions of the Taxonomy Regulation with view to (a) economic activities that do not have a significant impact on environmental sustainability and economic activities that significantly harm environmental sustainability, as well as (b) regarding other sustainability objectives, such as social objectives, may follow at a later stage.\n\nFurthermore, the Disclosures Delegated Act requires the EU Commission to review the application of this regulation by 30 June 2024, and to assess in particular the need for any further amendments with regard to the inclusion of (a) exposures to central governments and central banks in the numerator and denominator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings, and (b) exposures to undertakings that do not publish a non-financial statement pursuant to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU in the numerator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings.\n\nOverall, this means that the Taxonomy Regulation will evolve further over coming years, translating into an extension of the expected screening and reporting scope alongside various dimensions.\n\nFor a transitional period of two years, a simplified approach applies for the financial sector. In this context, only eligibility has to be reported. This means that we only report on (investments into) economic activities which are in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation, i.e., described in the Climate Delegated Act/uni003B irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down therein.\n\nThus, taxonomy 'eligibility' of an economic activity implies that respective Technical Screening Criteria are available and the activity could generally make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives of the taxonomy. Whether an activity is taxonomyeligible, or not, provides no indication about how green or environmentally sustainable that activity is. This will only be possible with the future alignment KPI.\n\nTaxonomy 'alignment' of an activity goes beyond taxonomy eligibility. It implies that an activity complies with the requirements defined specifically for this particular activity in the Technical Screening Criteria of the taxonomy. For example, to be 'taxonomy-aligned' under the current taxonomy, an activity has to fulfill the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a substantial contribution to the climate objectives as outlined in the Climate Delegated Act. For example, for an activity to be considered 'taxonomy-aligned' it must meet the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a significant contribution to the climate objectives set out in the delegated act on climate. In addition, the criterion of 'do no significant harm' and minimum social safeguards must be met. Allianz is reporting  taxonomy eligibility for the second year. Taxonomy alignment will be reported from the financial year 2023 onwards.",

        "page_content": "The Disclosures Delegated Act specifies the disclosure obligations under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn order to ensure comparability of the taxonomy information with the Group's financial disclosure, we report for each of our material financial activities. Consequently, the Allianz Group will report on the following activities:\n\n- -non-life insurance,\n- -proprietary investments, and\n- -third-party investments.\n\nNon-life  insurance  (and  thereof  eight  Solvency II  Lines  of  Business (LoBs)) is one economic activity in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation ('taxonomy-eligible'), as it is generally deemed as able to have a positive enabling function with a view to climate change adaptation.\n\nIn the non-life insurance business, the Allianz Group is active in all the eight LoBs that can generally be considered as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation/uni003B the same applies for the Allianz Group's reinsurance business accepted from external counterparties. Namely reinsurance business of eligible insurance activities can be considered as taxonomy-eligible. The extent to which individual contracts include protection against climate-related perils (e.g., flood events or hail storms) depends on the individual demand and the requirements of the customer's typical situation or unique risk exposure. Risk analysis and product advice is an integral part of our sales process and we are pursuing the objective to close insurance coverage gaps as far as possible.\n\nWe integrate climate protection into our core business and we embed the management of risks and opportunities resulting from climate change in our overall business strategy. Measures include developing and adjusting financial products and services, updating policies and processes, setting targets and limits, managing our operational climate footprint, and engaging with internal and external stakeholders. As a treaty reinsurer of external clients, we consider the climaterelated strategies of these insurance companies as part of our underwriting process in order to live up to our decarbonization commitments.\n\nThe information about taxonomy eligibility in our underwriting portfolio is an indication of the scope of our activities that can generally be assessed against the specific technical screening criteria for taxonomy-alignment applying to (re-)insurers, and therefore have the potential to provide a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation. A LoB must contain at least one policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils to be considered as taxonomy-eligible. On the one hand, the Allianz Group offers policies in the LoBs of 'other motor insurance', 'marine, aviation and transport insurance' and 'fire and damage to property insurance', where protection against climate perils is explicitly included. On the other hand, the Allianz Group offers policies that are based on a general protection approach, thus covering all risks, including (yet, not explicitly referring to) climate perils in the five remaining LoBs 'medical expense insurance', 'income protection insurance', 'workers' compensation insurance', 'motor vehicle liability insurance', and 'assistance'. Allianz generally considers both types of LoBs as eligible under the\n\nTaxonomy Regulation, as they all comprise policies that cover against climate perils. The most material eligible LoBs, in terms of gross written premiums, are 'fire and other damage to property insurance', 'other motor insurance' and 'motor vehicle liability insurance'.\n\n## EU Taxonomy: Eligibility in underwriting based on GWP 1\n\n|                                                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Non-life insurance and reinsurance eligible     | 76.65% | 78.74% |\n| Non-life insurance and reinsurance non-eligible | 23.35% | 21.26% |\n| Insurance eligible                              | 76.54% | 78.72% |\n| Insurance non-eligible                          | 23.46% | 21.28% |\n| Reinsurance eligible                            | 81.45% | 80.06% |\n| Reinsurance non-eligible                        | 18.55% | 19.94% |\n| 1\\_Based on non-consolidated LoB reporting.      |        |        |\n\nTaxonomy eligibility does not give an indication of the degree to which the Allianz Group's non-life insurance activities can be considered as taxonomy-aligned, but reflects the structure of the Allianz Group's underlying business and future screening scope with respect to a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation at a broad level.\n\nFor investments, the Taxonomy Regulation currently limits the scope of which investments and non-financial investments,  including real  estate, that could generally be considered as 'taxonomy-eligible' to exposures to undertakings that are obliged to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU. This means that for taxonomy reporting as an investor, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe eligibility share includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that may have underlying NFRD investments. In addition, mortgages and real estate held for investment are considered 100 % eligible and are included in the reported figures. In addition, Allianz considers investments in real estate funds (with non-controlling interest) to be eligible. However, for such investments we do not expect to be able to acquire the necessary information to assess their taxonomy-alignment, hence we expect to report them as non-aligned due to lack of data.\n\nAdditionally,  several  asset  classes,  which  are  material  for  the Allianz Group,  cannot  be  considered  taxonomy-eligible  as  of  now, such as sovereign bonds or non-EEA investments (except for own investments, for example in real estate and mortgages). This applies for both proprietary and third-party assets.\n\nThe Allianz Group uses Moody's Analytics to source listed asset eligibility data, and uses only reported data (no estimated data is used). For single listed asset products, Allianz employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at an issuer level. If reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent level data is sourced. And in case that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data of the ultimate entity. Taxonomy eligibility is considered only for NFRD companies that publish reported data.",

        "page_content": "The taxonomy eligibility share for the Allianz Group's proprietary investments  is  based  on  listed  equities  and  corporate  bonds  from NFRD companies, where reported data is available. In addition, we assessed controlled listed or unlisted assets and debt instruments that are held by our (internal) asset managers, or other subsidiaries (e.g., real estate investments or mortgages) and where Allianz has control under IFRS.\n\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies for investment funds and unit-linked products. However, such reporting for the financial year of 2022 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer level (see more detail in the 'Limitations of reported numbers' section).\n\nIn order to provide transparency about the sustainability of our portfolio beyond what the taxonomy KPIs currently allow, we disclose additional voluntary information on the sustainability of our proprietary investments portfolio at Group-level, based on the definition of 'Sustainable Investments' as per the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). For more information, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2022 on the Allianz  company website , section 02.2.1.6.\n\nWith regard to third-party assets, the taxonomy eligibility share is based on listed equities and corporate bonds from NFRD companies, where reported data is available. In addition, the mortgages portfolio was assessed as eligible. A look-through for fund investments was applied on a limited basis, where data was available. The table below provides insights into the respective asset classes, where the exposure to  undertakings,  which  are  obliged  to  publish  non-financial  information pursuant to Article 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, represents the part for which a screening for taxonomy eligibility based on data reported by investees can take place going forward.\n\nThe main eligibility KPIs for 2022 include eligibility based on turnover, and eligibility based on CAPEX (new for 2022). Each KPI is determined using only reported data for the investee. If, for example, Allianz has an investment in a company with a turnover eligibility of 10 %, and the book value of the investment is 100, Allianz would report a turnover eligibility balance of 10. And if Allianz  has a coverage ratio of 200 (see EU Taxonomy template for row reference), then the final eligibility share based on turnover would be 10/200, or 5 %. The total eligibility based on turnover additionally includes eligibility shares from mortgages and real estate held for investment. The total eligibility KPI based on CAPEX is determined in the same way.\n\nFor 2022, Allianz has followed the disclosure guidance for insurer investment KPIs under Annex IX/X. The main changes to the EU Taxonomy disclosure for 2022 were:\n\n- -the introduction of eligibility based on CAPEX KPI/uni003B\n- -the use of reported data for our listed asset portfolio/uni003B\n- -limited fund look-through capability (versus no look-through capability for 2021 reporting).\n\nFurthermore, the extension of scope of eligible activities via the complementary delegated act (CDA) for certain nuclear and gas activities was assessed for Allianz's own portfolio. As for the CDA applicability to third party investments, since the CDA was invoked from 2022, the reported figures are generally from the reporting year 2021 when nuclear and gas activities were non-eligible. Hence, Allianz assessments relate to own non-financial assets or looked-through to non-financial assets. The result of this assessment was no eligibility could be attained for the Allianz Group.\n\nTaxonomy eligibility does not assess alignment of the Allianz Group's underwriting or investment activities, i.e., it does not serve as a proxy of how sustainable our activities are. Numbers reported in the table below and in the section 'Underwriting' above describe the structure of the Allianz Group's non-life insurance and investment portfolio and define the scope of future taxonomy alignment assessment applying Taxonomy Regulation as of the balance sheet date.\n\nNon-eligibility rows in the EU Taxonomy disclosure include the portion of non-eligibility based on the difference between the eligibility share that Moody's Analytics provides for listed assets and 100 percent. The non-eligibility share is not explicitly reported by Moody's Analytics.\n\nFor Investment funds, Allianz uses a fund look-through approach where possible to report fund eligibility, leveraging data in the Tripartite  Template (TPT). However, look-through coverage of companies was limited for 2022 due to limited adoption of the TPT, and inability to obtain underlying investment eligibility. In addition, the aforementioned data hierarchy approach is suppressed for investment funds: if investment level look-through data is not available, eligibility is assumed to be zero. This is a conservative approach designed to mitigate the risk of reporting eligibility figures that may not be representative of the underlying investments. Going forward, Allianz aims to expand its look-through capability for investment funds.\n\nUnder regulation (EU) 2020/852, our business strategy, product design processes,  and engagement  with clients and counterparties concept is not yet integrated into our business activities, as it is still evolving and can only be seriously considered when we have established alignment reporting.",

Thirdparty assets consider net derivative balances in the fund, consistent with external reporting.\n- 4\\_Unit-linked products are on balance sheet and not applicable for the third-party investment section. Where underlying look-through data is available for funds and unit-linked products, data is captured in eligibility and non-eligibility KPI sections.\n- 5\\_Listed asset eligibility is based on reported data (not estimated or derived), on the latest reporting date. For funds, if look-through data was not available, it is assumed fund eligibility is zero (100 % non-eligible).",

Business-related divisions reflect our business segments  Property-Casualty,  Life/Health,  Asset  Management,  and Corporate and Other. In 2022, they were overseen by six board members. The following divisions focus on Group functions and come with business-related responsibilities: Chairman of the Board of Management/uni003B Finance, Controlling and Risk/uni003B Investment Management/uni003B Operations and IT/uni003B Human Resources, Legal, Compliance and M&A/uni003B and Business Transformation 1 .\n\nFor further information on Board of Management members and their responsibilities, please refer to Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management.\n\nFor Allianz SE the same key performance indicators and target values as for the Allianz Group apply. In particular the key financial performance indicators are based on IFRS.\n\nThe Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business segments via an integrated management and control process. It begins with the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which are discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating entities. Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare three-year plans, which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan also forms the basis for our capital management. The Supervisory Board approves the plan and sets corresponding targets for the Board of Management. The performance-based remuneration of the Board of Management is linked to short-term and long-term targets to ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For further details about our remuneration structure, including target setting and performance assessment, please refer to the Remuneration Report.\n\nWe continuously monitor our business performance against these targets through monthly reviews - which cover key operational and financial metrics - to ensure we can move quickly and take appropriate measures in the event of negative developments. The Allianz Group uses operating profit and net income as key financial performance indicators across all its business segments. Other indicators include segment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio for Property-Casualty, return on equity 2 and new business margins for Life/Health, and the cost-income ratio for Asset Management.\n\nBesides performance steering, we also have a risk-steering process in place, which is described in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nNon-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to assess the organizational health of Allianz and are reflected in the annual bonus of the Board of Management. This includes sustainability targets on customer loyalty, employee engagement, and environmental indicators. For further information on non-financial KPIs, as well as an overview of the development and expected development of these nonfinancial KPIs, please refer to the Non-Financial Statement.\n\nFor an overview of the development and expected development of the most important financial KPIs, please refer to the Outlook 2023 of the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2022.\n\n## Branches\n\nIn 2022, Allianz SE operated its business from Munich and from branch offices  in  Rome  (Italy),  Casablanca  (Morocco),  Singapore,  Labuan (Malaysia), Wallisellen (Switzerland), Vienna (Austria),  and  Dublin (Ireland).\n\n## Takeover-related Statements and Explanations\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to \u00a7 289a of the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB') and \u00a7 176 (1) of the German Stock Company Act ('Aktiengesetz - AktG').\n\nAs  of  31 December 2022,  the  share  capital  of  Allianz SE  was \u20ac 1,169,920,000. It was divided into 403,313,996 registered and fully paid-up shares with no par value. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. Each no-par value share carries one vote.\n\nShares may only be transferred with the consent of the company. An approval duly applied for may only be withheld if it is deemed necessary in the company's interest on exceptional grounds. The applicant will be informed of the reasons.\n\nShares acquired by employees of the Allianz Group as part of the employee stock purchase plan are generally subject to a three-year lock-up  period.  During  the  lock-up  period,  employees  can  exercise their voting rights.",

        "page_content": "Allianz SE is not aware of any direct or indirect interests in the share capital that exceed 10 % of the voting rights.\n\nThere are no shares with special rights conferring powers of control.\n\nThe appointment and removal of members of Allianz SE's Board of Management is governed by Articles 9 (1), 39 (2) and 46 of the SE Regulation, \u00a7\u00a7 84, 85 AktG, \u00a7 24 (3) and \u00a7 47 No. 1 German Insurance Supervision Act ('Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz - VAG'), and the Statutes. According to the Statutes, the Board of Management shall consist of at least two persons/uni003B  the  Supervisory Board determines the number of any additional members (\u00a7 5 (1) of the Statutes). The members of the Board of Management are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a term of up to five years/uni003B reappointment is permitted for a maximum of five years in each case (\u00a7 5 (3) of the Statutes). A simple majority of the votes cast in the Supervisory Board is required to appoint members of the Board of Management. In the case of a tie vote, the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who pursuant to Article 42 of the SE Regulation must be a shareholder representative, shall have the casting vote (\u00a7 8 (3) of the Statutes). If the Chairperson does not participate in the vote, the Vice Chairperson shall have the casting vote, provided he or she is a shareholder representative. A Vice Chairperson who is an employee representative has no casting vote (\u00a7 8 (3) of the Statutes).\n\nAmendments to the Statutes are governed by Article 59 SE Regulation,  \u00a7 179 AktG,  and  the  Statutes.  \u00a7 13 (4)  of  the  Statutes  of Allianz SE  stipulates  that,  unless  mandatory  law  requires  otherwise, changes to the Statutes require a two-thirds majority of the votes cast at a General Meeting or, if at least one half of the share capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a majority in capital for a shareholder resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented at the General Meeting is sufficient, provided this is in line with legal requirements. The Supervisory Board may alter the wording of the Statutes (\u00a7 179 (1) AktG and \u00a7 10 of the Statutes).\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized to issue shares as well as to acquire and use treasury shares as follows:\n\nIt may increase the company's share capital on or before 3 May 2027, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by issuing new registered no-par value shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind, on one or more occasions:\n\n- -Up to a total of \u20ac 467,968,000 (Authorized Capital 2022/I): In case of a capital increase against cash contribution, the Board of Management  may  exclude  the  shareholders'  subscription  rights  for these shares with the consent of the Supervisory Board (i) for fractional amounts, (ii) in order to safeguard the rights pertaining to holders  of  convertible  bonds  or  bonds  with  warrants,  including\n\n- mandatory convertible bonds, and (iii) in the event of a capital increase of up to 10 %, if the issue price of the new shares is not significantly  below  the  stock  market  price.  The  Board  of  Management  may  furthermore  exclude  the  shareholders'  subscription rights with the consent of the Supervisory Board in the event of a capital increase against contributions in kind.\n- -Up  to  a  total  of  \u20ac 15,000,000 (Authorized  Capital  2022/II):  The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded. New shares may only be issued to employees of Allianz SE and its Group companies.\n\nThe  company's  share  capital  is  conditionally  increased  by  up  to \u20ac 116,992,000 (Conditional Capital 2022). This conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent that the holders of convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, convertible participation rights, participation  rights,  and  subordinated  financial  instruments  issued against cash by Allianz SE or its subsidiaries, based on the authorizations granted by the General Meeting on 4 May 2022, exercise their conversion or option rights, or to the extent that conversion obligations from such bonds are fulfilled, and to such extent that treasury shares or shares from authorized capital are not used for such purpose.\n\nUnder an authorization by the General Meeting on 4 May 2022, the Board of Management may, until 3 May 2025, buy back Allianz shares corresponding to up to 10 % of the lower of (i) the share capital at the moment of the shareholder resolution and (ii) the share capital at the moment of the buy-back, and to use those shares for other purposes (\u00a7 71 (1) No. 8 AktG). Together with other treasury shares that are held by Allianz SE, or which are attributable to it under \u00a7\u00a7 71a et seq. AktG, such shares may not exceed 10 % of the share capital at any time. The shares acquired pursuant to this authorization may be used, under exclusion of the shareholders' subscription rights, for any legally admissible purposes, in particular those specified in the authorization. Furthermore, the acquisition of treasury shares under this authorization may also be carried out using derivatives, provided such derivatives do not relate to more than 5 % of the share capital.\n\nThe following essential agreements of the company are subject to a change-of-control condition following a takeover bid:\n\n- -Our  reinsurance  contracts,  in  principle,  include  a  clause  under which both parties to the contract have an extraordinary termination right if and when the counterparty merges with another entity or  its  ownership  or  control  situation  changes  materially.  Agreements  with  brokers  regarding  services  connected  with  the  purchase of reinsurance cover also provide for termination rights in case of a change of control. Such clauses are standard market practice.\n- -Allianz SE  is  also  party  to  various  bancassurance  distribution agreements for insurance products in various regions. These distribution agreements normally include a clause under which the parties  have  an  extraordinary  termination  right  in  the  event  of  a change of control of the other party's ultimate holding company.",

        "page_content": "- -Shareholder agreements and joint ventures to which Allianz SE is a party often contain change-of-control clauses that provide, as the case may be, for the termination of the agreement, or for put or call rights that one party can exercise with regard to the joint venture or the target company, if there is a change of control of the other party.\n- -The framework agreements between Allianz SE and the subsidiaries of various car manufacturers relating to the distribution of car insurance by the respective car manufacturers each include a clause under which each party has an extraordinary termination right in case there is a change of control of the other party.\n- -Bilateral credit agreements in some cases provide for termination rights in the event of a change of control, mostly defined as the acquisition of at least 30 % of the voting rights within the meaning of \u00a7 29 (2) of the German Takeover Act ('Wertpapiererwerbs- und \u00dcbernahmegesetz - Wp\u00dcG'). Where such termination rights are exercised, the respective credit lines have to be replaced by new credit lines under conditions then applicable.\n\n-\n\n- Under the Allianz Equity Incentive Program, Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) - i.e., virtual Allianz shares - are granted to senior management of the Allianz Group worldwide as a stock-based remuneration component. The conditions for these RSUs contain change-ofcontrol clauses, which apply when a majority of the voting share capital in Allianz SE is directly or indirectly acquired by one or more third parties who do not belong to the Allianz Group, and which provide for an exception from the usual vesting and exercise periods. In line with the relevant general conditions, the company will release the RSUs to plan participants on the day of the change of control, without observing any vesting period that would otherwise apply. The cash amount payable per RSU must equal or exceed the average market value of the Allianz share and the price offered per Allianz share in a preceding tender offer. By providing for  the  non-application  of  the  vesting  period  in  the  event  of  a change of control, the terms take into account the fact that the conditions influencing the share price are substantially different when there is a change of control.",

They are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of generally three to five years. In case of a permanent impairment, an unscheduled write-down is recognized. Based on the capitalization option in accordance with \u00a7 248 (2) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code, the internally generated intangible assets are capitalized.\n\nThese items are recorded at acquisition or construction cost less depreciation in accordance with \u00a7 253 (1) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 341b (1) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code. Depreciation is measured mainly using a straightline method according to ordinary useful life. The useful life of newly acquired properties is based on the remaining useful life in the purchase report. For all other assets, we use tax depreciation tables. In case of a permanent impairment, the values of these items are adjusted through unscheduled write-downs.\n\n## Shares in affiliated enterprises and participations\n\nThese  are  recorded  at  cost  less  impairments,  in  accordance  with \u00a7 341b (1)  of  the  German  Commercial  Code  in  conjunction  with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code.\n\nImpairments are measured either as the difference between the acquisition cost and the respective value, in accordance with IDW RS HFA 10 in conjunction with IDW S1, or as the difference between the acquisition cost and the lower share price as of 31 December 2022, or in some cases as the difference between the acquisition cost and the net asset value.\n\nWherever the market value on the balance sheet date is higher than the previous year's valuation, the value is written up to no more than the historical acquisition cost.\n\n## Loans in affiliated enterprises and participations\n\nThese items are normally recorded at cost less impairments, in accordance with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code. However, when converting foreign currency loans into euro at the reporting date, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\n## Stocks, interests in funds, debt securities and other fixed and variable income securities, miscellaneous investments\n\nThese items are generally valued in accordance with \u00a7 341b (2) of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 253 (1), (4), and (5) of the German Commercial Code, using either the acquisition cost or the stock exchange or market value on the balance sheet date, whichever is lower. We calculate the acquisition cost by averaging the different acquisition costs for securities of the same type.\n\n## Registered bonds, debentures, and loans\n\nThese items are recorded at cost less impairments in accordance with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code. In accordance with \u00a7 341c of the German Commercial Code, amortized cost accounting is applied and the difference between acquisition cost and the redemption amount is amortized over the remaining period, based on the effective interest method.\n\n## Assets to meet liabilities resulting from retirement provision commitments\n\nThese assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with \u00a7 253 (1) of the German Commercial Code, and offset against the liabilities in accordance with \u00a7 246 (2) of the German Commercial Code. Group life insurance contracts are recorded at asset value.",

If the fair value of the assets exceeds the liabilities, the exceeding amount is shown as an excess of plan assets over pensions and similar obligations.\n\nThese items are recorded at acquisition cost less depreciation on a straight-line basis. The expected useful life is based on the tax depreciation tables. Low-value assets worth up to \u20ac 250 are written off immediately. A compound item for tax purposes formed in accordance with \u00a7 6 (2a) of the German Income Tax Act (EStG) for assets from \u20ac 250 to \u20ac 1,000 is depreciated by one fifth each year.\n\nWhen calculating deferred taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset.\n\nBased on the capitalization option in accordance with \u00a7 274 (1) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code, the surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities is not recognized.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed,\n- -bank deposits,\n- -accounts receivable on reinsurance business,\n- -other receivables,\n- -cash with banks and cash on hand.\n\nThese items are recorded at face value less repayments and impairments.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -unearned premiums,\n- -aggregate policy reserves,\n- -reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses,\n- -reserves for premium refunds,\n- -claims equalization and similar reserves,\n- -other insurance reserves.\n\nInsurance reserves are set up according to the German Commercial Code and the Government Order on the External Accounting Requirements of Insurance Enterprises (RechVersV) requirements. The primary goal is to ensure our ongoing ability to satisfy reinsurance contract liabilities in all cases. Generally, reinsurance reserves are booked according to the cedent's statements. For claims incurred but not yet reported, or not sufficiently reported, additional reserves are calculated using actuarial techniques.\n\nInsurance reserves in the ceded reinsurance business are calculated according to the terms of the retrocession contracts.\n\nUnearned premiums are accrued premiums already written for future risk periods. They are calculated in accordance with German accounting principles, partly on the basis of information received from the cedents and partly using nominal percentages. Where unearned\n\npremiums are calculated using such percentages, these are based on many years of experience and the latest information available.\n\nAggregate policy reserves for Life/Health reinsurance are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are established for the payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but are not yet settled. Reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses fall into two categories: case reserves for reported claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported yet, or not sufficiently reported.\n\nReserves for premium refunds are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nFor Property-Casualty reinsurance, the equalization reserve, the reserve for nuclear power plants, the product liability reserve for major pharmaceutical risks, and reserves for risks relating to terrorist attacks are calculated according to \u00a7 341h of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 30 of the Government Order on the External Accounting Requirements of Insurance Enterprises. The reserves are set up to moderate substantial fluctuations in the claims of individual lines of business. In cases where above-average or belowaverage claims occur, changes in the reserves mitigate the technical result for the individual lines of business.\n\nOther insurance reserves are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nPension provisions are calculated applying actuarial principles. Other obligations, such as provisions for jubilee payments, birthday payments, early retirement payments, phased-in early retirement benefits and a long-term credit account, are also calculated in accordance with actuarial principles.\n\nAccording to \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code, the discount rate used for calculating the pension obligations has to be derived from a 10-year average/uni003B for calculating other obligations, it has to be derived from a 7-year average.\n\n\u00a7 253 (6) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code states that a positive difference resulting from the calculation of pension obligations with the discount rate of 7-year average versus 10-year average is earmarked for profit distribution.\n\nApart from that, with respect to the discount rate, the simplification option set out in \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code has still been applied (duration of fifteen years). The impact of the change in the discount rate is reported under other non-technical result.\n\nFor further information regarding the accounting for pensions and similar obligations, please refer to note 14 to our financial statements.\n\nRemaining  other  provisions  are  recognized  at  the  settlement amount. Long-term provisions are discounted applying the net approach in accordance with IDW RS HFA 34.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -subordinated liabilities,\n- -funds held with reinsurance business ceded,\n- -other liabilities.",

Premiums and discounts carried forward as prepaid income and expenses are amortized over the remaining life of the related financial instruments.\n\nTransactions are generally recorded in the original currency and converted into euro at the relevant daily rate (middle forex spot rate).\n\nLoans to affiliated enterprises denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euro using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date, and applying the strict lower of cost or market value principle.\n\nThe valuation of foreign currency shares in affiliated enterprises and participations, stocks, interests in funds, and other variable and fixed-income securities is performed by converting their value from the original currency into euro, using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date.\n\nComparing the acquisition cost in euro with the value in euro as described above, the moderate lower-value principle is applied for affiliated  enterprises and participations. For other investments, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\nAs a result of this valuation method, currency gains and losses are  not  separately  determined  and  shown  as  foreign-exchange gains/losses in the other non-technical result. Instead, the net effect of both changes (exchange rate and value in original currency) is reflected in the impairments/reversals of impairments and in the realized  gains/losses calculated for these asset classes and is disclosed in the investment result.\n\nIssued debt securities and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euro at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Unrealized losses are recognized immediately in the income statement, while unrealized gains are not.\n\nAll other monetary assets and liabilities with a remaining term of one year or less recorded in foreign currency are valued at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Both unrealized losses and gains resulting from the valuation of these foreign currency positions are reflected immediately in the other non-technical result, as according to \u00a7 256a of the German Commercial Code neither \u00a7 253 (1) sentence 1 nor \u00a7 252 (1) number 4 clause 2 of the German Commercial Code are applicable.\n\nAllianz SE made use of the option of forming valuation units as defined in \u00a7 254 of the German Commercial Code. This option is used for derivative contracts in which Allianz SE acts as an intra-group clearing agency. In this function, Allianz SE enters into derivative transactions with other Group companies and hedges the exposure resulting from these transactions by entering into mirror positions with the same term and structure but with different partners. Opposing positions whose performances completely offset each other have been combined into valuation units and form a perfect micro hedge.\n\nWhen  accounting  for  valuation  units,  we  apply  the  'freezing' method, which means that mutually offsetting changes in value of opposing positions (i.e., within valuation units) are not recorded in the income statement. More details regarding derivative transactions combined into valuation units are explained in note 16 to our financial statements.",

The fair value is determined during the financial year.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nInvestments in companies quoted on the stock exchange are generally measured by the stock exchange price quoted on the last trading day of 2022. Non-quoted companies are generally valued at their net asset value, calculated using the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management's (DVFA) method. The transaction prices are used for recent transactions. In individual cases, marketbased valuation models based on market multiplies of relevant peers or internal valuation models considering the individual conditions defined in shareholder agreements are applied.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThese items are measured at the stock exchange value quoted on the last trading day of 2022 or, if there is no active market, at the prices obtained from brokers or pricing services.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans are valued using the Discounted Cash Flow method. Relevant discount  rates  are  derived  from  observable  market  parameters and reflect the remaining life and credit risk of the instruments. In exceptional cases, the carrying amount is used as fair value.\n\n## Bank deposits and funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed\n\nThere are no differences between the book value and the fair value of these items.\n\nWe disregarded market value declines of \u20ac 108 mn for loans with a book value of \u20ac 2,920 mn. Based on the expected development of market conditions, the decline in market value is not expected to be of an enduring nature.

This growth resulted mainly from the  additions  to  the  provisions for anticipated losses, which went up by \u20ac 696 mn and resulted exclusively from derivative transactions.  The  pension liabilities increased by \u20ac 386 mn  in total and the tax provisions grew by \u20ac 150 mn.\n\nAllianz SE has made pension promises for which pension provisions are recognized. Part of these pension obligations are secured by 'Contractual Trust Arrangements' (Methusalem Trust e.V.). Nearly all of these trust assets constitute offsettable plan assets, with the asset value/market value being used as the fair value.\n\nIn 1985, the pension provisions of the German subsidiaries were centralized by transferring the corresponding assets to Allianz SE. As a result, Allianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of these old pension promises. The German subsidiaries reimburse the costs, with Allianz SE assuming responsibility for settlement. Consequently, these pension provisions are reported by Allianz SE.\n\nAs of 1 January 2015, Allianz SE completely assumed the obligations resulting from the agents pension fund ('Vertreterversorgungswerk - VVW') from Allianz Beratungs- und Vertriebs-AG. Effective from 1 January 2017, the German subsidiaries  only  reimburse the service costs for their employees. There is no longer any cost reimbursement\n\nIn  2022,  claims  equalization  and  similar  reserves  decreased  by \u20ac 486 mn to \u20ac 2,521 mn. This was mainly driven by the full release of the claims equalization reserve for motor reinsurance, since the conditions  for  setting  up  a  claims  equalization  reserve  according  to \u00a7 29 RechVersV were no longer met.\n\nA strengthening of the claims equalization and similar reserves occurred in other lines of reinsurance, mainly due to lower loss ratios compared to the historical average loss ratio.",

Allianz SE  hedged these positions by entering into countertrades at the market. Both intra-group and group-external positions were combined to valuation units ('Bewertungseinheiten'). The average remaining term of the call options is five years. The average remaining term of the put options is seven months.\n\nEuropean-type  options  are  valued  using  the  Black-Scholes model, and American-type options using the binomial model/uni003B  both based on the closing price on the valuation date. Yield curves are derived from the swap rates prevailing on the valuation date. The future dividend yield is estimated on the basis of market information on the valuation date. Volatility is estimated based on currently traded implicit volatility, taking into account the residual term, and the ratio between the strike price and the prevailing share price.\n\nForward contracts in shares, share indices, and hedge RSU as of 31 December 2022\n\n|               | Nominal   | Fair value   | Book value   | Underlying             | Balance sheet position   |\n|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Class         | \u20ac thou    | \u20ac thou       | \u20ac thou       |                        |                          |\n| Long forward  | 447,560   | 68,473       | -            | Allianz SE share       | -                        |\n| Long forward  | 614,968   | 239,671      | -            | UniCredit S.p.A. share | -                        |\n| Short forward | 614,968   | (239,671)    | -            | UniCredit S.p.A. share | -                        |\n| Hedge RSU     | 316,485   | (375,322)    | 375,429      | Allianz SE share       | Liabilities F.IV.        |\n\nPositions in long forwards on Allianz SE shares and in hedge RSU are held in the context of hedging the Allianz Equity Incentive Plans.\n\nFor the purpose of hedging the share price risk, our subsidiary Allianz Finance II Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l.  entered  into  short  forwards  on UniCredit S.p.A. shares with Allianz SE. Allianz SE hedged these positions  by  entering into countertrades at the market. Both intra-group and group-external positions were combined to valuation units. The remaining term of these forwards is less than one year.\n\nThe fair value of a forward contract is determined as the difference between the underlying closing price on the valuation date\n\nand the discounted forward price. The net present value of dividend payments due before maturity of the forward contract is also taken into account, unless the dividends are subject to a pass-through agreement. Liabilities from hedge RSU, which the Group companies acquire from Allianz SE in order to hedge their liabilities from the Group Equity Incentive programs, are valued on the basis of the Allianz closing price on the valuation date, minus the net present value of estimated future dividends due before maturity of the respective hedge RSU. Applicable discount rates are derived from interpolated swap rates.",

Due to the lack of quoted prices on active markets for these financial participations, and the uncertainty regarding the occurrence of the option conditions, the fair value of such options cannot be determined reliably. Wherever feasible, contractual arrangements including the option agreements\n\nwere taken into account when determining the fair value of the financial participation. However, no standalone valuation of the options as derivative financial instruments was performed.\n\nEmbedded in a retrocession agreement covering the retrocession of life business to an external reinsurance partner, Allianz SE  has provided the retrocessionaire with credit protection related to the issuer risk associated with ceded future cash flows arising from a corporate bond. The agreement obliges Allianz SE to pay an amount of \u20ac 87 mn to the retrocessionaire as compensation for safeguarding the reinsurance partner against default risk arising from a bond. At the end of 2022, the fair value of this credit derivative amounted to \u20ac 3.8 mn.",

The increase in the Property-Casualty reinsurance is particularly attributable  to  fire  and  property  reinsurance  as  well  as  motor reinsurance. In life reinsurance, gross premiums written increased by \u20ac 105 mn.\n\n## 18 \\_ Allocated interest return (net)\n\nThe allocated interest return (net) mainly corresponds to the agreed interest rate for deposited provisions and is therefore transferred from the  non-technical  section  to  the  technical  section.

The positive run-off result was mainly due to group-internal quota share reinsurance treaties, primarily with Allianz Versicherungs-AG, Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE, and Allianz Trade, as well as the recovery under our retrocession program.\n\n## 20 \\_ Change in other insurance reserves (net)\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n|                                           | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Change in aggregate policy reserves (net) | 13,502 | 40,229 |\n| Other insurance reserves (net)            | 34,489 | 28,043 |\n| Total                                     | 47,991 | 68,271 |\n\nThe change in aggregate policy reserves (net) was mainly driven by life reinsurance.\n\nThe other insurance reserves (net) mostly include reserves for motor reinsurance.\n\n## 21 \\_ Underwriting expenses (net)\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n|                                                  | 2022        | 2021        |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Gross underwriting expenses                      | (3,488,029) | (3,240,647) |\n| Less: commission received on retroceded business | 175,759     | 105,461     |\n| Net                                              | (3,312,270) | (3,135,186) |\n\nThe increase of underwriting expenses (net) mainly followed the increase in premium development and therefore resulted in higher commissions.

The foreign currency translation of liabilities denominated in USD contributed to the overall improvement, as foreign currency translation losses of USD liabilities decreased from \u20ac (294) mn to \u20ac (224) mn in 2022.",

        "page_content": "Allianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of the pension provisions of its German subsidiaries (see note 14 for more details). Expenses incurred in this context are recognized as service expenses from pension plans charged to Group companies, as they are reimbursed by the German subsidiaries according to the cost allocation contract and result in corresponding service revenues.\n\nOut of the pension expenses of \u20ac 477 mn, \u20ac 412 mn relate to the increase in the pension trend to 5.5 % per year until 2024.\n\nThe significant decrease of \u20ac 473 mn  in interest expenses (net) was mainly due to \u20ac 465 mn lower interest expenses from pensions. The decrease of interest expenses from pensions was primarily caused by a lower addition to pension provisions compared to the previous year resulting from a smaller change in the discount rate.\n\nThe deterioration of the result from derivatives from \u20ac (205) mn to \u20ac (971) mn was predominantly attributable to losses from interest rate swaps held for the purpose of managing duration and hedging interest rate risk arising from the pension portfolio of Allianz SE. Due to the sharp rise of interest rates in 2022, the losses resulting from these swaps increased to \u20ac (660) mn after \u20ac (120) mn in 2021. In addition, losses from foreign currency forwards in 2022 (\u20ac (255) mn) after gains in 2021 (\u20ac 7 mn) added to the adverse development of the result from derivatives.\n\nFurthermore, other income/expenses include the following offset income and expenses:\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n|                                                                                 | 2022                              | 2022               | 2021                              | 2021               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Pensions and similar  obligations | Other  obligations | Pensions and similar  obligations | Other  obligations |\n| Actual return of the offset assets                                              | 14,351                            | 215                | 17,784                            | 903                |\n| Imputed interest cost for the settlement amount of the offset liabilities       | (171,921)                         | (469)              | (189,495)                         | (922)              |\n| Effect resulting from the change in the discount rate for the settlement amount | (109,423)                         | 4                  | (559,056)                         | (7)                |\n| Net amount of the offset income and expenses                                    | (266,933)                         | (250)              | (730,767)                         | (26)               |\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (PwC GmbH) is the external auditing firm for the Allianz Group.\n\nAudit services primarily relate to services rendered for the audit of the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements, the audit of the statutory financial statements of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries, the audit of the Allianz Group's Solvency II market value balance sheet as well as those of Allianz SE and its subsidiaries. In addition, a review of the Allianz Group's consolidated interim financial statements was performed. The 2022 fees for audit services include fees for the implementation audit of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17.\n\nTax services primarily refer to tax compliance services, other services mainly refer to consulting services.\n\nDetails of the fees to the auditor for services to Allianz SE, pursuant to \u00a7 285 No. 17 of the German Commercial Code, can be found in the notes to the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 25 \\_ Income taxes\n\nIn 2022, our tax income, most of which is net operating income, decreased to \u20ac 17 mn (2021: \u20ac 191 mn).\n\nAs the controlling company ('Organtr\u00e4ger') of the tax group, Allianz SE files a consolidated tax return with most of its German affiliated enterprises. The tax compensation payments received from members of the tax group increased to \u20ac 550 mn (2021: \u20ac 543 mn).\n\nThe greatest differences between accounting and tax-based valuation concern the balance sheet items 'pension accruals', 'reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses', and 'provisions for anticipated losses' resulting in deferred tax assets.\n\nThe valuation of the domestic deferred taxes is based on the following tax rates:\n\n- -31.0 % differences in balance sheet items,\n- -15.8 % corporate tax losses,\n- -15.2 % trade tax losses.\n\n## 26 \\_ Net earnings\n\n\u20ac thou\n\n|                                         | 2022      | 2021      |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net income                              | 4,791,846 | 5,351,221 |\n| Unappropriated earnings carried forward | 637,981   | 420,079   |\n| Transfer to other revenue reserves      | (500,000) | (750,000) |\n| Net earnings                            | 4,929,827 | 5,021,300 |",

        "page_content": "## OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## Contingent liabilities, other financial commitments, and litigation\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe following guarantees have been provided by Allianz SE to Allianz Group companies as well as to third parties with regard to the liabilities of certain Allianz Group companies:\n\n- -senior bonds issued by Allianz Finance II B.V. for \u20ac 8.1 bn,\n- -commercial papers issued by Allianz Finance Corporation. As of 31 December 2022, USD 0.2 bn in commercial papers were issued as part of the program,\n- -letters  of  credit  issued  to  various  Allianz Group  companies amounting to \u20ac 1.2 bn.\n\nGuarantee declarations totaling \u20ac 0.8 bn have also been made for life policies signed by Allianz Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Seguros y Reaseguros S.A.\n\nContingent liabilities exist because of indirect pension promises organized via pension funds (Allianz  Versorgungskasse VVaG) and support funds (Allianz Pensionsverein e.V.). Because the adjustment obligation according to \u00a7 16 of the German Occupational Pensions Act (BetrAVG) is not funded in the APV old tariff, the resulting deficit as of 31 December 2022 amounts to \u20ac 57 mn (2021: \u20ac 45 mn). In addition, Allianz SE  has a joint liability of \u20ac 574 mn for a part of the pension promises belonging to its German subsidiaries.\n\nIn the context of the sale of investments, guarantees were given in individual cases to cover counterparty exposures or the various bases used to determine purchase prices.\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE has  issued  guarantees  to  various Allianz Group companies totaling \u20ac 0.5 bn.\n\nAllianz SE enters into contingent liabilities only after careful consideration of the risks involved. On the basis of a continuous evaluation of the risk situation of the contingent liabilities entered into, and taking into account the knowledge gained up to the preparation date, it can be assumed that the obligations underlying the contingent liabilities can be met by the respective principal debtors. As of today, and to the best of our knowledge, Allianz SE assesses the probability of a loss resulting from contingent liabilities to be extremely remote.\n\n## Legal obligations\n\nLegal obligations to assume any losses arise on account of management control agreements and/or profit transfer agreements with the following companies:\n\n- -Allianz Africa Holding GmbH,\n- -Allianz Asset Management GmbH,\n- -Allianz Climate Solutions GmbH,\n- -Allianz Deutschland AG,\n- -Allianz Digital Health GmbH,\n- -Allianz Direct Versicherungs-AG,\n- -Allianz Finanzbeteiligungs GmbH,\n- -Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE,\n\n- -Allianz Global Health GmbH,\n- -Allianz Investment Management SE,\n- -Allianz Kunde und Markt GmbH,\n- -Allianz Technology SE,\n- -Allvest GmbH,\n- -IDS GmbH-Analysis and Reporting Services.\n\nThere are financial obligations of \u20ac 454 mn, which result from advertising agreements (\u20ac 436 mn), and payment obligations arising from investments (\u20ac 18 mn).\n\nAllianz SE is involved in legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings in Germany and foreign jurisdictions, including the United States. Such proceedings  arise  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  including, amongst others, Allianz SE's activities as a reinsurance company, employer, investor and taxpayer. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of such proceedings, they may result in substantial damages or other payments or penalties, or result in adverse publicity and damage to Allianz SE's reputation. As a result, such proceedings could have an adverse effect on Allianz SE's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Apart from the  proceedings  discussed  below,  Allianz SE  is  not  aware  of  any threatened or pending legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on its financial position or profitability. Material proceedings in which Allianz SE is involved are in particular the following:\n\nWith respect to the multiple complaints which had been filed in U.S.  Courts  in  connection  with  losses  suffered  by  investors  in AllianzGI U.S.'s Structured Alpha funds ('Funds') during the COVID-19 related market downturn, in the meantime all actions regarding private funds have been dismissed after settlements were reached with the respective investors.. Currently there is one putative class action pending in a U.S. Court filed by investors in mutual funds. Plaintiffs and all Defendants have reached agreement to settle the matter and the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. AllianzGI U.S.'s contribution to the settlement is within the respective recognized provision.\n\nIn addition, as announced by ad-hoc disclosure on 17 May 2022, AllianzGI U.S. has entered into settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice  ('DOJ')  and  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission ('SEC') in connection with the Structured Alpha matter. Pursuant to the DOJ resolution, AllianzGI U.S. pleaded guilty to one count of criminal securities fraud, and pursuant to the SEC resolution the SEC found that AllianzGI U.S. violated relevant U.S. securities laws. These settlements fully resolve the U.S. governmental investigations of the Structured Alpha matter for Allianz.\n\nAs announced by ad-hoc disclosures on 17 February 2022 and 11 May 2022, Allianz recognized a provision of \u20ac 3.7 bn for the fourth quarter of 2021 and an additional provision of \u20ac 1.9 bn for the first quarter of 2022 for the Structured Alpha matter within the Allianz Group financial  statements.  As  of  31 December 2022,  the  majority  of  the amounts provisioned have been paid out already for settlements with investors in the Funds and for payments to the U.S. authorities according",

Allianz SE believes that the remaining provision within the Allianz Group financial statements represents a fair estimate of the financial exposure in relation to any remaining compensation payments to Structured Alpha investors. Allianz is seeking a timely resolution with remaining fund investors. For Allianz SE the Structured Alpha matter has not led to any requirement for building a provision.\n\nIn January 2023 a putative class action complaint has been filed against Allianz SE and its CEO in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleges violation of Federal U.S. Securities Laws by making false or misleading statements in public disclosures such as the annual reports of Allianz in the period between  March  2018  and  May  2022  regarding  the  AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha matter and internal controls. Allianz SE considers the action to be unfounded.\n\n## Board members\n\nThe disclosures required in accordance with \u00a7 285 No. 10 of the German Commercial Code for the Supervisory Board and Board of Management can be found in the chapters Mandates of the Members of the Supervisory Board  and  Mandates of the Members of Board of Management.\n\n## Board of Management remuneration 1\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Board of Management was comprised of eleven members.

In 2022, the share-based  remuneration  was  comprised  of  118,784 2 (2021: 112,297 3 ) Restricted Stock Units (RSU).\n\nBoard of Management remuneration \u20ac thou\n\n|                                                     | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Base salary                                         | (11,661) | (10,930) |\n| Annual bonus                                        | (11,437) | (9,629)  |\n| Perquisites                                         | (199)    | (274)    |\n| Subtotal base salary, annual bonus, and perquisites | (23,298) | (20,832) |\n| Fair value of RSU at grant date                     | (18,730) | (17,862) |\n| Subtotal share-based compensation                   | (18,730) | (17,862) |\n| Total                                               | (42,027) | (38,694) |\n\nThe total remuneration of the Board of Management of Allianz SE for 2022 amounted to \u20ac 42,027 thou (2021: \u20ac 38,694 thou).\n\nThe remuneration system as of 1 January 2019 only awards RSUs under the long-term incentive plan. For 2022, the fair value of the RSUs at the date of grant was \u20ac 18,730 thou (2021: \u20ac 17,862 thou).\n\nIn 2022, remuneration and other benefits of \u20ac 8 mn (2021: \u20ac 10 mn) were paid to retired members of the Board of Management and to surviving dependents of deceased former members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe pension obligations for former members of the Board of Management and their surviving dependents are as follows:\n\n## \u20ac thou\n\n| as of 31 December                           | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Fair value of the offset assets             | 149,680 | 155,686 |\n| Settlement amount of the offset liabilities | 182,412 | 176,995 |\n| Pension provisions                          | 32,732  | 21,309  |\n\n## Supervisory Board remuneration 4\n\n|                        | 2022    | 2022   | 2021    | 2021   |\n|------------------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|\n|                        | \u20ac thou  | %      | \u20ac thou  | %      |\n| Fixed remuneration     | (1,776) | 61.0   | (1,750) | 62.0   |\n| Committee remuneration | (1,059) | 37.0   | (1,038) | 37.0   |\n| Attendance fees        | (55)    | 2.0    | (24)    | 1.0    |\n| Total                  | (2,890) | 100.0  | (2,812) | 100.0  |\n\n## Average number of employees\n\nExcluding members of the Board of Management, employees in the passive phase of early retirement and on early retirement, on maternity leave or voluntary military/federal voluntary service, trainees, and interns:\n\n|                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| Full-time staff | 2,113  | 1,823  |\n| Part-time staff | 329    | 260    |\n| Total           | 2,442  | 2,083  |\n\nThe increase in the number of employees by 359 was mainly due to further transitions of central functions of Allianz  Deutschland AG to Allianz SE as part of the realignment of Allianz Deutschland AG.",

[paragraph] 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU\n\nAudit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] -  (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Annual Financial Statements and of the Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the annual financial statements, on the management report and on the non-financial statement included in the management report.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon/uni003B we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matter of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- -Measurement of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses\n- -Measurement of shares in affiliated companies and participations\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:\n\n- -Matter and issue\n- -Audit approach and findings\n- -Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter, we present the key audit matters:\n\n## Measurement of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses\n\n## Matter and issue\n\nIn the annual financial statements of the Company, technical provisions (so called 'claims provisions') amounting to \u20ac 14,974 mn (11.9 % of total assets) are reported under the 'Reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses' balance sheet item.\n\nInsurance companies are required to recognize technical provisions to the extent necessary in accordance with reasonable business judgment to ensure that they can meet their obligations from insurance contracts on a continuous basis. Defining assumptions for the purpose of measuring the technical provisions requires the Company's",

        "page_content": "executive directors, in addition to complying with the requirements of commercial and regulatory law, to make estimations of future events and to apply appropriate measurement methods. The gross provision is generally determined on the basis of the cedents' information or, in the case of outstanding settlements, on the basis of an estimate. The Company  reviews  the  appropriateness  of  the  cedents'  information and, if necessary, makes appropriate increases to the amounts.\n\nThe methods used to determine the amount of the claims provisions and the calculation parameters are based on judgments and assumptions made by the executive directors. This also included the evaluation of the impact of increased inflation rates on the calculation  of  the  reserves.  In particular, the lines of  products  with  long claims  settlement  periods,  low  loss  frequency  or  high  individual losses are usually subject to increased estimation uncertainties and usually require a high degree of judgment by the Company's executive directors.\n\nMinor changes to those assumptions and to the methods used may have a material impact on the measurement of the claims provisions. Due to the material significance of the amounts of these provisions in relation to the assets, liabilities and financial performance of the Company as well as the considerable scope for judgment on the part of the executive directors and the associated uncertainties in the estimations made, the measurement of the claims provisions was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n## Audit approach and findings\n\nAs part of our audit, we evaluated the appropriateness of selected controls established by the Company for the purpose of selecting actuarial methods, determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims in propertycasualty insurance.\n\nWith the support of our property-casualty insurance valuation specialists, we have compared the respective actuarial methods applied and the material assumptions with generally recognized actuarial practices and industry standards and examined to what extent these are appropriate for the valuation. Our audit also included an evaluation of the plausibility and integrity of the data and assumptions used in the valuation including the assessment of the executive directors regarding the impact of increased inflation rates,  and an analysis of the claims settlement processes and the reconciliation of the information provided by the cedents. Furthermore, we recalculated the amount of the provisions for selected lines of products, in particular lines of products with large reserves or increased estimation uncertainties. For these lines of products we compared the recalculated provisions with the provisions calculated by the Company and evaluated any differences.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are  appropriate  overall  for  measuring  the  technical  provisions  in property-casualty insurance.\n\n## Reference to further information\n\nThe Company's disclosures on the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims are contained in section Accounting, Valuation, and Calculation Methods in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of shares in affiliated companies and participations\n\n## Matter and issue\n\nIn the annual financial statements of the Company shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments amounting to \u20ac 75,287 mn (59.9 % of total assets) are reported under the \"Investments\" balance sheet item.\n\nShares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments are measured in accordance with German commercial law at the lower of cost and fair value. For shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments whose valuation is not based on stock exchange prices or other market prices, the income approach is used for all significant operating companies (property insurance companies, banks and asset management companies). For life and health insurance companies, the valuation is based on the appraisal value. Companies whose business purpose is essentially limited to the management of investments (asset holding companies), the fair value is determined on the basis of the  fair  values  of  the  respective  underlying  investment  properties, which are determined using different valuation methods (e.g. net asset value, discounted cash flow method).\n\nThe measurement of the fair values is based on the business plan set up by the executive directors. In this context, the executive directors have to make significant judgements, estimates and assumptions in particular about the future development of the business and the effect of the development of macroeconomic factors on the business of the shares in affiliated companies and the companies which are other equity instruments. The discount rate used in the context of the income approach is the individually determined cost of capital for the relevant financial investment.\n\nSmall changes in the assumptions made as well as in the methods applied  can  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  measurement  of  the shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments. On the basis of the values determined and supplementary documentation, write-ups amounting in total to \u20ac 61 mn and write-downs amounting in total to \u20ac 264 mn were required for the financial year. Due to the significance in terms of the amount of the shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments for the Company's assets, liabilities and financial performance as well as the considerable judgments of the executive directors and the related estimation uncertainties, the measurement of the shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n## Audit approach and findings\n\nAs part of our audit, we assessed methodology used by the Company for the purposes of the valuation and the assumptions made by the executive directors in light of the significance of the shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments. Our assessment was based on, among other things, our knowledge of the industry, our investment valuation expertise and our industry experience. We evaluated the company's valuation process, including the design and effectiveness of the controls in place. On that basis, we performed tests of detail related to the valuation for selected shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments. Our selection was risk-oriented with regard to the size and significance for the company's financial statements and in the case of specific indications for a permanent impairment. Our tests of detail included, among other things, the assessment of the selected valuation method,  its consistent application and  the",

In addition, we checked the assumptions underlying the valuation (planned budget, derivation of the discount rate and assumptions on the perpetual annuity) for their appropriateness.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors for the measurement of the shares in affiliated companies and other  equity  instruments  are  substantiated  and  sufficiently  documented.\n\n## Reference to further information\n\nThe Company's disclosures relating to shares in affiliated companies and other equity instruments are contained in section Accounting, Valuation, and Calculation Methods and in section '3 - Market value of investments' of the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, the executive directors  are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore,  the  executive  directors  are  responsible  for  the preparation of the management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.\n\nThe executive directors are also responsible for the preparation of the non-financial statement included in the management report in accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Company's executive directors. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent reporting in the non-financial statement) or error.\n\nThe applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which authoritative  comprehensive  interpretations  have  not  yet  been  published. Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretations of such wording and terms in the non-financial statement in section  'E.U. Taxonomy Regulation'  of the non-financial statement. The executive directors are responsible for the defensibility of these interpretations. As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is uncertain.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report as well as of the non-financial statement included in the management report.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's  position  and,  in  all  material  respects,  is  consistent  with  the",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements and this management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual  financial  statements  and  of  the  management  report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of  the  annual  financial  statements  and  of  arrangements  and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions.

On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the  prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n- -Evaluate the suitability of the criteria presented by the executive directors in the non-financial statement as a whole.

It explains the application of the remuneration system in the financial year 2022, using detailed and individualized  specifications  on  the  remuneration  of  current  and  former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n\u00a7 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its currently valid version.\n\nIt was also decided to allow the auditor to carry out a comprehensive, content audit of the Remuneration Report going above and beyond the legal requirements of \u00a7 162 (3) AktG.\n\nThe report was created jointly by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, taking into consideration the requirements of\n\n## The remuneration year of 2022 at a glance\n\n2022 was significantly shaped by the war in Ukraine and its impact on the global economy, the insurance industry, and asset management. The energy crisis and rising inflation also had a significant impact on the insurance business. The potential risks of further geopolitical tensions are of growing importance. In addition, the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic are still being felt, which has had a lasting impact on the working lives of employees.\n\nThe Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board has closely followed the business development from the viewpoint of potential target achievement at Group level, as well as individual remuneration targets for the first half of the year and at year-end 2022. Besides the quantitative targets for the financial year 2023, the non-financial targets for 2023 and the appropriateness of the remuneration of the Board of Management were discussed. Changes in the Board of Management were also prepared and implemented. Detailed comments on the adjustments for 2023 are provided in the Outlook.\n\nThe annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI) allocation are based on two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50 %.\n\nThe operating profit target of \u20ac 13.40 bn was exceeded to \u20ac 14.16 bn, as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Corporate and Other business segments achieved strong growth in operating profit and more than compensated for the decline in the Asset Management business segment. This resulted in a target achievement of 111.40 % for operating profit.\n\nAs a consequence of the war in Ukraine, Allianz SE decided to withdraw from the Russian market. This decision could not have been foreseen either in the budget planning or in the actual target setting. The planned divestment of the majority stake in Allianz's Russian business resulted in extraordinary charges of \u20ac 437 mn in the financial year 2022, which are reflected in the net income attributable to shareholders. In the event of such unforeseeable extraordinary developments, it is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board to take them into account, if necessary, when determining target achievement. In order to recognize the actual performance of the Board of Management in the context of variable compensation, the Supervisory Board took into account the losses incurred as a result of this planned sale of a majority interest when it determined target achievement. Adjusted for this effect, net income attributable to shareholders in the past financial year was \u20ac 7.17 bn. This was slightly below the target of \u20ac 7.20 bn, resulting in target achievement of 99.29 %.\n\nOverall, this results in an achievement rate of 105.35 % for the Group financial targets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "For the financial year 2022, the financial performance of the Board of Management, based on the operating business, again has to be rated as very strong. Despite strong capital market distortions, solvency and essential credit ratings stabilized at a solid level. Almost all business divisions rendered a positive contribution and some significantly exceeded the planned target level.\n\nThe Iberia & Latin America region again failed to reach its operating target. The Asset Management business segment also missed the planned target level against the backdrop of the extremely volatile capital markets and the strong rise in interest rates.\n\nThe strong performance overall was achieved on a sustainable basis. Based on the quality indicators surveyed, both customers and employees of Allianz once again awarded the Board of Management very good ratings in the financial year 2022, as they had done in the financial year 2021. The proportion of local business segments considered as market leaders in terms of customer satisfaction, as measured by the digital Net Promoter Score, grew significantly to 58 %. The Inclusive Meritocracy Index and the Work Well Index Plus, which are used to measure employee satisfaction, also rose year-on-year from already very good levels to 79 % and 71 %, respectively. The environmental target set for reducing CO2 emissions per employee was also clearly exceeded with a reduction of 57 % versus the baseline year 2019. As a result, the overall determination of the individual contribution factor for the Board of Management was 1.11. The individual contribution factor of each member of the Board of Management is explained in detail in the chapter on individual target achievement.\n\nIn connection with the Structured Alpha matter, both the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management initiated internal reviews and commissioned external investigations from various independent consultants. These reviews and investigations did not reveal any breaches of duty by current or former members of the Board of Management that could form the basis for a reduction in payment (malus) or a clawback of variable compensation already paid out. No other use was made of the clawback option in the financial year 2022.\n\nThe system for the remuneration of members of the Board of Management was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2021 with a majority vote of 87.14 %. The remuneration system applies to all members of the Board of Management who were in office in the financial year 2022.\n\nThe Remuneration Report for 2021 was approved at the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2022 with a majority vote of 86.7 %.\n\nOverall, the remuneration system and the Remuneration Report are strongly supported by investors and proxy advisors. Feedback to the Supervisory Board, for example, positively emphasizes transparency and that the Allianz Remuneration Report is broadly in line with best practice standards in Germany - and even exceeds them in many respects.\n\nWith regard to the Remuneration Report, various investors and proxy advisors have requested a detailed description of how the Supervisory Board uses its discretion in the context of the individual contribution factor (ICF). Our response to this request is to provide a detailed commentary on individual target achievement for each member of the Board of Management in the section on individual compensation in the Remuneration Report. In addition, key points from the individual target achievements are clearly summarized in a new table.\n\nInvestors and proxy advisors regularly underline the importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets. The sustainability targets are a fundamental consideration in the remuneration system for members of the Board of Management and are reflected in both short- and long-term compensation. In determining the targets for 2022, even greater account was taken of the increased importance of sustainability issues. In addition to group-wide sustainability targets, individual ESG targets were again set for each member of the Board of Management for their respective areas of responsibility. Here, too, the presentation in the report has been made even more transparent and expanded to include a chart.\n\nThe Supervisory Board plans to conduct a comprehensive review of the remuneration system in 2023 and to present adaptions to the remuneration system for approval, either at the Annual General Meeting in 2024 or in 2025 at the latest. The review will include the suggestions made by investors and proxy advisors.\n\nSirma Boshnakova has been a member of the Board of Management since 1 January 2022. She is responsible for the insurance business in the countries of Western and Southern Europe (France, Benelux, Italy, T\u00fcrkiye), for the European direct insurance companies, and for the global business unit Allianz Partners. Her remuneration was set at the same level as that of the other regular members of the Board of Management.\n\nSergio Balbinot (63) left the Allianz SE Board of Management after his term of office expired due to retirement on 31 December 2022.\n\nBecause the Allianz Customer Model - one of Ivan de la Sota's main responsibilities - was transferred to the respective Board of Management divisions for property, life, and industrial insurance, as well as for asset management, earlier than planned, the Supervisory Board approved the early termination of Ivan de la Sota's mandate and the dissolution of the divisions he headed. Ivan de la Sota's mandate thus ended as of 31 December 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management\n\nRemuneration is designed to be appropriate compared to peers, given the Allianz Group's range of business activities, operating environment, and business results achieved. The aim is to ensure and promote sustainable and value-oriented management of the company that is in line with our corporate strategy. The key principles are as follows:\n\nThe Board of Management's remuneration is decided upon by the entire Supervisory Board, based on proposals prepared by the Supervisory  Board's  Personnel  Committee.  If  required,  the  Supervisory Board may seek outside advice from independent external consultants. The Personnel Committee and the  Supervisory Board consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management in assessing the performance and remuneration of Board of Management members. The Chairperson  of the Board of Management is generally not involved in the discussion about their own remuneration. The Supervisory Board designs the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management in accordance with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in its currently valid version, as well as with regulatory requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, while ensuring clarity and comprehensibility. Feedback from investors is also considered.\n\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines the target total compensation, and regularly reviews the appropriateness of the remuneration. This is based on both a horizontal comparison (i.e., with peer companies) and a vertical comparison (in relation to Allianz employees). Again, the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee develops respective recommendations, if necessary with the assistance of external consultants.\n\n- -Support of the Group's strategy: The design of variable compensation, and in particular of performance targets, reflects the business  strategy  and  sustainable  long-term  development  of  the Allianz Group.\n- -Alignment of pay and performance: The performance-based variable component of the remuneration of members of the Board of Management forms a significant portion of the overall remuneration, corresponding to 70 % of the target compensation.\n- -Sustainability of performance and alignment with shareholder interests: A major part of the variable remuneration reflects longerterm performance, with deferred payout (64 %), and is linked to the absolute and relative performance of the Allianz share price.\n\nThe structure, weighting, and level of each remuneration component should be adequate and appropriate.\n\n## Horizontal appropriateness\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly benchmarks the remuneration of the Board of Management of Allianz SE against other DAX companies and selected international companies (including, for example, the top positions in the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance), taking into account the company's position, as well as the Allianz Group's long-term performance, relative size, complexity, and internationality.\n\nThe outcome of the horizontal comparison is that Allianz SE is well above 75 th percentile relative to size (revenue, number of employees, and market capitalization) compared to the DAX companies. Accordingly, the total remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is orientated on the upper quartile of the remuneration of the peer companies.\n\n## Vertical appropriateness\n\nThis comparison is based on the total direct compensation of a member of the Board of Management and the average direct compensation of an employee of the German Allianz companies. The Supervisory Board's decision in December is based on the factor resulting from this comparison for the previous financial year. For the financial year 2021, the factor for the Chairperson of Board of Management to employee was '70', and the factor for a regular board member to employee was '41'. For the financial year 2022, the respective factor for",

If an appointment to the Board of Management requires a change of residence, relocation expenses are reimbursed to an appropriate extent.\n\n## Pension contribution\n\nTo  provide  competitive  and  cost-effective  retirement  and  disability benefits, company contributions to the defined-contribution pension plan 'My Allianz Pension' are invested with a guarantee for the contributions paid, but no further interest guarantee.\n\nEach year,  the Supervisory Board decides whether a budget is provided and, if so, to what extent. The current pension contribution generally represents 15 % of the target compensation of the board members.\n\nApart from cases of occupational or general disability for medical reasons, the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 62. Should board membership cease before the retirement age is reached, accrued pension rights are maintained if vesting requirements are met.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may have additional pension entitlements under former pension plans based on previous positions in the Allianz Group or due to membership of the Board of Management prior to 2015. Payments of social insurance contributions abroad required by Allianz in individual cases may also give rise to additional pension entitlements.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed remuneration components comprise the base salary, perquisites, and pension contributions. They serve to provide a competitive remuneration to attract and retain Board of Management members, whose experience and skills enable them to develop and successfully implement the Allianz Group's strategy. They secure a reasonable level of income in line with market conditions, and promote a management of the company that is commensurate with risk.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe base salary, which is not performance-related, is paid in twelve equal monthly installments.\n\n## Perquisites\n\nPerquisites mainly consist of contributions to accident and liability insurances, tax consultant fees, and the provision of a company car and further individual perquisites if applicable. Perquisites are not linked to performance. Each member of the Board of Management is responsible for paying the income tax due on these perquisites. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the level of perquisites/uni003B a contractual",

        "page_content": "## Performance-based remuneration\n\nThe  performance-based  variable  remuneration  includes  the  shortterm annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration. The composition  aims  to  balance  short-term  performance,  longer-term success, and sustained value creation. The Supervisory Board ensures that the targets for the variable remuneration are challenging, sustainable, and ambitious.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe annual bonus provides incentives for profitable growth and further developing the operating business by successfully implementing the business objectives for the respective financial year. In doing so, the overall responsibility for reaching the Group targets as well as the individual performance with regard to the operational responsibilities of the individual members of the Board of Management are taken into consideration.\n\nThe annual bonus is derived by multiplying the target achievement factor by the target amount for the annual bonus, and is paid out in cash after the end of the relevant financial year, with payment limited to a maximum of 150 % of the target amount.\n\n## Long-term incentive - LTI\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation is oriented mainly towards the sustainable increase in the enterprise value. Taking the share price performance in absolute and relative terms as a basis, it encourages combining the interests of the shareholders with those of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nOther stakeholder aspects are taken into consideration by setting strategic sustainability targets, whose achievement forms the basis for the final assessment at the end of the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nAlmost two thirds (64 %) of the variable remuneration is  sharebased, so as to adequately reflect the long-term performance of the company in the Board of Management remuneration.\n\n## Additional remuneration principles\n\n## Shareholding obligation and shareholding exposure\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are obliged to build up the following degree of share ownership within three years:\n\n- -Chairperson of the Board of Management: two times base salary, i.e., \u20ac 3,822 thou,\n- -Regular Board of Management member: one time base salary, i.e., \u20ac 975 thou.\n\nHolding is required for the entire term of service on the Board of Management. Shares will be acquired through mandatory pay component conversion. In case of a base salary increase, the shareholding obligation increases accordingly. The holding obligation ceases with the end of the mandate.\n\nIn  combination with the virtual shares (RSU) accumulated over four years through the LTI plan, the Allianz SE Board of Management has significant economic exposure to the Allianz stock: It amounts to approximately 800 % of base salary for the Chairperson and approximately 700 % of base salary for a regular board member.\n\n## Malus/clawback\n\nIn order to ensure sustainable corporate development and to avoid taking inappropriate risks, variable  remuneration components may not be paid, or payment may be restricted, in the case of a significant breach of the Allianz Code of Conduct or regulatory Solvency II policies or standards, including risk limits.\n\nIn  the  same  way,  variable  remuneration  components  already paid may be subject to a clawback for three years after payout. Additionally, a reduction or cancellation of variable remuneration may occur if the supervisory authority (BaFin) requires this in accordance with its statutory powers.\n\n## Payout cap\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 87a (1) sentence 2 (1) AktG and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board has determined a remuneration cap.\n\nThus, the actual payout for the underlying financial year, comprising the base salary, variable remuneration and pension service cost, will be capped at maximum \u20ac 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management, and at \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member of the Board of Management. If the remuneration for the financial year exceeds this amount, compliance with the maximum limit will be ensured by reducing the payout of the long-term variable remuneration accordingly.\n\nThis payout cap principle was introduced for the first time for the financial year 2019. Given that the actual amount of the paid out longterm variable remuneration cannot be determined until after vesting and the final sustainability assessment, compliance with the payout cap will be reported on for the first time in the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2024.\n\n## Deviation from the remuneration system\n\nThe Supervisory Board can temporarily deviate from the remuneration system in exceptional circumstances in accordance with the statutory requirements (\u00a7 87a (2) AktG), if this is necessary in the interests of the long-term welfare of the company. The assessment may take into account both macroeconomic and company-related exceptional circumstances, such as impairment of the long-term viability and profitability of the company. The deviation requires a prior proposal by the Personnel Committee.\n\nThe components of the remuneration system from which deviations may be made in exceptional cases include in particular the base salary, the annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI), including their  relationship  to  each  other,  their  respective  assessment  bases where applicable, the target setting and target achievement assessment principles, and the determination of any payout and payment dates. The duration of the deviation shall be determined by the Supervisory Board at its due discretion, but should not exceed a period of four years. In a crisis situation, for example, this principle is intended to allow the appointment of a new board member, e.g., with crisis management expertise, with a remuneration structure that temporarily deviates from the remuneration structure.\n\nIn the financial year 2022, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to deviate from the remuneration system.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration adjustment\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also entitled to take appropriate account of extraordinary  unforeseeable  developments  when  determining  the amount of the variable remuneration components. This rule takes up a recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code and allows for the adjustment of the remuneration in rare unforeseeable exceptional cases.\n\nConceivable cases of application include, for example, significant changes in accounting rules, or in the tax or regulatory framework, as well as catastrophic events not yet known at the time of target setting. The application of this rule may also lead to a reduction in the variable remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may also adjust the target remuneration of the members of the Board of Management, insofar as this is appropriate to ensure that the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Board of Management or a regular member of the Board of Management is appropriate with regard to their duties and performance. In doing so, it shall take into account the horizontal and vertical comparison of the Board of Management remuneration. The aim of this rule is to moderately adjust Board of Management remuneration on the basis of horizontal and vertical salary trends, and thus to avoid major salary increases.\n\nIt does not constitute an automatic adjustment, but requires a justified decision by the Supervisory Board in each case. Such a moderate adjustment of the target remuneration does not in itself represent a significant change to the remuneration system. These adjustments or deviations must be justified in detail in the respective Remuneration Report for the financial year. The Remuneration Report is prepared in accordance with ARUG II and submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval.\n\n## Termination of service\n\nBoard of Management contracts are limited to a period of five years. For new appointments, a shorter period of up to three years is provided based on the recommendation by the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Severance payment cap\n\nPayments for early termination to board members with a remaining term of contract of more than two years are capped at twice the annual compensation, consisting of the last financial year's base salary and 100 % of the variable target compensation. If the remaining term of contract is less than two years, the payment is pro-rated for the remaining term of the contract. Contracts do not contain provisions for any other cases of early termination of Board of Management service.\n\nIn the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, a severance payment is offset against compensation resulting from the non-compete clause in case of premature termination of service.\n\n## Transition payment\n\nBoard members appointed before 1 January 2010 are eligible for a transition payment after leaving the Board of Management. The transition payment comprises an amount corresponding to the most recent base salary (paid for a period of six months), plus a one-time payment of 25 % of the target variable remuneration at notice date. Where an Allianz pension is due at the same time, such pension is deducted from the monthly transition payments. In the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, the remittance of the transitional payment will be offset against the payment resulting from the non-compete clause.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n## Internal and external board appointments\n\nWhen a member of the Board of Management simultaneously holds an appointment at another company within the Allianz Group or their joint ventures with outside partners, the full amount of the respective remuneration is transferred to Allianz SE.\n\nIn recognition of related benefits to the organization, and subject to prior approval by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, board members are also allowed to accept a limited number of non-executive supervisory roles at appropriate external organizations. In these cases, 50 % of the remuneration received is paid to Allianz SE.\n\nThe respective board member will retain the full remuneration for that position only if the Allianz SE Supervisory Board classifies the appointment as a personal one (ad personam) . Any remuneration paid by external organizations will be itemized in those organizations' annual reports/uni003B its level will be determined by the governing body of the relevant organization.\n\n## Target achievement factor to determine the variable remuneration\n\nIn line with the overarching strategic objective 'simplicity wins', the calculation of variable remuneration follows a simple system. The annual bonus and LTI allocation are based on only two Group financial targets for the relevant financial  year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50 %. The resulting target achievement is adjusted by an individual contribution factor (ICF) in the range of 0.8 to 1.2, which reflects both the results of the business division and the performance of the individual board member. If targets are not met, the variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If targets are significantly exceeded, the target achievement is limited to 150 %.",

Adjustments are only applied to acquisitions and disposals that account for more than 10 % of the Group's operating profit or net income attributable to shareholders, or that have a value-adding effect from a risk management perspective (e.g., portfolio transfers) and were not yet known at the time the plan was prepared. This regulation is intended to prevent meaningful transactions from having a negative impact on the remuneration of the Management Board.\n\nOperating profit highlights the underlying performance of ongoing core operations.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders is the profit after tax and non-controlling  interests  (minorities).  Furthermore,  the  net  income forms the basis for the dividend payout and for the return on equity calculation.

In addition, there are overarching strategic goals that apply to all Board members.\n- -Performance (Business division targets): For board members with business-related division responsibilities, the contribution to the financial performance is based on various indicators of profitability (e.g., operating profit and net income) and productivity (e.g., expense ratio) for the respective business division. For Board members with a functional focus, division-specific performance targets are determined based on their key responsibilities, and are qualitatively assessed.\n- -Sustainability targets: The development of strategy for sustainability in asset management and the definition of an approach and KPIs for sustainable claims management have been newly introduced across the board, and -  as before  -  the securing of the strong sustainability positioning in three leading sustainability indices  is  assessed.  Customer  satisfaction  (digital  Net  Promoter Score (dNPS)) and employee satisfaction (Inclusive Meritocracy Index and Work Well Index Plus) are taken into account in the sustainability social  targets.  With respect to Governance, management qualities are also assessed along with behavioral aspects (for example, customer orientation, personnel management, corporate behavior), and credibility (for example, social responsibility, integrity, diversity). The development of the following elements are taken into account in regard to climate protection, when assessing the ICF:\n- -Decarbonizing the Allianz Group's business operations and increasing the share of renewable energy in order to reduce carbon emissions by 50 % by year-end 2025 (baseline year 2019).\n- -Decarbonizing the investment portfolio in line with the U.N.Convened  Net-Zero  Asset  Owner  Alliance  with  the  interim\n\ntarget of reducing emissions in listed equities and corporate bond asset classes by 25 % by year-end 2024 (baseline year 2019).\n\nAdditional information can be found in the Non-Financial Statement for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE.\n\n## Determining the individual contribution factor (ICF)\n\nThe Supervisory Board determines the ICF for each member of the Board of Management based on the fulfillment of the individual performance indicators. Most of the performance indicators are provided with quantitative criteria, and therefore offer a sufficiently concrete basis for the combined assessment.\n\nEach ICF category - strategic priority, performance, and sustainability  -  has a significant weighting, and all three categories are of equal importance and contribution to the overall assessment. However, the individual indicators are not weighted on a fixed percentage basis, so that the ICF is not determined on the basis of a formulaic calculation. This allows the Supervisory Board to take appropriate consideration  of  the  individual  criteria  and  to  react  appropriately  to changes in priorities during the year. In particular, significantly underperforming in one category should allow a low overall rating without being balanced out by the other indicators.\n\nSince  the  performance  is  determined  without  a  specified weighting, the ICF covers a narrow range of 0.8 to 1.2.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI) design\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation component makes up the largest portion of variable compensation. It promotes alignment with shareholders and reflects the sustainable implementation of the company's long-term strategy. The LTI is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the long-term development of KPIs is reflected in the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Grant and contractual vesting period: The LTI is granted annually in the form of virtual Allianz shares, so-called restricted stock units (RSUs). The number of RSUs to be granted corresponds to the LTI allocation amount, divided by the allocation value of an RSU at grant:\n\n- -The LTI allocation amount is derived by multiplying the LTI target amount by the  annual bonus achievement factor, and capped at maximum 150 % of the target level.\n- -The RSU allocation value is based on the ten-day-average Xetra closing price of the Allianz stock following the annual",

As RSUs are virtual stock without dividend payments, the relevant share price is reduced by the net present value of the expected future dividend payments during the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nThe LTI grant is followed by a contractual vesting period of four years. After that period, the LTI amount to be paid is determined based on the relative performance of the Allianz share, the relevant share price, and the results of the sustainability assessment.\n\n- -Relative performance versus peers: Besides the absolute shareprice development, the LTI payout takes the relative performance of the Allianz  share into account. The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Allianz share is benchmarked against the TSR of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index by reflecting the relation of the total performance of the Allianz share ('Allianz TSR') and the total performance of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index ('Index TSR') between the start and end of the four-year contractual vesting period. The payout is based on the TSR performance factor, which is calculated as follows:\n\n- -At the end of the contractual vesting period, the difference between the Allianz TSR and the Index TSR is determined in percentage points/uni003B the result is multiplied by '2': As the comparison with competitors and the market is of outstanding importance, the outperformance/underperformance is weighted twofold.\n- -To determine the factor, 100 percentage points are added to the result. Example: 1 percentage point outperformance results in a relative performance factor of 102 %/uni003B 1 percentage point underperformance results in a relative performance factor of 98 %.\n\nIn order to avoid incentivizing excessive risk-taking, the relative TSR performance factor is limited: it can vary between zero (for underperformance of the index by 50 percentage points or lower) and 200 % (for outperformance of the index by minimum + 50 percentage points or higher).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Sustainability assessment: Prior to the payout of each LTI tranche, the Supervisory Board determines, following a preliminary assessment by the Personnel Committee, whether there are any sustainability-related concerns regarding a full payout. If so, payment of the tranche may be canceled in full or in part.\n\nSubject of the sustainability assessment are:\n\n- -compliance breaches,\n- -balance  sheet  issues,  such  as  reserve  strength,  solvency, indebtedness, and ratings,\n- -KPIs entailed in the individual board members' targets, such as dNPS, employee satisfaction, and climate targets.\n\nThe assessment is made applying a comparable basis/uni003B i.e., any regulatory changes, changes in accounting regulations, or changes in calculation methods for the KPIs in question are taken into account.\n\n- 1\\_For accounting purposes, the determination of the fair value of RSUs is based on an option pricing model, taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index.

The relevant share price is capped at 200 % of the grant price. Likewise, the relative TSR performance factor is capped at a maximum of 200 %. Taking into account the overall compensation cap (\u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular board member and \u20ac 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management), the LTI payout in relation to the LTI target - which deviates from the individual LTI component caps - is limited to 272 %.\n\nOutstanding RSU holdings are forfeited should a board member leave at their own request or be terminated for important cause.\n\nthe board members' compensation may deviate from this IFRS value, as a simplified calculation method was applied to increase transparency and traceability.",

The planned divestment of the majority stake in Allianz's Russian business resulted in extraordinary charges of \u20ac 437 mn in the financial year 2022, which are reflected in the net income attributable to shareholders. In the event of such unforeseeable extraordinary developments, it is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board to take them into account, if necessary, when determining target achievement. In order to recognize the actual performance of the Board of Management in the context of variable compensation, the Supervisory Board took into account the losses incurred as a result of this planned sale of a majority interest when it determined target achievement. Adjusted for this effect, net income attributable to shareholders in the past financial year was \u20ac 7.17 bn. This was slightly below the target of \u20ac 7.20 bn, resulting in target achievement of 99.29 %.\n\nOverall, this results in an achievement rate of 105.35 % for the Group financial targets.",

steady hand to record operating profit in the crisis year 2022. In addition,  both  brand  strength  and  customer  &  employee  satisfaction reached record highs. His prudent actions were instrumental in the swift resolution of the Structured Alpha proceedings in the United States and the establishment of the partnership with Voya Investment Management to strengthen the U.S. business of Allianz Global Inves-\n\ntors.\n\nThrough strong results in his regional portfolio, Sergio Balbinot again delivered significant contributions to the strong Group performance in 2022/uni003B not only in terms of financial results, but also with further improvements in customer satisfaction and brand strength. Beyond his own regional portfolio, Mr. Balbinot led the Group in expanding its claims management expertise and successfully supported Ms. Boshnakova and Ms. Wagner in assuming their new regional areas of responsibility. Mr. Balbinot left the Board of Management of Allianz after eight very successful years but will continue to be available to the Group in various important functions, including as Chairperson of the Board of Directors of Allianz S.p.A.. The Supervisory Board thanks Mr. Balbinot for his outstanding contributions to the sustainable success of the Allianz Group.\n\nIn her first year on the Board of Management, Sirma Boshnakova has successfully assumed leadership of her new area of responsibility and integrated well into the Board of Management team. The turnaround  of  Allianz  Partners  was  successfully  achieved  after  the\n\nchallenges of the COVID-19 crisis. In addition, the large operating entities in France and Italy delivered very solid results. The improvements in customer satisfaction are particularly noteworthy, including the market  leadership  in  the  Life/Health  and  Property-Casualty  insurance businesses in France. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects to see an increase in the competitiveness of Allianz Direct. In addition, the new claims service platform is to be systematically established and anchored throughout the Group.\n\nIvan de la Sota's financial target achievement was again adversely impacted by the disappointing performance of the entities in Brazil and Spain. Progress was made, primarily in the ongoing improvement and expansion of the claims management platform, as well as the successful integration of Control\u20acxpert and the acquisition of Innovation Group. Allianz X was also able to set important innovation stimuli in 2022. Progress in group-wide IT initiatives can be further improved. In the future, the delivery of measurable economies of scale and economic benefits, in particular, must become a stronger focus. Mr. de la Sota left Allianz after 32 years at the end of the financial year 2022. He has had a successful career in key operational roles in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America, and has held critical transformational roles in the Group. The Supervisory Board thanks Mr. de la Sota for his very good contributions to the sustainable success of the Allianz Group and wishes him all the best for his future.\n\nBarbara Karuth-Zelle made further progress in modernizing the IT architecture and managing the technology portfolio.

Ms. KaruthZelle  also  further  improved  cooperation  between  the  group-wide technology entities and local operating entities, despite the considerable challenges arising from the demanding transformation projects. The further increase in employee satisfaction at Allianz Technology, which also had a positive effect on the Group's results in 2022, is also impressive. The efforts undertaken by Ms. Karuth-Zelle to consistently improve IT security within the Allianz Group should also be highlighted. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects to see improved stability of infrastructure services and user satisfaction with workplace services. At the same time, economic control of the IT budget must be systematically improved.\n\nKlaus-Peter R\u00f6hler again delivered very good contributions to both the strong financial results and the strategic development of the Allianz Group with the portfolio that he manages. Despite considerable distortions in capital markets, spiraling inflation, and the war in Ukraine, overall target achievement was very good. The solid results in the Property-Casualty insurance business segment and the further improvement of employee satisfaction are particularly noteworthy. His handling of the effects of the war in Ukraine was excellent. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects continued progress towards market leadership in terms of customer satisfaction, especially at Allianz Versicherungs-AG in Germany, and strengthened growth of profitable customer segments, especially in Germany and Switzerland.\n\nAs CFO, Giulio Terzariol contributed significantly to delivering the operating profit of \u20ac 14.16 bn, yet another record result. He consistently worked to strengthen the solvency ratio and key credit ratings, as well as to safeguard Group liquidity. Stringent capital management and the achievement of financial results contributed significantly to the recovery of the share price in the second half of the year. Mr. Terzariol prepared the Allianz Group in an exemplary manner for the introduction of the new accounting standard IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 in 2023. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects the successful integration of the  control  functions  in  Mr.  Terzariol's  area  of  responsibility,  the strengthening of the management of potential reputational risks, and the further development of automated transformation controlling.\n\nG\u00fcnther Thallinger again achieved a very solid investment result in an extremely difficult capital market environment, with simultaneously falling prices for equity and fixed-income securities as well as a massive inflation shock. In addition, Mr. Thallinger successfully implemented the capital reallocation on the asset side of the balance sheet.\n\nHis contributions to the excellent expansion of the Allianz Group's leadership role in sustainability issues and the management of climate crisis are also particularly noteworthy. Apart from helping Allianz to maintain its top position in leading sustainability rankings, Mr. Thallinger was also personally recognized for his achievements/uni003B for example,  through  his  re-election  as  Chairperson  of  the  Net  Zero  Asset Owner Alliance. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects further progress in the profitable growth of the health insurance business and the increase of risk capital efficiency.\n\nChristopher Townsend again made strong contributions to improve the profitability of the Commercial Lines business in 2022. Both Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty and Allianz Trade delivered results that exceeded the ambitious plans. The design of a transnational Commercial Lines platform also made very good progress under his leadership. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects to see sustainable improvements in the results of Allianz UK and further progress in the globalization of the Commercial Lines business.\n\nRenate Wagner again made excellent progress in her areas of responsibility in 2022. In Human Resources, strategic personnel planning was further improved and support of Allianz employees was reinforced in a sustainable manner by flexibilizing working time arrangements and modernizing the working environment. In addition, Ms. Wagner consistently drove the required improvements in Group governance. Under her leadership, the M&A team successfully supported highly complex transactions, including the strategic partnership between Allianz Global Investors and Voya Investment Management. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects to see a further expansion of strategic HR planning and recruitment, particularly in critical areas such as technology, as well as continued diversification of talent pools.\n\nAndreas Wimmer managed the challenges in the Asset Management business segment and US Life Insurance very well against the backdrop of a very difficult capital market environment. In particular, he managed the consequences of the settlements concluded with U.S. authorities in the Structured Alpha matter with great prudence, including the negotiation and immediate implementation of the partnership with Voya Investment Management and the improvement in governance at Allianz Asset Management Holding. For 2023, the Supervisory Board expects to see a strengthening of growth through the continued transformation of the Life Insurance and Asset Management business segments, for example through cross-segmental product innovations and further build-out of distribution channels.",

        "page_content": "The following tables show the individual remuneration of those members of the Board of Management who were active in the reporting year.\n\nThe table 'Remuneration in the financial year' features the remuneration  awarded  and  due  in  accordance  with  \u00a7 162 (1)  sentence 1 AktG. It includes the payments made in the financial year for base salary, perquisites, and other remuneration. For the variable remuneration, the components for performance fully rendered in the financial year are reported. This requirement is met in case the applicable performance criteria are fulfilled and conditions subsequent and suspensive have been met or have ceased to exist. For the financial year 2022, this is the annual bonus that refers to the 2022 performance period and is paid out in March 2023. For the share-based renumeration, the payout of the RSU allocation of the Allianz Equity Incentive (AEI) for the financial year 2017, which vested  in the financial year 2022, is reported.\n\nThe additional table 'Remuneration for the financial year' goes above and beyond the requirements of \u00a7 162 AktG. It includes the contributions to base salary and perquisites made in the respective financial year, as well as the annual bonus for the respective financial year and the allocation amount of the share-based remuneration for the financial year.\n\nThe amounts for the annual bonus and LTI allocation reported here result from the achievement of the targets for the financial year. The information therefore directly depicts the correlation between remuneration and business development.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration for the financial year is decisive for reviewing the retention of the general payout cap of \u20ac 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management and \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member. It is reviewed prior to the payout in 2027 and 2026 of the LTI tranches allocated for the financial year 2022 and 2021, and reported in the remuneration report for the respective financial year.\n\nFurthermore, the pension expenses in the financial year are listed in  both  tables,  even  if  these  are  not  regarded  as  remuneration awarded and due in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG. Finally, in addition to the absolute amounts, the share of the individual remuneration components relative to the total remuneration is stated.\n\nThe information provided for by the Stock Corporation Act on remuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management is shown in a separate table for the sake of clarity.\n\nThe following diagram presents the allocation of the remuneration components in the two tables, using the financial year 2022 as an example:\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are invested in a fund with a guarantee on the contributions paid, but no further interest guarantee.\n\nFor members with pension rights under the now frozen defined benefit plan, the above contribution rates are reduced by 19 % of the expected annual pension from that frozen plan.\n\n## Individual pensions: 2022 and 2021\n\n\u20ac thou (total might not sum up due to rounding)\n\n|                                 |      | Current pension plan   | Current pension plan   | Previous pension plans 1   | Previous pension plans 1   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Board members                   |      | SC 2                   | DBO 3                  | SC 2                       | DBO 3                      | SC 2    | DBO 3   |\n|                                 | 2022 | 913                    | 5,848                  | 209                        | 4,608                      | 1,122   | 10,456  |\n| Oliver B\u00e4te                     | 2021 | 878                    | 4,830                  | 172                        | 5,494                      | 1,050   | 10,324  |\n| Sergio Balbinot                 | 2022 | 466                    | 3,429                  | 3                          | 39                         | 469     | 3,468   |\n|                                 | 2021 | 465                    | 2,885                  | 2                          | 45                         | 467     | 2,930   |\n| Sirma Boshnakova (since 1/2022) | 2022 | 412                    | 739                    | -                          | -                          | 412     | 739     |\n|                                 | 2021 | -                      | -                      | -                          | -                          | -       | -       |\n|                                 | 2022 | 464                    | 1,608                  | 92                         | 804                        | 556     | 2,412   |\n| Dr. Barbara Karuth-Zelle        | 2021 | 353                    | 1,115                  | 45                         | 1,091                      | 398     | 2,206   |\n|                                 | 2022 | 462                    | 2,331                  | 71                         | 1,843                      | 533     | 4,174   |\n| Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler          | 2021 | 461                    | 1,826                  | 79                         | 2,466                      | 540     | 4,292   |\n|                                 | 2022 | 464                    | 2,214                  | 63                         | 445                        | 527     | 2,659   |\n| Ivan de la Sota                 | 2021 | 462                    | 1,708                  | 73                         | 635                        | 535     | 2,343   |\n| Giulio Terzariol                | 2022 | 462                    | 2,460                  | 108                        | 1,001                      | 570     | 3,461   |\n|                                 | 2021 | 461                    | 1,950                  | 104                        | 1,481                      | 565     | 3,431   |\n|                                 | 2022 | 466                    | 3,005                  | 82                         | 1,252                      | 548     | 4,257   |\n| Dr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger          | 2021 | 465                    | 2,484                  | 83                         | 1,779                      | 548     | 4,263   |\n| Christopher Townsend            | 2022 | 412                    | 845                    | -                          | -                          | 412     | 845     |\n|                                 | 2021 | 412                    | 417                    | -                          | -                          | 412     | 417     |\n| Renate Wagner                   | 2022 | 465                    | 1,678                  | 61                         | 176                        | 526     | 1,854   |\n|                                 | 2021 | 464                    | 1,182                  | 63                         | 247                        | 527     | 1,429   |\n| Dr. Andreas Wimmer              | 2022 | 367                    | 1,222                  | 46                         | 237                        | 413     | 1,459   |\n|                                 | 2021 | 42                     | 836                    | 9                          | 289                        | 51      | 1,125   |\n\n- 1\\_Previous closed and frozen plans, including transition payment for Oliver B\u00e4te.\n- 2\\_SC = service cost.

        "page_content": "The following overview compares the annual development of the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management, the average remuneration of the employees, and selected earnings parameters over the last five financial years.\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Board of Management presented  in  the  table  corresponds  to  the  total  remuneration  rewarded and due in the respective financial year. The earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for the Group's financial target achievement -  operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nIt must be noted with regard to the Board of Management remuneration from 2018 to 2019 that the payout for the mid-term bonus (MTB) for 2016 - 2018 is reported in the financial year 2018.\n\nDr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger  received the share-based compensation for the first time in the financial year 2022. The significant change from 2020 to 2021 in Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler's remuneration is explained by the fact that he joined the Board of Management during the year, so the remuneration reported for 2020 is pro rata only. The same rationale applies to the increase from 2021 to 2022 in Dr. Andreas Wimmer's remuneration, as he joined during 2021.\n\nRemuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management for the financial years following their departure comprises mainly pension payments, share-based compensation payouts, and other remuneration.\n\n## Comparative presentation\n\n|

The structure of the Supervisory Board's remuneration is regularly reviewed with regard to its compliance with German, European, and international corporate governance recommendations and regulations.\n\n- -The set total remuneration reflects the scale and scope of the duties of the members of the Board of Management, and is appropriate to the company's activities, and business and financial situation. The contribution to the long-term development of the company by the monitoring activity of the Supervisory Board is also reflected.\n- -The remuneration structure takes into account the individual functions and responsibilities of Supervisory Board members, such as Chair, Vice Chair, or committee mandates.\n- -The remuneration structure allows proper oversight of business as well as independent decisions on executive personnel and remuneration.\n- -In view of the size, complexity and the Allianz Group's long-term performance, the level  of the remuneration for the Supervisory Board is based on the upper quartile of the Supervisory Board remuneration of the companies reported in the DAX.\n\nThe remuneration for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE provides for a  fixed  remuneration.  Supervisory  Board  members  who  had  only served on the Supervisory Board during part of the financial year receive one twelfth of the remuneration for each month of service commenced. This shall apply accordingly for membership of Supervisory Board committees.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Remuneration System was presented to the Annual General Meeting of Allianz SE on 5 May 2021 and was approved with a majority vote of 97.56 %.\n\n## Fixed annual remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of a Supervisory Board member consists of a fixed cash amount paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the business year for services rendered over that period. In 2022, each regular Supervisory Board member received a fixed compensation  amounting  to  \u20ac 125 thou  per  year.  The  Chairperson  received \u20ac 250 thou, each Vice Chairperson received \u20ac 187.5 thou.\n\n## Committee-related remuneration\n\nThe Chairperson and members of the Supervisory Board committees receive additional committee-related remuneration. The committeerelated remuneration is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Attendance fees and expenses\n\nIn addition to the fixed and committee-related remuneration, members of the Supervisory Board receive an attendance fee of \u20ac 1,000 for each Supervisory Board or committee meeting they attend. Should several meetings be held on the same or consecutive days, the attendance fee will only be paid once. In addition, the Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses. The company provides insurance coverage and technical support to the Supervisory Board members to an extent reasonable for carrying out their Supervisory Board duties.",

        "page_content": "## Outlook for 2023\n\nIn 2022, the Board of Management and Supervisory Board regularly dealt with the impact of the new accounting standards IFRS 9 and 17 on profit steering and remuneration. The transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share of assets measured at fair value on the balance sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering options. In the medium term, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board plan to adjust the Group's financial target of net income attributable to shareholders by eliminating certain non-operating effects such as fluctuations from market movements. The new version of the Group target as part of the remuneration system for the Board of Management is to be submitted to the 2024 Annual General Meeting - or at the latest to the 2025 Annual General Meeting - for approval. For the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve will be adjusted in order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of Management cannot control in either direction. For this purpose, 100 % target achievement is defined as a plateau with an upward or downward fluctuation range of \u20ac 500 mn.\n\nAs part of the review of the appropriateness of the remuneration of the Board of Management, a need to adjust the level of remuneration for the Board members at Allianz SE was identified. The remuneration for the regular members of the Board of Management was last adjusted in 2019. In addition, the reduction of the entire Board of Management to nine members and the associated redistribution of tasks led to an increase in the workload for the remaining Board members. The tasks have been redistributed as follows:\n\n- -Allianz Group Regulatory & Public Affairs joined the Group Communications & Reputation and Group Strategy, Marketing & Distribution functions, and Group Audit in reporting to Oliver B\u00e4te.\n- -Allianz's businesses in Latin America, Portugal, and Spain were added to the portfolio of Christopher Townsend.\n- -The Allianz Customer Model for Property-Casualty for Retail was integrated into Property-Casualty for Retail & SME/uni003B the division led by Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler.\n- -Allianz's Center of Competence Life, including its corresponding Allianz Customer Model concept and Allianz Global Life (Ireland), became part of the division led by Andreas Wimmer.\n- -The Allianz Customer Model and Center of Competence for Global Health became part of the division led by G\u00fcnther Thallinger.\n- -Allianz's businesses in Southeast Asia, India, China, and Australia moved to the leadership of Renate Wagner.\n- -Allianz Group Legal and Group Compliance became part of the finance and risk organization led by Giulio Terzariol.\n- -Allianz's businesses in Greece were integrated into Sirma Boshnakova's business divison.\n- -Allianz Group Privacy, as well as Group Data Analytics, became part of the division led by Barbara Karuth-Zelle.\n\nThe Supervisory Board viewed an increase in the annual remuneration at 100 % target achievement of 5 % for all Board members to be appropriate in order to remain attractive in recruiting talent. The target remuneration for regular members of the Board of Management increased from \u20ac 3,251 thou to \u20ac 3,414 thou. The target remuneration for the CEO increased from \u20ac 6,371 thou to \u20ac 6,691 thou, maintaining the ratio of the remuneration of the CEO to a regular Board member at a factor of 1.96.\n\nThe general remuneration cap of \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member of the Board of Management and \u20ac 11,750 thou for the CEO of the Board of Management was not increased.\n\nThe obligation to hold own shares increases with the adjustment of the remuneration, for the CEO from \u20ac 3,822 thou to \u20ac 4,013 thou and for a regular member of the Board of Management from \u20ac 975 thou to \u20ac 1,024 thou.\n\nThe last regular adjustment of the remuneration of the Supervisory Board was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2018. Since then, the sole amendment made was the introduction of remuneration for the members of the Nomination Committee as part of the resolution on the approval of the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board adopted at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2021. In the last few years, however, the workload has increased significantly, both for the full Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board committees, due to steadily growing legal and regulatory requirements and obligations. This applies in particular to the work performed by the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Audit Committee, partly driven by the changes resulting from the German Financial Market Integrity Strengthening Act (FISG) and the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code. Moreover, in view of the increased regulatory requirements regarding the qualifications of members of supervisory boards in the insurance sector, attractive remuneration is indispensable in order to be able to attract suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE.\n\nAgainst this background and in light of the general development of Supervisory Board remuneration in comparable companies, an adjustment of the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members shall be proposed to the Annual General Meeting to be held on 4 May 2023. The annual fixed remuneration shall be increased to \u20ac 150 thou each for regular Supervisory Board members, to \u20ac 450 thou for the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, and to \u20ac 225 thou each for Deputy Chairpersons. At the same time, the additional annual fixed remuneration shall be increased to \u20ac 75 thou each for the members of the Audit Committee, and to \u20ac 150 thou for the Chairperson of the Audit Committee. In all other respects, the existing Remuneration System for the Supervisory Board shall remain unchanged.",

The executive directors and the supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany - IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report including the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive  directors and the  supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of remuneration report including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remuneration report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022, including  the related disclosures, complies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of \u00a7 162 AktG.\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration report required by \u00a7 162 (3) AktG, including the issuance of a report on this audit. As we express an unqualified audit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit opinion includes that the information required by \u00a7 162 (1) and (2) AktG  has been disclosed in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Allianz SE. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform the company as to the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties/uni003B no third parties are included in the scope of protection of the underlying engagement.  \u00a7 334 BGB  [B\u00fcrgerliches  Gesetzbuch:  German  Civil Code], according to which objections arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, is not waived.\n\nMunich, 20 February 2023\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\n\nRichard Burger\n\nFrank Trauschke\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor)\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor)",
