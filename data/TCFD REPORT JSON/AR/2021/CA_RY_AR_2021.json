        "page_content": "## 2021 Reflections\n\n2021 was another year defined by the pandemic and it presented both challenges and opportunities for RBC and those we serve in ways we couldn't have predicted as the year began.\n\nThe rollout of multiple vaccines marked an important step forward in society's collective efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 and a path towards ending the global pandemic. As some normality returned, many of us began to look to the future with greater hope and confidence. Improving business and consumer sentiment spurred on economic activity, reinforcing RBC's view that better days were ahead of us.\n\nAt the same time, however, we learned that progress against the virus didn't follow a predictable or straight line. Successive waves of the virus were devastating in some regions and continued to disrupt lives and livelihoods, and rising cases coupled with an uneven vaccination rollout led to significant market volatility and uncertainty for businesses and consumers.\n\nAnd after more than a year of social distancing and isolation, many people felt fatigued and affected by uncertain times, marked by a rising need to support mental health and well-being.\n\nGeopolitical divisions intensified, and systemic barriers and inequalities exposed by the pandemic became more pronounced, reinforcing the need for meaningful change across our society and institutions. Several events, including the tragic discovery of unmarked Indigenous children's graves at former residential school sites in Canada, only added to the urgency.\n\nMoreover, the frequent impacts of climate change were everpresent as many countries and communities experienced devastating heat waves, floods and other extreme weather events. In 2021, it was never more evident that urgent action is needed to place our planet on a more sustainable path. This will come with significant new costs, and require all of us to understand and make tough choices as society adapts and we all adopt new behaviours.\n\nIt also became clear that the pandemic has accelerated and reshaped our world and our future in permanent ways transforming the way we live, work, shop, and connect with each other. These changes represent tectonic shifts that won't revert back to the way things were.\n\nWithin this uncertain and rapidly evolving context, society and economies showed incredible resilience, backed by significant financial support from governments - facilitated by financial institutions, including RBC, which worked extensively with clients across the spectrum - to help manage through a very challenging first half of the year until we started to see progressive re-opening. These conditions supported increasingly strong client activity and demand throughout 2021, in what was a defining year for RBC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe executed very well in support of our medium-term objectives and vision of the future, and against our balanced scorecard. This meant bringing all our stakeholders - clients, employees, communities, and shareholders - along with us as we helped build a stronger and more sustainable future.\n\n## Our balanced scorecard: Purpose drives performance\n\nLooking back on the year, I'm most proud of the ways our over 87,000 employees led RBC through significant disruption and uncertainty, and responded to our clients and communities while supporting each other. Despite navigating a working environment largely defined by lockdowns, their empathy, care and commitment to those we serve was the most powerful reflection of our culture and Purpose - to help clients thrive and communities prosper. Nowhere was this truer than RBC's annual Employee Giving Campaign which broke previous fundraising records with a combined total of $23 million raised, supporting more charities than ever before.\n\nThanks to our teams, we accelerated our vision to transform our bank for the future while executing and growing through the global pandemic. RBC kept investing in people and technology at a time when others pulled back, and continued building more value for our clients. This is emblematic of how we run the bank, delivering in the short-term while continuing to build for the long-term.\n\nTo support our employees, we doubled down on our commitment to their physical and mental health and well-being, including through new benefits, initiatives and resources for those working on-site, from home or returning to premises. We also gave employees an additional day off and provided them with a mindfulness and meditation app to help manage the mental fatigue of the pandemic.\n\nWe also engaged employees for input on the future of work at RBC. In actively surveying our employees for feedback on their experiences, 88% told us their engagement remained high, and they felt well-supported by RBC leaders. Over 90% said they were proud to be part of RBC. I was also proud RBC continued to be recognized externally as an employer of choice in 2021.",

        "page_content": "This recognition also included the bank's leadership on diversity and inclusion, which is a cornerstone of RBC's values. RBC was awarded the global Catalyst Award in 2021 for the second time in our history. Furthermore, we ranked second in Refinitiv's Top 100 Company Diversity & Inclusion Index, making RBC the topranked company in Banking Services globally and the top ranked organization in Canada. While we are honoured by this recognition and have made good progress, we know there is more to be done and we're committed to accelerating change.\n\nThe biggest testament to our culture and strong employee engagement is how our people have gone above and beyond to serve our 17 million clients, and attract new ones.\n\nOur Canadian Personal & Commercial Banking businesses grew volumes and gained market share in lending, deposits and investments. As a result of this client activity, in Canada, we maintained or extended our #1 and #2 share in key categories of our Personal & Commercial Banking businesses. We also achieved progress in deepening client relationships, both within Canadian Banking, where nearly 19% of clients have all four of transaction accounts, credit cards, investments, and borrowing products with RBC, and between segments. And for the fifth time in six years, J.D. Power ranked RBC highest in retail customer satisfaction in 2021, among our peer banks.\n\nWe also saw strong client activity across our wealth management franchises. In Canadian Wealth Management, we grew assets under administration (AUA) by 26% and, for the 15th consecutive year, RBC Dominion Securities was ranked #1 in advisor satisfaction amongst bank-owned wealth management firms in the 2021 Investment Executive Brokerage Report Card. RBC Global Asset Management gained $45 billion of total net sales with 17% market share of Canadian retail long-term mutual fund flows.\n\nIn the U.S., City National Bank continued to see strong momentum with double-digit growth in loans and deposits. Our U.S. Wealth Management franchise also achieved strong asset growth, in part by hiring experienced advisor teams who are attracted to our clientfirst culture coupled with the capabilities and resources of a large bank, including an integrated technology platform.\n\nOur global Capital Markets businesses generated strong advisory and underwriting activity, deepening client relationships, including financing in support of their strategic objectives. Strong Corporate and Investment Banking results more than offset normalizing Global Markets performance, and robust M&A activity propelled an increase in loan syndication across our core regions. RBC Capital Markets' solid overall business performance in 2021 also helped to offset interest rate pressures in our other businesses, which further reinforces the importance of our diversified model.\n\nCollectively, the growth in our core client franchises speaks to the success of our longstanding strategy to harness the power of our talent and technology with our scale and distribution power to deliver differentiated advice, insights and experiences that create value for clients and deepen relationships across our businesses.\n\nThe biggest testament to our culture and strong employee engagement is how our people have gone above and beyond to serve our 17 million clients.\n\nIn the communities where we live and work, RBC stood tall as an active corporate citizen through the more than $140 million in donations and investments our bank directed throughout 2021 to local community organizations and causes. During the year, we were particularly proud of our initiatives that broaden economic opportunity amongst youth and underrepresented groups, foster community spirit and encourage innovation to address climate change.\n\nA great example of this is RBC Future Launch \u00ae , our 10-year, $500 million commitment to preparing youth for the jobs of tomorrow. With a focus on networking, skills development, practical work experience, and mental well-being supports and services, RBC Future Launch \u00ae is helping prepare youth in critical ways to address the skills shortage and build more inclusive workforces. More than three million young people across Canada have already benefitted from the program run by our 500+ community partners. In 2021, the program relaunched three scholarship programs to support Indigenous, Black and all youth. The scholarships will benefit over 500 youth with tailored resources developed with input from diverse business, academic and non-profit leaders.\n\nMore broadly, RBC used our leadership voice and took action in response to several global events in 2021. We spoke out and supported truth and reconciliation efforts following the tragic discoveries of unmarked graves at residential schools in Canada, and condemned the tragic anti-Muslim hate crime in London, Ontario. In the year's ongoing fight against COVID-19, we provided much needed relief funding through the WHO Foundation when India experienced unparalleled challenges. And we made important donations to humanitarian efforts and disaster relief following the historic power outage in Texas, the wildfires and floods in British Columbia, the Iqaluit water crisis, and the devastating impacts of Hurricane Ida on Haiti. In times of need, RBC was there.\n\nFrom a shareholder's perspective, RBC's overall performance in 2021 demonstrated very strong results, premium shareholder performance, and highlighted our superior ability to manage through a complex and uncertain operating environment while remaining focused on the long-term and investing for future growth. Notably, we have been growing our investments in people and technology throughout the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "During the year, we generated earnings of $16.1 billion and an ROE of 18.6%. Our CET1 ratio stood at 13.7% at year-end, maintaining a strong capital base. Earnings per share grew by 41%, reflecting strong underlying business growth and an improving credit environment, and we delivered $6.2 billion in dividends to our common shareholders. In terms of Total Shareholder Return, RBC outperformed our global peer group over the three- and five-year periods.\n\nFollowing the easing of regulatory restrictions on dividend increases and share buybacks in late 2021, we were pleased to increase our quarterly dividend by 11% and announce our intention to repurchase up to 45 million outstanding common shares, in line with our commitment to create long-term value for our shareholders.\n\n## A complex macro backdrop defines our operating environment\n\nAs the past several years have shown, and 2021 reinforced, the pace of change and disruption in our world has accelerated significantly, in part due to COVID-19, the effect of technology platforms, and evolving consumer expectations. As a result, the context in which we serve and advise clients continues to be defined by an increasingly complex world and big forces of change over the nearand longer-term.\n\nFor example, economies are experiencing a series of supply and demand imbalances that are all happening simultaneously, causing uncertainty and also inflation risk.\n\nImpacting factors include: skills and labour shortages; housing supply; energy supply and prices; changing client preferences; and, unprecedented liquidity and wealth creation. These imbalances add complexity to a smooth transition to a new normal economy.\n\nNotwithstanding these short- to medium-term challenges, I remain cautiously optimistic that we'll see global economic growth through an ongoing recovery over the next 12-24 months based on trends we've experienced in credit card spending, business investment in term assets, and utilization of working capital.\n\n## Confidence in RBC's strategy\n\nOur outlook for the future is bolstered by the combination of several strengths RBC possesses. We have a strong balance sheet, capital and liquidity positions, and our risk and cost discipline as foundational pillars.\n\nNext, the size, scale and reach of our diversified business model and market-leading franchises have significant momentum and focused growth strategies. Our businesses are supported by more than $4 billion in annual technology spend, our great people and investments in talent, backed by our world-class brand.\n\nWe have also been anticipating a more open market with disruptive technology platforms for some time, and have been actively preparing for these competitive forces by continuously evolving our client value proposition and investing in talent and technology.\n\nThese strengths enable differentiation in our markets and reflect how we allocate capital in smart and balanced ways to manage the short-term context and build future growth horizons.\n\nLooking forward, we're adapting RBC for long-term success and executing on our vision for the future by focusing on four key strategic priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Creating a broader value equation for clients and extending our lead in Canada\n- \u00b7 Accelerating growth in the U.S. - our second home market\n- \u00b7 Investing in talent and enhancing our brand as an employer of choice\n- \u00b7 Playing an active leadership role in accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions\n\nDelivering on these priorities while continuing to manage expenses and improve our efficiency will support our transformation and ongoing investments to future proof our bank and widen the gap with the competition.\n\n## Creating a broader value equation for clients, underpinned by significant digital investment, and extending our lead in Canada\n\nAt RBC, we have a strong vision for the future. We know that to remain successful requires us to operate in two worlds - our traditional businesses and the pivot to a far more digital world. Doing so takes more innovation, integration, and breaking down business silos of what we do so we can redefine relationships and create more value for our clients and deepen relationships. We do this in three main ways:\n\n## \u00b7 Digitally enabled, client-centric advice and insights\n\nAs a leader in harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, for years we've been empowering clients, simplifying and digitizing their interactions with us - saving them time, adding convenience and delivering meaningful value and insights which has fostered stronger relationships.\n\nAI-based solutions like NOMI \u00ae deliver personalized services tailored to individual banking needs and NOMI Find & Save \u00ae , for instance, has helped clients save an average of more than $420 per month in fiscal 2021. Since the launch of NOMI \u00ae , close to 2 billion insights have been viewed by clients through RBC's mobile app.\n\nMyAdvisor \u00ae is our online financial planning platform that enables our clients to receive insights and counsel in real time. Since its launch in 2017, more than 2.8 million clients have activated their personalized investment plans.\n\nFor our institutional clients, Capital Markets' AI-based electronic platform, Aiden\u2122, executes trades based on live market data, and dynamically adjusts to new information and learnings from each of its previous actions. Since its inception in March 2018, there have been more than four billion shares and US$158 billion of notional volumes traded through Aiden\u2122.",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Delivering more value\n\nWe are continually focused on providing clients with more value for money, and rewarding them for the depth and breadth of their relationship with us, and extending unique offers through the power of our partnerships.\n\nThrough RBC Vantage\u2122, our enhanced everyday banking value proposition in Canada, clients can use their personal debit cards to earn RBC Rewards \u00ae points and have more ways to save on monthly account fees.\n\nRBC Ampli\u2122, our consumer cash-back app, allows us to increasingly partner with merchants across Canada to provide even more value to our retail and business clients. We have expanded our slate of partners who continue to be a differentiator for RBC, adding 43 new merchants in 2021, including Lyft, McDonald's, Lowe's, and other leading retailers.\n\n## \u00b7 Moving Beyond Banking\n\nAnother differentiated element of our strategy is building ecosystems that go beyond banking to enable RBC to participate in a broader part of the client journey and value chain - reimagining our business and the role we play.\n\nIn 2021, we continued the momentum in our RBC Ventures business, with 14 Ventures in market, six moved to national scale, and several others in validation mode or development. These Ventures have attracted over four million registered users, or new connections with RBC that go beyond banking in three core ecosystems - business, home and new to banking.\n\nOne example is in the increasingly competitive Canadian commercial and small business segment. Several of these capabilities are made in RBC proprietary solutions. Ownr \u00ae , an RBC Venture, has helped over 55,000 entrepreneurs launch their businesses using its online platform, including over 26,000 this year, while driving a significant proportion of our small business acquisition. With RBC Insight Edge\u2122, our business clients can leverage aggregated data to gain relevant insights into their markets to enable them to attract more clients.\n\nWe have also made investments in building a digital platform with enriched payments and cash management capabilities for our business clients. RBC PayEdge\u2122 helps our clients save time and money with a secure solution for automating the accounts payable and reconciliation process.\n\nThis expanded ecosystem approach and continuum of offerings allows us to support our clients and attract new ones with differentiated advice and solutions, and creates competitive advantages for RBC that will help enable us to extend our lead in Canada and grow at a premium to peers.\n\n## Accelerating growth in the U.S. - our second home market\n\nRBC has a unique and differentiated strategy in the U.S. - to be the preferred partner to corporate, institutional and high net worth clients and their businesses through our core client franchises City National Bank, U.S. Wealth Management and Capital Markets. We've been consistently executing on our client-centric approach, leveraging the strength of RBC's balance sheet to support clients and making ongoing investments in talent and technology to support future growth.\n\nFor example, at City National, we've added US$14 billion in loans over the last two years, including over US$5 billion in mortgages. In U.S. Wealth Management, we're the sixth largest advisory firm by AUA and we added over US$130 billion of AUA, growing client assets 30% year-over-year and surpassing US$550 billion for the first time. And, in Capital Markets, we're the 11th largest global investment bank by fees and continue to deepen relationships with clients and earn high-quality mandates.\n\nThroughout, we've consistently added talent to our platform, including ultra high net worth private banking teams in high growth regions, including on the U.S. east coast and in our core California markets, experienced financial advisors, and investment bankers in key verticals, such as technology, healthcare and aerospace.\n\nLooking forward, we believe we are well-positioned to accelerate growth by deepening relationships in our core franchises to deliver our full expertise to all our clients, including in key sectors like entertainment. We will also focus on driving greater cross-sell, such as through mortgages and banking into wealth management, and expanding other growth vectors such as our recently launched mid-market corporate banking strategy which has already booked US$1.8 billion in new commitments in the first year. Finally, as we pursue our growth ambitions in the U.S., RBC will also consider highly targeted acquisitions to augment our strong organic growth strategies or enhance our existing capabilities, provided there is a near- and long-term view to shareholder value creation.\n\n## Investing in talent and enhancing our brand as an employer of choice\n\nOur focus on attracting and retaining the people and capabilities needed to propel us forward in the world of work is underpinned by our Purpose-led values and unique culture.\n\nKey to our success is continuing to foster a diverse and inclusive culture that celebrates unique perspectives and embraces the power of diversity to drive innovation and growth. We have established ourselves as a change leader on diversity and are exceeding the goals we set for hiring BIPOC youth and investing in Black entrepreneurship. We've made significant progress on BIPOC executive appointments, which represented 43% of appointments in 2021, up from 23% in 2020, surpassing our goal of 30% for the year. And we've focused on advancing women in leadership, with women representing 41% of executive appointments and 54% of promotions.",

        "page_content": "## Accelerating growth in the U.S.\n\nLooking forward, we're well positioned to accelerate growth by deepening relationships in our core franchises to deliver our full expertise to all our clients.\n\nOur success as a leading digitally enabled relationship bank means building and hiring skills, such as data, design, app development and product ownership, enabling RBC to create seamless and exceptional client experiences. Through the pandemic, it has become even more important to attract and retain these skills, and our efforts resulted in over 600 digital hires in 2021, with an offer acceptance rate of 95%. We also expanded our existing Tech Hubs and announced plans to welcome 300 tech employees over the next three years to a new Calgary Innovation Hub.\n\nAs we transition into the future world of work, we're increasing our investments in talent, including leadership growth and development, and enhancing the overall employee experience. This includes challenging assumptions about how and where work is done. Teams across RBC are establishing work arrangements that best match their needs and strategies, with an objective to hold onto the best of everything we've learned over the past 18 months, while recapturing what we've missed from our pre-pandemic world. We're also transforming the way we deliver learning experiences and development programs by expanding virtual offerings and micro-learning resources, along with creating more meaningful connections through coaching and mentoring opportunities. Underpinning our commitment to supporting our people is a greater focus on mental health and well-being to enable employees to achieve their goals and thrive in an increasingly complex world.\n\nFinally, as a strong believer in the power of work-integrated learning, RBC provides meaningful, paid work experiences to students from high school to post-graduate programs. More than 2,000 students joined us in 2021, and we remain committed to continuing to grow the next generation of talent.\n\n## Playing an active leadership role in accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions\n\nClimate is a complex issue and one of the most pressing of our age. It presents risk but also opportunity. Global plans to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions down to net-zero by 2050 requires the largest change to our economies in our lifetime, change that RBC is fully committed to supporting. RBC believes we need to make this transition in an orderly fashion so we create prosperity for society rather than destroy industries and sectors that our economies and social fabric rely upon.\n\nRBC will engage through our people and capabilities in every sector and community to address climate change in four key ways: eliminate our own emissions; support our clients with transition financing; monitor and measure our clients' progress; and, be a leader within Canada to advance climate solutions through thought leadership and policy for change and active partnerships across public and private sectors, technology experts and Indigenous leadership.\n\nWe have committed $500 billion in sustainable financing by 2025 and are well on our way to meeting this commitment. Through a wide range of products, services and advice, we will continue to help our personal, commercial and institutional clients across all sectors and regions where we operate, establish and accelerate their climate plans, achieve their goals and adapt to net-zero.\n\nHow we collectively make the transition is just as important as the destination itself. Getting this transition right will not be easy, but we must move forward together with a sense of urgency and thoughtful action.\n\n## RBC is well-positioned to build on our Purpose and performance\n\nRBC enters 2022 with market-leading client franchises in our core businesses and key markets. A world-renowned brand, an engaged workforce, and a culture recognized for elevating the performance of our people. And our financial discipline, risk management culture and robust capital position provides the foundation to deliver sustainable growth for the long-term.\n\nWe will continue to align our Purpose with performance to grow RBC in a more inclusive, sustainable world, and create value for all of our stakeholders - clients, employees, communities, and shareholders.\n\nAs we move forward, we will continue to leverage the size and strength of our balance sheet to support our clients. And we believe that our 'bionic' blend of great people and technology will remain a key success factor, creating differentiated offerings and solutions that attract new clients and deepen existing relationships.\n\nWe will continue to prioritize a disciplined focus on expense management to remain financially and strategically flexible. We will also continue to prioritize investments to accelerate growth, and sustain leadership in areas of strategic focus. By doing so, we can find new and engaging ways to fulfill our Purpose.\n\nOur continued momentum is the result of our tremendous employees, and the oversight and counsel of our Board. I am so thankful for everything they do.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## David McKay\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer",

The bank's financial discipline, risk management culture as well as robust capital position provided a solid foundation for growth today and into the future. RBC's talented team of more than 87,000 people around the world - inspired by Purpose, guided by values and empowered by technology created the differentiated client experiences that the bank is known for. Their efforts also helped to fulfill the promises RBC makes in the communities in which it serves.\n\nProviding this kind of certainty to all of our stakeholders, especially in a time of great change and disruption, reinforced the trust and confidence our stakeholders have in the bank.\n\nIndeed, over the past year RBC employees could count on the bank's unwavering commitment to prioritize their safety, health and well-being, and to sustain a work environment that empowers people to be their best. Millions of clients also relied on RBC to place their wants and needs at the centre of everything we do, and to find new ways to create value for them. Indeed, as Dave McKay points out in his letter, in a year of uncertain and rapidly evolving circumstances, client activity levels were strong and demand high across business lines, reflecting the trust they placed in RBC in 2021. And, at the same time thousands of communities looked to RBC to help create a more inclusive, sustainable and prosperous future.\n\nWe are especially proud of the bank's conscious choice to lead on issues that matter most to those we serve. In particular, Dave McKay has been a catalyst for important policy discussions on re-imagining the post-pandemic economy, a vocal advocate for small- and medium-sized businesses, and a strong promoter of an orderly transition to a net-zero world.\n\nIn combination, these commitments help explain why the bank's engaged workforce continued to earn high satisfaction levels with clients, deliver market-leading results in business volume and market share growth, and build momentum in areas of strategic importance, including in the United States. These efforts have also driven superior shareholder returns. Indeed, over three- and fiveyear periods, the bank's Total Shareholder Return has outperformed its global peers.\n\nFor the Board, the vast majority of our work was still done remotely in 2021, as we stayed agile to support management in the first full year of the pandemic. But importantly, we never lost sight of our agenda and core responsibilities to ensure RBC has the right strategy and execution, talent and risk management to deliver value in the near- and longer-term.\n\nWe engaged with management on all businesses and, in some cases, subset of businesses to ensure plans were carefully developed. The bank's approach to its climate action plan was an important area of focus in 2021. This included evaluating the bank's strategy and ensuring its clarity and viability. It also included an assessment of the measurement and milestones necessary to gauge meaningful progress in the years ahead. In aligning the net-zero ambitions of the bank with the needs of society, we are collectively in a better position to serve the broader goal of an orderly - and inclusive - transition to a cleaner economy. To this end, the central tenets of our plan are designed to support clients in their own net-zero journey, be publicly accountable for our actions, including financed emissions, and contribute ideas on how we can move forward together in a coordinated way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board continued its work on succession planning for senior management. Directors regularly engaged with senior managers to maintain our connection with high-potential leaders, either through special Board presentations or dedicated sessions. Last year, we also focused on the orderly transition of the bank's new Chief Financial Officer, the assumption of responsibilities for RBC Ventures by the Group Head, Personal & Commercial Banking, as well as the appointment of a Chief Legal Officer, reporting to our CEO. These changes build strength and capacity in our senior executive team while reinforcing the bank's ongoing efforts to enhance its diversity.\n\nOn matters related to diversity and inclusion, the symmetry between management and the Board is paramount, as it helps create a holistic approach to advance the bank's goals. In 2021, the appointment of Roberta Jamieson to our Board underscores the inherent value in bringing more voices from different backgrounds to our table. Heading into 2022, I am proud to say 46% of Board members are women, and 23% are Black, Indigenous and People of Colour.\n\nPromoting strong risk conduct and embedding a risk management culture throughout RBC are also key priorities for the Board. In 2021, the Board carefully assessed whether management's plans appropriately balance strategic opportunities with risk discipline and we continued to provide oversight on key regulatory matters where RBC operates. The overall strength of our portfolios speak to the soundness of our risk strategy and execution.\n\nAn array of awards and accolades highlight the success of the bank's efforts last year, some of which are cited in the preceding pages. I am most proud of what these recognitions say about how the bank's highly engaged teams make meaning of RBC's Purpose every day. Our gratitude goes out to each and every employee, especially those on the frontlines, who never lost focus on serving others, even as the global pandemic continued to pose risks to them and their communities. Indeed, the collective actions reveal the kind of organization RBC is and aspires to be - ever-present, empathic and responsive to help our clients thrive and communities prosper. I join Dave in saying the collective response of RBC employees was my greatest point of pride in 2021.\n\nI also want to express my gratitude to each RBC Director for their invaluable insight and counsel, and acknowledge the important contributions of Alice Laberge, Michael McCain and Heather Munroe-Blum, who retired from our Board in 2021.\n\nOn behalf of the RBC Board, I also want to convey our confidence in, and support for, Dave McKay and his executive team. In 2021, their leadership reinforced the considerable strengths RBC possesses to create value for its clients, employees, communities, and shareholders as the bank brings its Purpose to life in everything it does.\n\nKathleen Taylor Chair of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->",

Forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our financial performance objectives, vision and strategic goals, climate related goals, the Economic, market, and regulatory review and outlook for Canadian, U.S., European and global economies, the regulatory environment in which we operate, the Strategic priorities and Outlook sections for each of our business segments, the risk environment including our credit risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, and the potential continued impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on our business operations, financial results, condition and objectives and on the global economy and financial market conditions and includes our President and Chief Executive Officer's statements. The forward-looking information contained in this document is presented for the purpose of assisting the holders of our securities and financial analysts in understanding our financial position and results of operations as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, as well as our financial performance objectives, vision and strategic goals, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as 'believe', 'expect', 'foresee', 'forecast', 'anticipate', 'intend', 'estimate', 'goal', 'plan' and 'project' and similar expressions of future or conditional verbs such as 'will', 'may', 'should', 'could' or 'would'.\n\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, which give rise to the possibility that our predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that our assumptions may not be correct and that our financial performance objectives, vision and strategic goals will not be achieved. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these statements as a number of risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements. These factors - many of which are beyond our control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict - include: credit, market, liquidity and funding, insurance, operational, regulatory compliance (which could lead to us being subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, the potential outcome of which could include regulatory restrictions, penalties and fines), strategic, reputation, competitive, legal and regulatory environment, and systemic risks and other risks discussed in the risk sections and Impact of COVID-19 pandemic section of this 2021 Annual Report including business and economic conditions, information technology and cyber risks, environmental and social risk (including climate change), digital disruption and innovation, Canadian housing and household indebtedness, geopolitical uncertainty, privacy, data and third-party related risks, regulatory changes, culture and conduct, the business and economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate, the effects of changes in government fiscal, monetary and other policies, tax risk and transparency, and the emergence of widespread health emergencies or public health crises such as pandemics and epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global economy, financial market conditions and our business operations, and financial results, condition and objectives. In addition, as we work to advance our climate goals, external factors outside of RBC's reasonable control may act as constraints on their achievement, including varying decarbonization efforts across economies, the need for thoughtful climate policies around the world, more and better data, reasonably supported methodologies, technological advancements, the evolution of consumer behaviour, the challenges of balancing interim emissions goals with an orderly and just transition, and other significant considerations such as legal and regulatory obligations.\n\nWe caution that the foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results. When relying on our forwardlooking statements to make decisions with respect to us, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this 2021 Annual Report are set out in the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section and for each business segment under the Strategic priorities and Outlook headings. Except as required by law, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by us or on our behalf.\n\nAdditional information about these and other factors can be found in the risk sections and Impact of COVID-19 pandemic section of this 2021 Annual Report.",

If this information or these assumptions are not accurate, actual economic outcomes may differ materially from the outlook presented in this section.\n\n## Economic and market review and outlook\n\nWhile the global economic recovery has continued, momentum has waned amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reopening of economies and the significant fiscal and monetary policy stimulus put in place to support the recovery are contributing to stronger GDP growth and improved labour market conditions globally, though this remains uneven. Although increasing vaccination rates are expected to support a continued economic recovery, exceptional government support programs have begun to wind down, and uncertainty remains regarding the emergence and progression of new variants of COVID-19 and the potential impact of vaccine hesitancy. Supply chain disruptions, rising business input costs, and labour shortages are also limiting the pace of further improvement, particularly in goods-producing industries, and adding to rising inflation concerns.\n\n## Canada\n\nCanadian GDP is expected to increase by 5.1% in calendar 2021 following a 5.2% contraction in calendar 2020. Activity in highcontact service sectors like restaurants and accommodations improved over the summer as provincial economies reopened, although travel-related industries remain depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. Output on the goods-producing side of the economy is being constrained by ongoing supply chain disruptions. Consumer price growth has accelerated as the economy",

        "page_content": "reopened, and higher business input costs driven by rising demand and supply chain disruptions are threatening further increases at above pre-pandemic rates through calendar 2022. Although the unemployment rate remained above pre-pandemic levels at 6.7% in October, labour markets have improved substantially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and are expected to continue to improve into 2022. While government support programs have begun to wind down, household purchasing power continues to be supported by large amounts of savings. An improved economic growth backdrop and above-target inflation rates are expected to prompt the Bank of Canada (BoC) to begin raising interest rates in calendar 2022. GDP is expected to increase a further 4.3% in calendar 2022. Despite substantial improvement to date, the economy has yet to fully recover from the impacts of the pandemic, particularly in the high-contact and travel service sectors.\n\n## U.S.\n\nU.S. GDP is expected to increase 5.5% in calendar 2021 after a 3.4% contraction in calendar 2020. The pace of the economic recovery slowed over the summer amid ongoing supply chain disruptions and the continued spread of COVID-19 in some regions. While employment remains well below pre-pandemic levels, labour markets have continued to improve with the unemployment rate declining to 4.6% in October, down from 6.9% a year earlier. Consumer spending on goods has declined from elevated levels in the spring of 2021 but spending on services has increased as spending rotates away from merchandise and back to leisure and hospitality services that have been in many cases unavailable through the pandemic. Households have accumulated substantial savings, in part due to exceptional government income transfers, to support a further recovery in spending as the virus threat continues to ease. Consumer prices have increased sharply as the economy has re-opened. Higher business input costs and expected further growth in household demand are increasing the risk that inflation growth will persist at rates above prepandemic levels for longer than expected. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has committed to maintaining extraordinary policy support until the economic slack is fully absorbed and the labour market has recovered. The Fed is expected to begin the process of raising interest rates in calendar 2022.\n\n## Europe\n\nEuro area GDP is expected to rise by 5.2% in calendar 2021 following a 6.5% drop in calendar 2020, amid lifting of most containment measures across member states. Similarly, U.K. GDP is projected to rise by 7.1% in calendar 2021 after a larger 9.7% decline in 2020. Labour market conditions also improved throughout the year, both in the U.K. and Euro area. While labour shortages and supply chain challenges continue to curtail businesses' abilities to increase production to meet rising demand, leading to inflation concerns, a further economic rebound in both the Euro area and the U.K. is expected in calendar 2022, though likely at a slower pace relative to 2021 in light of these challenges. In the U.K., the Bank of England is expected to begin raising interest rates before the end of calendar 2021, while the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to hold policy rates through calendar 2022.\n\n## Financial markets\n\nGovernment bond yields remain low but have risen in the latter half of calendar 2021 as the global economic recovery has continued and inflation rates have risen. Equity markets have broadly continued to improve, supported by the positive economic outlook, and prices for some raw materials, including crude oil, have increased to well above pre-pandemic levels reflecting limited supply and rising demand as the virus threat eases globally.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nWe continue to monitor and prepare for regulatory developments and changes in a manner that seeks to ensure compliance with new requirements, while mitigating adverse business or financial impacts. Such impacts could result from new or amended laws or regulations and the expectations of those who enforce them. A high level summary of the key regulatory changes that have the potential to increase or decrease our costs and the complexity of our operations is included in the Legal and regulatory environment risk section of this 2021 Annual Report. A summary of the additional regulatory changes instituted by governments globally and by OSFI in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are included in the Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and Capital management sections of this 2021 Annual Report.\n\nFor a discussion on risk factors resulting from these and other developments which may affect our business and financial results, refer to the risk sections of this 2021 Annual Report. For further details on our framework and activities to manage risks, refer to the Impact of COVID-19 pandemic, risk and Capital management sections of this 2021 Annual Report.\n\n## Defining and measuring success through total shareholder returns\n\nOur focus is to maximize total shareholder returns (TSR) through the achievement of top half performance compared to our global peer group over the medium-term (3-5 years), which we believe reflects a longer-term view of strong and consistent financial performance.\n\nMaximizing TSR is aligned with our three strategic goals discussed earlier and we believe represents the most appropriate measure of shareholder value creation. TSR is a concept used to compare the performance of our common shares over a period of time, reflecting share price appreciation and dividends paid to common shareholders. The absolute size of TSR will vary depending on market conditions, and the bank's position reflects the market's perception over a period of time of our overall performance relative to our peers.\n\nFinancial performance objectives are used to measure our performance against our medium-term TSR objectives and are used as goals as we execute against our strategic priorities. We review and revise these financial performance objectives as economic, market and regulatory environments change.",

The breadth and depth of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and financial markets has continued to evolve with disruptive effects in countries in which we operate and beyond, while also contributing to increased market volatility and changes to the macroeconomic environment. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to affect our employees, clients and communities, with resultant impacts on our operations, financial results and present and future risks to our business.\n\nMeasures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including business closures, social distancing protocols, travel restrictions, school closures, quarantines, and restrictions on gatherings and events, have been widespread. These measures have had and continue to have extensive implications for the global economy, including the pace and magnitude of recovery, as well as on related market functions, unemployment rates, inflation, fiscal and monetary policies and supply chains. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, including through the emergence and progression of new variants of COVID-19 in different regions, governments continue to adjust their response and approach to the pandemic. While rising vaccination rates have supported a substantial or full easing of containment measures in some regions, progress towards re-opening has been accompanied by resurgences in the spread of COVID-19 and the re-imposition of restrictions in other regions. Consequently, the extent of containment measures and progress towards reopening continues to vary and fluctuate across regions. Despite positive developments, uncertainty remains regarding new variants of COVID-19, the potential impact of vaccine hesitancy, and global vaccine supply and availability, including uneven vaccine access across regions. All of these factors contribute to the uncertainty regarding the timing of a full recovery. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic, the containment measures and the phased reopening approach taken in many regions could have longer-term effects on economic and commercial activity and consumer behaviour after the COVID-19 pandemic recedes and containment measures are fully lifted. In conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures, governments, regulatory bodies, central banks and private organizations around the globe have provided and continue to provide unprecedented relief programs and temporary measures to facilitate the continued operation of the global economy and financial system, all of which are intended to provide support to individuals and businesses. While some programs and temporary measures have come to an end, others remain in place or have continued to be developed in an effort to support the overall economy. We expect that governments, regulatory bodies, central banks and private organizations will continue to assess the need for these programs and measures.",

Results across all of our business segments have been and continue to be impacted to varying degrees by downstream implications from changes in the macroeconomic environment, including lower interest rates, changes in consumer spending patterns, market volatility, fluctuations in credit spreads, as well as other impacts including changes in credit risk, increased client-driven volumes and changes in operating costs. Notwithstanding these challenges, our financial results and condition amid these challenges demonstrate the resilience of our capital and liquidity positions, which have been bolstered by our position of strength at the time of entering this crisis and throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the potential effects and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the uncertainty of the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on the economy and society as a whole, as well as the timeline of the transition to a fully reopened economy, the future impact on our businesses and our financial results and condition remains uncertain.\n\n## Impact of pandemic risk factor\n\nPandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease in Canada or worldwide could have an adverse impact on our business, including changes to the way we operate, and on our financial results and condition. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, given its severity and scale, has affected and may continue to adversely affect our business and our clients to varying degrees, and also continues to pose risks to the global economy. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and regulatory bodies in affected areas imposed a number of measures designed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, including widespread business closures, social distancing protocols, travel restrictions, school closures, quarantines, and restrictions on gatherings and events. While rising vaccination rates have supported a substantial or full easing of containment measures in a number of regions, the extent of containment measures and progress towards reopening continues to vary and fluctuate across different regions. As a result, containment measures continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and global economic activity, including the pace and magnitude of recovery. As the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, the prolonged effects of the disruption continue to have an impact on our business strategies and initiatives, and could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nGovernments, monetary authorities, regulators and financial institutions, including us, have taken and continue to take actions in support of the economy and financial system. These actions include fiscal, monetary and other financial measures to increase liquidity, and provide financial aid to individual, small business, commercial and corporate clients. We expect that these governments, monetary authorities, regulators, and institutions will continue to assess the need for these programs and measures. Additionally, we implemented various temporary relief programs beyond the available government programs to further support our clients in financial need. Although the temporary relief programs have largely concluded, we have assessed and will continue to assess the needs of each individual client and continue to provide support to clients on a case by case basis. For more information on these programs, refer to the Relief programs, Liquidity and funding risk and Capital management sections.\n\nUncertainty remains as to the full impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, financial markets, and us, including on our financial results, regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and ability to meet regulatory and other requirements. The ultimate impacts will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope, severity, duration and additional subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of actions and measures taken by government, monetary and regulatory authorities and other third parties. Despite positive developments, uncertainty remains regarding new variants of COVID-19, the potential impact of vaccine hesitancy, and global vaccine supply and availability, including uneven vaccine access.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to result in disruptions to some of our clients and the way in which we conduct our business and could continue to adversely impact our business operations and the quality and continuity of service to clients. We have taken proactive measures through our business continuity plans to adapt to the ongoing work from home arrangements and carefully plan the return to premise for some of our employees, and are maintaining our focus on the well-being of our employees and our ability to serve clients.\n\nIn addition to the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our business, it may also continue to increase financial stress, possibly arising from support programs coming to an end, on some of our clients. This, in conjunction with operational constraints due to the impacts of social distancing, could lead to increased pressure on the financial performance of some of our clients, which, to some extent, creates uncertainty around potential future expected credit losses for us.\n\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic is further prolonged, including the possibility of additional subsequent waves, or further diseases emerge that give rise to similar effects, the adverse impact on the economy could deepen and could potentially result in volatility and declines in financial markets. Moreover, it remains uncertain how the macroeconomic environment, and societal and business norms will be impacted following the COVID-19 pandemic. Unexpected developments in financial markets, regulatory environments, or consumer behaviour and confidence may also have adverse impacts on our financial results and condition, business operations and reputation, for a substantial period of time.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the potential continued effects and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to be an evolving situation.\n\nIn virtually all aspects of our operations, our view of risks is not static as our business activities expose us to a wide variety of risks. Consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), we actively manage our risks to help protect and enable our businesses. Additionally, we continue to evaluate the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have on our business, including the impact on our top and emerging risks, operational and reputational risks as well as credit, market and liquidity and funding risks. For further details on our Top and emerging and Operational risks, refer to the risk sections in this 2021 Annual Report.\n\n## Relief programs\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several government programs have been developed to provide financial aid to individuals and businesses, which include wage replacement for individuals, wage subsidies and rent relief for businesses, and lending",

To further support our clients in financial need, various temporary relief programs were launched beyond the available government programs.\n\n## RBC relief programs\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, we announced the RBC Client Relief program which aimed to provide relief for clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The RBC Client Relief program for the majority of our commercial and small business clients closed on June 30, 2020 and loan deferrals within the program closed for retail clients on September 30, 2020. Payment deferral periods for clients that participated in these programs largely concluded by the end of the second quarter of 2021, however we have assessed and will continue to assess the needs of each individual client and continue to provide support to clients on a case by case basis.\n\n## Government programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n## Government of Canada\n\nCommencing in the second quarter of 2020, the Department of Finance Canada announced new programs and revisions to existing programs to help support the functioning of markets and finance businesses while ensuring the financial sector remains sound, well-capitalized and resilient, in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. To support businesses experiencing cash flow challenges during this unprecedented time, the Canadian Federal government established the following significant programs in which Canadian financial institutions are assisting with financial relief:\n\n- GLYPH<129> The Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) - Under this program, Canadian banks were able to facilitate interest-free loans of up to $60,000 to existing eligible small business clients as a source of liquidity for immediate operating costs. The loans were funded by the Government of Canada, with the Canadian banks retaining no credit risk. The application window for the CEBA program closed on June 30, 2021.\n- GLYPH<129> Export Development Canada (EDC) Business Credit Availability Program Guarantee - Under this program, Canadian banks are able to provide existing eligible mid-sized and large business clients, focused on both export oriented and domestic sales-based businesses, with loans of up to $6.25 million to support short-term liquidity needs. These loans must be used for certain operating costs and are 80% guaranteed by the EDC. On June 2, 2021, the EDC announced that the application deadline for this program has been extended to December 31, 2021.\n- GLYPH<129> Business Development Canada (BDC) Co-Lending Program - Under this program, the BDC and Canadian banks jointly provide loans, which are funded based on an 80%/20% split, respectively, to eligible business clients of up to $6.25 million to meet their operational and liquidity needs. The maximum loan varies by the size of the business and may be structured with an interest-only payment obligation for the first year. On June 2, 2021, the BDC announced that the application deadline for this program has been extended to December 31, 2021.\n- GLYPH<129> BDC Mid-Market Financing Program - Under this program, the BDC and Canadian banks provide loans, which are funded based on a 90%/10% split, respectively, to eligible mid-sized business clients ranging between $12.5 million and $60 million to meet their operational and liquidity needs. On June 2, 2021, the BDC announced that the application deadline for this program has been extended to December 31, 2021.\n- GLYPH<129> EDC Mid-Market Guarantee and Financing Program - Under this program, Canadian banks are able to provide existing eligible mid-sized and large business clients, focused on both export oriented and domestic sales-based businesses, with loans ranging from $12.5 million to a maximum of $80 million for terms up to 5 years, to support their liquidity needs. These loans must be used for certain operating costs and are 75% guaranteed by the EDC. On June 2, 2021, the EDC announced that the application deadline for this program has been extended to December 31, 2021.\n- GLYPH<129> On January 26, 2021, the Canadian Federal government announced the BDC Highly Affected Sectors Credit Availability Program (HASCAP). Under this program, Canadian banks are able to provide low-interest loans ranging from $25,000 to $1 million to businesses that have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to cover operational cash flow needs. Loans funded under this program are fully guaranteed by the BDC. The application deadline for this program has been extended from June 30, 2021 to December 31, 2021.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, we have facilitated the administration of relief to more than 203,100 clients (July 31, 2021 - 200,900) who have enrolled in the Canadian federal government programs, with corresponding exposures of $12 billion (July 31, 2021 - $12 billion), of which $11 billion (July 31, 2021 - $11 billion) was funded. For further details, refer to Note 6 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## U.S. Government\n\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law, which is in addition to other programs that were enacted by the U.S. Federal Government. As part of the CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) offers small businesses with loans, guaranteed by the U.S. Federal Government, to support the payment of payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. Through this program, we have provided loans directly to our clients based on their assessment of certain eligibility requirements and failure to meet these requirements will result in recourse actions for the borrower. In some cases, the U.S. Small Business Administration may forgive all or a portion of the loan.\n\nOn June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (Flexibility Act) was signed into law, which amends the CARES Act and is intended to provide additional relief from the original terms of the PPP, including but not limited to, the extension of the period available for support payments from 8 to 24 weeks after PPP loan origination, the extension of the maturity of PPP loans granted from two to five years and the modification of eligibility requirements. Applications for the PPP closed on August 8, 2020.\n\nIn January 2021, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, pursuant to the 'Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act' (Economic Aid Act) relaunched the PPP, extending it through March 31, 2021, and announced a number of updates to the PPP for current and future loans. The expanded program includes new categories of eligible expenses, including operating expenditures, property damage costs, supplier costs and worker protection expenditures, in addition to payroll costs, utilities and mortgage interest. Borrowers are also provided with additional flexibility, including the ability to set their covered period for forgivable expenditures to be any length between 8 and 24 weeks. Certain borrowers with existing PPP loans may qualify for a second draw loan and may be eligible for a supplemental increase to their first draw. On March 30, 2021, the 'PPP Extension Act' was signed into law, extending the PPP for an additional",

The application window for the PPP closed on May 31, 2021.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, loans outstanding under the PPP were $2 billion (US$2 billion) (July 31, 2021 - $3 billion, (US$3 billion)) to 10,441 clients (July 31, 2021 - 12,220 clients).\n\n## Programs in support of liquidity and funding\n\nCommencing in the second quarter of 2020, governments and federal agencies expanded the eligibility criteria to existing funding programs and announced new programs to provide further liquidity to banks as well as providing additional sources to access funding to support clients during this time of uncertainty. The majority of these measures or programs have been discontinued or are winding down and we expect that governments and federal agencies will continue to assess the need for these programs as the global economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor further details on how we are managing our liquidity and funding profile, refer to the Liquidity and funding risk section of this 2021 Annual Report.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n## Overview\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020\n\nNet income of $16,050 million increased $4,613 million or 40% from last year. Diluted EPS of $11.06 was up $3.24 or 41% and ROE of 18.6% was up 440 bps. Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 13.7%, up 120 bps from last year.\n\nOur results reflected higher earnings in Personal & Commercial Banking, Capital Markets, Wealth Management, and Insurance, partially offset by lower earnings in Investor & Treasury Services. The prior year reflected elevated provisions on performing loans due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which unfavourably impacted results in Personal & Commercial Banking, Capital Markets and Wealth Management, whereas current year results reflect releases of provisions on performing loans primarily driven by improvements in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook.\n\nFor further details on our business segment results and CET1 ratio, refer to the Business segment results and Capital management sections, respectively.\n\n## Impact of foreign currency translation\n\nThe following table reflects the estimated impact of foreign currency translation on key income statement items:\n\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts)   | Table 5  2021 vs. 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Increase (decrease):                                       |                          |\n| Total revenue                                              | $ (977)                  |\n| PCL                                                        | 28                       |\n| Non-interest expense                                       | (707)                    |\n| Income taxes                                               | (50)                     |\n| Net income                                                 | (248)                    |\n| Impact on EPS                                              |                          |\n| Basic                                                      | $ (0.17)                 |\n| Diluted                                                    | (0.17)                   |\n\nThe relevant average exchange rates that impact our business are shown in the following table:\n\n| (Average foreign currency equivalent of C$1.00) (1)   |   2021 |   Table 6   2020 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| U.S. dollar                                           |  0.796 |            0.744 |\n| British pound                                         |  0.579 |            0.579 |\n| Euro                                                  |  0.668 |            0.658 |",

Higher insurance premiums, investment and fee income (Insurance revenue) and credit fees also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. The impact of foreign exchange translation decreased total revenue by $977 million.\n\nNet interest income decreased $833 million or 4%, largely reflecting lower trading revenue in Capital Markets and the impact of foreign exchange translation. In Canadian Banking and U.S. Wealth Management (including City National), volume growth more than offset the impact of lower spreads.\n\nNIM was down 7 bps compared to last year, largely reflecting lower spreads in U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) driven by the impact of lower interest rates and changes in average earning assets mix, and lower spreads in Canadian Banking primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and changes in product mix.\n\nInsurance revenue increased $239 million or 4%, mainly reflecting higher group annuity sales as well as business growth, both of which are largely offset in PBCAE. These factors were partially offset by the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities and the impact of realized investment gains in the prior year.\n\nInvestment management and custodial fees increased $1,031 million or 17%, primarily driven by higher average fee-based client assets reflecting market appreciation and net sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nMutual fund revenue increased $539 million or 15%, primarily due to higher average fee-based client assets reflecting market appreciation and net sales in Wealth Management, and higher average mutual fund balances driving higher distribution fees in Canadian Banking.\n\nUnderwriting and other advisory fees increased $373 million or 16%, mainly due to higher M&A activity and higher equity origination, across most regions.\n\nCredit fees increased $209 million or 16%, primarily driven by higher loan syndication activity across most regions. Other revenue increased $624 million or 72%, largely attributable to changes in the fair value of the hedges related to our U.S. share-based compensation plans, which was largely offset in Non-interest expense, and the impact of economic hedges.\n\n## Additional trading information\n\n|                                  | Table 8   | Table 8   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)   | 2021      | 2020      |\n| Net interest income (1)          | $ 2,623   | $ 3,459   |\n| Non-interest income              | 1,183     | 1,239     |\n| Total trading revenue            | $ 3,806   | $ 4,698   |\n| Total trading revenue by product |           |           |\n| Interest rate and credit         | $ 1,948   | $ 2,838   |\n| Equities                         | 1,285     | 1,234     |\n| Foreign exchange and commodities | 573       | 626       |\n| Total trading revenue            | $ 3,806   | $ 4,698   |",

The PCL on loans ratio of (10) bps decreased 73 bps.\n\nFor further details on PCL, refer to Credit quality performance in the Credit risk section.\n\n## Insurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense (PBCAE)\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020\n\nPBCAE of $3,891 million increased $208 million or 6% from last year, mainly reflecting higher group annuity sales and business growth, both of which are largely offset in revenue. Lower favourable investment-related experience and a lower impact from reinsurance contract renegotiations also contributed to the increase.

We provide services that are administrative in nature, including safekeeping, collecting investment income, settling purchase and sale transactions, and record keeping. Underlying investment strategies within AUA are determined by our clients and generally do not impact the administrative fees that we receive. Administrative fees can be impacted by factors such as asset valuation level changes from market movements, types of services administered, transaction volumes, geography and client relationship pricing based on volumes or multiple services.\n\nOur Investor & Treasury Services business is the primary business segment that has AUA with approximately 73% of total AUA, as at October 31, 2021, followed by our Wealth Management and Personal & Commercial Banking businesses with approximately 21% and 6% of total AUA, respectively.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020\n\nAUA increased $456 billion or 8% from last year, primarily reflecting market appreciation, partially offset by lower client activity in Investor & Treasury Services and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nThe following table summarizes AUA by geography and asset class:\n\n| AUA by geographic mix and asset class  (Millions of Canadian dollars)   | 2021        | Table 11   2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Canada  (1)                                                             |             |                   |\n| Money market                                                            | $ 42,700    | $ 42,800          |\n| Fixed income                                                            | 772,400     | 763,500           |\n| Equity                                                                  | 781,400     | 591,200           |\n| Multi-asset and other                                                   | 1,150,400   | 954,800           |\n| Total Canada                                                            | 2,746,900   | 2,352,300         |\n| U.S.  (1)                                                               |             |                   |\n| Money market                                                            | 49,800      | 40,100            |\n| Fixed income                                                            | 90,400      | 107,300           |\n| Equity                                                                  | 256,000     | 195,400           |\n| Multi-asset and other                                                   | 324,600     | 256,000           |\n| Total U.S.                                                              | 720,800     | 598,800           |\n| Other International  (1)                                                |             |                   |\n| Money market                                                            | 32,800      | 40,700            |\n| Fixed income                                                            | 308,200     | 375,400           |\n| Equity                                                                  | 865,000     | 837,200           |\n| Multi-asset and other                                                   | 1,673,600   | 1,686,800         |\n| Total International                                                     | 2,879,600   | 2,940,100         |\n| Total AUA                                                               | $ 6,347,300 | $ 5,891,200       |",

Management fees are paid by the investment funds and other clients for the investment capabilities of an investment manager and can also cover administrative services. Management fees may be calculated daily, monthly or quarterly as a percentage of the AUM, depending on the distribution channel, product and investment strategies. In general, equity strategies carry a higher fee rate than fixed income or money market strategies. Fees are also impacted by asset mix and relationship pricing for clients using multiple services. Higher risk assets generally produce higher fees, while clients using multiple services can take advantage of synergies which reduce the fees they are charged. Certain funds may have performance fee arrangements where fees are recorded when certain benchmarks or performance targets are achieved. These factors could lead to differences in fees earned by product and therefore net return by asset class may vary despite similar average AUM. Our Wealth Management segment is the primary business segment that has AUM with approximately 99% of total AUM as at October 31, 2021.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020\n\nAUM increased $165 billion or 20% from last year, primarily due to market appreciation and net sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nThe following table presents the change in AUM for the year ended October 31, 2021:\n\n| Client assets -

        "page_content": "## How we measure and report our business segments\n\nOur management reporting framework is intended to measure the performance of each business segment as if it were a standalone business and reflects the way that the business segment is managed. This approach is intended to ensure that our business segments' results include all applicable revenue and expenses associated with the conduct of their business and depicts how management views those results.\n\n## Key methodologies\n\nThe following outlines the key methodologies and assumptions used in our management reporting framework. These are periodically reviewed by management to ensure they remain valid.\n\n## Expense and tax allocation\n\nTo ensure that our business segments' results include expenses associated with the conduct of their business, we allocate costs incurred or services provided by Technology & Operations and Functions, which are directly undertaken or provided on the business segments' behalf. For other costs not directly attributable to our business segments, including overhead costs and other indirect expenses, we use our management reporting framework for allocating these costs to each business segment in a manner that is intended to reflect the underlying benefits.\n\n## Capital attribution\n\nOur management reporting framework also determines the attribution of capital to our business segments in a manner that is intended to consistently measure and align economic costs with the underlying benefits and risks associated with the activities of each business segment. The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as attributed capital. Unattributed capital and associated amounts are reported in Corporate Support. For further information, refer to the Capital management section.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing refers to the pricing of intra-company borrowing or lending for management reporting purposes. We employ a funds transfer pricing process to enable risk-adjusted management reporting of segment results. This process determines the costs and revenue for intra-company borrowing and lending of funds after taking into consideration our interest rate risk and liquidity risk management objectives, as well as applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n## Provisions for credit losses\n\nPCL is recorded to recognize estimated credit losses on all financial assets, except for financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity securities designated as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), which are not subject to impairment assessment. For details on our accounting policy on Allowance for credit losses (ACL), refer to Note 2 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nPCL is included in the results of each business segment to fully reflect the appropriate expenses related to the conduct of each business segment.\n\nIn addition to the key methodologies described above, the following components of our management reporting framework also impact how our business segments are managed and reported:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Wealth Management results include disclosure in U.S. dollars, primarily for U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) as we review and manage the results of this business largely in this currency.\n- GLYPH<129> Capital Markets results are reported on a teb basis, which grosses up total revenue from certain tax-advantaged sources (Canadian taxable corporate dividends and the U.S. tax credit investment business) to their effective taxable equivalent value with a corresponding offset recorded in the provision for income taxes. We record the elimination of the teb adjustments in Corporate Support. We believe these adjustments are useful and reflect how Capital Markets manages its business, since it enhances the comparability of revenue and related ratios across taxable revenue and our principal taxadvantaged sources of revenue. The use of teb adjustments and measures may not be comparable to similar GAAP measures or similarly adjusted amounts disclosed by other financial institutions.\n- GLYPH<129> Corporate Support results include all enterprise level activities that are undertaken for the benefit of the organization that are not allocated to our five business segments, such as certain treasury and liquidity management activities, including amounts associated with unattributed capital, and consolidation adjustments, including the elimination of the teb gross-up amounts. In addition, we record gains (losses) on economic hedges of our U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) share-based compensation plans, which are reflected in revenue, and related variability in share-based compensation expense driven by changes in the fair value of liabilities relating to these plans in Corporate Support as we believe this presentation more closely aligns with how we view business performance and manage the underlying risks.",

        "page_content": "## Key performance and non-GAAP measures\n\n## Performance measures\n\nWe measure and evaluate the performance of our consolidated operations and each business segment using a number of financial metrics, such as net income and ROE. Certain financial metrics, including ROE, do not have a standardized meaning under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other financial institutions.\n\n## Return on common equity\n\nWe use ROE, at both the consolidated and business segment levels, as a measure of return on total capital invested in our business. Management views the business segment ROE measure as a useful measure for supporting investment and resource allocation decisions because it adjusts for certain items that may affect comparability between business segments and certain competitors.\n\nOur consolidated ROE calculation is based on net income available to common shareholders divided by total average common equity for the period. Business segment ROE calculations are based on net income available to common shareholders divided by average attributed capital for the period. For each segment, average attributed capital includes the capital required to underpin various risks as described in the Capital management section and amounts invested in goodwill and intangibles.\n\nThe attribution of capital involves the use of assumptions, judgments and methodologies that are regularly reviewed and revised by management as deemed necessary. Changes to such assumptions, judgments and methodologies can have a material effect on the business segment ROE information that we report. Other companies that disclose information on similar attributions and related return measures may use different assumptions, judgments and methodologies.\n\n| Calculation of ROE                                         | Table 14                        | Table 14                      | Table 14   | Table 14                       | Table 14         | Table 14           | Table 14     | Table 14   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|------------|\n|                                                            | 2021                            | 2021                          | 2021       | 2021                           | 2021             | 2021               | 2021         | 2020       |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars,  except percentage amounts) | Personal &  Commercial  Banking | Wealth  Management  Insurance |            | Investor &  Treasury  Services | Capital  Markets | Corporate  Support | Total        | Total      |\n| Net income available to  common shareholders               | $ 7,761  $                      | 2,577  $                      | 882  $     | 431  $                         | 4,119  $         |                    | 11  $ 15,781 | $ 11,164   |\n| Total average common  equity (1), (2)                      | 24,200                          | 16,200                        | 2,350      | 3,100                          | 22,550           | 16,450             | 84,850       | 78,800     |\n| ROE (3)                                                    | 32.0%                           | 15.9%                         | 37.4%      | 14.0%                          | 18.3%            | n.m.               | 18.6%        | 14.2%      |\n\n## Non-GAAP measures\n\nWe believe that certain non-GAAP measures described below are more reflective of our ongoing operating results and provide readers with a better understanding of management's perspective on our performance. These measures also enhance the comparability of our financial performance for the year ended October 31, 2021 with the results from last year. Non-GAAP measures (including non-GAAP ratios) do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other financial institutions.\n\nThe following discussion describes the non-GAAP measures we use in evaluating our operating results.\n\n## Adjusted efficiency ratio\n\nOur efficiency ratio is impacted by the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities, which is reported in revenue and largely offset in PBCAE. The adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP ratio and is calculated using adjusted total revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure as it excludes the impact from the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities. We believe the adjusted efficiency ratio is a useful measure as changes in the fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities can lead to volatility in total revenue that could obscure trends in underlying business performance and reduce comparability with prior periods.\n\n| Consolidated non-GAAP efficiency ratio   | Table 15    | Table 15                 | Table 15   | Table 15    | Table 15                 | Table 15   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------|\n|                                          | 2021        | 2021                     | 2021       | 2020        | 2020                     | 2020       |\n|                                          |             | Item excluded            |            |             | Item excluded            |            |\n|                                          |             | Change in fair value     |            |             | Change in fair value     |            |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars,           |             | of investments backing   |            |             | of investments backing   |            |\n| except percentage amounts)               | As reported | policyholder liabilities | Adjusted   | As reported | policyholder liabilities | Adjusted   |\n| Total revenue                            | $ 49,693    | $ 13                     | $ 49,706   | $ 47,181    | $ (277)                  | $ 46,904   |\n| Non-interest expense                     | 25,924      | -                        | 25,924     | 24,758      | -                        | 24,758     |\n| Efficiency ratio                         | 52.2%       |                          | 52.2%      | 52.5%       |                          | 52.8%      |",

We are focused on building deep and meaningful relationships with our clients, underscored by our exceptional client experience, the breadth of our product suite, our depth of expertise, and the features of our digital solutions.\n\n## > 14 million\n\n## 8 million\n\n## 36,675\n\nNumber of clients\n\nActive digital users in Canada 1\n\nEmployees\n\n## Revenue by business lines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 73%  Personal  Banking\n- 23%  Business  Banking\n- 4%  Caribbean and U.S. Banking\n\n## 2021 Operating environment\n\n- \u203a While impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to persist, client activity improved driving strong volume and fee-based revenue growth throughout fiscal 2021 as economies re-opened due to progress on vaccination distribution, reduced containment measures and continued government support. Further, as businesses began re-opening, unemployment rates also improved.\n- \u203a Improvements in the credit environment, driven by the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, led to favourable changes in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook, resulting in releases of provisions on performing assets. Lower provisions on impaired loans in our Canadian Banking retail portfolios also reflected the economic recovery underway and the continued impact of the COVID-19 related government support programs.\n- \u203a Personal and business deposits continued to see significant growth throughout fiscal 2021, reflecting clients' preference for the safety of higher cash balances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u203a Housing activity was strong with record levels of mortgage originations in fiscal 2021. Despite the industry-wide tightening of mortgage lending criteria in the third quarter, low interest rates and demand for housing continued to support strong growth in residential mortgages.\n- \u203a Throughout fiscal 2021, we saw favourable market conditions resulting in solid growth in mutual fund balances from a combination of market appreciation and strong net sales. We also saw significant market activity in the first half of the fiscal year which benefitted our Direct Investing business. While market activity moderated in the second half of the fiscal year, average trading volumes remained above pre-pandemic levels.\n- \u203a The ongoing low interest rate environment continued to be a headwind in fiscal 2021, resulting in a further decline in NIM. NIM was also negatively impacted by changes in product mix and competitive pricing pressures.\n- \u203a Client preferences for digital offerings continue to evolve and this shift has been accelerated due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continued to invest in digital solutions to improve the client experience and deliver personalized advice.\n- \u203a Our Caribbean Banking business continued to be negatively impacted by the ongoing low interest rate environment; however, we also saw releases of provisions on performing assets. We also closed the sale of our Eastern Caribbean operations in the second quarter of 2021.\n- \u203a In the U.S., earnings were unfavourably impacted by the low interest rate environment and severe limitations on cross-border travel, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n1\n\nWe operate through two businesses - Canadian Banking and Caribbean & U.S. Banking. Canadian Banking serves our home market in Canada, where we maintain top (#1 or #2) rankings in market share for all key retail and business products. We have the largest branch network, the most ATMs and one of the largest mobile sales forces across Canada. In Caribbean & U.S. Banking, we offer a broad range of financial products and services in targeted markets.\n\nIn Canada, we compete with other Schedule 1 banks, independent trust companies, foreign banks, credit unions, caisses populaires, and auto financing companies.\n\nIn the Caribbean, our competition includes banks, trust companies and investment management companies serving retail and corporate clients, as well as public institutions. In the U.S., we compete primarily with other Canadian banking institutions that have U.S. operations.",

The BoC and other central banks are expected to begin raising interest rates in fiscal 2022. Ongoing inflationary pressures also have the potential to impact our results in fiscal 2022. We will continue to pursue industry-leading volume growth, operational efficiency efforts and channel transformation to achieve our vision of being a digitally-enabled relationship bank.\n\nIn the Caribbean, an economic recovery is expected as travel and tourism continue to improve, supported by rising vaccination rates. Continued fiscal stimulus and accommodative monetary conditions in some countries are expected to bolster consumer spending and unemployment relief. We will continue to focus on growth strategies in our target markets, improving operational efficiency, and adding value for our clients.\n\nFor further details on our general economic review and outlook, refer to the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section.\n\n| Personal & Commercial Banking                                                    | Table 16   | Table 16   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except percentage amounts and as otherwise noted) | 2021       | 2020       |\n| Net interest income                                                              | $ 12,621   | $ 12,568   |\n| Non-interest income                                                              | 5,725      | 5,163      |\n| Total revenue                                                                    | 18,346     | 17,731     |\n| PCL on performing assets                                                         | (909)      | 1,818      |\n| PCL on impaired assets                                                           | 722        | 1,073      |\n| PCL                                                                              | (187)      | 2,891      |\n| Non-interest expense                                                             | 7,978      | 7,946      |\n| Income before income taxes                                                       | 10,555     | 6,894      |\n| Net income                                                                       | $ 7,847    | $ 5,087    |\n| Revenue by business                                                              |            |            |\n| Canadian Banking                                                                 | $ 17,570   | $ 16,838   |\n| Personal Banking                                                                 | 13,337     | 12,703     |\n| Business Banking                                                                 | 4,233      | 4,135      |\n| Caribbean & U.S. Banking                                                         | 776        | 893        |\n| Key ratios                                                                       |            |            |\n| ROE                                                                              | 32.0%      | 21.7%      |\n| NIM                                                                              | 2.51%      | 2.67%      |\n| Efficiency ratio                                                                 | 43.5%      | 44.8%      |\n| Operating leverage (1)                                                           | 3.1%       | (3.1)%     |\n| Selected balance sheet information                                               |            |            |\n| Average total assets                                                             | $ 527,100  | $ 494,600  |\n| Average total earning assets, net                                                | 502,000    | 470,200    |\n| Average loans and acceptances, net                                               | 505,600    | 473,400    |\n| Average deposits                                                                 | 504,300    | 447,300    |\n| Other information                                                                |            |            |\n| AUA (2), (3)                                                                     | $ 367,700  | $ 292,800  |\n| Average AUA                                                                      | 340,800    | 287,600    |\n| AUM (3)                                                                          | 5,400      | 5,300      |\n| Number of employees (FTE)                                                        | 36,675     | 35,964     |\n| Credit information                                                               |            |            |\n| PCL on impaired loans as a % of average net loans and acceptances                | 0.14%      | 0.23%      |\n| Other selected information - Canadian Banking                                    |            |            |\n| Net income                                                                       | $ 7,620    | $ 5,077    |\n| NIM                                                                              | 2.50%      | 2.64%      |\n| Efficiency ratio                                                                 | 42.0%      | 43.2%      |\n| Operating leverage                                                               | 2.9%       | (3.3)%     |\n\n## Financial performance 2021 vs. 2020\n\nNet income increased $2,760 million or 54% from last year, primarily attributable to lower PCL. Average volume growth of 10% in Canadian Banking and higher non-interest income also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by lower spreads.\n\nTotal revenue increased $615 million or 3%, largely due to average volume growth in Canadian Banking of 7% in loans and 13% in deposits, and higher average mutual fund balances driving higher distribution fees. Increased client activity also contributed to higher card service revenue, securities brokerage commissions and foreign exchange revenue. These factors were partially offset by lower spreads.\n\nNIM decreased 16 bps, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and changes in product mix.\n\nPCL decreased $3,078 million, as last year reflected elevated provisions on performing loans due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to releases in the current year primarily driven by improvements in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook. Lower provisions on impaired loans in our Canadian Banking retail portfolios also contributed to the decrease, resulting in a decrease of 9 bps in the PCL on impaired loans ratio.

Average deposits increased $57 billion or 13%, reflecting growth in business and personal deposits.\n\n## Business line review\n\nIn Canada, we operate through two business lines: Personal Banking and Business Banking.\n\n## Personal Banking\n\nPersonal Banking offers a full range of products focused on meeting the needs of our individual Canadian clients at every stage of their lives through a wide range of financing and investment products and services. This includes home equity financing, personal lending, chequing and savings accounts, private banking, indirect lending (including auto financing), mutual funds and self-directed brokerage accounts, Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), credit cards, and payment products and solutions.\n\nWe rank #1 or #2 in market share for all key Personal Banking products in Canada and our retail banking network is the largest in Canada with 1,182 branches and 4,032 ATMs.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nTotal revenue increased $634 million or 5% compared to last year, largely reflecting average volume growth of 8% and higher average mutual fund balances of 17% driving higher distribution fees. Increased client activity also contributed to higher card service revenue, securities brokerage commissions and foreign exchange revenue. These factors were partially offset by lower spreads driven by the ongoing impact of the low interest rate environment and changes in product mix.\n\nAverage residential mortgages increased 12% compared to last year, largely driven by strong housing activity driving record mortgage originations, partially offset by higher mortgage prepayment activity.\n\nAverage deposits increased 9% from last year, largely driven by clients' preference for the safety of higher cash balances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n| Selected highlights                              | Table 17   | Table 17   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except number of) | 2021       | 2020       |\n| Total revenue                                    | $ 13,337   | $ 12,703   |\n| Other information                                |            |            |\n| Average residential mortgages                    | 305,400    | 273,200    |\n| Average other loans and acceptances, net         | 74,800     | 77,800     |\n| Average deposits                                 | 270,500    | 248,100    |\n| Average credit card balances                     | 16,600     | 18,100     |\n| Credit card purchase volumes                     | 132,400    | 118,100    |\n| Branch mutual fund balances (1)                  | 205,500    | 166,000    |\n| Average branch mutual fund balances              | 191,300    | 163,600    |\n| AUA - Self-directed brokerage (1)                | 135,900    | 96,400     |\n| Number as at October 31:                         |            |            |\n| Branches                                         | 1,182      | 1,201      |\n| ATMs                                             | 4,032      | 4,182      |\n\n## Average residential mortgages, loans and deposits (Millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The U.S. Fed and other central banks are expected to begin raising interest rates in fiscal 2022. Ongoing inflationary pressures also have the potential to impact our results in fiscal 2022.\n\nWe believe our diversified businesses are well-positioned to continue growing our leading position in Canada and increasing our market share in the HNW and UHNW client segments globally, leveraging the strength of our brand, reputation and solid financial position. Our strategy remains unchanged as we continue to focus on delivering an unmatched client experience through holistic goals-based advice, attracting and retaining top-performing advisors, and collaborating across the enterprise to bring our full breadth of capabilities to our clients. We will continue to invest in our people and technology to improve client and advisor experiences, drive operational efficiencies, and further strengthen our risk, compliance and controls infrastructure to meet heightened regulatory requirements.\n\nFor further details on our general economic review and outlook, refer to the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section.",

These factors were partially offset by higher variable compensation and the impact of lower spreads.\n\nTotal revenue increased $1,166 million or 10%, mainly due to higher average fee-based client assets reflecting market appreciation and net sales, as well as average volume growth of 10% in loans and 17% in deposits. These factors were partially offset by lower spreads and the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nPCL decreased $261 million in U.S. Wealth Management (including City National), as last year reflected elevated provisions on performing loans due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to releases in the current year primarily driven by improvements in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook. Provisions on impaired loans in the prior year as compared to recoveries in the current year also contributed to the decrease, resulting in a decrease of 9 bps in the PCL on impaired loans ratio. For further details, refer to Credit quality performance in the Credit risk section.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $806 million or 9%, mainly due to higher variable compensation commensurate with improved results. A legal provision in U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) as well as higher technology and staffrelated costs also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nAUA and AUM increased $222 billion or 20% and $164 billion or 20%, respectively, primarily due to market appreciation and net sales, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\n## Business line review\n\n## Canadian Wealth Management\n\nCanadian Wealth Management includes our full-service Canadian wealth advisory business, which is the largest in Canada as measured by AUA, with over 1,900 investment advisors providing comprehensive financial solutions with a focus on HNW and UHNW clients.

As a result, we continued to evolve our robust frameworks, controls and risk culture to protect clients and meet the expectations of both federal and provincial regulators.\n- \u203a In the U.K., there was a strong and sustained appetite for longevity risk transfer as companies continued to actively manage longevity risk. As a result, the longevity reinsurance market remained highly competitive in fiscal 2021.

Forces of change include evolving client expectations, accelerated digital disruption, and distribution innovation. Government and regulatory pressures are also expected to continue into fiscal 2022. As consumers focus more attention on overall health and well-being, we will continue to deliver services and create industry partnerships to assist our clients. In this rapidly evolving industry and economic environment, we will seek to maintain our strength through investments in technology, product and service innovation, efficient distribution channels, and a strong risk culture. We will also continue to redefine how we advise our clients and seek to provide them peace of mind. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has created more awareness of the importance of financial security and has prompted people to take a closer look at their insurance coverage. We see this renewed demand continuing to drive growth opportunities. We believe that delivering on our business strategy will allow us to continue to thrive in this changing environment.\n\nFor further details on our general economic review and outlook, refer to the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section.",

These factors were partially offset by lower favourable investment-related experience, including the impact of realized investment gains in the prior year, as well as a lower impact from reinsurance contract renegotiations.\n\nTotal revenue increased $239 million or 4%, mainly reflecting higher group annuity sales as well as business growth, both of which are largely offset in PBCAE as indicated below. These factors were partially offset by the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities and the impact of realized investment gains in the prior year.\n\nPBCAE increased $208 million or 6%, mainly reflecting higher group annuity sales and business growth, both of which are largely offset in revenue. Lower favourable investment-related experience and a lower impact from reinsurance contract renegotiations also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities, favourable annual actuarial assumption updates in the current year largely related to mortality and economic assumptions, and lower claims costs mainly in our travel and disability products.\n\nNon-interest expense increased $4 million or 1%, as higher legal costs were largely offset by the benefit of ongoing efficiency initiatives.\n\n## Business line review\n\n## Canadian Insurance\n\nWe offer life, health, travel, home, and auto insurance products (in partnership agreement with Aviva Canada), wealth accumulation solutions, and payout annuities to individual, group, HNW, and business clients across Canada. Our life and health portfolio includes participating whole life, universal life, term life, critical illness, disability, and group benefits such as long-term disability, and health and dental. Wealth solutions include a family of segregated funds as well as individual payout annuities. Our travel products include out-of-province/country medical coverage, and trip cancellation and interruption insurance.\n\nOur group annuities business helps defined benefit pension plan sponsors better manage and control risk. RBC Insurance has a set of strategies and initiatives aimed at building our momentum and positioning us for growth in this product line where companies are increasingly looking to transfer the risks associated with their pension obligations to insurance companies either through group annuity contracts or longevity swap products.\n\nIn Canada, many of our competitors specialize in life and health or property and casualty products. As a multi-line carrier, we offer a broad suite of solutions for individuals and businesses, including disability, life, home, auto and travel products along with wealth, group health and dental and pension solutions. Within these product lines, we hold market leadership positions in disability insurance and wealth products.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nTotal revenue decreased $57 million or 2% from last year, mainly due to the change in fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities and the impact of realized investment gains in the prior year. These factors were partially offset by higher group annuity sales and business growth, primarily in segregated fund and individual life products, both of which are largely offset in PBCAE.",

While we expect some benefit from rising interest rates in fiscal 2022, ongoing fee reductions, competition from global custody providers in key markets and the impact of reduced client activities are expected to constrain revenue growth. Ongoing inflationary pressures also have the potential to impact our results in fiscal 2022. Improving operational efficiency and completing ongoing repositioning initiatives will continue to be a priority. We will focus on business opportunities in our chosen fast-growing markets and segments where we have competitive advantages, and leveraging our investment in technology to enable our clients' success.\n\nWe will continue to prioritize prudent risk and funding management amidst an evolving interest rate and liquidity environment. Market liquidity levels are anticipated to remain elevated as monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative.\n\nFor further details on our general economic review and outlook, refer to the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section.\n\n| Investor & Treasury Services                                                     | Table 31    | Table 31    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except percentage amounts and as otherwise noted) | 2021        | 2020        |\n| Net interest income                                                              | $ 460       | $ 329       |\n| Non-interest income                                                              | 1,704       | 1,982       |\n| Total revenue                                                                    | 2,164       | 2,311       |\n| PCL on performing assets                                                         | (8)         | 6           |\n| PCL on impaired assets                                                           | -           | -           |\n| PCL                                                                              | (8)         | 6           |\n| Non-interest expense                                                             | 1,589       | 1,589       |\n| Income before income taxes                                                       | 583         | 716         |\n| Net income                                                                       | $ 440       | $ 536       |\n| Key ratios                                                                       |             |             |\n| ROE                                                                              | 14.0%       | 15.9%       |\n| Selected balance sheet information                                               |             |             |\n| Average total assets                                                             | $ 235,400   | $ 204,300   |\n| Average deposits                                                                 | 219,800     | 187,900     |\n| Average client deposits                                                          | 64,400      | 63,000      |\n| Average wholesale funding deposits                                               | 155,400     | 124,900     |\n| Other information                                                                |             |             |\n| AUA (1)                                                                          | $ 4,640,900 | $ 4,483,500 |\n| Average AUA                                                                      | 4,634,900   | 4,386,300   |\n| Number of employees (FTE) (2)                                                    | 3,718       | 3,851       |\n\n## Estimated impact of U.S. dollar, British pound and Euro translation on key income statement items\n\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except percentage amounts)       | 2021 vs. 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Increase (decrease):                                            |                 |\n| Total revenue                                                   | $ (22)          |\n| PCL                                                             | -               |\n| Non-interest expense                                            | (15)            |\n| Net income                                                      | (9)             |\n| Percentage change in average U.S. dollar equivalent of C$1.00   | 7%              |\n| Percentage change in average British pound equivalent of C$1.00 | -               |\n| Percentage change in average Euro equivalent of C$1.00          | 2%              |",

        "page_content": "## Financial performance 2021 vs. 2020\n\nNet income decreased $96 million or 18% from last year, primarily driven by lower revenue from client deposits and funding and liquidity.\n\nTotal revenue decreased $147 million or 6%, mainly due to lower client deposit revenue largely driven by lower interest rates. Lower funding and liquidity revenue also contributed to the decrease, mainly reflecting net favourable impacts from market volatility and interest rate movements in the prior year, as well as the impact of lower interest rates and lower gains from the disposition of securities, partially offset by a greater impact in the prior year from elevated enterprise liquidity.\n\nNon-interest expense remained relatively flat as higher technology-related costs and higher net costs associated with ongoing efficiency initiatives were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\n## Capital Markets\n\nRBC Capital Markets \u00ae is a premier global investment bank providing expertise in advisory & origination, sales & trading, and lending & financing to corporations, institutional investors, asset managers, private equity firms and governments globally. Our professionals ensure that clients receive the advice, products, and services their businesses need from 58 offices in 14 countries.

In Canada, we are a market leader with a strategic presence in all lines of capital markets businesses. In the U.S., where our competitors include large global investment banks, we have a full industry sector coverage and investment banking product range, as well as capabilities in credit, secured lending, municipal finance, fixed income, currencies & commodities, and equities.\n\nOutside North America, we have a targeted strategic presence in the U.K. & Europe, Australia, Asia & other markets aligned to our global expertise. In the U.K. & Europe, we offer a diversified set of capabilities in key industry sectors of focus. In Australia and Asia, we compete with global and regional investment banks in targeted areas aligned to our global expertise, including fixed income distribution and currencies trading, secured financing, as well as corporate and investment banking.\n\n## 2021 Operating environment\n\n- \u203a The fiscal 2021 operating environment was characterized by a rebound in investment banking activity as a result of robust deal flow commensurate with global investment banking fee pool growth of 37% 1 . Equity Capital Markets (ECM), M&A, and loan syndication fee pools reached record highs during the fiscal year, benefitting from the re-opening of economies resulting in strong deal flow, compared to a muted environment in the prior fiscal year against an uncertain economic outlook and backdrop.\n- \u203a Trading activity was elevated in the first quarter of the fiscal year as markets continued to benefit from volatility-driven tailwinds that characterized the second half of 2020. However, toward the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, trading results began to be impacted by market normalization, albeit remaining above pre-pandemic levels. This was particularly prevalent in fixed income trading which saw results impacted by reduced client activity. Repo-related financing also decreased driven by spread compression as the market became more liquid and client demand for secured funding declined.\n- \u203a Improvements in the credit environment, driven by the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, led to favourable changes in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook, resulting in releases of provisions on performing assets and lower provisions on impaired loans.\n\n1",

We will continue to pursue market share growth opportunities in our Investment Banking business, with a focus on targeted sectors and investment in talent. While we anticipate our trading businesses will continue to be impacted by normalization, our focus remains on delivering robust results across our Global Markets franchise through continued resource optimization, acceleration of cross-selling activities, further deployment of electronic and digital capabilities, and building on our strong risk management practices. In Corporate Banking, we will continue to pursue a moderate growth approach consistent with our focus on our balance sheet-enabled strategy to deepen relationships with lending clients in order to drive growth in our non-lending businesses. This strategy will continue to be underpinned by strong credit risk management practices, optimization of risk-weighted assets (RWA), and supporting our clients in the execution of their strategies.\n\nFor further details on our general economic review and outlook, refer to the Economic, market and regulatory review and outlook section.",

These factors were partially offset by higher taxes reflecting an increase in the proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions, and lower revenue in Global Markets.\n\nTotal revenue increased $303 million or 3%, mainly due to higher M&A and loan syndication activity, as well as higher equity trading revenue, across most regions. Lower residual funding costs, higher revenue associated with certain non-trading portfolios, higher equity origination across most regions, and gains from the disposition of certain investment securities also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by lower fixed income trading revenue across all regions due to spread compression in repo and secured financing products and reduced client activity, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nPCL decreased $1,748 million, as last year reflected elevated provisions on performing assets due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to releases in the current year primarily driven by improvements in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook.

For debt and equity origination, revenue is allocated between Corporate and Investment Banking and Global Markets based on the contribution of each group in accordance with an established agreement.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCorporate and Investment Banking revenue of $4,823 million increased $792 million or 20% from last year.\n\nInvestment Banking revenue increased $802 million or 46%, primarily due to higher M&A and loan syndication activity across most regions. Higher fixed income trading revenue in the U.S. and Europe, reflecting the impact of loan underwriting markdowns in the prior year, higher equity origination across most regions, and higher revenue associated with certain non-trading\n\nportfolios also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nLending and other revenue remained relatively flat.\n\n| Selected highlights                | Table 33   | Table 33   |\n|------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)     | 2021       | 2020       |\n| Total revenue  (1)                 | $ 4,823    | $ 4,031    |\n| Breakdown of revenue  (1)          |            |            |\n| Investment banking                 | 2,559      | 1,757      |\n| Lending and other (2)              | 2,264      | 2,274      |\n| Other information                  |            |            |\n| Average assets                     | 81,400     | 92,600     |\n| Average loans and acceptances, net | 73,300     | 83,000     |\n\n## Global Markets\n\nGlobal Markets comprises our sales and trading businesses including fixed income, foreign exchange, commodities, and equities, as well as our repo and secured financing products.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nGlobal Markets revenue of $5,542 million decreased $709 million or 11% from last year.\n\nRevenue in our Fixed income, currencies and commodities business decreased $365 million or 11%, largely driven by lower fixed income trading revenue across all regions due to reduced client activity, and the impact of foreign exchange translation.

Reported results for Corporate Support mainly reflect certain activities related to monitoring and oversight of enterprise activities which are not allocated to business segments.

The following identifies material items affecting the reported results in each year.\n\nTotal revenue and Income taxes (recoveries) in each period in Corporate Support include the deduction of the teb adjustments related to the gross-up of income from Canadian taxable corporate dividends and the U.S. tax credit investment business recorded in Capital Markets. The amount deducted from revenue was offset by an equivalent increase in Income taxes (recoveries).\n\nThe teb amount for the year ended October 31, 2021 was $518 million and was $513 million last year. For the year ended October 31, 2021, revenue included gains of $394 million (October 31, 2020: gains of $90 million) on economic hedges of our U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) share-based compensation plans, and non-interest expense included $382 million (October 31, 2020: $89 million) of share-based compensation expense driven by changes in the fair value of liabilities relating to our U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) share-based compensation plans.\n\nThe following identifies the material items, other than the teb impacts noted previously, affecting the reported results in each year.\n\n## 2021\n\nNet income was $61 million, primarily due to asset/liability management activities and residual unallocated items, partially offset by net unfavourable tax adjustments.\n\n## 2020\n\nNet income was $53 million, largely due to asset/liability management activities, partially offset by net unfavourable tax adjustments and residual unallocated costs.\n\n## Quarterly financial information\n\n## Fourth quarter performance\n\n## Q4 2021 vs. Q4 2020\n\nFourth quarter net income of $3,892 million was up $646 million or 20% from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.68 was up $0.45 and return on common equity (ROE) of 16.9% was up 90 bps. Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.7% was up 120 bps from a year ago. Our results reflected higher earnings across all of our business segments.\n\nTotal revenue increased $1,284 million or 12%, mainly due to higher group annuity sales, which is largely offset in PBCAE as indicated below, and higher average fee-based client assets reflecting market appreciation and net sales. Higher M&A activity across all regions and higher revenue associated with certain non-trading portfolios in Capital Markets also contributed to the increase. In Canadian Banking and U.S. Wealth Management (including City National), volume growth more than offset the impact of lower spreads. These factors were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation, and lower fixed income trading revenue across all regions as the prior year benefitted from increased client activity amidst elevated market volatility.\n\nTotal PCL decreased $654 million and the PCL on loans ratio of (12) bps decreased 35 bps from last year, due to lower provisions in Personal & Commercial Banking, Capital Markets and Wealth Management.\n\nPBCAE increased $571 million, primarily due to higher group annuity sales, which is largely offset in revenue. Lower favourable investment-related experience and business growth, primarily in longevity reinsurance, also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by favourable annual actuarial assumption updates in the current year largely related to mortality and economic assumptions.",

        "page_content": "Non-interest expense increased $525 million or 9%, mainly attributable to higher variable compensation on improved results and higher staff-related costs. A legal provision in U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) also contributed to the increase. These factors were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nIncome tax expense increased $196 million or 22%, primarily due to higher income before income taxes in the current quarter. The effective income tax rate of 22.0% increased 30 bps from last year, mainly due to the impact of changes in earnings mix.\n\n## Q4 2021 vs. Q3 2021\n\nNet income of $3,892 million was down $404 million or 9% compared to last quarter, primarily due to lower releases of PCL, lower spreads in Canadian Banking and U.S. Wealth Management (including City National), and a legal provision in U.S. Wealth Management (including City National). These factors were partially offset by lower variable compensation.\n\n## Quarterly results and trend analysis\n\nOur quarterly results are impacted by a number of trends and recurring factors, which include seasonality of certain businesses, general economic and market conditions, and fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to other currencies. The following table summarizes our results for the last eight quarters (the period):\n\n| Quarterly results  (1)                                                   |         |         |         |              | Table 36   | Table 36   | Table 36   | Table 36   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except per  share and percentage amounts) | Q4      | Q3      | Q2      | Q1           | Q4         | Q3         | Q2         | Q1         |\n| Personal & Commercial Banking                                            | $ 4,605 | $ 4,651 | $ 4,527 | $ 4,563    $ | 4,373      | $ 4,348    | $ 4,400    | $ 4,610    |\n| Wealth Management (2)                                                    | 3,444   | 3,373   | 3,260   | 3,219        | 3,061      | 3,008      | 2,955      | 3,106      |\n| Insurance                                                                | 1,501   | 1,754   | 536     | 1,809        | 958        | 2,212      | 197        | 1,994      |\n| Investor & Treasury Services                                             | 548     | 517     | 534     | 565          | 521        | 484        | 709        | 597        |\n| Capital Markets (3)                                                      | 2,298   | 2,463   | 2,718   | 2,708        | 2,275      | 2,748      | 2,313      | 2,548      |\n| Corporate Support (2), (3)                                               | (20)    | (2)     | 43      | 79           | (96)       | 120        | (241)      | (19)       |\n| Total revenue                                                            | 12,376  | 12,756  | 11,618  | 12,943       | 11,092     | 12,920     | 10,333     | 12,836     |\n| PCL                                                                      | (227)   | (540)   | (96)    | 110          | 427        | 675        | 2,830      | 419        |\n| PBCAE                                                                    | 1,032   | 1,304   | 149     | 1,406        | 461        | 1,785      | (177)      | 1,614      |\n| Non-interest expense                                                     | 6,583   | 6,420   | 6,379   | 6,542        | 6,058      | 6,380      | 5,942      | 6,378      |\n| Income before income taxes                                               | 4,988   | 5,572   | 5,186   | 4,885        | 4,146      | 4,080      | 1,738      | 4,425      |\n| Income taxes                                                             | 1,096   | 1,276   | 1,171   | 1,038        | 900        | 879        | 257        | 916        |\n| Net income                                                               | $ 3,892 | $ 4,296 | $ 4,015 | $ 3,847    $ | 3,246      | $ 3,201    | $ 1,481    | $ 3,509    |\n| EPS - basic                                                              | $ 2.68  | $ 2.97  | $ 2.76  | $ 2.66    $  | 2.23       | $ 2.20     | $ 1.00     | $ 2.41     |\n| - diluted                                                                | 2.68    | 2.97    | 2.76    | 2.66         | 2.23       | 2.20       | 1.00       | 2.40       |\n| Effective income tax rate                                                | 22.0%   | 22.9%   | 22.6%   | 21.2%        | 21.7%      | 21.5%      | 14.8%      | 20.7%      |\n| Period average US$ equivalent                                            |         |         |         |              |            |            |            |            |\n| of C$1.00                                                                | $ 0.796 | $ 0.812 | $ 0.798 | $ 0.779    $ | 0.756      | $ 0.737    | $ 0.725    | $ 0.760    |\n\n## Seasonality\n\nSeasonal factors may impact our results in certain quarters. The first quarter has historically been stronger for our Capital Markets businesses. The second quarter has fewer days than the other quarters, which generally results in a decrease in net interest income and certain expense items. The third and fourth quarters include the summer months which generally results in lower client activity and may negatively impact the results of our Capital Markets trading business.\n\n## Trend analysis\n\nEarnings have generally trended upward over the period. However, earnings in the second quarter of 2020 reflected the impact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic across all of our business segments which resulted in a significant increase in PCL and fluctuations in revenue from the impact of market volatility, including interest rates and credit spreads, as well as client activity. Market conditions subsequently improved, and while impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated downstream implications persist, earnings have increased since the second quarter of 2020. Quarterly earnings are also affected by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nPersonal & Commercial Banking revenue has benefitted from solid volume growth over the period. NIM has been negatively impacted by margin compression over the period from the lower interest rate environment, mainly reflecting cumulative BoC rate cuts of 150 bps in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nWealth Management revenue has benefitted from growth in average-fee based client assets, as well as volume growth over the period. The lower interest rate environment, mainly reflecting the cumulative U.S. Fed rate cuts of 150 bps in the second quarter of 2020, has negatively impacted revenue over the period.\n\nInsurance revenue has fluctuated over the period, primarily due to the impact of changes in the fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities as well as the timing of group annuity sales, both of which are largely offset in PBCAE. The first quarters of 2020 and 2021 as well as Q4 2021 reflect higher group annuity sales.\n\nInvestor & Treasury Services revenue has been impacted by interest rate movements, market volatility and client activity over the period, which resulted in heightened fluctuations in the second and third quarters of 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "page_content": "Capital Markets revenue is influenced, to a large extent, by market conditions that impact client activity, with first quarter results generally stronger than those in the remaining quarters. Markets experienced significant levels of volatility following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in increased client activity and fluctuations in trading revenue, including higher trading revenue in the third quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. Elevated market volatility in the second quarter of 2020 also resulted in loan underwriting markdowns, with partial reversals in the latter half of 2020. 2021 generally saw strong results from M&A and loan syndication activity as well as equity origination.\n\nPCL on assets is comprised of provisions taken on performing assets and provisions taken on impaired assets. PCL on performing assets has fluctuated over the period as it is impacted by macroeconomic conditions, changes in exposures and credit quality. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant increase in provisions in 2020, largely in the second quarter. Throughout 2021, we saw improvements in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook resulting in releases of provisions on performing assets. PCL on impaired assets trended lower over the period. The recovery that has been underway since the sharp drop of economic activity in calendar Q2 2020 as well as the impact of the COVID-19 related government support and calendar 2020 payment deferral programs, resulted in lower provisions, largely in our Canadian Banking retail portfolios beginning the second half of 2020. We saw higher provisions on impaired loans in Capital Markets, largely in the oil and gas sector, over the majority of 2020. Throughout 2021, we saw lower provisions on impaired loans in Capital Markets, largely due to recoveries in the oil and gas sector.\n\nPBCAE has fluctuated over the period as it includes the impact of changes in the fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities and the impact of group annuity sales, both of which are largely offset in Revenue. The fair value of investments backing policyholder liabilities is impacted by changes in market conditions. PBCAE has also fluctuated due to the impact of investment-related experience and claims costs over the period. Actuarial adjustments, which generally occur in the fourth quarter of each year, also impact PBCAE.\n\nNon-interest expense has generally trended upwards over the period. Variable compensation has fluctuated over the period, commensurate with fluctuations in revenue and earnings, including the impact of decreased results in the second quarter of 2020. Changes in the fair value of our U.S. share-based compensation plans, which are largely offset in revenue, have also contributed to fluctuations over the period and are impacted by market conditions. While we continue to focus on efficiency management activities, expenses over the period reflect our ongoing investments in people and technology, including digital initiatives. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, Non-interest expense also reflected incremental COVID-19 related costs, though these costs have subsided in 2021.\n\nOur effective income tax rate has fluctuated over the period, mostly due to varying levels of tax adjustments and changes in earnings mix. The second quarter of 2020 saw a decrease mainly due to a higher proportion of tax exempt income and income from lower tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower earnings in that quarter.\n\n## Financial condition\n\n## Condensed balance sheets\n\n| As at October 31 (Millions of Canadian dollars)                              | 2021        | Table 37   2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| Assets                                                                       |             |                   |\n| Cash and due from banks                                                      | $ 113,846   | $ 118,888         |\n| Interest-bearing deposits with banks                                         | 79,638      | 39,013            |\n| Securities, net of applicable allowance (1)                                  | 284,724     | 275,814           |\n| Assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed | 307,903     | 313,015           |\n| Loans                                                                        |             |                   |\n| Retail                                                                       | 503,598     | 457,976           |\n| Wholesale                                                                    | 218,066     | 208,655           |\n| Allowance for loan losses                                                    | (4,089)     | (5,639)           |\n| Other - Derivatives                                                          | 95,541      | 113,488           |\n| - Other (2)                                                                  | 107,096     | 103,338           |\n| Total assets                                                                 | $ 1,706,323 | $ 1,624,548       |\n| Liabilities                                                                  |             |                   |\n| Deposits                                                                     | $ 1,100,831 | $ 1,011,885       |\n| Other - Derivatives                                                          | 91,439      | 109,927           |\n| - Other (2)                                                                  | 405,698     | 406,102           |\n| Subordinated debentures                                                      | 9,593       | 9,867             |\n| Total liabilities                                                            | 1,607,561   | 1,537,781         |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders                                          | 98,667      | 86,664            |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                    | 95          | 103               |\n| Total equity                                                                 | 98,762      | 86,767            |\n| Total liabilities and equity                                                 | $ 1,706,323 | $ 1,624,548       |\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020\n\nTotal assets increased $82 billion or 5% from last year.

The impact of foreign exchange translation also contributed to the decrease.\n\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks increased $41 billion, primarily due to higher deposits with central banks, reflecting our short term cash and liquidity management activities.",

        "page_content": "Securities, net of applicable allowance, were up $9 billion or 3%, mainly due to higher equity trading securities reflecting favourable market conditions and higher corporate debt securities, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower government securities.\n\nAssets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) and securities borrowed decreased $5 billion or 2%, largely due to the impact of foreign exchange translation and our liquidity management activities, partially offset by increased client demand.\n\nLoans (net of Allowance for loan losses) were up $57 billion or 9%, largely due to volume growth in residential mortgages and wholesale loans. These factors were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nDerivative assets were down $18 billion or 16%, mainly attributable to the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower fair values on interest rate contracts. These factors were partially offset by higher fair values on foreign exchange contracts.\n\nOther assets were up $4 billion or 4%, largely reflecting higher commodity trading receivables and increased employee benefit assets. These factors were largely offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nTotal liabilities increased $70 billion or 5% from last year. Foreign exchange translation decreased total liabilities by $68 billion.\n\nDeposits increased $89 billion or 9%, mainly due to higher business and retail deposits driven by both higher liquidity maintained by our clients amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and higher client activity. Higher issuances of short-term notes also contributed to the increase.

Off-balance sheet transactions are generally undertaken for risk, capital and funding management purposes which benefit us and our clients. These include transactions with structured entities and may also include the issuance of guarantees. These transactions give rise to, among other risks, varying degrees of market, credit, liquidity and funding risk, which are discussed in the Risk management section.\n\nWe use structured entities to securitize our financial assets as well as assist our clients in securitizing their financial assets. These entities are not operating entities, typically have no employees, and may or may not be recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that may qualify for derecognition. We apply the derecognition rules to determine whether we have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards or control associated with the financial assets to a third party. If the transaction meets specific criteria, it may qualify for full or partial derecognition from our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Securitizations of our financial assets\n\nWe periodically securitize our credit card receivables and residential and commercial mortgage loans primarily to diversify our funding sources, enhance our liquidity position and for capital purposes. We also securitize residential and commercial mortgage loans as part of our sales and trading activities.\n\nWe securitize our credit card receivables, on a revolving basis, through a consolidated structured entity. We securitize single and multiple-family residential mortgages through the National Housing Act Mortgage-Backed Securities (NHA MBS) program. The majority of our securitization activities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we do not meet the derecognition criteria. During 2021 and 2020, we did not derecognize any mortgages securitized through the NHA MBS program. For further details, refer to Note 6 and Note 7 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also periodically securitize commercial mortgage loans by selling them in collateral pools, which meet certain diversification, leverage and debt coverage criteria, to structured entities, one of which is sponsored by us. Securitized commercial mortgage loans are derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the securitized assets. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we did not securitize any commercial mortgages (October 31, 2020 - $469 million). Our continuing involvement with the transferred assets is limited to servicing certain of the underlying commercial mortgages sold. As at October 31, 2021, there was $2 billion of commercial mortgages outstanding that we continue to service related to these securitization activities (October 31, 2020 - $2 billion).\n\n## Involvement with unconsolidated structured entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, we engage in a variety of financial transactions with structured entities to support our customers' financing and investing needs, including securitization of our clients' financial assets, creation of investment products, and other types of structured financing.\n\nWe have the ability to use credit mitigation tools such as third-party guarantees, credit default swaps, and collateral to mitigate risks assumed through securitization and re-securitization exposures. The process in place to monitor the credit quality of our securitization and re-securitization exposures involves, among other things, reviewing the performance data of the underlying assets. We affirm our ratings each quarter and formally confirm or assign a new rating at least annually. For further details on our activities to manage risks, refer to the Risk management section.\n\nBelow is a description of our activities with respect to certain significant unconsolidated structured entities. For a complete discussion of our interests in consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities, refer to Note 7 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## RBC-administered multi-seller conduits\n\nWe administer multi-seller conduits which are used primarily for the securitization of our clients' financial assets. Our clients primarily use our multi-seller conduits to diversify their financing sources and to reduce funding costs by leveraging the value of high-quality collateral. The conduits offer us a favourable revenue stream and risk-adjusted return.",

Revenue for all such services amounted to $304 million during the year (October 31, 2020 - $277 million).\n\nOur total commitment to the conduits in the form of backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities is shown below. The total committed amount of these facilities exceeds the total amount of the maximum assets that may have to be purchased by the conduits under the purchase agreements. As a result, the maximum exposure to loss attributable to our backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities is less than the total committed amounts of these facilities.\n\n| Liquidity and credit enhancement facilities     |                                      |                              |                                 | Table 38                             | Table 38                     | Table 38                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                                 | 2021                                 | 2021                         | 2021                            | 2020                                 | 2020                         | 2020                            |\n| As at October 31 (Millions of Canadian dollars) | Notional of  committed  amounts  (1) | Allocable  notional  amounts | Maximum  exposure  to loss  (2) | Notional of  committed  amounts  (1) | Allocable  notional  amounts | Maximum  exposure  to loss  (2) |\n| Backstop liquidity facilities                   | $ 40,876                             | $ 38,330                     | $ 38,330                        | $ 42,803                             |                              | $ 40,137  $ 40,137              |\n| Credit enhancement facilities (3)               | 2,546                                | 2,546                        | 2,546                           | 2,666                                | 2,666                        | 2,666                           |\n| Total                                           | $ 43,422                             | $ 40,876                     | $ 40,876                        | $ 45,469                             |                              | $ 42,803  $ 42,803              |\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, the notional amount of backstop liquidity facilities we provide decreased by $1,927 million or 5% from last year, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange translation.

Correspondingly, total assets of the multi-seller conduits decreased by $1,890 million or 5% from last year. All of the multi-seller conduits assets were internally rated A or above. All transactions funded by the unconsolidated multi-seller conduits are internally rated using a rating system as outlined in the internal ratings map in the credit risk section.\n\nMultiple independent debt rating agencies review all of the transactions in the multi-seller conduits. Transactions financed in the U.S. multi-seller conduits are reviewed by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Transactions in two of the Canadian multi-seller conduits are reviewed by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS) and Moody's while one of the Canadian multi-seller conduits is also reviewed by S&P. Each applicable rating agency also reviews ongoing transaction performance on a monthly basis and may publish reports detailing portfolio and program information related to the conduits.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, the total asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) issued by the conduits amounted to $25 billion, an increase of $1,488 million or 6% from last year, primarily due to higher client usage. The rating agencies that rate the ABCP rated 100% (October 31, 2020 - 100%) of the total amount issued within the top ratings category.\n\n## Structured finance\n\nWe provide liquidity facilities to certain municipal bond Tender Option Bond (TOB) trusts in which we have an interest but do not consolidate because the residual certificates issued by the TOB trusts are held by third parties. As at October 31, 2021, our maximum exposure to loss from these unconsolidated municipal bond TOB trusts was $3 billion (October 31, 2020 - $3 billion).\n\nWe provide senior warehouse financing to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans and issue term collateralized loan obligations (CLO). A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the term CLO is used to fully repay the senior warehouse financing that we provide. As at October 31, 2021, our maximum exposure to loss associated with the outstanding senior warehouse financing facilities was $951 million (October 31, 2020 - $88 million). The increase in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was driven by increased client utilization and the addition of new financing facilities.",

        "page_content": "We provide senior financing to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans. These facilities tend to be longer in term than the CLO warehouse facilities and benefit from credit enhancement designed to cover a multiple of historical losses. As at October 31, 2021, our maximum exposure to loss associated with the outstanding senior financing facilities was $4 billion (October 31, 2020 - $3 billion). The increase in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was driven by the addition of new financing facilities partially offset by the repayment and termination of existing financing facilities.\n\n## Investment funds\n\nWe invest in hedge funds primarily to provide clients with desired exposures to reference funds. As we make investments in the reference funds, exposures to the funds are simultaneously transferred to clients through derivative transactions. Our maximum exposure to loss in the reference funds is limited to our investments in the funds. As at October 31, 2021, our maximum exposure to loss was $3 billion (October 31, 2020 - $2 billion). The increase in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was due to increased holdings in third-party investment funds.\n\nWe also provide liquidity facilities to certain third-party investment funds. The funds issue unsecured variable-rate preferred shares and invest in portfolios of tax exempt bonds. As at October 31, 2021, our maximum exposure to loss on these funds was $606 million (October 31, 2020 - $278 million). The increase in our maximum exposure to loss from last year was driven by the addition of new financing facilities.\n\n## Third-party securitization vehicles\n\nWe hold interests in certain unconsolidated third-party securitization vehicles, which are structured entities. We, as well as other financial institutions, are obligated to provide funding to these entities up to our maximum commitment level and are exposed to credit losses on the underlying assets after various credit enhancements. As at October 31, 2021, our maximum exposure to loss in these entities was $12 billion (October 31, 2020 - $10 billion). The increase in our maximum exposure to loss compared to last year reflects an increase in client activity with third-party securitization vehicles partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Interest and non-interest income earned in respect of these investments was $89 million (October 31, 2020 $112 million).\n\n## Guarantees, retail and commercial commitments\n\nWe provide our clients with guarantees and commitments that expose us to liquidity and funding risks. Our maximum potential amount of future payments in relation to our commitments and guarantee products as at October 31, 2021 amounted to $414 billion compared to $387 billion last year. The increase compared to last year was primarily driven by growth in securities lending indemnifications and other commitments to extend credit partly offset by decreases in back stop liquidity facilities and sponsored repo guarantees. Refer to Liquidity and funding risk and Note 23 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding our guarantees and commitments.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe are in the business of managing the risks inherent to the financial services industry as we aim to create maximum value for our shareholders, clients, employees and communities. The ability to manage risk is a core competency of the bank, and is supported by our risk-aware culture and risk management approach. Our view of risks is dynamic, and reflects the pace of change in the financial services industry.\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nAn important component of our risk management approach is to ensure that top and emerging risks, as they evolve, are identified, managed, and incorporated into our existing risk management assessment, measurement, monitoring and escalation processes and addressed in our risk frameworks and policies. These practices are intended to ensure a forward-looking risk assessment is maintained by management in the course of business development and as part of the execution of ongoing risk oversight responsibilities. Top and emerging risks are discussed by senior management and the Board on a regular basis.",

Information technology (IT) and cyber risks remain top risks, not only for the financial services sector,  but for other industries worldwide.

Risks associated with climate change are evolving as it relates to the global transition to a net-zero  economy and physical climate risks (e.g., extreme weather events), which could result in a broad range  of impacts including potential strategic, reputational, regulatory, compliance, operational and credit  related risks for us and our clients.

Tensions remain elevated between China and the U.S. and its allies over a  number of issues, including trade, technology, human rights, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Tensions  between China and its neighbours over territorial claims add further global and economic uncertainty.

We seek to accomplish this through an effective and evolving risk management approach. All risk-taking activities and exposures are within the Boardapproved risk appetite, and corresponding capital and liquidity requirements. We seek to ensure that our business activities and transactions provide an appropriate balance of return for the risks assumed and the costs incurred. Our organizational design and governance processes are intended to ensure that our Group Risk Management (GRM) function is independent from the businesses it supports.\n\n## Risk drivers\n\nWe define risk as the potential vulnerabilities in the short-, medium- or long-term that may impact our financial results, financial and operational resilience, reputation, business model, or strategy. Risk can be realized through losses, or an undesirable outcome with respect to volatility of earnings in relation to expected earnings, capital adequacy, or liquidity. Our principal risks include credit, market, liquidity, insurance, operational, regulatory compliance, strategic, reputation, legal and regulatory environment, competitive, and systemic risks, that have been classified into four categories based on the level of control and influence that we can exert against these risks. These categories are maintained by GRM and reviewed regularly to ensure all principal risks are reflected. This classification methodology provides a common language and discipline for the identification and assessment of risk in existing businesses, new businesses, products or initiatives, as well as acquisitions and alliances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board oversees the implementation of our risk management framework, while employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for managing the day-to-day risks that arise in the context of their mandates. As illustrated below, we use the three lines of defence governance model which is intended to ensure that risks are appropriately and adequately managed throughout the enterprise to achieve our strategic objectives.\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n## RISK COMMITTEE\n\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nGOVERNANCE COMMITTEE\n\nHUMAN RESOURCES COMMITTEE\n\n- The Board establishes the tone from above and sets the standards of conduct and champions our values as set out in our Code of Conduct. The Board also approves our risk appetite, provides oversight and carries out its risk management mandate primarily through its committees:\n- The Risk Committee oversees our risk management program which is designed to ensure that the policies, procedures and controls used by management are sufficient to keep risks within our risk appetite. The Risk Committee's oversight role is designed to ensure that the risk management function is adequately independent from the businesses whose activities it reviews. Its oversight activities include the review of the GRM function which evaluates GRM's success against its key priorities, the mandate of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the GRM organizational structure, and the function's budget and resources.\n- The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of (i) the integrity of our financial statements; (ii) the qualifications, performance and independence of our external auditors; (iii) the performance of our internal audit function and internal controls; and (iv) compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n- The Governance Committee recommends individuals for Board member election or re-election, oversees the process for evaluating Board Committee and director effectiveness, and oversees management of culture and conduct, including breaches of our Code of Conduct. Additional responsibilities include (i) developing and recommending governance frameworks, principles and policies to the Board; (ii) overseeing corporate citizenship matters; (iii) monitoring developments in corporate governance and adapting best practices; and (iv) reviewing shareholder proposals and recommending responses to the Board.\n- The Human Resources Committee assists the Board in its oversight of compensation policies and programs, compensation for the CEO and Group Executives (GE), as well as compensation risk management. It also oversees our pension plans, key talent management strategies and practices, and management succession plans for key senior leadership roles.\n\n## THE GROUP EXECUTIVE AND GROUP RISK COMMITTEE\n\n- Actively shapes enterprise risk appetite and recommends it for Board approval.\n- Visibly supports and communicates enterprise risk appetite, ensuring that sufficient resources and expertise are in place to help provide effective oversight of adherence to the enterprise risk appetite.\n- Seeks to ensure principles, policies, authorities, resources, responsibilities and reporting are in place to support the control infrastructure necessary for an effective enterprise-wide risk management program.\n- Oversees culture and conduct strategy and key activities.\n- The Compensation Risk Management Oversight Committee (CRMOC) oversees the design of major compensation programs in an effort to ensure alignment with sound risk management principles, and that risks that may not be fully captured in our current financial performance are appropriately considered in variable compensation payouts, including our enterprise risk profile relative to risk appetite. The CRMOC has responsibility for ensuring our compensation programs align with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Principles for Sound Compensation Practices and Implementation Standards and other applicable guidance and best practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE\n\n## RISK OWNERS RISK OWNERS\n\n- All employees across our businesses and functional areas\n- Accountable for:\n- Identification;\n- Assessment;\n- Measurement;\n- Mitigation;\n- Monitoring; and\n- Reporting of risk against approved policies and appetite\n\n## SECOND LINE OF DEFENCE\n\n## RISK OVERSIGHT RISK OVERSIGHT\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nGLOBAL COMPLIANCE AND ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING\n\n- The CRO has direct access to the Risk Committee\n- The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and the Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer (CAMLO) have direct access to the Audit Committee\n- Establishes risk management practices and provides risk guidance\n- Provides oversight of the effectiveness of First Line risk management practices\n- Monitors and independently reports on the level of risk against established risk appetite\n\n## THIRD LINE OF DEFENCE\n\n## INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE\n\n- Internal Audit\n- Independent assurance to management and the Board on the effectiveness of risk management practices",

        "page_content": "## Risk appetite\n\nEffective risk management protects us from unacceptable losses or undesirable outcomes with respect to earnings volatility, capital adequacy or liquidity, reputation risk or other risks while supporting and enabling our overall business strategy. It requires the clear articulation of our risk appetite, which is the amount and type of risk that we are able and willing to accept in the pursuit of our business objectives. It reflects our self-imposed upper bound to risk-taking, set at levels inside of regulatory limits and constraints, and influences our risk management philosophy, Code of Conduct, business practices and resource allocation. It provides clear boundaries and sets an overall tone for balancing risk-reward trade-offs to ensure the long-term viability of the organization.\n\nOur risk appetite is integrated into our strategic, financial, and capital planning processes, as well as ongoing business decision-making processes and is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Appetite Framework (ERAF) outlines the foundational aspects of our approach to risk appetite, articulates our quantitative and qualitative risk appetite statements and their supporting measures and associated constraints, which can be applied at the enterprise, business segment, business unit and legal entity level, and describes our requirements and expectations to embed effective risk appetite practices throughout the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite statements\n\n## Quantitative statements\n\n## Qualitative statements\n\n- GLYPH<129> Manage earnings volatility and exposure to future losses under normal and stressed conditions.\n- GLYPH<129> Avoid excessive concentrations of risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure capital adequacy and sound management of liquidity and funding risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure sound management of operational and regulatory compliance risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Maintain strong credit ratings and a risk profile in the top half of our peer group.\n- GLYPH<129> Always uphold our Purpose and Vision and consistently abide by our Values and Code of Conduct to maintain our reputation and the trust of our clients, colleagues, and communities.\n- GLYPH<129> Undertake only risk we understand. Make thoughtful and future-focused risk decisions, taking environmental and social considerations into account.\n- GLYPH<129> Effectively balance risk and reward to enable sustainable growth.\n- GLYPH<129> Maintain a healthy and robust control environment to protect our stakeholders.\n- GLYPH<129> Always be operationally prepared and financially resilient for a potential crisis.\n\nThe allocation of our risk appetite across the bank is supported by the establishment of delegated authorities or risk limits. These delegated authorities or risk limits represent the maximum level of risk permitted for a line of business, portfolio, individual or group and are used to govern ongoing operations. Risk posture, the anticipated shift in risk profile as a result of changes in objectives, strategies, and external factors, is used to provide insights on key areas that may require management attention to ensure strategies are able to be executed successfully within our risk appetite.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nQuantifying risk is a key component of our enterprise-wide risk and capital management processes. Risk measurement and planning processes are integrated across the enterprise, especially in regards to forward-looking projections and analyses, including but not limited to, stress testing, recovery and resolution planning, and credit provisioning. The degree of integration across our Finance and Risk functions continues to increase in measuring both financial and risk performance.\n\nCertain risks, such as credit, market, liquidity and insurance risks, can be more easily quantified than others, such as operational, reputation, strategic, legal, and regulatory compliance risks. For the risks that are more difficult to quantify, greater emphasis is placed on qualitative risk factors and assessment of activities to gauge the overall level of risk. In addition, judgmental risk measures and techniques such as stress testing, and scenario and sensitivity analyses can be used to assess and measure risks, and we are continuously evolving our risk measures and techniques to manage our risks. Our primary methods for measuring risk include:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Quantifying expected loss: losses that are statistically expected to occur as a result of conducting business in a given time period;\n- GLYPH<129> Quantifying unexpected loss: an estimate of the deviation of actual earnings from expected earnings, over a specified time horizon;\n- GLYPH<129> Stress testing: evaluates, from a forward looking perspective, the potential effects of a set of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible adverse economic and financial market events; and\n- GLYPH<129> Back-testing: the realized values are compared to the parameter estimates that are currently used in an effort to ensure the parameters remain appropriate for regulatory and economic capital calculations.",

        "page_content": "## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important component of our risk management framework. Stress testing results are used for:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Assessing the viability of long-term business plans and strategies;\n- GLYPH<129> Monitoring our risk profile relative to our risk appetite in terms of earnings and capital at risk;\n- GLYPH<129> Setting limits;\n- GLYPH<129> Identifying key risks to, and potential shifts in, our capital and liquidity levels, as well as our financial position;\n- GLYPH<129> Enhancing our understanding of available mitigating actions in response to potential adverse events; and\n- GLYPH<129> Assessing the adequacy of our capital and liquidity levels.\n\nOur enterprise-wide stress tests evaluate key balance sheet, income statement, leverage, capital, and liquidity impacts arising from risk exposures and changes in earnings. The results are used by the Board, Group Risk Committee (GRC) and senior management risk committees to understand our performance drivers under stress, and review stressed capital, leverage, and liquidity ratios against regulatory thresholds and internal limits. The results are also incorporated into our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and capital plan analyses.\n\nWe evaluate a number of enterprise-wide stress scenarios over a multi-year horizon, featuring a range of severities. Our Board reviews the recommended scenarios, and GRM leads the scenario assessment process. Results from across the organization are integrated to develop an enterprise-wide view of the impacts, with input from subject matter experts in GRM, Corporate Treasury, Finance, and Economics. Generally, our stress testing scenarios evaluate global recessions, equity market corrections, elevated debt levels, trade policies, changes in interest rates, real estate price corrections, and shocks to credit spreads and commodity markets, among other factors. During our fiscal 2021 stress testing exercises, we addressed several emerging risks inclusive of further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation risk as well as physical and transitional climate risk, with a focus on the impacts of these risks on revenue, net income and capital projections.\n\nOngoing stress testing and scenario analyses within specific risk types, such as market risk (including Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)), liquidity risk, retail and wholesale credit risk, operational risk, and insurance risk, supplement and support our enterprise-wide analyses. Results from these risk-specific programs are used in a variety of decision-making processes including risk limit setting, portfolio composition evaluation, risk appetite articulation and business strategy implementation.\n\nIn addition to ongoing enterprise-wide and risk specific stress testing programs, we use ad hoc and reverse stress testing to deepen our knowledge of the risks we face. Ad hoc stress tests are one-off analyses used to investigate developing conditions or to stress a particular portfolio in more depth. Reverse stress tests, starting with a severe outcome and aiming to reverseengineer scenarios that might lead to it, are used in risk identification and understanding of risk/return boundaries.\n\nIn addition to internal stress tests, we participate in a number of regulator-required stress test exercises, on a periodic basis, across several jurisdictions.\n\n## Model governance and validation\n\nQuantitative models are used for many purposes including, but not limited to, the valuation of financial products, the identification, measurement and management of different types of risk, stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, informing business and risk decisions, measuring compliance with internal limits, meeting financial reporting and regulatory requirements, and issuing public disclosures.\n\nModel risk is the risk of adverse financial and/or reputational consequences to the enterprise arising from the use or misuse of a model at any stage throughout its life cycle and is managed through our model risk governance and oversight structure. The governance and oversight structure, which is implemented through our three lines of defence governance model, is founded on the basis that model risk management is a shared responsibility across the three lines spanning all stages of the model's life cycle. We continue to evolve our governance model to take into account any new risk considerations that may emerge from the growing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and applications in our models across our organization.\n\nPrior to being used, models are subject to an independent validation and approval by our enterprise model risk management function, a team of modelling professionals with reporting lines independent of those of the model owners, developers and users. The validation seeks to ensure that models are sound and capable of fulfilling their intended use. In addition to independently validating models prior to use, our enterprise model risk management function provides controls that span the life-cycle of a model, including model change management procedures, requirements for ongoing monitoring, and annual assessments to ensure each model continues to serve its intended purpose.\n\n## Risk control\n\nOur enterprise-wide risk management approach is supported by a comprehensive set of risk controls that are defined in our ERMF. The ERMF serves as the foundation for our approach to risk management and sets the expectations for the development and communication of policies, the establishment of formal independent risk review and approval processes, and the establishment of delegated authorities and risk limits. The ERMF is further reinforced and supported by a number of additional Board-approved risk frameworks, various policies thereunder and a comprehensive set of risk controls. Together, our risk frameworks and supporting policies provide direction and insight on how respective risks are identified, assessed, measured, managed, mitigated, monitored and reported. The enterprise-wide policies are considered our minimum requirements, articulating the parameters within which business groups and employees must operate.",

Board or Board Committee approval is required in some instances (e.g. RBC Code of Conduct, Dividend Policy)\n\nGenerally by business or Functional Unit management/committees. Group Risk Management approval is required if there are significant risk implications\n\n## Delegated authorities and risk limits\n\nRisk appetite is designed to account for strategic and forward-looking considerations whereas authorities and risk limits are used to govern and monitor our day-to-day business activities. Risk Appetite is supported by Risk Approval Authorities delegated by the Board to senior management which provide thresholds for escalation of exposures and transactions to the Risk Committee of the Board for review and approval. The allocation of Risk Appetite and Board Delegated Authorities may be supported by the establishment of management delegated authorities and/or risk limits. These represent the maximum level of risk permitted for a line of business, portfolio, individual or other group, and are used to implement risk management strategies and govern ongoing operations. Senior management can then delegate some or all of their authorities onwards to others in the organization. The delegated authorities enable the approval of single name, geographic and industry sectors, and product and portfolio exposures within defined parameters and limits. They are also used to manage concentration risk, establish underwriting and inventory limits for trading and investment banking activities and set market risk tolerances.\n\n## Risk review and approval processes\n\nRisk review and approval processes provide an important control mechanism and are established by GRM based on the nature, size and complexity of the risk involved. In general, the risk review and approval process involves a formal review and approval by an individual, group or committee that is independent from the originator. The approval responsibilities are governed by delegated authorities and risk limits are based on the following categories: transactions, projects and initiatives, and new products and services.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nEnterprise and business segment level risk monitoring and internal reporting are critical components of our enterprise risk management program and support the ability of senior management and the Board to effectively perform their risk management and oversight responsibilities. In addition, we publish a number of external reports on risk matters to comply with regulatory requirements. The Risk Committee of the Board receives a CRO report at each meeting that has been reviewed by senior management, and which includes, among others, top and emerging risks, industry trends or other notable items. On a quarterly basis, we provide our Enterprise Risk Report to senior management and the Risk Committee of the Board which includes, among others, top and emerging risks, risk profile relative to our risk appetite, portfolio quality metrics and a range of risks we face along with an analysis of the related issues, key trends and, when required, management actions. On an annual basis, we provide a benchmarking review to the Board which compares our performance to peers across a variety of risk metrics and includes a composite risk scorecard which provides an objective measure of our ranking relative to the peer group. In addition to our regular risk monitoring, other risk specific presentations are provided to, and discussed with, senior management and the Board on top and emerging risks or changes in our risk profile.\n\n## Culture and conduct risk\n\nOur values set the tone of our organizational culture and translate into desired behaviours as articulated in our Code of Conduct and leadership model. We define conduct as the manifestation of culture through the behaviours, judgment, decisions, and actions of the organization and its individuals. Our organizational direction establishes the expectation of good conduct outcomes as the operating norm for the organization, all employees, and third-party service providers operating on our behalf to drive positive outcomes for our clients, employees, stakeholders, financial markets and our reputation.

The desired outcomes from effective culture and conduct practices align with our purpose and values and support our risk appetite statements.\n\nRisk culture is a subset of our overall culture that influences how, individually and collectively, we take and manage risks. Our risk culture helps us identify and understand risks, openly discuss risks, and act on the organization's current and perceived future risks. Our risk culture practices are grounded in our existing risk management and human resource disciplines and protocols. When combined with the elements of effective leadership and values, these practices provide a base from which the resulting risk culture and conduct can be assessed, monitored, sustained and subjected to ongoing enhancement.\n\nOur Board-approved Enterprise Culture and Conduct Risks Framework provides organizational direction and describes our approach to a set of related topics applicable to all risk categories such as fair outcomes for clients and other stakeholders, culture, including accountability and risk culture, conduct risk, sales conduct and client practices, and misconduct.\n\nOn a regular basis, management communicates behavioural expectations to our employees with an emphasis on conduct and values. Our leadership model also supports and encourages effective challenge between the businesses and control functions. These behavioural expectations are supported by tools and resources which are designed to help employees live our values, report misconduct and raise concerns, including those that might have ethical implications. We are committed to fostering an environment where employees feel safe to speak up without retaliation. Employees have the ability to report matters through a global anonymous Conduct Hotline. In addition, our Code of Conduct outlines an employee's responsibility to be truthful, respect others, and comply with laws, regulations and our policies. Anyone who breaches or fails to report an actual or possible breach of the Code of Conduct is subject to corrective or disciplinary action. This can range from reprimands and impacts on performance ratings and compensation, to termination of employment relationships with the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe shaded text along with the tables specifically marked with an asterisk (*) in the following sections of the MD&A represent our disclosures on credit, market and liquidity and funding risks in accordance with IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures , and include discussion on how we measure our risks and the objectives, policies and methodologies for managing these risks. Therefore, these shaded text and marked tables represent an integral part of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Transactional/positional risk drivers\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss associated with an obligor's potential inability or unwillingness to fulfill its contractual obligations on a timely basis and may arise directly from the risk of default of a primary obligor (e.g., issuer, debtor, counterparty, borrower or policyholder), indirectly from a secondary obligor (e.g., guarantor or reinsurer), through off-balance sheet exposures, contingent credit risk, associated credit risk and/or transactional risk. Credit risk includes counterparty credit risk arising from both trading and non-trading activities.\n\nThe responsibility for managing credit risk is shared broadly following the three lines of defence governance model. The Board delegates credit risk approval authorities through risk appetites to the President & CEO and CRO. Credit transactions in excess of these authorities must be approved by the Risk Committee of the Board. To facilitate day-to-day business activities, the CRO has been empowered to further delegate credit risk approval authorities to individuals within GRM, the business segments, and functional units as necessary.",

Additional supporting policies exist that are designed to provide further clarification of roles and responsibilities, acceptable practices, limits and key controls within the enterprise.\n\n## Credit risk measurement\n\nWe quantify credit risk at both the individual obligor and portfolio levels to manage expected credit losses and minimize unexpected losses to limit earnings volatility and ensure we are adequately capitalized.\n\nWe employ a variety of risk measurement methodologies to measure and quantify credit risk for our wholesale and retail credit portfolios. The wholesale portfolio is comprised of businesses, sovereigns, public sector entities, banks and other financial institutions, as well as certain high net worth individuals. The retail portfolio is comprised of residential mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, and small business loans. Our credit risk rating systems are designed to assess and quantify the risk inherent in credit activities in an accurate and consistent manner. The resulting ratings and scores are then used for both client- and transaction-level risk decision-making and as key inputs for our risk measurement and capital calculations.\n\n## Measurement of economic and regulatory capital\n\nEconomic capital, which is our internal quantification of risks, is used for limit setting. It is also used for internal capital adequacy and allocation of capital to the Insurance segment. Our methodology for allocating capital to our business segments, other than Insurance, is based on regulatory requirements. For further details, refer to the Capital management section.\n\nIn measuring credit risk to determine regulatory capital, two principal approaches are available: Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach and Standardized Approach.\n\nThe Standardized Approach applies primarily to our Caribbean banking operations and City National and is based on risk weights prescribed by OSFI that are used to calculate RWA for credit risk exposure.\n\nThe IRB Approach, which applies to most of our credit risk exposures, utilizes three key parameters which form the basis of our credit risk measures for both regulatory and economic capital.\n\n- GLYPH<129> Probability of default (PD): An estimated percentage that represents the likelihood of default within a given time period of an obligor for a specific rating grade or for a particular pool of exposure.\n- GLYPH<129> Exposure at default (EAD): An amount expected to be owed by an obligor at the time of default.\n- GLYPH<129> Loss given default (LGD): An estimated percentage of EAD that is not expected to be recovered during the collections and recovery process.\n\nThese parameters are determined based primarily on historical experience from internal credit risk rating systems in accordance with supervisory standards.\n\nEach credit facility is assigned an LGD rate that is largely driven by factors that impact the extent of losses anticipated in the event the obligor defaults. These factors mainly include seniority of debt, collateral and the industry sector in which the obligor operates. Estimated LGD rates draw primarily on internal loss experiences. Where we have limited internal loss data, we also refer to appropriate external data to supplement the estimation process. LGD rates are estimated to reflect conditions that might be expected to prevail in a period of an economic downturn, with additional conservatism added to reflect data limitations and statistical uncertainties identified in the estimation process.\n\nEAD is estimated based on the current exposure to the obligor and the possible future changes in that exposure driven by factors such as the nature of the credit commitment. As with LGD, rates are estimated to reflect an economic downturn, with added conservatism to reflect data and statistical uncertainties identified in the modelling process.\n\nEstimates of PD, LGD and EAD are reviewed, and then validated and back-tested by an independent validation team within the bank, on an annual basis. In addition, quarterly monitoring and back-testing is performed by the estimation team. These ratings and risk measurements are used to determine our expected losses as well as economic and regulatory capital, setting of risk limits, portfolio management and product pricing.",

        "page_content": "## Financial and regulatory measurement distinctions\n\nExpected loss models are used for both regulatory capital and accounting purposes. Under both models, expected losses are calculated as the product of PD, LGD and EAD. However, there are certain key differences under current Basel and IFRS reporting frameworks which could lead to significantly different expected loss estimates, including:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Basel PDs are based on long-run averages over an entire economic cycle. IFRS PDs are based on current conditions, adjusted for estimates of future conditions that will impact PD under probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios.\n- GLYPH<129> Basel PDs consider the probability of default over the next 12 months. IFRS PDs consider the probability of default over the next 12 months only for instruments in stage 1. Expected credit losses for instruments in stage 2 are calculated using lifetime PDs.\n- GLYPH<129> Basel LGDs are based on severe but plausible downturn economic conditions. IFRS LGDs are based on current conditions, adjusted for estimates of future conditions that will impact LGD under probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios. For further details, refer to the Critical accounting policies and estimates section.\n\n## Gross credit risk exposure\n\nGross credit risk is categorized as i) lending-related and other credit risk or ii) trading-related credit risk; and is calculated based on the Basel III framework. Under this method, EAD for all lending-related and other credit transactions and tradingrelated repo-style transactions is calculated before taking into account any collateral and is inclusive of an estimate of potential future changes to that credit exposure. EAD for derivatives is calculated inclusive of collateral in accordance with regulatory guidelines.\n\nLending-related and other credit risk includes:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Loans and acceptances outstanding, undrawn commitments, and other exposures, including contingent liabilities such as letters of credit and guarantees, debt securities carried at FVOCI or amortized cost and deposits with financial institutions. Undrawn commitments represent an estimate of the contractual amount that may be drawn upon at the time of default of an obligor.\n\n## Trading-related credit risk includes:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Repo-style transactions, which include repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions. For repo-style transactions, gross exposure represents the amount at which securities were initially financed, before taking collateral into account.\n- GLYPH<129> Derivative amounts which represent the credit equivalent amount, as defined by OSFI as the replacement cost plus an add-on amount for potential future credit exposure, scaled by a regulatory factor. For further details on replacement cost and credit equivalent amounts, refer to Note 8 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit risk assessment Wholesale credit risk\n\nThe wholesale credit risk rating system is designed to measure the credit risk inherent in our wholesale credit activities. Each obligor is assigned a borrower risk rating (BRR), reflecting an assessment of the credit quality of the obligor. Each BRR has a PD calibrated against it. The BRR differentiates the riskiness of an obligor and represents our evaluation of the obligor's ability and willingness to meet its contractual obligations on time over a three year time horizon. The assignment of BRRs is based on the evaluation of the obligor's business risk and financial risk through fundamental credit analysis, as well as data-driven modelling. The determination of the PD associated with each BRR relies primarily on internal default history since 2006. PD estimates are designed to be a long-run average of our experience across the economic cycle in accordance with regulatory guidelines.\n\nOur rating system is designed to stratify obligors into 22 grades. The following table aligns the relative rankings of our 22-grade internal risk ratings with the external ratings used by S&P and Moody's.",

It incorporates not only the contract's current value, but also considers how that value can move as market conditions change. Counterparty credit risk usually arises from trading-related derivative and repo-style transactions. Derivative transactions include forwards, futures, swaps and options, and can have underlying references that are either financial (e.g., interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, or equity) or non-financial (e.g., precious metal and commodities). For further details on our derivative instruments and credit risk mitigation, refer to Note 8 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTrading counterparty credit activities are undertaken in a manner consistent with the relevant requirements under the ECRMF and the Enterprise Market Risk Management Framework (EMRMF), in line with our credit risk management policy documents and with approval in accordance with the appropriate delegated authorities.\n\nThe primary risk mitigation techniques for trading counterparty credit risk are close-out netting and collateralization. Closeout netting considers the net value of contractual obligations between counterparties in a default situation, thereby reducing overall credit exposure. Collateralization is when a borrower pledges assets as security, which provides recourse to the lender in the event of default. The policies that we maintain in relation to the recognition of risk mitigation from these techniques incorporate such considerations as:\n\n- GLYPH<129> The use of standardized agreements such as the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex;\n- GLYPH<129> Restricting eligible collateral to high quality liquid assets, primarily cash and highly-rated government securities, subject to appropriate haircuts; and\n- GLYPH<129> The use of initial margin and variation margin arrangements in accordance with regulatory requirements and internal risk standards.\n\nSimilarly, for securities finance and repurchase trading activity we mitigate counterparty credit risk via the use of standardized securities finance agreements, and by taking collateral generally in the form of eligible liquid securities.\n\nWe also mitigate counterparty credit risk through the use of central counterparties (CCPs). These highly-regulated entities intermediate trades between participating bilateral counterparties and mitigate credit risk through the use of initial and variation margin and the ability to net offsetting trades amongst participants. The specific structure and capitalization, including contingent capital arrangements, of individual CCPs are analyzed as part of assigning an internal counterparty credit risk rating and determining appropriate counterparty credit risk limits.",

        "page_content": "## Wrong-way risk\n\nWrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty. There are two types of wrong-way risk:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Specific wrong-way risk, which exists when our exposure to a particular counterparty is positively correlated with the PD of the counterparty due to the nature of our transactions with them (e.g., loans collateralized by shares or debt issued by the counterparty or a related party). Specific wrong-way risk over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trades are done on an exception basis only, and are permitted only when explicitly pre-approved by GRM. Factors considered in reviewing such trades include the credit quality of the counterparty, the nature of the asset(s) underlying the derivative and the existence of credit mitigation.\n- GLYPH<129> General wrong-way risk, which exists when there is a positive correlation between the PD of the counterparties and general macroeconomic or market factors. This typically occurs with derivatives (e.g., the size of the exposure increases) or with collateralized transactions (e.g., the value of the collateral declines). We monitor general wrong-way counterparty credit risk using a variety of metrics including stress scenarios, investment strategy concentration, the ability of counterparties to generate cash and liquidity, liquidity of the collateral and terms of financing.\n\n## Retail credit risk\n\nCredit scoring is the primary risk rating system for assessing obligor and transaction risk for retail exposures. Scoring models use internal and external data to assess and score borrowers, predict future performance and manage limits for existing loans and collection activities. Credit scores are one of the factors employed in the acquisition of new clients and management of existing clients. The credit score of the borrower is used to assess the predicted credit risk for each independent acquisition or account management action, leading to an automated decision or guidance for an adjudicator. Credit scoring improves credit decision quality, adjudication timeframes and consistency in the credit decision process and facilitates risk-based pricing. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted our retail credit risk methodology by enhancing our product level credit strategies with advanced analytics and portfolio monitoring.\n\nTo arrive at a retail risk rating, borrower scores are categorized and associated with PDs for further grouping into risk rating categories. The following table maps PD bands to various summarized risk levels for retail exposures:\n\n| Internal ratings map*   | Table 41         |\n|-------------------------|------------------|\n| PD bands                | Description      |\n| 0.030% - 3.844%         | Low risk         |\n| 3.845% - 6.786%         | Medium risk      |\n| 6.787% - 99.99%         | High risk        |\n| 100%                    | Impaired/Default |\n\n- * This table represents an integral part of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nWe seek to reduce our exposure to credit risk through a variety of means, including the structuring of transactions and the use of collateral.\n\n## Structuring of transactions\n\nSpecific credit policies and procedures set out the requirements for structuring transactions. Risk mitigants include the use of guarantees, collateral, seniority, loan-to-value (LTV) requirements and covenants. Product-specific guidelines set out appropriate product structuring as well as client and guarantor criteria.\n\n## Collateral\n\nWhen we advance credit, we often require obligors to pledge collateral as security. The extent of risk mitigation provided by collateral depends on the amount, type and quality of the collateral taken. Specific requirements relating to collateral valuation and management are set out in our credit risk management policies.\n\nThe types of collateral used to secure credit or trading facilities within the bank are varied. For example, our securities financing and collateralized OTC derivatives activities are primarily secured by cash and highly-rated liquid government and agency securities. Wholesale lending to business clients is often secured by pledges of the assets of the business, such as accounts receivable, inventory, operating assets and commercial real estate. In Canadian Banking and Wealth Management, collateral typically consists of a pledge over a real estate property, or a portfolio of debt securities and equities trading on a recognized exchange.\n\n- GLYPH<129> We employ a risk-based approach to property valuation. Property valuation methods include automated valuation models (AVM) and appraisals. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. Using a risk-based approach, we also employ appraisals which can include drive-by or full on-site appraisals.\n- GLYPH<129> We continue to actively manage our entire mortgage portfolio and perform stress testing, based on a combination of increasing unemployment, rising interest rates and a downturn in real estate markets.\n- GLYPH<129> We are compliant with regulatory requirements that govern residential mortgage underwriting practices, including LTV parameters and property valuation requirements.\n\nThere were no significant changes regarding our risk management policies on collateral or to the quality of the collateral held during the period.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk approval\n\nThe Board, GE, GRC and other senior management committees work together to ensure the ECRMF and supporting policies, processes and procedures exist to manage credit risk and approve related credit risk limits. Reports are provided to the Board, the GRC, and senior executives to keep them informed of our risk profile, including significant credit risk issues, shifts in exposures and trending information, to ensure appropriate and timely actions can be taken where necessary. Our enterprise-wide credit risk policies set out the minimum requirements for the management of credit risk in a variety of borrower, transactional and portfolio management contexts.\n\n## Transaction approval\n\nCredit transactions are governed by our RBC Enterprise Policy on Risk Limits and Risk Approval Authorities that captures the limits delegated to management and the credit rules policy, which outlines the minimum standards for managing credit risk at the individual client relationship and/or transaction level. The credit rules policy is further supported by business and/or product-specific policies and guidelines as appropriate. Transaction approvals are subject to delegated risk approval authorities. If a transaction exceeds senior management's authorities, the approval of the Risk Committee of the Board is required.\n\n## Product approval\n\nProposals for credit products and services are comprehensively reviewed and approved under a risk assessment framework and are subject to risk approval authorities which increase as the level of risk increases. New and amended products must be reviewed relative to all risk drivers, including credit risk. All existing products must be reviewed following a risk-based assessment approach on a regular basis.\n\n## Credit risk limits\n\n- GLYPH<129> The allocation of risk appetite and Board delegated authorities are supported by the establishment of risk limits which take into account both regulatory constraints and internal risk management judgment. Risk limits are established at the following levels: single name limits, regional, country and industrial sector limits (notional and economic capital), regulatory large exposure limits, product and portfolio limits, and underwriting and distribution risk limits. These limits apply across all businesses, portfolios, transactions and products.\n- GLYPH<129> We actively manage credit exposures and limits to ensure alignment with our risk appetite, to maintain our target business mix and to ensure that there is no undue concentration risk.\n- GLYPH<129> Concentration risk is defined as the risk arising from large exposures that are highly correlated such that their ability to meet contractual obligations could be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other risk drivers.\n- GLYPH<129> Credit concentration limits are reviewed on a regular basis after taking into account business, economic, financial and regulatory environments.\n\n## Credit risk administration Loan forbearance\n\nIn our overall management of borrower relationships, economic or legal reasons may necessitate forbearance to certain clients with respect to the original terms and conditions of their loans. We have specialized groups and formalized policies that direct the management of delinquent or defaulted borrowers. We strive to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and modify their loan terms to maximize collection and to avoid foreclosure, repossession, or other legal remedies. In these circumstances, a borrower may be granted concessions that would not otherwise be considered. Examples of such concessions to retail borrowers may include rate reduction, payment deferral, principal forgiveness and term extensions. Concessions to wholesale borrowers may include payment deferral, restructuring the agreements, modifying the original terms of the agreement and/or relaxation of covenants. For both retail and wholesale loans, the appropriate remediation techniques are based on the individual borrower's situation, our policy and the customer's willingness and capacity to meet the new arrangement.",

PCL on loans of $(672) million decreased $4,903 million from last year, due to lower provisions in Personal & Commercial Banking, Capital Markets and Wealth Management. The PCL on loans ratio of (10) bps decreased 73 bps.\n\nPCL on performing loans was $(1,350) million, compared to $2,631 million in the prior year, reflecting elevated provisions in Personal & Commercial Banking, Capital Markets and Wealth Management in the prior year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and releases in the current year primarily driven by improvements in our macroeconomic and credit quality outlook.\n\nPCL on impaired loans of $678 million decreased $922 million or 58%, largely reflecting the economic recovery underway in the current year. The decrease largely related to provisions taken in the prior year in Capital Markets and Wealth Management as compared to recoveries in the current year. Lower provisions in Personal & Commercial Banking also contributed to the decrease.\n\nPCL on loans in Personal & Commercial Banking decreased $3,043 million, primarily reflecting provisions on performing loans in our Canadian Banking portfolios in the prior year as compared to releases in the current year, as described above. Lower provisions on impaired loans in our Canadian Banking retail portfolios also contributed to the decrease due to the economic recovery underway and the continued impact of the COVID-19 related government support programs.",

Positions whose revaluation gains and losses are reported in Revenue, which includes:\n- a) Changes in the fair value of instruments classified or designated as FVTPL, and\n- b) Hedge ineffectiveness.\n- 2. CET1 capital, which includes:\n- a) All of the above, plus\n- b) Changes in the fair value of FVOCI securities where revaluation gains and losses are reported as OCI,\n- c) Changes in the Canadian dollar value of investments in foreign subsidiaries, net of hedges, due to foreign exchange translation, and\n- d) Changes in the fair value of employee benefit plan deficits.\n- 3. CET1 ratio, which includes:\n- a) All of the above, plus\n- b) Changes in RWA resulting from changes in traded market risk factors, and\n- c) Changes in the Canadian dollar value of RWA due to foreign exchange translation.\n- 4. The economic value of the Bank, which includes:\n- a) Points 1 and 2 above, plus\n- b) Changes in the economic value of other non-trading positions, net interest income, and fee based income, as a result of changes in market risk factors.",

GRM creates and manages the control structure for FVTPL positions which ensures that business is conducted on a basis consistent with Board requirements. The Market and Counterparty Credit Risk function within GRM is responsible for creating and managing the controls and governance procedures that ensure that risk taken is consistent with risk appetite constraints set by the Board. These controls include limits on probabilistic measures of potential loss such as Value-at-Risk, Stressed Value-at-Risk, Incremental Risk Charge and stress tests as defined below:\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) is a statistical measure of potential loss for a financial portfolio computed at a given level of confidence and over a defined holding period. We measure VaR at the 99th percentile confidence level for price movements over a one-day holding period using historic simulation of the last two years of equally weighted historic market data. These calculations are updated daily with current risk positions, with the exception of certain less material positions that are not actively traded and are updated on at least a monthly basis.\n\nStressed Value-at-Risk (SVaR) is calculated in an identical manner as VaR with the exception that it is computed using a fixed historical one-year period of extreme volatility and its inverse rather than the most recent two-year history. The stress period used is a one-year period covering the market volatility observed during Q2 2020. SVaR is calculated daily for all portfolios, with the exception of certain less material positions that are not actively traded and are updated on at least a monthly basis.\n\nVaR and SVaR are statistical estimates based on historical market data and should be interpreted with knowledge of their limitations, which include the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> VaR and SVaR will not be predictive of future losses if the realized market movements differ significantly from the historical periods used to compute them.\n- GLYPH<129> VaR and SVaR project potential losses over a one-day holding period and do not project potential losses for risk positions held over longer time periods.\n- GLYPH<129> VaR and SVaR are measured using positions at close of business and do not include the impact of trading and hedging activity over the course of a day.\n\nWe validate our VaR and SVaR measures through a variety of means - including subjecting the models to vetting and validation by a group independent of the model developers and by back-testing the VaR against daily marked-to-market revenue to identify and examine events in which actual outcomes in trading revenue exceed the VaR projections.\n\nIncremental Risk Charge (IRC) captures the risk of losses under default or rating changes for issuers of certain traded fixed income instruments. IRC is measured over a one year horizon at a 99.9% confidence level, and captures different liquidity horizons for instruments and concentrations in issuers under a constant level of risk assumption. Changes in measured risk levels are primarily associated with changes in inventory from the applicable fixed income trading portfolios.\n\nStress tests - Our market risk stress testing program is used to identify and control risk due to large changes in market prices and rates. We conduct stress testing daily on positions that are marked-to-market. The stress tests simulate both historical and hypothetical events which are severe and long-term in duration. Historical scenarios are taken from actual market events and range in duration up to 90 days. Examples include the Global Pandemic of 2020, Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and the Taper Tantrum of 2013. Hypothetical scenarios are designed to be forward-looking at potential future market stresses, and are designed to be severe but plausible. We are constantly evaluating and refining these scenarios as market conditions change. Stress results are calculated assuming an instantaneous revaluation of our positions with no management action.\n\nThese measures are computed on all positions that are FVTPL for financial reporting purposes, with the exception of those in a designated hedging relationship and those in our insurance businesses.\n\n## Market risk measures - FVTPL positions\n\n| Market risk measures*          |                  |                    |                    |                    |                  |                    |                    | Table 50           |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021   | October 31, 2021   | October 31, 2021   | October 31, 2020 | October 31, 2020   | October 31, 2020   | October 31, 2020   |\n|                                |                  | For the year ended | For the year ended | For the year ended |                  | For the year ended | For the year ended | For the year ended |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars) | As at            | Average            | High               | Low                | As at            | Average            | High               | Low                |\n| Equity                         | $ 24             | $ 20               | $ 38               | $ 12               | $ 23             | $ 33               | $ 64               | $ 13               |\n| Foreign exchange               | 4                | 4                  | 6                  | 2                  | 3                | 3                  | 6                  | 1                  |\n| Commodities                    | 3                | 3                  | 4                  | 2                  | 3                | 3                  | 7                  | 1                  |\n| Interest rate (1)              | 61               | 44                 | 64                 | 21                 | 47               | 54                 | 178                | 11                 |\n| Credit specific (2)            | 9                | 8                  | 11                 | 6                  | 7                | 6                  | 7                  | 4                  |\n| Diversification (3)            | (51)             | (35)               | n.m.               | n.m.               | (18)             | (25)               | n.m.               | n.m.               |\n| Market risk VaR                | $ 50             | $ 44               | $ 72               | $ 23               | $ 65             | $ 74               | $ 232              | $ 18               |\n| Market risk Stressed VaR       | $ 59             | $ 53               | $ 101              | $ 29               | $ 86             | $ 109              | $ 228              | $ 49               |",

The investments which support actuarial liabilities are predominantly fixed income assets designated as FVTPL. Consequently, changes in the fair values of these assets are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the actuarial liabilities, the impact of which is reflected in Insurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense.

        "page_content": "## Market risk controls - Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) positions 1\n\nIRRBB arises primarily from traditional customer-originated banking products such as deposits and loans, and includes related hedges and interest rate risk from securities held for liquidity management purposes. Factors contributing to IRRBB include mismatches between asset and liability repricing dates, relative changes in asset and liability rates in response to market rate scenarios, and other product features affecting the expected timing of cash flows, such as options to pre-pay loans or redeem term deposits prior to contractual maturity. IRRBB sensitivities are regularly measured and reported, and subject to limits and controls with independent oversight from GRM.\n\nThe Board approves the risk appetite for IRRBB, and the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO) and GRM provide ongoing governance through IRRBB risk policies, limits, operating standards and other controls. IRRBB reports are reviewed regularly by GRM, ALCO, the GRC, the Risk Committee of the Board and the Board.\n\n## IRRBB measurement\n\nTo monitor and control IRRBB, we assess two primary metrics, Net Interest Income (NII) risk and Economic Value of Equity (EVE) risk, under a range of market shocks, scenarios, and time horizons. Market scenarios include currency-specific parallel and non-parallel yield curve changes, interest rate volatility shocks, and interest rate shock scenarios prescribed by regulators.\n\nIn measuring NII risk, detailed banking book balance sheets and income statements are dynamically simulated to estimate the impact of market stress scenarios on projected NII. Assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions are simulated over various time horizons. The simulations incorporate maturities, renewals, and new originations along with prepayment and redemption behaviour. Product pricing and volumes are forecast based on past experience to determine response expectations under a given market shock scenario. EVE risk captures the market value sensitivity to changes in rates. In measuring EVE risk, deterministic (single-scenario) and stochastic (multiple-scenario) valuation techniques are applied to spot position data. NII and EVE risks are measured for a range of market risk stress scenarios which include extreme but plausible changes in market rates and volatilities. IRRBB measures do not include beneficial management actions that could be taken to reduce exposures.\n\nManagement of NII and EVE risk is complementary and supports our efforts to generate a sustainable high-quality NII stream. NII and EVE risks for specific units are measured daily, weekly or monthly depending on materiality, complexity and hedge strategy.\n\nA number of assumptions affecting cash flows, product re-pricing and the administration of rates underlie the models used to measure NII and EVE risk. The key assumptions pertain to the expected funding profile of mortgage rate commitments, fixed-rate loan prepayment behaviour, term deposit redemption behaviour, and the treatment of non-maturity deposits. All assumptions are derived empirically based on historical client behaviour and product pricing with consideration of possible forward-looking changes. All models and assumptions used to measure IRRBB are subject to independent oversight by GRM.\n\n## Market risk measures - IRRBB Sensitivities\n\nThe following table shows the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100 bps increase or decrease in interest rates on projected 12-month NII and EVE, assuming no subsequent hedging. Rate floors are applied within the declining rates scenarios which prevent EVE valuation and NII simulation rate levels from falling below a minimum average level of negative 25 bps across major currencies. Interest rate risk measures are based on current on and off-balance sheet positions which can change over time in response to business activity and management actions.\n\n| Market risk - IRRBB measures*   | Table 51                | Table 51            | Table 51              | Table 51                | Table 51            | Table 51   | Table 51         | Table 51         |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                 | October 31              | October 31          | October 31            | 2021                    | 2021                | 2021       | October 31  2020 | October 31  2020 |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)  | Canadian  dollar impact | U.S. dollar  impact | Total                 | Canadian  dollar impact | U.S. dollar  impact | Total      | EVE risk         | NII risk (1)     |\n| Before-tax impact of:           |                         |                     |                       |                         |                     |            |                  |                  |\n| 100 bps increase in rates       | $ (1,641)               |                     | $ (368)  $(2,009)   $ | 571                     | $ 358               | $ 929      | $ (1,756)        | $ 818            |\n| 100 bps decrease in rates       | 1,540                   | (3)                 | 1,537                 | (603)                   | (318)               | (921)      | 1,321            | (621)            |\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, an immediate and sustained -100 bps shock would have had a negative impact to our NII of $921 million, up from $621 million last year, and an immediate and sustained +100 bps shock would have had a negative impact to our EVE of $2,009 million, up from $1,756 million last year. The year-over-year change in NII sensitivity is largely attributable to continued low cost deposit growth, while the year-over-year change in EVE sensitivity is mainly due to overall growth in the balance sheet, in particular growth in book capital. During 2021, NII and EVE risks remained within approved limits.\n\n1",

We hold debt securities carried at FVOCI primarily as investments, as well as to manage liquidity risk and hedge interest rate risk in our non-trading banking balance sheet. As at October 31, 2021, our portfolio of investment securities carried at FVOCI is interest rate sensitive and would impact OCI by a pre-tax change in value of $8 million as measured by the change in the value of the securities for a one basis point parallel increase in yields. The portfolio also exposes us to credit spread risk of a pre-tax change in value of $14 million, as measured by the change in value for a one basis point widening of credit spreads. The value of the investment securities carried at FVOCI included in our IRRBB measures as at October 31, 2021 was $75 billion. Our investment securities carried at FVOCI also include equity exposures of $1 billion as at October 31, 2021, compared to $1 billion at the end of the prior year.\n\n## Non-trading foreign exchange rate risk\n\nForeign exchange rate risk is the potential adverse impact on earnings and economic value due to changes in foreign currency rates. Our revenue, expenses and income denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar are subject to fluctuations as a result of changes in the value of the average Canadian dollar relative to the average value of those currencies. Our most significant exposure is to the U.S. dollar, due to our operations in the U.S. and other activities conducted in U.S. dollars. Other significant exposures are to the British pound and the Euro, due to our activities conducted internationally in these currencies. A strengthening or weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar, British pound and the Euro could reduce or increase, as applicable, the translated value of our foreign currency denominated revenue, expenses and earnings and could have a significant effect on the results of our operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate risk arising from our investments in foreign operations. For unhedged equity investments, when the Canadian dollar appreciates against other currencies, the unrealized translation losses on net foreign investments decreases our shareholders' equity through the other components of equity and decreases the translated value of the RWA of the foreign currency-denominated asset. The reverse is true when the Canadian dollar depreciates against other currencies. Consequently, we consider these impacts in selecting an appropriate level of our investments in foreign operations to be hedged.\n\n## Derivatives related to non-trading activity\n\nDerivatives are also used to hedge market risk exposure unrelated to our trading activity. Hedge accounting is elected where applicable. These derivatives are included in our IRRBB measures and other internal non-trading market risk measures. We use interest rate swaps to manage our IRRBB, funding and investment activities. Interest rate swaps are also used to hedge changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate instruments. We also use foreign exchange derivatives to manage our exposure to equity investments in subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, British Pound, and Euro.\n\nFor further details on the application of hedge accounting and the use of derivatives for hedging activities, refer to Notes 2 and 8 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Liquidity risk arises from mismatches in the timing and value of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet cash flows.\n\nOur liquidity profile is structured to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy current and prospective commitments in both normal and stressed conditions. To achieve this goal, we operate under a comprehensive Liquidity Risk Management Framework (LRMF) and Pledging Policy. We also employ several liquidity risk mitigation strategies that include:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Achieving an appropriate balance between the level of exposure allowed under our risk appetite and the cost of risk mitigation;\n- GLYPH<129> Maintaining broad funding access, including preserving and promoting a reliable base of core client deposits and ongoing access to diversified wholesale funding sources;\n- GLYPH<129> A comprehensive liquidity stress testing program, contingency, recovery and resolution planning and status monitoring to ensure sufficiency of unencumbered marketable securities and demonstrated capacity to monetize specific asset classes;\n- GLYPH<129> Governance of pledging activity through limits and liquid asset buffers for potential pledging activity;\n- GLYPH<129> Timely and granular risk measurement information;\n- GLYPH<129> Transparent liquidity transfer pricing and cost allocation; and\n- GLYPH<129> Our three lines of defense governance model.",

        "page_content": "## Risk control\n\nOur liquidity risk objectives, policies, models and methodologies are reviewed regularly, and are updated to reflect changing market conditions and business mix. This includes aligning with local regulatory developments. We continue to maintain liquidity and funding that is appropriate for the execution of our strategy. Liquidity risk remains well within our risk appetite.\n\nThe Board annually approves the enterprise liquidity risk appetite recommended by the Risk Committee of the Board. The Risk Committee of the Board reviews and recommends the liquidity risk appetite and approves the LRMF. The Board, the Risk Committee of the Board, the GRC and the ALCO regularly review reporting on our consolidated liquidity position. The GRC, the Policy Review Committee (PRC) and/or the ALCO also review liquidity documents prepared for the Board or its committees.\n\n- GLYPH<129> The PRC approves the Liquidity Risk Policy, which establishes minimum risk control elements in accordance with the Board-approved risk appetite and the LRMF, and the Pledging Policy, which outlines the requirements and authorities for the management of our pledging activities.\n- GLYPH<129> The ALCO annually approves the Enterprise Liquidity Contingency Plan (ELCP) and provides strategic direction and oversight to Corporate Treasury, other functions, and business segments on the management of liquidity.\n\nThese policies are supported by operational, desk and product-level policies that implement risk control elements, such as parameters, methodologies, management limits and authorities that govern the measurement and management of liquidity. Stress testing is also employed to assess the robustness of the control framework and inform liquidity contingency plans.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nLiquidity risk is measured by applying scenario-specific assumptions against our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments to derive expected cash flow profiles over varying time horizons. For example, government bonds generally can be quickly and easily converted to cash without significant loss of value regardless of their contractual maturity. Similarly, while relationship-based deposits contractually can be withdrawn immediately, in practice, these balances can be relatively stable sources of funding depending on several factors, such as the nature of the client and their intended use. Risk methodologies and underlying assumptions are periodically reviewed and validated to ensure their alignment with our operating environment, expected economic and market conditions, rating agency preferences, regulatory requirements and generally accepted industry practices.\n\nTo manage liquidity risk within our liquidity risk appetite, we set limits on various metrics reflecting a range of time horizons and severity of stress conditions and develop contingency, recovery and resolution plans. Our liquidity risk measurement and control activities are divided into three categories as follows:\n\n## Structural (longer-term) liquidity risk\n\nTo guide our secured and unsecured wholesale term funding activities, we employ both internal and regulatory metrics to manage and control the structural alignment between long-term illiquid assets and longer-term funding sourced from wholesale investors and core relationship deposits.\n\n## Tactical (shorter-term) liquidity risk\n\nTo address potential immediate cash flow risks in times of stress, we use short-term net cash flow limits to control risk of material units, subsidiaries and currencies, and perform stress testing assessments. Net cash flow positions are determined by applying internally-derived risk assumptions and parameters to known and anticipated cash flows for all material unencumbered assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet activities. Encumbered assets are not considered a source of available liquidity. We also control tactical liquidity by adhering to relevant regulatory standards, such as LCR.\n\n## Contingency liquidity risk\n\nContingency liquidity risk planning assesses the impact of sudden stress events and our planned responses. Our ELCP, maintained and administered by Corporate Treasury, has been developed to guide our potential responses to liquidity crises. Under leadership of Corporate Treasury, both enterprise and regional Liquidity Crisis Teams (LCT) meet regularly to assess our liquidity status, approve the ELCP, and in times of stress provide valuable linkages to front line and risk functions to support the crisis management process. LCT's include members from key business segments, GRM, Finance, Operations, and Communications with relevant subject matter expertise.\n\nOur stress tests, which include elements of scenario and sensitivity analyses, measure our prospective exposure to systemic and RBC-specific events over a period of several weeks. Different levels of severity are considered for each type of crisis with some scenarios reflecting multiple-downgrades to our credit ratings.\n\nThe contingency liquidity risk planning process identifies contingent funding needs (e.g., draws on committed credit and liquidity lines, demands for more collateral and deposit run-off) and sources (e.g., contingent liquid asset sales and incremental wholesale funding capacity) under various stress scenarios, and as a result, informs requirements for our earmarked unencumbered liquid asset portfolios.\n\nOur unencumbered liquid asset portfolios consist of diversified, highly rated and liquid marketable securities, overnight government reverse repos and deposits with central banks. These portfolios are subject to minimum asset quality levels and, as appropriate, other eligibility guidelines (e.g., maturity, diversification and eligibility for central bank advances) to maximize ready access to additional cash should it be required. These securities, when added to other unencumbered liquid assets that we hold as a result of capital markets or other activities, contribute to our liquidity reserve, and are reflected in the asset encumbrance disclosures shown below.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity reserve and asset encumbrance\n\nThe following tables provide summaries of our liquidity reserve and asset encumbrance. In both tables, unencumbered assets represent, to varying degrees, a ready source of funding. Unencumbered assets are the difference between total and encumbered assets from both on- and off-balance sheet sources. The encumbered assets include: (i) bank-owned liquid assets that are either pledged as collateral (e.g., repo financing and derivative pledging) or not freely available due to regulatory or internal policy requirements (e.g., earmarked to satisfy mandatory reserve or regional capital adequacy requirements and to maintain continuous access to payment and settlement systems); (ii) securities received as collateral from securities financing and derivative transactions which have either been re-hypothecated where permissible (e.g., to obtain financing through repos or to cover securities sold short) or have no liquidity value since re-hypothecation is prohibited; and (iii) illiquid assets that have been securitized and sold into the market or that have been pledged as collateral in support of structured term funding vehicles. As per our liquidity management framework and practice, encumbered assets are not considered a source of liquidity.\n\n## Liquidity reserve\n\nOur liquidity reserve consists of available unencumbered liquid assets. Although unused wholesale funding capacity, which is regularly assessed, could be another potential source of liquidity to mitigate stressed conditions, it is excluded in the determination of the liquidity reserve. Similarly, uncommitted and undrawn central bank borrowing facilities that could be accessed subject to satisfying certain preconditions as set by various central banks (e.g., BoC, the Fed, Bank of England, and Bank of France), as well as amounts that qualify as eligible collateral at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) are also excluded from the determination of the liquidity reserve.\n\n| Liquidity reserve                                                                                   | Table 53                  | Table 53                                                                                      | Table 53               | Table 53                  | Table 53                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                                                     | As at October 31, 2021    | As at October 31, 2021                                                                        | As at October 31, 2021 | As at October 31, 2021    | As at October 31, 2021      |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                                                      | Bank-owned  liquid assets | Securities  received as  collateral from  securities  financing and  derivative  transactions | Total liquid  assets   | Encumbered  liquid assets | Unencumbered  liquid assets |\n| Cash and due from banks                                                                             | $ 113,846                 | $ -

However, the increase in collateral received was offset by an increase in collateral pledged under repurchase and collateral swap transactions.\n\n## Asset encumbrance\n\nThe table below provides a summary of our on- and off-balance sheet amounts for cash, securities and other assets, distinguishing between those that are encumbered or available for sale or use as collateral in secured funding transactions. Other assets, such as mortgages and credit card receivables, can also be monetized, albeit over longer timeframes than those required for marketable securities.

The remaining portion is comprised of short- and long-term wholesale funding.\n\nFunding for highly liquid assets consists primarily of short-term wholesale funding that reflects the monetization period of those assets. Long-term wholesale funding is used mostly to fund less liquid wholesale assets and to support liquid asset buffers.\n\nSenior long-term debt issued by the bank on or after September 23, 2018, that has an original term greater than 400 days and is marketable, subject to certain exceptions, is subject to the Canadian Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) regime. Under the Bail-in regime, in circumstances when the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has determined that a bank may no longer be viable, the Governor in Council may, upon a recommendation of the Minister of Finance that he or she is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to do so, grant an order directing the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) to convert all or a portion of certain shares and liabilities of that bank into common shares. As at October 31, 2021, the notional value of issued and outstanding long-term debt subject to conversion under the Bail-in regime was $53 billion (October 31, 2020 - $37 billion).\n\nFor further details on our wholesale funding, refer to the Composition of wholesale funding tables below.",

We issued, either directly or through our subsidiaries, unsecured long-term funding of $28 billion in various currencies and markets, which was more than offset by maturities.\n\nWe primarily use residential mortgage and credit card securitization programs as alternative sources of funding and for liquidity and asset/liability management purposes. Our total secured long-term funding includes outstanding MBS sold, covered bonds that are collateralized with residential mortgages and securities backed by credit card receivables.\n\nCompared to 2020, our outstanding MBS sold decreased $1.7 billion. Our covered bonds and securitized credit card receivables decreased $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\n\nFor further details, refer to the Off-balance sheet arrangements section.\n\n| Long-term funding sources* (1)   | Table 55           | Table 55           |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                  | As at   October 31 | As at   October 31 |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)   | October 31  2021   | 2020               |\n| Unsecured long-term funding      | $ 89,447           | $ 88,055           |\n| Secured long-term funding        | 56,688             | 63,043             |\n| Subordinated debentures          | 9,620              | 9,574              |\n|                                  | $ 155,755          | $ 160,672          |\n\n- * This table represents an integral part of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- (1) Based on original term to maturity greater than 1 year.\n\nOur wholesale funding activities are well-diversified by geography, investor segment, instrument, currency, structure and maturity. We maintain an ongoing presence in different funding markets which allows us to continuously monitor market developments and trends, identify opportunities and risks, and take appropriate and timely actions. We operate long-term debt issuance registered programs. The following table summarizes these programs with their authorized limits by geography.\n\n| Programs by geography                |                                               | Table 56                                                              |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Canadian Shelf Program - $25 billion | GLYPH<129> U.S. Shelf Program - US$50 billion | GLYPH<129> European Debt Issuance Program - US$40 billion  GLYPH<129> |\n| Canadian Shelf Program - $25 billion | GLYPH<129> U.S. Shelf Program - US$50 billion | Global Covered Bond Program -  \u20ac 60 billion                           |\n\nWe also raise long-term funding using Canadian Senior Notes, Canadian National Housing Act MBS, Canada Mortgage Bonds, credit card receivable-backed securities, Kangaroo Bonds (issued in the Australian domestic market by foreign firms) and Yankee Certificates of Deposit (issued in the U.S. domestic market by foreign firms). We continuously evaluate opportunities to expand into new markets and untapped investor segments since diversification expands our wholesale funding flexibility, minimizes funding concentration and dependency, and generally reduces financing costs. As presented in the following charts, our current long-term debt profile is well-diversified by both currency and product. Maintaining competitive credit ratings is also critical to cost-effective funding.\n\n## Long-term debt (1) - funding mix by currency of issuance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Includes unsecured and secured long-term funding with an original term to maturity greater than 1 year\n- (1) Includes unsecured and secured long-term funding with an original term to maturity greater than 1 year\n- (2) Mortgage-backed securities and Canada Mortgage Bonds\n\n<!-- image -->",

The following table provides the additional collateral obligations required at the reporting date in the event of a one-, two- or threenotch downgrade to our credit ratings. These additional collateral obligations are incremental requirements for each successive downgrade and do not represent the cumulative impact of multiple downgrades. The amounts reported change periodically as a result of several factors, including the transfer of trading activity to centrally cleared financial market infrastructures and exchanges, the expiration of transactions with downgrade triggers, the imposition of internal limitations on new agreements to exclude downgrade triggers, as well as normal course mark-to-market. There is no outstanding senior debt issued in the market that contains rating triggers that would lead to early prepayment of principal.\n\n## Additional contractual obligations for rating downgrades\n\n|                                                        | As at   October 31   | As at   October 31   | As at   October 31     | As at   October 31   | As at   October 31   | As at   October 31     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                        | October 31           | October 31           | October 31             | 2020                 | 2020                 | 2020                   |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                         | One-notch  downgrade | Two-notch  downgrade | Three-notch  downgrade | One-notch  downgrade | Two-notch  downgrade | Three-notch  downgrade |\n| Contractual derivatives funding or margin requirements | $ 312                | $ 112                | $ 140                  | $ 318                | $ 78                 | $ 149                  |\n| Other contractual funding or margin requirements (1)   | 157                  | 13                   | -                      | 187                  | -                    | -                      |",

The range is subject to periodic review in light of changes to internal requirements and external developments.\n\nWe maintain HQLAs in major currencies with dependable market depth and breadth. Our treasury management practices ensure that the levels of HQLA are actively managed to meet target LCR objectives. Our Level 1 assets, as calculated according to OSFI LAR and the BCBS LCR requirements, represent 88% of total HQLA. These assets consist of cash, placements with central banks and highly rated securities issued or guaranteed by governments, central banks and supranational entities.\n\nLCR captures cash flows from on- and off-balance sheet activities that are either expected or could potentially occur within 30 days in an acute stress scenario. Cash outflows result from the application of withdrawal and non-renewal factors to demand and term deposits, differentiated by client type (wholesale, retail and small- and medium-sized enterprises). Cash outflows also arise from business activities that create contingent funding and collateral requirements, such as repo funding, derivatives, short sales of securities and the extension of credit and liquidity commitments to clients. Cash inflows arise primarily from maturing secured loans, interbank loans and non-HQLA securities.\n\nLCR does not reflect any market funding capacity that we believe would be available in a stress situation. All maturing wholesale debt is assigned 100% outflow in the LCR calculation.\n\n## Q4 2021 vs. Q3 2021\n\nThe average LCR for the quarter ended October 31, 2021 was 123%, which translates into a surplus of approximately $67 billion, compared to 125% and a surplus of approximately $69 billion in the prior quarter. LCR has remained relatively stable compared to the previous quarter as growth in retail and wholesale loans was offset by the issuance of term funding and increases in client deposits.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\n\nNSFR is a Basel III metric that measures the sufficiency of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding. The BCBS and OSFI regulatory minimum coverage level for NSFR is 100%.\n\nAvailable stable funding is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends to one year. Required stable funding is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets held by the bank as well as those of its off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nBeginning in Q1 2021, OSFI requires Canadian D-SIBs to disclose the NSFR using the standard Basel disclosure template. Amounts presented in this disclosure template are determined in accordance with the requirements of OSFI's Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) guideline and are not necessarily aligned with the classification requirements prescribed under IFRS.",

        "page_content": "Available stable funding is comprised primarily of a diversified pool of personal and commercial deposits, capital, as well as long-term wholesale liabilities. Required stable funding is driven mainly by the bank's mortgage and loan portfolio, secured loans to financial institutions and to a lesser extent by other less liquid assets. NSFR does not reflect any unused market funding capacity that we believe is available to the bank.\n\nVolume and composition of available stable funding is actively managed to optimize our structural funding position and meet NSFR objectives. Our NSFR is managed in accordance with our comprehensive LRMF.\n\n## Q4 2021 vs. Q3 2021\n\nThe NSFR as at October 31, 2021 was 116%, which translates into a surplus of approximately $114 billion, compared to 116% and a surplus of approximately $110 billion in the prior quarter. NSFR has remained stable compared to the previous quarter as growth in retail and wholesale loans was offset by the issuance of term funding and increases in client deposits.\n\n## Contractual maturities of financial assets, financial liabilities and off-balance sheet items\n\nThe following tables provide remaining contractual maturity profiles of all our assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items at their carrying value (e.g., amortized cost or fair value) at the balance sheet date. Off-balance sheet items are allocated based on the expiry date of the contract.\n\nDetails of contractual maturities and commitments to extend funds are a source of information for the management of liquidity risk.

The amounts disclosed in the following table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows of all financial liabilities (e.g., par value or amount payable upon maturity). The amounts do not reconcile directly with those in our consolidated balance sheets as the table incorporates only cash flows relating to payments on maturity and do not recognize premiums, discounts or mark-to-market adjustments recognized in the instruments' carrying values as at the balance sheet date. Financial liabilities are based upon the earliest period in which they are required to be paid. For off-balance sheet items, the undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under financial guarantees and commitments to extend credit are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be called.\n\n| Contractual maturities of financial liabilities and off-balance sheet items -

Insurance risk is distinct from those risks covered by other parts of our risk management framework (e.g., credit, market and operational risk) where those risks are ancillary to, or accompany, the risk transfer. The five insurance sub-risks are: morbidity, mortality, longevity, policyholder behaviour (lapse), and travel risk.\n\nOur Insurance Risk Management Framework provides an overview of our processes and tools for identifying, assessing, managing, mitigating and reporting on the insurance risks that face the organization. These are also supported by our robust three lines of defence governance structure, which is consistent with our Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\n\n## Operational/regulatory compliance risk drivers\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss or harm resulting from people, inadequate or failed internal processes, controls and systems or from external events. Operational risk is inherent in all of our activities and third-party activities and failure to manage operational risk can result in direct or indirect financial loss, reputational impact or regulatory scrutiny and proceedings in the various jurisdictions where we operate.\n\nOur management of operational risk follows the three lines of defence governance model, encompassing the organizational roles and responsibilities for a coordinated enterprise-wide approach. For further details, refer to the Risk management - Enterprise risk management section.\n\n## Operational risk framework\n\nWe have an Enterprise Operational Risk Framework which sets out the processes to identify, assess, monitor, measure, report and communicate on operational risk. The processes are established through the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Risk identification and assessment tools, including the collection and analysis of risk event data, help risk owners understand and proactively manage operational risk exposures. Risk assessments are intended to ensure alignment between risk exposures and efforts to manage them. Management uses outputs of these tools to make informed risk decisions.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk monitoring tools alert management to changes in the operational risk profile. When paired with escalation and monitoring triggers, risk monitoring tools can identify risk trends, warn management of risk levels that approach or exceed defined limits, as well as prompt actions and mitigation plans to be undertaken.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk capital measurement provides credible estimation of potential risk exposure, including surfaces risk vulnerabilities, and informs strategic and capital planning decisions, which are ultimately intended to ensure that the bank is sufficiently resilient to withstand operational risk losses both in normal times and under stress situations.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk reporting and communication processes ensure that relevant operational risk information is made available to management in a timely manner to support risk-informed business decisions.\n\nConclusions from our operational risk programs enable learning based on what has happened to us, whether it could happen elsewhere in the organization, and what controls we need to amend or implement. These conclusions support the articulation of our operational risk appetite and are used to inform the overall level of operational risk exposure which thereby defines our operational risk profile. This profile includes significant operational risk exposures, potential new and emerging exposures and trends, and overall conclusions on the control environment and risk outlook. We proactively identify and investigate corporate insurance opportunities to mitigate and reduce potential future impacts of operational risk.\n\nWe consider the potential risks and rewards of our decisions to strike a balance between accepting potential losses versus incurring costs of mitigation, the expression of which is in the form of our operational risk appetite. Our operational risk appetite is established at the Board level and cascaded throughout each of our business segments.\n\nManagement reports have been implemented at various levels to support proactive management of operational risk and transparency of risk exposures. These reports are provided to senior management on a regular basis and provide detail on the main drivers of the risk status and trend for each of our business segments and the bank overall. In addition, changes to the operational risk profile that are not aligned to our business strategy or operational risk appetite are identified and discussed at GRC and the Risk Committee of the Board.",

We have a dedicated team of technology and  cybersecurity professionals that manage a comprehensive program to help protect the  organization against breaches and other incidents by ensuring appropriate security and  operational controls are in place. We continue to strengthen our cyber-control framework and to  improve our resilience and cybersecurity capabilities including 24 hour monitoring, cyber  intelligence analysis of internal and external threats and alerting of potentially suspicious security  events and incidents. Throughout the year, we continued to invest in our cybersecurity program,  and multiple scenarios, assessments and simulations were conducted to test our resiliency  strategy.  Data management risk is the risk of failing to manage information appropriately throughout its                                                                                        |\n| Data management and  privacy risk  lifecycle due to inadequate processes and controls, resulting in legal or regulatory consequences,  reputational damage or financial loss. Privacy risk is the risk of improper creation or collection,  use, disclosure, retention or destruction of information. The collection, use and sharing of data, as  well as the management and governance of data, are increasingly important as we continue to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| the Chief Data Office partner with cross-functional teams to develop and implement enterprise- wide standards and practices that describe how data is used, protected, managed and governed.  Money laundering and  Terrorist financing risk  Money laundering and Terrorist financing risk is the risk that our products and services are used to  facilitate the laundering of proceeds of crime, including the financing of terrorist activity. We  maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to deter, detect and report suspected money  laundering and terrorist financing activities across our organization, while seeking to ensure  compliance with the laws and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our  Global AML Compliance Group is dedicated to the continuous development and maintenance of  robust policies, guidelines, training and risk-assessment tools and models to help our employees                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Third-party risk  Third-party risk is the risk of failure to effectively manage third parties which may expose us to  service disruptions, regulatory action, financial loss, litigation or reputational damage. We have a  risk-based enterprise-wide program designed to provide oversight for third-party relationships  that enables us to respond effectively to events that can cause service disruptions, financial loss  or various other risks that could impact us. Our approach to third-party risk mitigation is outlined  in policies and standards that establish the minimum requirements for identifying and managing  risks throughout the engagement with a third party, while ensuring compliance with global  regulatory expectations. We monitor third-party providers that we consider critical to our  operations for any impact on their ability to deliver services to us, including vendors of our  third-party providers.                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Business continuity risk  Business continuity risk is the risk of being unable to maintain, continue or restore essential  business operations during and/or after an event that prevents us from conducting business in the  normal course. Exposure to disruptive operational events interrupts the continuity of our business  operations and could negatively impact our financial results, reputation, client outcomes and/or  result in harm to our employees. These operational events could result from the impact of severe  weather, pandemics, failed processes, technology failures or cyber threats. Our risk-based  enterprise-wide business continuity management program considers multiple scenarios to  address the consequences of a disruption and its effects on the availability of our people,  processes, facilities, technology, and third-party arrangements. Our approach to business  continuity management is outlined in policies and standards embedded across the organization  and the related risks are regularly measured, monitored, reported and integrated in our |\n\n## Operational risk capital\n\nRequirements for operational risk capital are determined in accordance with OSFI issued guidelines. Currently, our operational risk capital is assessed using the Standardized Approach (TSA) which is a formula-based calculation predicated on gross income. Upon implementation of final Basel III reforms, OSFI will require deposit-taking institutions to adopt a new Standardized Approach (SA) for measurement of operational risk capital. The SA methodology is based on the Business Indicator Component (BIC), which is a financial statement-based proxy for operational risk, and the Internal Loss Multiplier, a scaling factor that is based on the historical internal loss average relative to the BIC. Once implemented, SA will replace TSA. For further details on operational risk capital, refer to the Capital management section.\n\n## Operational risk loss events\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, our operational risk losses remain within our risk appetite. For further details on our contingencies, including litigation, refer to Notes 23 and 24 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory compliance risk\n\nRegulatory compliance risk is the risk of potential non-conformance with laws, rules, regulations and prescribed practices in any jurisdiction in which we operate. Issues regarding compliance with laws and regulations can arise in a number of areas in large complex financial institutions, such as ourselves, and are often the result of inadequate or failed internal processes, controls, people or systems. We currently are, and may be at any given time, subject to a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and subject to numerous governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations and other inquiries.\n\nLaws and regulations are in place to protect the financial and other interests of our clients, investors and the public. As a large-scale global financial institution, we are subject to numerous laws and extensive and evolving regulation by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and self-regulatory organizations in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulation continues to become increasingly extensive and complex. In addition, regulatory scrutiny and expectations in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and other jurisdictions for large financial institutions with respect to, among other things, governance, risk management practices and controls, and conduct, as well as the enforcement of regulatory compliance matters, has intensified. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements and expectations or to resolve any identified deficiencies could result in increased regulatory oversight and restrictions. Resolution of such matters can also result in the payment of substantial penalties, agreements with respect to future operation of their business, actions with respect to relevant personnel, admission of wrongdoing, and guilty pleas with respect to criminal charges.\n\nOperating in this increasingly complex regulatory environment and intense regulatory enforcement environment, we are and have been subject to a variety of legal proceedings, including civil claims and lawsuits, criminal charges, regulatory scrutiny, examinations and proceedings, investigations, audits and requests for information by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that our ongoing business activities will give rise to such matters in the future. The global scope of our operations also means that a single issue may give rise to overlapping regulatory investigations, regulatory proceedings and or civil litigation claims in different jurisdictions. RBC can be subject to such proceedings due to alleged violations of law or, if determined by regulators, allegedly inadequate policies, procedures, controls or remediation of deficiencies. Changes to laws, including tax laws, regulations or regulatory policies, as well as the changes in how they are interpreted, implemented or enforced, could adversely affect us, for example, by lowering barriers to entry in the businesses in which we operate, increasing our costs of compliance, or limiting our activities and ability to execute our strategic plans. In addition, the severity of the remedies sought in legal and regulatory proceedings to which RBC is subject have increased. Further, there is no assurance that we always will be, or be deemed to be, in compliance with laws, regulations or regulatory policies or expectations. Accordingly, it is possible that we could receive a judicial or regulatory enforcement judgment or decision that results in significant fines, damages, penalties, and other costs or injunctions, criminal convictions, or loss of licenses or registrations that would damage our reputation, and negatively impact our earnings and ability to conduct some of our businesses. We are also subject to litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business and the adverse resolution of any litigation could have a significant adverse effect on our results or could give rise to significant reputational damage, which in turn could impact our future business prospects.\n\nOur Regulatory Compliance Management Framework outlines how we manage and mitigate the regulatory compliance risks associated with failing to comply with, or adapt to, current and changing laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nRegulatory compliance risk includes the regulatory risks associated with financial crimes (which include, but are not limited to, money laundering, bribery, and sanctions), privacy, market conduct, consumer protection, business conduct, as well as prudential and other generally applicable non-financial requirements. Specific compliance policies, procedures and supporting frameworks have been developed to manage regulatory compliance risk.\n\n## Strategic risk drivers\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk that the enterprise or particular business areas will make inappropriate strategic choices, or will be unable to successfully implement selected strategies or achieve the expected benefits. Business strategy is a major driver of our risk appetite and consequently the strategic choices we make in terms of business mix determine how our risk profile changes.\n\nResponsibility for selecting and successfully implementing business strategies is mandated to the individual heads of each business segment. Oversight of strategic risk is the responsibility of the heads of the business segments and their operating committees, the Enterprise Strategy group, the GE, and the Board. The Enterprise Strategy group supports the management of strategic risk through the strategic planning process, articulated within our Enterprise Strategic Planning Policy, ensuring alignment across our business, financial, capital and risk planning.\n\nOur annual business portfolio review and project approval request processes help to identify and mitigate strategic risk by ensuring strategies for new initiatives, lines of business, and the enterprise as a whole align with our risk appetite and risk posture. GRM provides oversight of strategic risk by providing independent reviews of these processes, establishing enterprise risk frameworks, and independently monitoring and reporting on the level of risk established against our risk appetite metrics in accordance with the three lines of defence governance model.\n\nFor details on the key strategic priorities for our business segments, refer to the Business segment results section.\n\n## Reputation risk\n\nReputation risk is the risk of an adverse impact on stakeholders' perception of the bank due to i) the actions or inactions of the bank, its employees, third-party service providers, or clients, ii) the perceived misalignment of these actions or inactions with stakeholder expectations of the bank, or iii) negative public sentiment towards a global or industry issue. Our reputation is rooted in the perception of our stakeholders, and the trust and loyalty they place in us is core to our purpose as a financial services organization. A strong and trustworthy reputation will generally strengthen our market position, reduce the cost of capital, increase shareholder value, strengthen our resiliency, and help attract and retain top talent. Conversely, damage to our reputation can result in reduced share price and market capitalization, increased cost of capital, loss of strategic flexibility,",

The sources of reputation risk are widespread; risk to our reputation can occur in connection with credit, regulatory, legal and operational risks. We can also experience reputation risk from a failure to maintain an effective control environment, exhibit good conduct and maintain appropriate culture practices.\n\nManaging our reputation risk is an integral part of our organizational culture and our overall enterprise risk management approach, as well as a priority for employees and our Board. Our Board-approved Reputation Risk Management Framework provides an overview of our approach to identify, assess, manage, monitor and report on reputation risk. This framework outlines governance authorities, roles and responsibilities, and controls and mechanisms to manage our reputation risk, including our culture of integrity, compliance with our Code of Conduct and operating within our risk appetite.\n\nOur governance of reputation risk aims to be holistic and provides an integrated view of potential reputation issues across the organization. This governance structure is designed to ensure that ownership and accountability for reputation risk are understood across the enterprise, both proactive and reactive reputation risk decisions are escalated to senior management for review and evaluation, and reporting on reputation risk is comprehensive and integrated.\n\n## Legal and regulatory environment risk\n\nLegal and regulatory environment risk is the risk that new or modified laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of laws and regulations, will negatively impact the way in which we operate, both in Canada and in the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. The full impact of some of these changes on our business will not be known until final rules are implemented and market practices have developed in response. We continue to respond to these and other developments and are working to minimize any potential adverse business or economic impact. The following provides a high-level summary of some of the key regulatory changes that have potential to increase or decrease our costs, impact our profitability and increase the complexity of our operations. A summary of the additional regulatory changes instituted by governments globally and by OSFI in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are included in the Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and Capital management sections of this 2021 Annual Report.\n\n## Global uncertainty\n\nSignificant uncertainty about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, trade policy and geopolitical tensions continue to pose risks to the global economic outlook. In October 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected global growth of 5.9% in calendar 2021, down 0.1% from its July forecast, reflecting supply chain disruptions in advanced economies and limited vaccine access in developing countries. Despite largely positive economic developments throughout the year, uncertainty remains regarding new variants of COVID-19 and the potential impacts of uneven vaccine access and vaccine hesitancy. Trade policy also remains a source of global uncertainty as countries consider ways to incorporate climate policy into trade policy and the U.K. continues to develop its post-Brexit international trade policies. Finally, global financial markets remain vulnerable to geopolitical tensions, such as those between the U.S. and China, many of which center around trade and technology. Our diversified business model, as well as our product and geographic diversification, continue to help mitigate the risks posed by global uncertainty.\n\n## Consumer protection\n\nOn August 18, 2021, the Canadian federal government published the Financial Consumer Protection Framework Regulations which are the underlying regulations to support the new Financial Consumer Protection Framework (FCPF). The FCPF encompasses a number of new consumer protection requirements, including complaint handling, access to banking services, and disclosures. We will be required to comply with the regulations by June 30, 2022 and we expect to be in compliance by the effective date.\n\n## Minimum qualifying rates for insured and uninsured mortgages in Canada\n\nEffective June 1, 2021, the proposed minimum qualifying rate for uninsured mortgages is the greater of the mortgage contract rate plus 2% or 5.25%. OSFI also announced that it will review and communicate the qualifying rate at a minimum annually, every December. The Department of Finance Canada, who is responsible for setting the benchmark rate for qualifying insured mortgages, also announced that it would align the rate for insured mortgages with the rate set by OSFI for uninsured mortgages and that this new rate would apply to insured mortgages approved on June 1, 2021 or later. The minimum qualifying rate for insured mortgages will be subject to review and periodic adjustment.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the most widely referenced benchmark interest rate across the globe for derivatives, bonds, loans and other floating rate instruments; however, there is a regulator-led push to transition the market away from LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates to alternative benchmark rates (ABRs) that are based on actual overnight transactions.\n\nOn March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the regulator of the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) which administers LIBOR, announced the permanent cessation or loss of representativeness of all 35 LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the IBA as of December 31, 2021 or June 30, 2023.\n\nDetails related to certain settings to which we are exposed are noted below.\n\n- GLYPH<129> Publication of the 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR settings will cease immediately after December 31, 2021. Publication of the overnight and 12-month USD LIBOR settings will cease immediately after June 30, 2023, while the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD LIBOR settings will no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure after June 30, 2023. The FCA may consult on requiring the IBA to publish 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD LIBOR settings after the end of June 2023 on a non-representative 'synthetic' basis.\n- GLYPH<129> Publication of the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month GBP LIBOR settings will cease immediately after December 31, 2021, while the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month GBP LIBOR settings will no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure after December 31, 2021. The FCA will require the IBA to continue to publish 1, 3 and 6 month GBP LIBOR settings until the end of 2022 on a non-representative 'synthetic' basis.",

        "page_content": "The FCA announcement engaged contractual triggers for the calculation and future application of fallback provisions related to our LIBOR linked products, including certain loans, bonds and derivatives.\n\nAdditionally, on June 22, 2021, OSFI issued a letter setting out their expectation that Federally Regulated Financial Institutions (FRFIs) will stop using USD LIBOR settings as soon as possible and will not enter into new transactions referencing these rates after December 31, 2021. OSFI further expects FRFIs to prioritize system and model updates to accommodate ABRs by December 31, 2021, and be fully prepared to transact in ABRs that are available in markets in which the FRFI operates by December 31, 2021.\n\nTo manage our transition away from LIBOR, we have implemented a comprehensive enterprise-wide program and governance structure that addresses the key areas of impact including contract remediation, funding and liquidity planning, risk management, financial reporting and valuation, systems, processes and client education and communication. Transition activities are focused on two broad streams of work: (i) developing new ABR linked products, and (ii) conversion of existing LIBOR based contracts to ABRs. Our program timelines are ultimately dependent on broader market acceptance of products that reference the new ABRs and our clients' readiness and ability to adopt the replacement products. Significant matters that we continue to evaluate include client product offerings, short and long-term funding strategies, and our hedging programs. We continue to work towards the recommended target dates for the cessation of LIBOR-based products provided by our regulators and are on track with our transition activities to move to ABRs.\n\nFor further details, refer to the Critical accounting policies and estimates section in this 2021 Annual Report and Note 2 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Client Focused Reforms\n\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators published amendments to National Instrument 31-103 to implement the Client Focused Reforms (Reforms), which are intended to increase the standard of conduct required for Canadian securities registrants. The Reforms enhance core requirements relating to conflicts of interest, suitability, know-your-product and know-your-client requirements, and also introduce new requirements relating to relationship disclosure, training and recordkeeping. The changes are coming into effect in two phases: the first phase relating to conflicts of interest and the related disclosure requirements came into effect on June 30, 2021, and the second phase relating to the remaining requirements comes into effect on December 31, 2021. The requirements primarily impact our Personal & Commercial Banking and Wealth Management platforms. We are well positioned to comply with the requirements.\n\n## U.S. regulatory initiatives\n\nPolicymakers continue to evaluate and implement reforms to various U.S. financial regulations, which could result in either expansion or reduction to the U.S. regulatory requirements and associated changes in compliance costs. On January 1, 2021, the U.S. Congress enacted the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA) which represents a comprehensive set of reforms to U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Regulations pertaining to this legislation have yet to be issued; the extent, timing and impact of which are unknown at this time. We will continue to monitor developments and any resulting implications for us.\n\n## U.K. and European regulatory reform\n\nEU Sustainability-Related Disclosures Regulation requires financial services firms to disclose their approaches to considering environmental, social and governance factors as part of their advice and investment decision processes. These requirements were effective on March 10, 2021 and to date there has been no material impact on us; however, we will continue to monitor future guidance and the impact, if any, on us.\n\nFor further details on regulatory capital and related requirements, refer to the risk and Capital management sections of this 2021 Annual Report.\n\n## Competitive risk\n\nCompetitive risk is the risk of an inability to build or maintain a sustainable competitive advantage in a given market or markets, and includes the potential for loss of market share due to competitors offering superior products and services. Competitive risk can arise within or outside the financial sector, from traditional or non-traditional competitors, domestically or globally. There is intense competition for clients among financial services companies in the markets in which we operate. Client loyalty and retention can be influenced by a number of factors, including new technology used or services offered by our competitors, relative service levels and prices, product and service attributes, our reputation, actions taken by our competitors, and adherence with competition and anti-trust laws. Other companies, such as insurance companies and non-financial companies, as well as new technological applications, are increasingly offering services traditionally provided by banks. This competition could also reduce our revenue which could adversely affect our results.\n\nWe identify and assess competitive risks as part of our overall risk management process. Our products and services are regularly benchmarked against existing and potential competitors. In addition, we regularly conduct risk reviews of our products, services, mergers and acquisitions strategy, as well as we seek to ensure adherence to competition and anti-trust laws. Our annual strategy-setting process also plays an integral role in managing competitive risk.",

Our ability to mitigate systemic risk when undertaking business activities is limited, other than through collaborative mechanisms between key industry participants, and, as appropriate, the public sector and regulators to reduce the frequency and impact of these risks. The two most significant measures in mitigating the impact of systemic risk are diversification and stress testing.\n\nOur diversified business model, portfolios, products, activities and funding sources help mitigate the potential impacts from systemic risk as well as having established risk limits to ensure our portfolio is diversified, and concentration risk is reduced and remains within our risk appetite.\n\nStress testing involves consideration of the simultaneous movements in a number of risk factors. It is used to ensure our business strategies and capital planning are robust by measuring the potential impacts of credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks on us, under adverse economic conditions. Our enterprise-wide stress testing program evaluates the potential effects of a set of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible adverse economic and financial market events. These stress scenarios are evaluated across the organization, and results are integrated to develop an enterprise-wide view of the impacts on our financial results and capital requirements. For further details on our stress testing, refer to the Enterprise risk management section.\n\nOur financial results are affected by the business and economic conditions in the geographic regions in which we operate. These conditions include consumer saving and spending habits as well as consumer borrowing and repayment patterns, business investment, government spending, exchange rates, sovereign debt risks, the level of activity and volatility of the capital markets, strength of the economy and inflation. Given the importance of our Canadian and U.S. operations, an economic downturn may largely affect our personal and business lending activities and may result in higher provisions for credit losses. Deterioration and uncertainty in global capital markets could result in continued high volatility that would impact results in Capital Markets, while in Wealth Management weaker market conditions could lead to lower average fee-based client assets and transaction volumes. In addition, worsening financial and credit market conditions may adversely affect our ability to access capital markets on favourable terms and could negatively affect our liquidity, resulting in increased funding costs and lower transaction volumes in Capital Markets and Investor & Treasury Services.\n\nOur financial results are also sensitive to changes in interest rates. Central banks globally reduced benchmark interest rates in 2020, largely in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to provide support to maintain the resilience and stability of the financial systems. With interest rates remaining low throughout 2021, and expected to continue to remain low into fiscal 2022, we could see net interest income continuing to be unfavourably impacted by spread compression across many of our businesses while an increase in interest rates would benefit our businesses. However, a significant increase in interest rates could also adversely impact household balance sheets, leading to credit deterioration which could negatively impact our financial results, particularly in some of our Personal & Commercial Banking and Wealth Management businesses.\n\n## Overview of other risks\n\nIn addition to the risks described in the risk sections, there are other risk factors, described below, which may affect our businesses and financial results. The following discussion is not exhaustive as other factors could also adversely affect our results.\n\n## Government fiscal, monetary and other policies\n\nOur businesses and earnings are affected by monetary policies that are adopted by the BoC, the Fed in the U.S., the ECB in the EU and monetary authorities in other jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the fiscal policies of the governments of Canada, the U.S., Europe and such other jurisdictions. Such policies can also adversely affect our clients and counterparties in Canada, the U.S. and internationally, which may increase the risk of default by such clients and counterparties.\n\n## Tax risk and transparency\n\nTax risk refers to the risk of loss related to unexpected tax liabilities. The tax laws and systems that are applicable to us are complex and wide-ranging. As a result, we ensure that any decisions or actions related to tax always reflect our assessment of the long-term costs and risks involved, including their impact on our reputation and our relationship with clients, shareholders, and regulators.\n\nOur approach to taxation is grounded in principles which are reflected in our Code of Conduct, is governed by our Enterprise Tax Risk Management Policy, and incorporates the fundamentals of our risk drivers. Oversight of our tax policy and the management of tax risk is the responsibility of the GE, the CFO and the Senior Vice President, Taxation. We discuss our tax strategy with the Audit Committee annually and provide updates on our tax position on a regular basis.\n\nOur tax strategy is designed to provide transparency and support our business strategy, and is aligned with our corporate vision and values. We seek to maximize shareholder value by structuring our businesses in a tax-efficient manner while considering reputational risk by being in compliance with all laws and regulations. Our policy requires that we:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Act with integrity and in a straightforward, open and honest manner in all tax matters;\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure tax strategy is aligned with our business strategy supporting only bona fide transactions with a business purpose and economic substance;\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure all intercompany transactions are conducted in accordance with applicable transfer pricing requirements;\n- GLYPH<129> Ensure our full compliance and full disclosure to tax authorities of our statutory obligations; and\n- GLYPH<129> Endeavour to work with the tax authorities to build positive long-term relationships and where disputes occur, address them constructively.",

We seek to ensure that we only support bona fide client transactions with a business purpose and economic substance. Should we become aware of client transactions that are aimed at evading their tax obligations, we will not proceed with the transactions.\n\nWe operate in 29 countries worldwide. Our activities in these countries are subject to both Canadian and international tax legislation and other regulations, and are fully disclosed to the relevant tax authorities. The Taxation group and GRM both regularly review the activities of all entities in an effort to ensure compliance with tax requirements and other regulations.\n\nGiven that we operate globally, complex tax legislation and accounting principles have resulted in differing legal interpretations between the respective tax authorities we deal with and ourselves, and we are at risk of tax authorities disagreeing with prior positions we have taken for tax purposes. When this occurs, we are committed to an open and transparent dialogue with the tax authorities to facilitate a quick assessment and prompt resolution of the issues where possible. Failure to adequately manage tax risk and resolve issues with tax authorities in a satisfactory manner could adversely impact our results, potentially to a material extent in a particular period, and/or significantly impact our reputation.\n\n## Tax contribution\n\nIn 2021, total income and other tax expense, including income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity, to various levels of governments globally totalled $8 billion (2020 - $4 billion). In Canada, total income and other tax expense for the year ended October 31, 2021 to various levels of government totalled $7 billion (2020 - $3 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on income and other tax expense, refer to the Financial performance section.\n\n## Environmental and social risk\n\nEnvironmental and Social (E&S) risk is the potential for an E&S issue associated with us, a client, transaction, product, supplier or activity, to have a negative impact on our financial position, operations, legal and regulatory compliance, or reputation. E&S issues include, but are not limited to, site contamination, waste management, land and resource use, biodiversity, water quality and availability, climate change, environmental regulation, human rights (including, but not limited to, Indigenous Peoples' rights), and community engagement. GRM is responsible for developing and maintaining policies to identify, assess, monitor and report on E&S risk, and to regularly review and update E&S risk policies. These policies seek to identify sectors, clients and business activities that may expose us to E&S risk, establish requirements to manage, mitigate and monitor E&S risk, including when to apply enhanced due diligence and escalation procedures. Business segments and functional areas are responsible for incorporating E&S risk management requirements within their operations.\n\nWe recognize the importance of E&S risk management practices and processes and are committed to regular and transparent disclosures. Global practices in the identification, assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities are rapidly evolving. We are working to advance our climate risk measurement, management, monitoring and reporting capabilities and to advance our understanding of the impact climate-related risks may have on our business and our clients' businesses. The TCFD Disclosure section below discusses our participation in climate initiatives and industry working groups. In addition, as a signatory to the Equator Principles (EP), we report annually on projects assessed according to the EP framework. RBC Global Asset Management (GAM) 1 and BlueBay Asset Management LLP are signatories to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and report annually on their responsible investment activities to the UN PRI. RBC Europe Limited (RBCEL), a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank, is a member of the Green Bond Principles and reports annually on its green bond underwriting activities. Our annual ESG Performance Report provides disclosure on our approach and performance towards addressing significant E&S and human rights issues. We published our Human Rights Position Statement in October 2020, recognizing the need to consider human rights impacts in our business activities. The Human Rights Position Statement sets out our commitment to respect internationally-recognized human rights in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We also publish an annual Modern Slavery Act Statement, which sets out the policies and processes that are in place to prevent slavery and human trafficking from taking place in our operations and supply chains, and climate-related disclosures that consider the recommendations of the FSB's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nWe also continue to explore opportunities to expand the products and services we provide to respond to the evolving ESG landscape, help our clients navigate the transition to a net-zero economy, and advance their sustainability strategies. The TCFD Disclosure section below discusses a number of products and services that we provide to respond to climate-related opportunities and these offerings also often address broader ESG-related considerations.",

The Board provides oversight of our strategic approach to climate change and our E&S risks, which includes how we manage climate-related risks and opportunities. Each of the four Committees of the Board, the Risk Committee, the Governance Committee, the Audit Committee and the Human Resources Committee, have oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities that are specific to their respective oversight responsibilities. The Board reviewed our updated climate strategy, RBC's Climate Blueprint, in February 2021. The Board and its Committees also received reports on a range of climate change-related issues, which included our climate change strategy, climate risks including physical and transition risk in our enterprise-wide stress testing, measurement and reporting of emissions, the regulatory landscape and regulatory initiatives, increasing stakeholder focus, as well as our engagement with stakeholders. We have established a Climate Strategy Steering Committee and a Climate Strategy & Governance Team, focused on providing enterprise-wide strategic direction on advancing our understanding and developing strategies to address climate-related risks and opportunities for us and our clients. GRM has senior executive representation on the Climate Strategy Steering Committee and also has a dedicated E&S risk team that develops approaches to identify, assess, monitor and report on climate-related risks, as appropriate.\n\n## Strategy\n\nWe recognize we have a role to play in accelerating the transition to a net-zero economy and mitigating the risks associated with climate change. Our RBC Climate Blueprint outlines our climate strategy and includes our commitment to net-zero emissions in our lending by 2050, beginning with measuring and reporting our financed emissions for key sectors. Our enterprise strategy for addressing climate-related opportunities includes supporting our clients in the net-zero transition, advancing our capabilities in climate risk measurement and management, reducing emissions from our own operations, speaking up for smart climate solutions, and investing in technology to address complex environmental challenges. RBC GAM published its approach to climate change that lays out its commitments and actions related to climate change.\n\nWe are working to develop products, solutions and advice to assist our clients as they transition to a net-zero economy. In 2021, we committed to achieving $500 billion in sustainable financing by 2025, and we issued a 5-year US$750 million green bond, our second green bond offering and our first issuance through our Sustainable Bond Framework which was launched in 2020. Our participation in the rapidly evolving sustainable finance and green bond market helps to enable and advance the net-zero transition.\n\nWe are active participants in industry groups that support the development of strategies and plans to transition to a netzero economy. In 2021:\n\n- GLYPH<129> We joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) and have begun work to measure and report our financed emissions for key sectors.\n- GLYPH<129> We joined RMI's Center for Climate-Aligned Finance to convene stakeholders and advance progress on sector-based decarbonisation pathways.\n- GLYPH<129> We pledged to join the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) as part of a global, industry-led initiative to accelerate and support efforts to address climate change.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nWe regard climate risk as a transverse risk, which impacts all the other risk categories for which we have established limits, and requires us to consider how financial and non-financial factors may impact us and our clients. We initially identified climate change as an emerging risk in 2017 and, as such, our approach to managing it is reported on a regular basis to senior management and to the Risk Committee of the Board. We define climate risk as risk related to the transition to a net-zero economy (transition risk) and risk related to the physical impacts of climate change (physical risk), which includes both chronic and acute risks. We continue to advance our capabilities and approach to climate risk management:\n\n- GLYPH<129> We conduct portfolio, client and scenario analyses to assess our exposure to, and the impact of, climate-related risks.\n- GLYPH<129> We participated in a climate scenario analysis pilot project with the Bank of Canada and OSFI to build our climate scenario analysis knowledge and understanding of our potential exposure to climate-related transition risks.\n- GLYPH<129> We have committed to refining our climate risk appetite and setting interim reduction goals on our path to net-zero emissions in our lending by 2050.\n- GLYPH<129> We are building out climate-related scenario analysis and stress testing capabilities. As part of our annual stress testing and analysis, we incorporated components of climate risk through transition and physical risk stresses and assessed its impact on our key portfolios.\n- GLYPH<129> With the potential for climate risk to translate to increased credit risk, we have done work to identify those sectors within our wholesale portfolio that are most affected by physical and transition risk, which allows us to better focus ongoing monitoring of climate risk.\n\nAs with risk appetite, as we continue to develop our climate risk measurement capabilities this will inform the steps we take to further the implementation of climate-related risk limits and advance the integration of climate risks into our policies and procedures.",

Both we and our clients may also be exposed to climate risk through technological and societal change and market forces, in addition to the factors outlined above. Additionally, we and our clients may also be vulnerable to physical climate risk. We regularly review the risks that we face and reflect on those that affect our clients, considering:\n\nEmerging regulatory and legal requirements\n\nDisruptions to operations and client services\n\nProducts and services we provide\n\n- GLYPH<129> Climate change regulations, frameworks, and guidance that apply to banks, insurers and asset managers are rapidly evolving. Several central banks and regulators have taken steps towards introducing or have already introduced rules to address the financial and economic risks of climate change. As regulations and formal requirements evolve, we will monitor such developments and update our risk management practices and disclosures as necessary.\n- GLYPH<129> For clients in RBC's Corporate Client Group and Capital Markets that are in sectors categorized as high environmental risk, such as those in carbon-intensive sectors, we evaluate whether clients have assessed and quantified the regulatory impacts of climate change as part of our due diligence and risk assessment process.\n- GLYPH<129> We identify properties that we lease or own, which contain business processes and supporting applications that require enhanced facility infrastructure to mitigate site disruptions, such as those caused by extreme weather events.

For example, we provide sustainable finance products such as green, social and sustainability bond underwriting, sustainability-linked bonds and loans as well as advisory services to integrate ESG factors for companies that are in the pre-initial public offering or pre-acquisition stage. In addition, our offerings include ESG-integrated investment solutions, structured products, carbon trading services, ESG research and thought leadership.\n- GLYPH<129> RBC GAM integrates material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in its investment processes to help mitigate risk and/or enhance long-term, risk-adjusted returns.\n- GLYPH<129> RBC Insurance \u00ae (through its insurance agency) sells property and casualty insurance products that are underwritten and insured by Aviva Canada Inc. As such, RBC Insurance is not directly exposed to climaterelated risks associated with these products. The property and casualty insurance industry as a whole has exposure to longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as rising temperatures and hurricanes, which may indirectly impact our Insurance business results. We are working to advance our understanding of the impact of acute and longer term weather events on travel insurance, and for life and health insurance products sold to group/business clients.\n\n## Metrics & Targets\n\nWe have committed to net-zero emissions in our lending by 2050 and also have commitments associated with financing, investments, risk management and carbon reduction in our operations, research, partnerships, and philanthropy. Performance is reported on in our annual TCFD Report and in the RBC GAM TCFD Report. The first RBC GAM TCFD report was published in April 2021. We have commenced efforts to measure our financed emissions in accordance with the PCAF methodology. As a signatory to the Carbon Disclosure Project, we have publicly reported climate-related data since 2003, including multi-year data in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. We also receive third-party limited assurance on our energy and emissions metrics.\n\n## Other factors\n\nOther factors that may affect our results include changes in government trade policy, changes in accounting standards and their effect on our accounting policies, estimates and judgments, currency and interest rate movements in Canada, the U.S., and other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct business, changes to our credit ratings, the timely and successful development of new products and services, technological changes, effective design, implementation and execution of processes and their associated controls, fraud by internal and external parties, the possible impact on our business from disease or illness that affects local, national or global economies, disruptions to public infrastructure, including transportation, communication, power and water, international conflicts and other political developments and our success in anticipating and managing the associated risks.\n\nWe caution that the foregoing discussion of risk factors, many of which are beyond our control, is not exhaustive and other factors could also affect our results.",

In addition to the regulatory requirements, we consider the expectations of credit rating agencies, depositors and shareholders, as well as our business plans, stress tests, peer comparisons and our internal capital ratio targets. Our goal is to optimize our capital usage and structure, and to provide support for our business segments and clients. We also aim to generate optimal returns for our shareholders, while protecting depositors and creditors.\n\n## Capital management framework\n\nOur capital management framework establishes policies and processes for defining, measuring, raising and investing all forms of capital in a coordinated and consistent manner. It sets our overall approach to capital management, including guiding principles and roles and responsibilities relating to capital adequacy and transactions, dividends, solo capital and management of RWA and leverage ratio exposures. We manage and monitor capital from several perspectives, including regulatory capital and solo capital.\n\nOur capital planning process is dynamic and involves various teams including Finance, Corporate Treasury, GRM, Economics and our businesses, and covers internal capital ratio targets, potential capital transactions as well as projected dividend payouts and share repurchases. This process considers our business operating plans, enterprise-wide stress testing and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), regulatory capital changes and requirements, accounting changes, internal capital requirements, rating agency metrics and solo capital.\n\nOur capital plan is established on an annual basis and is aligned with the management actions included in the annual business operating plan, which includes forecast growth in assets and earnings taking into account our business strategies, the projected market and economic environment, and peer positioning. This includes incorporating potential capital transactions based on our projected internal capital generation, business forecasts, market conditions and other developments, such as accounting and regulatory changes that may impact capital requirements. All of the components in the capital plan are monitored throughout the year and are revised as deemed appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur enterprise-wide stress testing and annual ICAAP processes provide key inputs for capital planning, including setting internal capital ratio targets. The stress scenarios are evaluated across the organization, and results are integrated to develop an enterprise-wide view of financial impacts and capital requirements, which in turn facilitate the planning of mitigating actions to absorb adverse events. ICAAP assesses capital adequacy and requirements covering all material risks, with a cushion for plausible contingencies. In accordance with OSFI guidelines, major components of our ICAAP process include comprehensive risk assessment, stress testing, capital assessment and planning, Board and senior management oversight, monitoring and reporting and internal control review.\n\nOur internal capital targets are established to maintain robust capital positions in excess of OSFI's Basel III regulatory targets. The results of our enterprise-wide stress testing and ICAAP processes are incorporated into the OSFI Capital Buffers, DSIB/Globally Systemically Important Banks (G-SIB) surcharge, and Domestic Stability Buffer (DSB), with a view to ensure that the bank has adequate capital to underpin risks and absorb losses under all plausible stress scenarios, including the COVID-19 pandemic, given our risk profile and appetite. In addition, we include a discretionary cushion on top of OSFI's regulatory targets to reflect our risk appetite, our forecasts of potential negative downturns and to maintain our capital strength for forthcoming regulatory and accounting changes, peer comparatives, rating agencies sensitivities and solo capital level.\n\nThe Board is responsible for the ultimate oversight of capital management, including the annual review and approval of the capital plan. ALCO and Group Executive (GE) share responsibility for capital management and receive regular reports detailing our compliance with approved limits and guidelines. The Audit and Risk Committees jointly approve the ICAAP process.\n\n## Basel III\n\nOur consolidated regulatory capital requirements are determined by guidelines issued by OSFI, which are based on the minimum Basel III capital ratios adopted by the BCBS.\n\nUnder Basel III, banks select from two main approaches, the Standardized Approach (SA) or the IRB Approach, to calculate their minimum regulatory capital required to support credit, market and operational risks. We adopted the Basel III IRB approach to calculate credit risk capital for consolidated regulatory reporting purposes. While the majority of our credit risk exposures are reported under the Basel III IRB Approach for regulatory capital purposes, certain portfolios continue to use the Basel III Standardized Approach for credit risk (for example, our Caribbean Banking operations and City National). For consolidated regulatory reporting of market risk capital, we use both the Internal Models-based and Standardized Approaches, and for consolidated regulatory reporting of operational risk capital we use the Standardized Approach. We determine our regulatory leverage ratio based on OSFI's Leverage Requirements (LR) Guideline, which reflects the BCBS Basel III leverage ratio requirements.",

        "page_content": "All federally regulated banks with a Basel III leverage ratio total exposure exceeding \u20ac 200 billion at their financial year-end are required, at a minimum, to publicly disclose in the first quarter following their year-end, the twelve indicators used in the G-SIB assessment methodology, with the goal of enhancing the transparency of the relative scale of banks' potential global systemic importance and data quality. The FSB publishes an updated list of G-SIBs annually. On November 23, 2021, we were re-designated as a G-SIB by the FSB. This designation requires us to maintain a higher loss absorbency requirement (common equity as a percentage of RWA) of 1% consistent with the D-SIB requirement.\n\nOn April 18, 2018, OSFI released its final guideline on Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC), which applies to Canadian D-SIBs as part of the Federal Government's Bail-in regime. The guideline is consistent with the TLAC standard released on November 9, 2015 by the FSB for institutions designated as G-SIBs, but tailored to the Canadian context. The TLAC requirement is intended to address the sufficiency of a systemically important bank's loss absorbing capacity in supporting its recapitalization in the event of its failure. TLAC is defined as the aggregate of Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, and other TLAC instruments, which allow conversion in whole or in part into common shares under the CDIC Act and meet all of the eligibility criteria under the guideline.\n\nTLAC requirements established two minimum standards, which are required to be met effective November 1, 2021: the riskbased TLAC ratio, which builds on the risk-based capital ratios described in the Capital Adequacy Requirements (CAR) guideline, and the TLAC leverage ratio, which builds on the leverage ratio described in OSFI's LR guideline. As at October 31, 2021, our TLAC ratio of 25.7% was above the minimum TLAC ratio requirement of 24%, which includes the DSB requirement of 2.5% mentioned below, and our TLAC leverage ratio of 8.6% was above the minimum requirement of 6.75%. We do not anticipate any challenges in complying with these requirements.\n\nOSFI requires all D-SIBs to publicly disclose their Pillar 2 DSB as part of their quarterly disclosures, similar to other current capital-related disclosure requirements. The level of the Pillar 2 buffer ranges between 0% and 2.5% of the entity's total RWA for each of the six systemically important banks in Canada. The DSB requirements must be met at the CET1 capital level. OSFI undertakes a review of the DSB on a semi-annual basis, in June and December, and will publicly announce any changes at that time. However, on March 13, 2020, OSFI announced a decrease in the DSB from 2.25% to 1.0% of total RWA, with the buffer decrease effective immediately, in response to the disruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and in support of the banks' ability to supply additional credit to the economy. At that time, OSFI also committed to not increasing the DSB for a period of 18 months and also announced its expectation that all banks should not increase their dividend payments and should stop any share buybacks. On June 17, 2021, OSFI announced an increase in the DSB from 1.0% to 2.5% of total RWA effective October 31, 2021. The 2.5% reflects the highest DSB requirement under OSFI capital requirements. On November 4, 2021, OSFI announced that banks are permitted to increase their dividend payments and to execute share buybacks, once approved.\n\nIn Q2 2020, OSFI announced a series of regulatory adjustments and guidance to support the financial and operational resilience of the banking sector in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and continues, as needed, to release regulations implementing, clarifying, updating or unwinding certain aspects or requirements. Such measures and guidance include:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Regulatory adjustments to RWA, including temporary measures to reduce stressed VaR multipliers from three to one and the permanent exclusion of Funding Valuation Adjustment hedges from market risk.\n- O Effective May 1, 2021, OSFI unwound the temporary measures to reduce SVaR multipliers, requiring banks to revert to prepandemic levels.\n- GLYPH<129> Modifications for increases in expected credit loss provisions on CET1 capital by applying a 70% after-tax exclusion rate for growth in Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowances between Q1 2020 and the respective quarters of fiscal 2020. The exclusion rate was reduced to the current 50% in fiscal 2021 and will be reduced to 25% in fiscal 2022. These modifications are not available for a financial institution's IRB portfolio in any quarter in which the financial institution has a shortfall in allowances.\n- GLYPH<129> Exclusion of central bank reserves and sovereign-issued securities that qualify as HQLA from leverage ratio exposure amounts until December 31, 2021.\n- O On August 12, 2021, OSFI announced that the exclusion of sovereign-issued securities that qualify as HQLA from the leverage ratio exposure measure will not extend beyond December 31, 2021 and that central bank reserves will continue to be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure.\n- GLYPH<129> Reduction in the current regulatory capital floor for financial institutions using the IRB approach from 75% to 70% of RWA under the SA. The reduced floor factor will remain in place until the adoption of the Basel III reforms.\n\nIn relation to the relief programs launched by both the Canadian and U.S. federal governments and described in the Impact of COVID-19 pandemic section of this 2021 Annual Report, OSFI has provided guidance on the associated capital treatment of these programs:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Loans issued under the CEBA program are to be excluded from risk-based capital and leverage ratios as they are fully guaranteed by the government.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk-weighting for both the guaranteed and unsecured portion of loans issued as part of the EDC BCAP Guarantee program, as well as for the BDC Highly Affected Sectors Credit Availability Program (HASCAP), should be in accordance with existing regulatory guidelines. The full amount of these loans are required to be included in the leverage ratio calculation.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk-based capital and leverage ratio calculations should reflect only the financial institutions' own proportion of new loans issued under the BDC lending programs.\n- GLYPH<129> Exclusion of exposures acquired through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) instituted by the U.S. government from RWA and leverage exposure amounts.\n\nOSFI has assessed and will continue to assess the need for these relief measures. We have incorporated the above adjustments and guidance, as applicable, into our results and in our ongoing capital planning activities.",

capital buffer as prescribed by OSFI.\n- (2) A capital surcharge, equal to the higher of our D-SIB surcharge and the BCBS's G-SIB surcharge, is applicable to risk-weighted capital.\n- (3) The DSB was increased from 1.0% to 2.5% of total RWA effective October 31, 2021.\n- n.a. not applicable\n\n## Regulatory capital, RWA and capital ratios\n\nUnder Basel III, regulatory capital consists of CET1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n\nCET1 capital comprises the highest quality of capital. Regulatory adjustments under Basel III include full deductions of certain items and additional capital components that are subject to threshold deductions.\n\nTier 1 capital comprises predominantly CET1 and Additional Tier 1 items including non-cumulative preferred shares and limited recourse capital notes (LRCNs) that meet certain criteria. Tier 2 capital primarily includes subordinated debentures that meet certain criteria and certain loan loss allowances. Total capital is defined as the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Preferred shares, LRCNs, and subordinated debentures issued after January 1, 2013 require Non-viability contingent capital (NVCC) features to be included into regulatory capital. NVCC requirements ensure that non-common regulatory capital instruments bear losses before banks seek government funding.\n\nRegulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital by total RWA.\n\nThe following chart provides a summary of the major components of CET1, Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) In accordance with OSFI's regulatory adjustments announced in Q2 2020, and as discussed above, includes capital modifications associated with Stage 1 and 2 allowances which were subject to a 50% after-tax exclusion rate in fiscal 2021 that will be reduced to 25% in fiscal 2022.\n- (2) First level: The amount by which each of the items exceeds a 10% threshold of CET1 capital (after all deductions but before threshold deductions) will be deducted from CET1 capital. Second level: The aggregate amount of the three items not deducted from the first level above and in excess of 15% of CET1 capital after regulatory adjustments will be deducted from capital, and the remaining balance not deducted will be risk-weighted at 250%.\n- (3) Non-significant investments are subject to certain CAR criteria that drive the amount eligible for deduction.",

Our Tier 1 ratio was also positively impacted by the issuance of LRCNs, partially offset by the redemption of preferred shares.\n\nOur Total capital ratio of 16.7% was up 120 bps, reflecting the factors noted above under the Tier 1 capital ratio.\n\nOur Leverage ratio of 4.9% was up 10 bps, mainly reflecting internal capital generation and the issuance of LRCNs, partially offset by growth in leverage exposures, the redemption of preferred shares and the impact of lower capital modification as noted above under the CET1 ratio.\n\nLeverage exposures increased by $109 billion mainly driven by business growth in loans, interest-bearing deposits with banks, securities, undrawn commitments, repo-style transactions and derivatives, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation and higher regulatory modifications for central bank reserves and sovereign-issued securities qualifying as HQLA.\n\n## Basel III RWA\n\nOSFI requires banks to meet minimum risk-based capital requirements for exposures to credit risk, operational risk, and where they have significant trading activity, market risk. RWA is calculated for each of these risk types and added together to determine total RWA. In addition, a minimum capital floor requirement must be maintained as prescribed under OSFI's CAR guidelines which is currently set to 70% of RWA as calculated under current Basel III standardized credit risk and market risk approaches as defined in the CAR guidelines. If the capital requirement is less than the required threshold, a floor adjustment to RWA must be applied to the reported RWA as prescribed by OSFI CAR guidelines.",

These factors were partially offset by the net impact of models and methodology updates, the impact of foreign exchange translation and net credit migration in wholesale and retail portfolios. The models and methodology updates mainly include recalibration of the probability of default parameters in our wholesale portfolio, partially offset by an increase in SVaR multipliers reflecting the unwinding of temporary measures introduced by OSFI in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and transitional methodology changes to the securitization framework. The impact of foreign exchange translation on RWA is largely mitigated with economic hedges in our CET1 ratio.",

This NCIB expired on March 1, 2021, with 0.4 million common shares repurchased and cancelled at a cost of $39 million. In accordance with OSFI's announcement on March 13, 2020 of its expectation that share buybacks be stopped, we ceased the repurchase of our common shares effective March 13, 2020.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, we did not have an active NCIB. When we do have an active NCIB, we determine the amount and timing of purchases under an NCIB, subject to prior consultation with OSFI. Purchases may be made through the TSX, the NYSE and other designated exchanges and alternative Canadian trading systems. The price paid for repurchased shares is the prevailing market price at the time of acquisition.\n\nOn November 2, 2020, we issued $1,250 million of LRCN Series 2, at a price per note of $1,000. The LRCN Series 2 bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.0% per annum until February 24, 2026, and thereafter at a rate per annum, reset every fifth year, equal to the 5-Year Government of Canada Yield plus 3.617% until maturity on February 24, 2081.\n\nOn January 20, 2021, we redeemed all $1,500 million of our outstanding NVCC 3.31% subordinated debentures due on January 20, 2026 for 100% of their principal amount plus interest accrued to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n\nOn January 28, 2021, we issued $1,000 million of NVCC subordinated debentures. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.67% per annum until January 28, 2028, and at the three-month Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.55% thereafter until their maturity on January 28, 2033.\n\nOn May 24, 2021, we redeemed all 29 million of our issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset First Preferred Shares Series BK at a price of $25 per share.\n\nOn June 8, 2021, we issued $1,000 million of LRCN Series 3, at a price per note of $1,000. The LRCN Series 3 bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.65% per annum until November 24, 2026, and thereafter at a rate per annum, reset every fifth year, equal to the 5-Year Government of Canada Yield plus 2.665% until maturity on November 24, 2081.\n\nOn August 24, 2021, we redeemed all 30 million of our issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate Reset First Preferred Shares Series BM at a price of $25 per share.\n\nOn September 29, 2021, we redeemed all $1,000 million of our outstanding NVCC 3.45% subordinated debentures due on September 29, 2026 for 100% of their principal amount plus interest accrued to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n\nOn October 14, 2021, we issued $1,750 million of NVCC subordinated debentures. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.14% per annum until November 3, 2026, and at the three-month Canadian Dollar Offered Rate plus 0.61% thereafter until their maturity on November 3, 2031.\n\nOn November 5, 2021, we issued 750 thousand of Non-Cumulative 5-Year Fixed Rate Reset First Preferred Shares Series BT to certain institutional investors at a price of $1,000 per share.\n\n## Dividends\n\nOur common share dividend policy reflects our earnings outlook, payout ratio objective and the need to maintain adequate levels of capital to support business plans. In 2021, our dividend payout ratio was 39%. Common share dividends paid during the year were $6 billion. In accordance with OSFI's announcement on March 13, 2020 of its expectation that all banks should not increase their dividend payment, we did not increase our dividend payments in fiscal 2021. OSFI lifted this restriction on November 4, 2021.",

If a NVCC trigger event were to occur, our NVCC capital instruments as at October 31, 2021, which were the preferred shares Series AZ, BB, BD, BF, BH, BI, BJ, BO, LRCN Series 1, LRCN Series 2, LRCN Series 3 and subordinated debentures due on January 27, 2026, July 25, 2029, December 23, 2029, June 30, 2030, January 28, 2033, and November 3, 2031 would be converted into common shares pursuant to an automatic conversion formula with a conversion price based on the greater of: (i) a contractual floor price of $5.00, and (ii) the current market price of our common shares at the time of the trigger event (10-day weighted average). Based on a floor price of $5.00 and including an estimate for accrued dividends and interest, these NVCC capital instruments would convert into a maximum of 4,057 million common shares, in aggregate, which would represent a dilution impact of 74.01% based on the number of common shares outstanding as at October 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Attributed capital\n\nOur methodology for allocating capital to our business segments is based on the Basel III regulatory capital requirements, with the exception of Insurance. For Insurance, the allocation of capital is based on fully diversified economic capital. Risk-based capital attribution provides a uniform base for performance measurement among business segments, which compares to our overall corporate return objective and facilitates management decisions in resource allocation in conjunction with other factors.\n\nThe calculation and attribution of capital involves a number of assumptions and judgments by management which are monitored to ensure that the regulatory capital framework remains comprehensive and consistent. The models are benchmarked to leading industry practices via participation in surveys, reviews of methodologies and ongoing interaction with external risk management industry professionals.\n\nFor additional information on the risks highlighted below, refer to the Risk management section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) RWA amount represents period-end spot balances. Attributed Capital represents average balances.\n- (2) Other includes (a) non-Insurance segments: equity required to underpin Basel III regulatory capital deductions other than Goodwill and other intangibles as well as capital modifications for expected loss provisioning and (b) Insurance segment: equity required to underpin risks associated with business, fixed assets and insurance risks.\n- (3) Insurance RWA represents our investments in the insurance subsidiaries capitalized at the regulatory prescribed rate as required under OSFI CAR guideline.\n\n## Other considerations affecting capital\n\nCapital treatment for equity investments in other entities is determined by a combination of accounting and regulatory guidelines based on the size or nature of the investment. Three broad approaches apply as follows:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Consolidation: entities which we control are consolidated on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n- GLYPH<129> Deduction: certain holdings are deducted from our regulatory capital. These include all unconsolidated 'substantial investments,' as defined by the Bank Act (Canada) in the capital of financial institutions, as well as all investments in insurance subsidiaries.\n- GLYPH<129> Risk-weighting: equity investments that are not deducted from capital are risk-weighted at a prescribed rate for determination of capital charges.\n\n## Regulatory capital approach for securitization exposures\n\nOur securitization regulatory capital approach reflects Chapter 7 of OSFI's CAR guidelines. For our securitization exposures, we use an internal assessment approach (IAA) for exposures related to our ABCP business, and as per regulatory guidelines for other securitization exposures we use a combination of approaches including an external ratings based approach, an IRB approach and a standardized approach.\n\nWhile our IAA rating methodologies are based in large part on criteria that are published by External Credit Assessment Institutions (ECAIs) such as S&P and therefore are similar to the methodologies used by these institutions, they are not identical. Our ratings process includes a comparison of the available credit enhancement in a securitization structure to a stressed level of projected losses. The stress level used is determined by the desired risk profile of the transaction. As a result, we stress the cash flows of a given transaction at a higher level in order to achieve a higher rating. Conversely, transactions that only pass lower stress levels achieve lower ratings.",

        "page_content": "Most of the other securitization exposures (non-ABCP) carry external ratings and we use the external rating for determining the proper capital allocation for these positions. We periodically compare our own ratings to ECAIs ratings to ensure that the ratings provided by ECAIs are reasonable.\n\nGRM is responsible for providing risk assessments for capital purposes in respect of all our banking book exposures. GRM is independent of the business originating the securitization exposures and performs its own analysis, sometimes in conjunction with but always independent of the applicable business. GRM has developed asset class specific criteria guidelines which provide the rating methodologies for each asset class. The guidelines are reviewed periodically and are subject to the ratings replication process mandated by Pillar I of the Basel rules.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\n## Basel III reforms\n\nOn March 11, 2021, OSFI launched industry consultations on the adoption of the BCBS Basel III reforms into its existing Capital Adequacy Requirements, Leverage Requirements and Liquidity Adequacy Requirements Guidelines and related Pillar 3 disclosure requirements. While adopting the international standards, OSFI is also tailoring requirements for the Canadian market. On November 29, 2021, OSFI announced a one quarter implementation delay of its adoption timeline for these reforms to April 30, 2023.\n\nOn June 18, 2021, OSFI launched an industry consultation on proposed regulatory changes to the treatment of credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and market risk hedges of other valuation adjustments of over-the-counter derivatives referred to as XVA. The proposed changes are a continuation of OSFI's aforementioned industry consultation announced in March 2021 to incorporate the latest and final round of Basel III reforms into its capital, leverage and related disclosure guidelines for banks. These revised guidelines will be effective in Q1 2024.\n\nOn November 11, 2021, BCBS finalized the disclosure requirements for the Minimum capital requirements for market risk standards published in January 2019. OSFI has not yet released their disclosure requirements; however, OSFI requires implementation of the Minimum capital requirements for market risk standards in Q1 2024.\n\nWe expect to continue to engage with OSFI on the domestic implementation of the Basel III reforms and are taking appropriate steps to ensure required adoption readiness based on guidance provided to date.\n\n## Global systemically important banks (G-SIBs)\n\nOn August 13, 2021, OSFI released revised G-SIB disclosure requirements which take into consideration the 2022 revised G-SIB assessment methodology incorporating a new trading volume indicator and inclusion of insurance activities for certain indicators. The new disclosure requirements are effective for us in Q1 2022 and we are well-positioned to comply with the new requirements. In addition, we are currently assessing the impact of the revised G-SIB framework and we do not anticipate any material impact to our current G-SIB surcharge loss absorbency requirement of 1%.\n\nOn November 9, 2021, the BCBS finalized a technical amendment to the G-SIB methodology to replace the existing three-year review cycle requirement with one of ongoing monitoring and review. BCBS will consider updating the G-SIB methodology only if monitoring findings suggest material unintended consequences or deficiencies.\n\n## Accounting and control matters\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\n## Application of critical accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies and related estimates are recognized as critical because they require us to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and significantly different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve and the economic environment in which we operate could continue to be subject to sustained uncertainty, which could continue to impact our financial results. While the global economic recovery has continued, momentum has waned amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor and assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions. For further information, refer to our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOur critical accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions relate to the fair value of financial instruments, allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other intangible assets, employee benefits, consolidation, derecognition of financial assets, application of the effective interest method, provisions, insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities, and income taxes. Our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed and approved by our Audit Committee, in consultation with management, as part of their review and approval of our significant accounting policies, judgments, estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we adopted the revised Conceptual Framework, which replaces the previous version of the Conceptual Framework issued in 2010. The Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and does not override the concepts or requirements in any standard. It may be used to develop consistent accounting policies where there is no applicable standard in place. The revisions include a few new concepts, updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts. These amendments had no material impact on our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we early adopted the Phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement , IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures , IFRS 4 Insurance contracts , and IFRS 16 Leases (the Amendments) in response to the market transition away from interbank offered rates (IBORs) to alternative benchmark rates (ABRs) as part of the IBOR reform (the Reform). Refer to Note 2 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for details of these changes.",

        "page_content": "## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine fair value by incorporating factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, including commonly accepted valuation approaches.\n\nWe give priority to third-party pricing services and valuation techniques with the highest and most consistent accuracy. The level of accuracy is determined over time by comparing third-party price values to traders' or system values, other pricing service values and, when available, actual trade data. Other valuation techniques are used when a price or quote is not available. Some valuation processes use models to determine fair value. We have a systematic and consistent approach to control the use of models.\n\nIn determining fair value, a hierarchy is used which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Fair values established based on this hierarchy require the use of observable market data whenever available. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model inputs that are either observable, or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs include one or more inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value of the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available at the measurement date. The availability of inputs for valuation may affect the selection of valuation techniques. The classification of a financial instrument in the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.\n\nWhere observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, proxy information from similar transactions, and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. For more complex or illiquid instruments, significant judgment is required to determine the model used, select the model inputs, and in some cases, apply valuation adjustments to the model value or quoted price for inactively traded financial instruments. The selection of model inputs may be subjective and the inputs may be unobservable. Unobservable inputs are inherently uncertain as there is little or no market data available from which to determine the level at which the transaction would occur under normal business circumstances. Appropriate parameter uncertainty and market risk valuation adjustments for such inputs and other model risk valuation adjustments are assessed in all such instances.\n\nValuation adjustments may be subjective as they require significant judgment in the input selection, such as the probability of default and recovery rate, and are intended to arrive at a fair value that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument. The realized price for a transaction may be different from its recorded value that was previously estimated using management judgment, and may therefore impact unrealized gains and losses recognized in Non-interest income - Trading revenue or Other.\n\nFor further information on the fair value of financial instruments, refer to Notes 2 and 3 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nAn allowance for credit losses (ACL) is established for all financial assets, except for financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity securities designated as FVOCI, which are not subject to impairment assessment. Assets subject to impairment assessment include certain loans, debt securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, customers' liability under acceptances, accounts and accrued interest receivable, and finance and operating lease receivables. Off-balance sheet items subject to impairment assessment include financial guarantees and undrawn loan commitments.\n\nWe measure the ACL on each balance sheet date according to a three-stage expected credit loss impairment model:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Performing financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 1 - From initial recognition of a financial asset to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected to result from defaults occurring over the 12 months following the reporting date.\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 2 - Following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the initial recognition of the financial asset, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset.\n- GLYPH<129> Impaired financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 3 - When a financial asset is considered to be credit-impaired, a loss allowance is recognized equal to credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset. Interest income is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance, rather than on its gross carrying amount.\n\nThe ACL is a discounted probability-weighted estimate of the cash shortfalls expected to result from defaults over the relevant time horizon. For loan commitments, credit loss estimates consider the portion of the commitment that is expected to be drawn over the relevant time period. For financial guarantees, credit loss estimates are based on the expected payments required under the guarantee contract. For finance lease receivables, credit loss estimates are based on cash flows consistent with the cash flows used in measuring the lease receivable.\n\nThe ACL represents an unbiased estimate of expected credit losses on our financial assets as at the balance sheet date. Judgment is required in making assumptions and estimations when calculating the ACL, including movements between the three stages, the inclusion of forward looking information and the application of expert credit judgment. The underlying assumptions and estimates may result in changes to the provisions from period to period that significantly affect our results of operations.\n\nFor further information on allowance for credit losses, refer to Notes 2, 4 and 5 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nWe allocate goodwill to groups of cash-generating units (CGU). Goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are objective indications of impairment. We test for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.",

        "page_content": "We estimate the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal of our CGUs primarily using a discounted cash flow method which incorporates each CGU's internal forecasts of revenues and expenses. Significant management judgment is applied in the determination of expected future cash flows (uncertainty in timing and amount), discount rates (based on CGU-specific risks) and terminal growth rates. CGU-specific risks include country risk, business/operational risk, geographic risk (including political risk, devaluation risk and government regulation), currency risk and price risk (including product pricing risk and inflation). If the future cash flows and other assumptions in future periods deviate significantly from the current amounts used in our impairment testing, the value of our goodwill could become impaired.\n\nWe assess for indicators of impairment of our other intangible assets at each reporting period. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its recoverable amount. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, we estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. Significant judgment is applied in estimating the useful lives and recoverable amounts of our intangible assets and assessing whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment. We do not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\nFor further details, refer to Notes 2 and 10 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWe sponsor a number of benefit programs for eligible employees, including registered pension plans, supplemental pension plans, health, dental, disability and life insurance plans.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit expenses and obligations depends on various assumptions such as discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, projected salary increases, retirement age, and mortality and termination rates. Discount rates are determined using a yield curve based on spot rates from high quality corporate bonds. All other assumptions are determined by us and are reviewed by the actuaries. Actual experience that differs from the actuarial assumptions will affect the amounts of benefit obligations and remeasurements that we recognize. The weighted average assumptions used and the sensitivity of key assumptions are presented in Note 16 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Consolidation of structured entities\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities, including structured entities, over which we have control. We control an entity when we are exposed, or have rights, to variable returns from our involvement with the entity and have the ability to affect those returns through our power over the investee. We have power over an entity when we have existing rights that give us the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity's returns (relevant activities). Power may be determined on the basis of voting rights or, in the case of structured entities, other contractual arrangements.\n\nWe are not deemed to control an entity when we exercise power over an entity as the agent of a third party or parties. In determining whether we are acting as an agent, we consider the overall relationship between us, the investee and other parties to the arrangement with respect to the following factors: (i) the scope of our decision-making power; (ii) the rights held by other parties; (iii) the remuneration to which we are entitled; and (iv) our exposure to variability of returns.\n\nThe determination of control is based on the current facts and circumstances and is continuously assessed. In some circumstances, different factors and conditions may indicate that various parties control an entity depending on whether those factors and conditions are assessed in isolation or in totality. Significant judgment is applied in determining whether we control an entity, specifically, assessing whether we have substantive decision-making rights over the relevant activities and whether we are exercising our power as a principal or an agent.\n\nWe consolidate all subsidiaries from the date control is transferred to us, and cease consolidation when an entity is no longer controlled by us. Our consolidation conclusions affect the classification and amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor further details, refer to Note 7 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nWe periodically enter into transactions in which we transfer financial assets such as loans or mortgage-backed securities to structured entities or trusts that issue securities to investors. We derecognize the assets when our contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired; when we retain the rights to receive the cash flows but assume an obligation to pay those cash flows to a third party subject to certain pass-through requirements; or when we transfer our contractual rights to receive the cash flows and substantially all of the risks and rewards of the assets have been transferred. When we retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for as secured financing transactions. When we neither retain nor transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the assets, we derecognize the assets if control over the assets is relinquished. If we retain control over the transferred assets, we continue to recognize the transferred assets to the extent of our continuing involvement. Management's judgment is applied in determining whether we have transferred or retained substantially all risk and rewards of ownership of the transferred financial asset.\n\nThe majority of assets transferred under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements, and in our Canadian residential mortgage securitization transactions do not qualify for derecognition. As a result, we continue to record the associated transferred assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and no gains or losses are recognized for those securitization activities. Otherwise, a gain or loss is recognized on securitization by comparing the carrying amount of the transferred asset with its fair value at the date of the transfer. For further information on derecognition of financial assets, refer to Notes 2 and 6 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Application of the effective interest method\n\nInterest is recognized in Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income generally for all interest bearing financial instruments using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the financial asset or liability to the net carrying amount upon initial recognition.

        "page_content": "## Provisions\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Significant judgment is required in determining whether a present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. We record provisions related to litigation, asset retirement obligations and other items.\n\nThe forward-looking nature of these estimates requires us to use a significant amount of judgment in projecting the timing and amount of future cash flows. We record our provisions on the basis of all available information at the end of the reporting period and make adjustments on a quarterly basis to reflect current expectations. Should actual results differ from our expectations, we may incur expenses in excess of the provisions recognized.\n\n## Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities\n\nInsurance claims and policy benefit liabilities represent current claims and estimates for future insurance policy benefits. Liabilities for life insurance contracts are determined using the Canadian Asset Liability Method, which incorporates assumptions for mortality, morbidity, policy lapses and surrenders, investment yields, policy dividends, operating and policy maintenance expenses, and provisions for adverse deviation. Key assumptions are reviewed annually and updated in response to actual experience and market conditions. Liabilities for property and casualty insurance represent estimated provisions for reported and unreported claims. Liabilities for life and property and casualty insurance are included in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities. Changes in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are included in the Insurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the estimates change. Refer to Note 14 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in various jurisdictions where we operate, and the complex tax laws are potentially subject to different interpretations by us and the relevant taxation authority. Management's judgment is applied in interpreting the relevant tax laws, in assessing the probability of acceptance of our tax positions by the relevant tax authorities and estimating the expected timing and amount of the provision for current and deferred income taxes. A deferred tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference based on the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Where the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, no deferred tax amount is recognized.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we review whether it is probable that the benefits associated with our deferred tax assets will be realized, using both positive and negative evidence. Refer to Note 21 of our 2021 Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## Future changes in accounting policy and disclosure\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17)\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 to establish a comprehensive global insurance standard which provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 requires entities to measure insurance contract liabilities at their current fulfillment values using one of three approaches. In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17, including deferral of the effective date by two years. This new standard will be effective for us on November 1, 2023 and will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard and the amendments on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under Canadian and U.S. securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified under those laws and include controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nAs of October 31, 2021, management evaluated, under the supervision of and with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under rules adopted by the U.S. SEC. Based on that evaluation, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2021.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS. However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. See Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.",

        "page_content": "## Acceptances\n\nA bill of exchange or negotiable instrument drawn by the borrower for payment at maturity and accepted by a bank. The acceptance constitutes a guarantee of payment by the bank and can be traded in the money market. The bank earns a 'stamping fee' for providing this guarantee.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses (ACL)\n\nThe amount deemed adequate by management to absorb expected credit losses as at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established for all financial assets subject to impairment assessment, including certain loans, debt securities, customers' liability under acceptances, financial guarantees, and undrawn loan commitments. The allowance is changed by the amount of provision for credit losses recorded, which is charged to income, and decreased by the amount of write-offs net of recoveries in the period.\n\n## Asset-backed securities (ABS)\n\nSecurities created through the securitization of a pool of assets, for example auto loans or credit card loans.\n\n## Assets under administration (AUA)\n\nAssets administered by us, which are beneficially owned by clients, as at October 31, unless otherwise noted. Services provided in respect of assets under administration are of an administrative nature, including safekeeping, collecting investment income, settling purchase and sale transactions, and record keeping.\n\n## Assets under management (AUM)\n\nAssets managed by us, which are beneficially owned by clients, as at October 31, unless otherwise noted. Services provided in respect of assets under management include the selection of investments and the provision of investment advice. We have assets under management that are also administered by us and included in assets under administration.\n\n## Attributed capital\n\nAttributed capital is based on the Basel III regulatory capital requirements and economic capital.\n\n## Auction rate securities (ARS)\n\nDebt securities whose interest rates are regularly reset through an auction process.\n\n## Average earning assets, net\n\nAverage earning assets include interestbearing deposits with other banks, securities, net of applicable allowance, assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed, loans, net of allowance, cash collateral and margin deposits. Insurance assets, and all other assets not specified are excluded. The averages are based on the daily balances for the period.\n\n## Basis point (bp)\n\nOne one-hundredth of a percentage point (.01%).\n\n## Collateral\n\nAssets pledged as security for a loan or other obligation. Collateral can take many forms, such as cash, highly rated securities, property, inventory, equipment and receivables.\n\n## Collateralized debt obligation (CDO)\n\nSecurities with multiple tranches that are issued by structured entities and collateralized by debt obligations including bonds and loans. Each tranche offers a varying\n\ndegree of risk and return so as to meet investor demand.\n\n## Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\n\nSecurities created through the securitization of commercial mortgages.\n\n## Commitments to extend credit\n\nUnutilized amount of credit facilities available to clients either in the form of loans, bankers' acceptances and other on-balance sheet financing, or through off-balance sheet products such as guarantees and letters of credit.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital\n\nA regulatory Basel III capital measure comprised mainly of common shareholders' equity less regulatory deductions and adjustments for goodwill and intangibles, defined benefit pension fund assets, shortfall in allowances and other specified items.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n\nA risk-based capital measure calculated as CET1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Covered bonds\n\nFull recourse on-balance sheet obligations issued by banks and credit institutions that are fully collateralized by assets over which investors enjoy a priority claim in the event of an issuer's insolvency.\n\n## Credit default swaps (CDS)\n\nA derivative contract that provides the purchaser with a one-time payment should the referenced entity/entities default (or a similar triggering event occur).\n\n## Derivative\n\nA contract between two parties, which requires little or no initial investment and where payments between the parties are dependent upon the movements in price of an underlying instrument, index or financial rate. Examples of derivatives include swaps, options, forward rate agreements and futures. The notional amount of the derivative is the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate the payments to be exchanged between the two parties, and the notional amount itself is generally not exchanged by the parties.\n\n## Dividend payout ratio\n\nCommon dividends as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders.\n\n## Dividend yield\n\nDividends per common share divided by the average of the high and low share price in the relevant period.\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS), basic\n\nCalculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the average number of shares outstanding.\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS), diluted\n\nCalculated as net income available to common shareholders divided by the average number of shares outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effects of stock options and other convertible securities.\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nThe difference between the contractual cash flows due to us in accordance with the relevant contractual terms and the cash flows that we expect to receive, discounted to the balance sheet date.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustment\n\nFunding valuation adjustments are calculated to incorporate cost and benefit of funding in the valuation of uncollateralized and undercollateralized OTC derivatives. Future expected cash flows of these derivatives are discounted to reflect the cost and benefit of funding the derivatives by using a funding curve, implied volatilities and correlations as inputs.\n\n## Guarantees and standby letters of credit\n\nThese primarily represent irrevocable assurances that a bank will make payments in the event that its client cannot meet its financial obligations to third parties. Certain other guarantees, such as bid and performance bonds, represent non-financial undertakings.\n\n## Hedge\n\nA risk management technique used to mitigate exposure from market, interest rate or foreign currency exchange risk arising from normal banking operations. The elimination or reduction of such exposure is accomplished by establishing offsetting positions. For example, assets denominated in foreign currencies can be offset with liabilities in the same currencies or through the use of foreign exchange hedging instruments such as futures, options or foreign exchange contracts.\n\n## Hedge funds\n\nA type of investment fund, marketed to accredited high net worth investors, that is subject to limited regulation and restrictions on its investments compared to retail mutual funds, and that often utilize aggressive strategies such as selling short, leverage, program trading, swaps, arbitrage and derivatives.\n\n## High-quality liquid assets (HQLA)\n\nAssets are considered to be HQLA if they can be easily and immediately converted into cash at little or no loss of value during a time of stress.\n\n## Impaired loans\n\nLoans are classified as impaired when there has been a deterioration of credit quality to the extent that management no longer has reasonable assurance of timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Credit card balances are not classified as impaired as they are directly written off after payments are 180 days past due.\n\n## International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\n\nIFRS are principles-based standards, interpretations and the framework adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\n## Leverage Ratio\n\nA Basel III regulatory measure, the ratio divides Tier 1 capital by the sum of total assets plus specified off-balance sheet items.\n\n## Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)\n\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio is a Basel III metric that measures the sufficiency of HQLA available to meet net short-term financial obligations over a thirty day period in an acute stress scenario.",

OSFI's mission is to safeguard policyholders, depositors and pension plan members from undue loss.\n\n## Operating leverage\n\nThe difference between our revenue growth rate and non-interest expense growth rate.\n\n## Options\n\nA contract or a provision of a contract that gives one party (the option holder) the right, but not the obligation, to perform a specified transaction with another party (the option issuer or option writer) according to specified terms.\n\n## Provision for credit losses (PCL)\n\nThe amount charged to income necessary to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level\n\ndetermined appropriate by management. This includes provisions on performing and impaired financial assets.\n\n## RBC Homeline Plan \u00ae products\n\nThis is comprised of residential mortgages and secured personal loans whereby the borrower pledges real estate as collateral.\n\n## Repurchase agreements\n\nThese involve the sale of securities for cash and the simultaneous repurchase of the securities for value at a later date. These transactions normally do not constitute economic sales and therefore are treated as collateralized financing transactions.\n\n## Return on common equity (ROE)\n\nNet income available to common shareholders, expressed as a percentage of average common equity.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements\n\nThese involve the purchase of securities for cash and the simultaneous sale of the securities for value at a later date. These transactions normally do not constitute economic sales and therefore are treated as collateralized financing transactions.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA)\n\nAssets adjusted by a regulatory risk-weight factor to reflect the riskiness of on and offbalance sheet exposures. Certain assets are not risk-weighted, but deducted from capital. The calculation is defined by guidelines issued by OSFI. For more details, refer to the Capital management section.\n\n## Securities lending\n\nTransactions in which the owner of securities agrees to lend it under the terms of a prearranged contract to a borrower for a fee. Collateral for the loan consists of either high quality securities or cash and collateral value must be at least equal to the market value of the loaned securities. Borrowers pay a negotiated fee for loans collateralized by securities, whereas for cash collateral lenders pay borrowers interest at a negotiated rate and reinvest the cash collateral to earn a return. An intermediary such as a bank often acts as agent lender for the owner of the security in return for a share of the revenue earned by the owner from lending securities. Most often, agent lenders indemnify the owner against the risk of the borrower's failure to redeliver the loaned securities - counterparty credit risk if a borrower defaults and market risk if the value of the non-cash collateral declines. The agent lender does not indemnify against the investment risk of re-investing cash collateral which is borne by the owner.\n\n## Securities sold short\n\nA transaction in which the seller sells securities and then borrows the securities in order to deliver them to the purchaser upon settlement. At a later date, the seller buys identical securities in the market to replace the borrowed securities.\n\n## Securitization\n\nThe process by which various financial assets are packaged into newly issued securities backed by these assets.\n\n## Standardized Approach\n\nRisk weights prescribed by OSFI are used to calculate risk-weighted assets for the credit risk exposures. Credit assessments by OSFIrecognized external credit rating agencies of S&P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS are used to riskweight our Sovereign and Bank exposures based on the standards and guidelines issued by OSFI. For our Business and Retail exposures, we use the standard risk weights prescribed by OSFI.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nA structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when the activities that significantly affect the entity's returns are directed by means of contractual arrangements. Structured entities often have restricted activities, narrow and well defined objectives, insufficient equity to finance their activities, and financing in the form of multiple contractually-linked instruments.\n\n## Taxable equivalent basis (teb)\n\nIncome from certain specified tax advantaged sources (eligible Canadian taxable corporate dividends) is increased to a level that would make it comparable to income from taxable sources. There is an offsetting adjustment in the tax provision, thereby generating the same after-tax net income.\n\n## Tier 1 capital\n\nTier 1 capital comprises predominantly of CET1 capital, with additional Tier 1 items such as preferred shares, limited recourse capital notes and non-controlling interests in subsidiaries Tier 1 instruments.\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\nTier 2 capital consists mainly of subordinated debentures that meet certain criteria, certain loan loss allowances and non-controlling interests in subsidiaries' Tier 2 instruments.\n\n## Total capital and total capital ratio\n\nTotal capital is defined as the total of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The total capital ratio is calculated by dividing total capital by riskweighted assets.\n\n## Tranche\n\nA security class created whereby the risks and returns associated with a pool of assets are packaged into several classes of securities offering different risk and return profiles from those of the underlying asset pool. Tranches are typically rated by ratings agencies, and reflect both the credit quality of underlying collateral as well as the level of protection based on the tranches' relative subordination.\n\n## Unattributed capital\n\nUnattributed capital represents common equity in excess of common equity attributed to our business segments and is reported in the Corporate Support segment.\n\n## Value-at-Risk (VaR)\n\nA generally accepted risk-measurement concept that uses statistical models based on historical information to estimate within a given level of confidence the maximum loss in market value we would experience in our trading portfolio from an adverse one-day movement in market rates and prices.",

These consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the Bank Act (Canada) and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Financial information appearing throughout our Management's Discussion and Analysis is consistent with these consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are authorized, assets are safeguarded and proper records are maintained. These controls include quality standards in hiring and training of employees, policies and procedures manuals, a corporate code of conduct and accountability for performance within appropriate and welldefined areas of responsibility.\n\nThe system of internal controls is further supported by a compliance function, which is designed to ensure that we and our employees comply with securities legislation and conflict of interest rules, and by an internal audit staff, which conducts periodic audits of all aspects of our operations.\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees management's responsibilities for financial reporting through an Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors. This Committee reviews our consolidated financial statements and recommends them to the Board for approval. Other key responsibilities of the Audit Committee include reviewing our existing internal control procedures and planned revisions to those procedures, and advising the directors on auditing matters and financial reporting issues. Our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Internal Auditor have full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI) examines and inquires into our business and affairs as deemed necessary to determine whether the provisions of the Bank Act are being complied with, and that we are in sound financial condition. In carrying out its mandate, OSFI strives to protect the rights and interests of our depositors and creditors.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm appointed by our shareholders upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee and Board, has performed an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) as stated in their Independent Auditor's Report and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, respectively. The auditors have full and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee to discuss their audit and related findings.\n\nDavid I. McKay\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nNadine Ahn\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nToronto, November 30, 2021\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nManagement of Royal Bank of Canada is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. It includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions related to and dispositions of our assets;\n- GLYPH<129> Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and our receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n- GLYPH<129> Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement evaluated, under the supervision of and with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, as of October 31, 2021, internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, as stated in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, which appears herein.\n\nDavid I.

These disclosures are cross-referenced from the consolidated financial statements and are identified as audited.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Bank in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Canada.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)\n\nRefer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments, Note 4 - Securities and Note 5 - Loans and allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Bank's ACL for financial assets was $4,471 million as of October 31, 2021 and represents management's estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets as of the balance sheet date. Performing financial assets are categorized as Stage 1 from initial recognition to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition. Performing financial assets transfer into Stage 2 following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the initial recognition. Financial assets are categorized as Stage 3 when considered to be credit-impaired. As disclosed by management, the measurement of expected credit losses is a complex calculation that involves a large number of interrelated inputs and assumptions such as the financial asset's probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default, which are modelled based on macroeconomic variables, and discounted to the reporting date.\n\nManagement's estimation of expected credit losses in Stage 1 and Stage 2 considers five distinct future macroeconomic scenarios, each of which includes a forecast of all relevant macroeconomic variables, designed to capture a wide range of possible outcomes, and which are probability-weighted according to management's expectation of the relative\n\nOur approach to addressing the matter included the following procedures, amongst others:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimation of the ACL, incorporating consideration of the ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including controls over:\n- O Probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default models.\n- O Design of multiple future macroeconomic scenarios, the forecasting of macroeconomic variables, and the probability-weighting of these scenarios.\n- O Completeness and accuracy of the data inputs underlying the ACL calculation.\n- O Application of expert credit judgment.\n- GLYPH<129> Testing management's process for estimating the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL, including their consideration of the ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which consisted of:\n- O Testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data.\n- O Using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating:\n- GLYPH<129> Appropriateness of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default models used in the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL.",

As disclosed in Note 5, while the global economic recovery has continued throughout fiscal 2021, momentum has waned over the year amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the estimation of the ACL continues to require the application of heightened judgment, as there is a higher than usual degree of uncertainty and the inputs used are inherently subject to change, which may materially change the estimate of Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL in future periods. The possibility of a more prolonged recovery period, including monetary policy responses to elevated inflation rates which may increase credit risk, has been reflected in management's general downside scenario.\n\nTo address the uncertainties inherent in the current and future environment and to reflect relevant risk factors not captured in the Bank's modelled results, management applied expert credit judgment in quantitative and qualitative adjustments for the impacts of the unprecedented macroeconomic environment including the impact of government support programs in offsetting the effect of COVID-19 related unemployment on the economy and on mitigating the losses for the sectors most sensitive to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe considered this a key audit matter due to:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Significant judgment required by management when:\n- O Designing future macroeconomic scenarios.\n- O Forecasting macroeconomic variables.\n- O Probability-weighting scenarios.\n- O Applying expert credit judgment to reflect characteristics not already considered in the models.\n- GLYPH<129> High degree of estimation uncertainty due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a high degree of auditor judgment.\n- GLYPH<129> Significant audit effort necessary to evaluate audit evidence as the estimation of the ACL is a complex calculation that involves a large volume of data, interrelated inputs and assumptions, some of which are model-based.\n- GLYPH<129> Audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessment of the Caribbean Banking Cash Generating Unit (CGU)\n\nRefer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments and Note 10 - Goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe goodwill allocated to the Caribbean Banking CGU was $1,600 million. Management conducts a goodwill impairment test as of August 1 of each year by comparing the carrying amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is represented by its value in use (VIU), except in circumstances where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its VIU. In such cases, the greater of the CGU's fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and its VIU is the recoverable amount.\n\nManagement estimated the recoverable amount of the Caribbean Banking CGU based on its FVLCD. Management calculated the FVLCD using a discounted cash flow method that projects future cash flows over a 5-year period based on management forecasts, adjusted to approximate the considerations of a prospective third-party buyer. Cash flows beyond the initial 5-year period are assumed by management to increase at a constant rate using a nominal long-term growth rate.

We also have audited the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Bank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Bank's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Bank's consolidated financial statements and on the Bank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nAn entity's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entity's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)\n\nAs described in Notes 2, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank's ACL for financial assets was $4,471 million as of October 31, 2021 and represents management's estimate of expected credit losses on financial assets as of the balance sheet date. Performing financial assets are categorized as Stage 1 from initial recognition to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition. Performing financial assets transfer into Stage 2 following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the initial recognition. Financial assets are categorized as Stage 3 when considered to be credit-impaired. As disclosed by management, the measurement of expected credit losses is a complex",

        "page_content": "calculation that involves a large number of interrelated inputs and assumptions such as the financial asset's probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default, which are modelled based on macroeconomic variables, and discounted to the reporting date. Management's estimation of expected credit losses in Stage 1 and Stage 2 considers five distinct future macroeconomic scenarios, each of which includes a forecast of all relevant macroeconomic variables, designed to capture a wide range of possible outcomes, and which are probability-weighted according to management's expectation of the relative likelihood of the range of outcomes that each scenario represents at the reporting date. As disclosed in Note 5, while the global economic recovery has continued throughout fiscal 2021, momentum has waned over the year amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the estimation of the ACL continues to require the application of heightened judgment, as there is a higher than usual degree of uncertainty and the inputs used are inherently subject to change, which may materially change the estimate of Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL in future periods. The possibility of a more prolonged recovery period, including monetary policy responses to elevated inflation rates which may increase credit risk, has been reflected in management's general downside scenario. To address the uncertainties inherent in the current and future environment and to reflect relevant risk factors not captured in the Bank's modelled results, management applied expert credit judgment in quantitative and qualitative adjustments for the impacts of the unprecedented macroeconomic environment, including the impact of government support programs in offsetting the effect of COVID-19 related unemployment on the economy and on mitigating the losses for the sectors most sensitive to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the ACL is a critical audit matter are: (i) there was significant judgment required by management when a) designing future macroeconomic scenarios, b) forecasting macroeconomic variables, c) probability-weighting scenarios and d) applying expert credit judgment to reflect characteristics not already considered in the models; (ii) there was a high degree of estimation uncertainty due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led to a high degree of auditor judgment; (iii) there was significant audit effort necessary to evaluate audit evidence as the estimation of the ACL is a complex calculation that involves a large volume of data, interrelated inputs and assumptions, some of which are model-based; and (iv) the audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the estimation of the ACL, incorporating consideration of the ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including controls over: (i) the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default models; (ii) the design of multiple future macroeconomic scenarios, the forecasting of macroeconomic variables, and the probabilityweighting of these scenarios; (iii) the completeness and accuracy of the data inputs underlying the ACL calculation; and (iv) the application of expert credit judgment. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL, including their consideration of the ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This consisted of (i) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data; and (ii) with the assistance of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, evaluating: (a) the appropriateness of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default models used in the estimation of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 ACL, (b) the reasonableness of significant inputs and assumptions used in the estimation of the ACL related to: 1) the design of future macroeconomic scenarios, 2) the forecasted macroeconomic variables, 3) the probability-weights assigned to the scenarios, (c) the appropriateness of the ACL calculation, and (d) management's application of expert credit judgment.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessment of the Caribbean Banking Cash Generating Unit (CGU)\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill allocated to the Caribbean Banking CGU was $1,600 million. Management conducts a goodwill impairment test as of August 1 of each year by comparing the carrying amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is represented by its value in use (VIU), except in circumstances where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its VIU. In such cases, the greater of the CGU's fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and its VIU is the recoverable amount. Management estimated the recoverable amount of the Caribbean Banking CGU based on its FVLCD. Management calculated the FVLCD using a discounted cash flow method that projects future cash flows over a 5-year period based on management forecasts, adjusted to approximate the considerations of a prospective third-party buyer. Cash flows beyond the initial 5-year period are assumed by management to increase at a constant rate using a nominal long-term growth rate. The discount rate used to determine the present value of the Caribbean Banking CGU's projected future cash flows is based on the bank-wide cost of capital, adjusted for the risks to which the CGU is exposed. As disclosed by management, with the improved economic environment in 2021, tempered by continued uncertainty related to COVID-19, the recoverable amount of the Caribbean Banking CGU has increased. As of August 1, 2021, management determined that the recoverable amount was 123% of its carrying amount. Management also considered reasonably possible alternative scenarios, including market comparable transactions, which yielded valuations ranging from a material surplus to an immaterial deficit. Management uses significant judgment to determine inputs to the discounted cash flow model. If the future cash flows and other assumptions in future periods deviate significantly from the current amounts used in management's impairment testing, the value of goodwill could become impaired.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Caribbean Banking CGU is a critical audit matter are: (i) there was significant judgment required by management when determining the recoverable amount of the CGU, including projecting future cash flows; (ii) there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures over management's calculation of the recoverable amount of the CGU, and evaluating audit evidence; and (iii) the audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment test, including controls over the determination of the recoverable amount of the Caribbean Banking CGU. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for determining the recoverable amount of the CGU, which consisted of, among others: (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow model",

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of management's discounted cash flow model; and ii) the consistency of the recoverable amount of the CGU with market comparable transactions.\n\n## Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Bank is subject to income tax laws in various jurisdictions where it operates and the complex tax laws are potentially subject to different interpretations by management and the relevant taxation authorities. As disclosed by management, significant judgment is required in the interpretation of the relevant tax laws, and in assessing the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions to determine tax provisions, which includes management's best estimate of uncertain tax positions that are under audit or appeal by the relevant taxation authorities. Management performs a review on a quarterly basis to incorporate its best assessment based on information available, but additional liability and income tax expense could result based on the acceptance of the Bank's tax positions by the relevant tax authorities. In some cases, as described in Note 21, the Bank has received reassessments denying the tax deductibility of dividends from transactions including those with Tax Indifferent Investors.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are that: (i) there was significant judgment required by management, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty, when a) interpreting the relevant tax laws, and b) assessing the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions, which includes management's best estimate of tax positions that are under audit or appeal by relevant taxation authorities; (ii) there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures to evaluate the uncertain tax positions; and (iii) the audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions and the impact on tax provisions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process used in (i) assessing the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions; and (ii) estimating provisions relating to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, which reflects management's best estimate of tax positions that are under audit or appeal by relevant taxation authorities. This involved: (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methods used; (ii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used; (iii) reviewing correspondence with relevant taxation authorities; (iv) making inquiries of the Bank's internal and external legal counsel; and (v) evaluating, with the assistance of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, the application of relevant tax laws, whether it is probable that the relevant tax authorities will accept the tax positions, and evidence used by management.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nChartered Professional Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants Toronto, Canada November 30, 2021\n\nWe have served as the Bank's auditor since 2016.",

Refer to Note 26 for further details on our business segments.\n\nThe parent bank, Royal Bank of Canada, is a Schedule I Bank under the Bank Act (Canada) incorporated and domiciled in Canada. Our corporate headquarters are located at Royal Bank Plaza, 200 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada and our head office is located at 1 Place Ville-Marie, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Our common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol RY.\n\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Unless otherwise stated, monetary amounts are stated in Canadian dollars. Tabular information is stated in millions of dollars, except as noted. These Consolidated Financial Statements also comply with Subsection 308 of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as otherwise specified by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI), our Consolidated Financial Statements are to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. Except where otherwise noted, the accounting policies outlined in Note 2 have been consistently applied to all periods presented.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the Consolidated Financial Statements for issue.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments\n\nThe significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements, including the accounting requirements prescribed by OSFI, are summarized below. These accounting policies conform, in all material respects, to IFRS. Except where otherwise noted, the same accounting policies have been applied to all periods presented.\n\n## General\n\n## Use of estimates and assumptions\n\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make subjective estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, net income and related disclosures. Estimates made by management are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Key sources of estimation uncertainty include: determination of fair value of financial instruments, the allowance for credit losses, insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities, pensions and other post-employment benefits, income taxes, carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and litigation provisions. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these and other estimates thereby impacting our future Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to the relevant accounting policies in this Note for details on our use of estimates and assumptions.\n\n## Significant judgments\n\nIn preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make significant judgments that affect the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recorded during the period.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve and the economic environment in which we operate could continue to be subject to sustained uncertainty, which could continue to impact our financial results. While the global economic recovery has continued, momentum has waned amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current environment requires particularly complex judgments and estimates in certain areas. We are closely monitoring the changing conditions and their impacts.\n\nSignificant judgments have been made in the following areas and discussed as noted in the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\n| Consolidation of structured entities   | Note 2  Note 7         | Application of the effective interest method   | Note 2                   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Fair value of financial instruments    | Note 2  Note 3         | Derecognition of financial assets              | Note 2  Note 6           |\n| Allowance for credit losses            | Note 2  Note 4  Note 5 | Income taxes                                   | Note 2  Note 21          |\n| Employee benefits                      | Note 2  Note 16        | Provisions                                     | Note 2  Note 23  Note 24 |\n| Goodwill and other intangibles         | Note 2                 |                                                |                          |\n\nNote 10\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements include the assets and liabilities and results of operations of the parent company, Royal Bank of Canada, and its subsidiaries including certain structured entities, after elimination of intercompany transactions, balances, revenues and expenses.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidation\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities, including structured entities, over which we have control. We control an entity when we are exposed, or have rights, to variable returns from our involvement with the entity and have the ability to affect those returns through our power over the investee. We have power over an entity when we have existing rights that give us the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity's returns (relevant activities). Power may be determined on the basis of voting rights or, in the case of structured entities, other contractual arrangements.\n\nWe are not deemed to control an entity when we exercise power over an entity in an agency capacity. In determining whether we are acting as an agent, we consider the overall relationship between us, the investee and other parties to the arrangement with respect to the following factors: (i) the scope of our decision-making power; (ii) the rights held by other parties; (iii) the remuneration to which we are entitled; and (iv) our exposure to variability of returns.\n\nThe determination of control is based on the current facts and circumstances and is continuously assessed. In some circumstances, different factors and conditions may indicate that different parties control an entity depending on whether those factors and conditions are assessed in isolation or in totality. Significant judgment is applied in assessing the relevant factors and conditions in totality when determining whether we control an entity. Specifically, judgment is applied in assessing whether we have substantive decision-making rights over the relevant activities and whether we are exercising our power as a principal or an agent.\n\nWe consolidate all subsidiaries from the date we obtain control and cease consolidation when an entity is no longer controlled by us. Our consolidation conclusions affect the classification and amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries that we consolidate are shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as a separate component of equity which is distinct from equity attributable to our shareholders. The net income attributable to non-controlling interests is separately disclosed in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Investments in joint ventures and associates\n\nOur investments in associated corporations and limited partnerships over which we have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. The equity method is also applied to our interests in joint ventures over which we have joint control. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are initially recorded at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize our share of the investee's net profit or loss, including our proportionate share of the investee's Other comprehensive income (OCI), subsequent to the date of acquisition.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is satisfied when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, management is committed to the sale, and it is highly probable to occur within one year. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and if significant, are presented separately from other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nA disposal group is classified as a discontinued operation if it meets the following conditions: (i) it is a component that can be distinguished operationally and financially from the rest of our operations and (ii) it represents either a separate major line of business or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Disposal groups classified as discontinued operations are presented separately from our continuing operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\n## Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework)\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we adopted the revised Conceptual Framework, which replaces the previous version of the Conceptual Framework issued in 2010. The Conceptual Framework is not a standard, and does not override the concepts or requirements in any standard. It may be used to develop consistent accounting policies where there is no applicable standard in place. The revisions include a few new concepts, updated definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and clarifies some important concepts. These amendments had no material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we early adopted the Phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement , IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures , IFRS 4 Insurance contracts , and IFRS 16 Leases (the Amendments) in response to the market transition away from interbank offered rates (IBORs) to alternative benchmark rates (ABRs) as part of the IBOR reform (the Reform). The Amendments provide two key reliefs which are applicable to changes undertaken as a direct consequence of the Reform and where the transition from IBOR to ABRs rates are transacted on an economically equivalent basis:\n\n- GLYPH<129> For modifications of financial instruments carried at amortized cost resulting from the Reform which are transacted on an economically equivalent basis, the Amendments allow the benchmark interest rate change to be reflected prospectively in the effective interest rate of the instrument rather than as an immediate gain or loss.\n- GLYPH<129> If qualifying criteria are met, hedging relationships that are directly impacted by the Reform would be able to continue hedge accounting upon transition to ABRs.\n\n## Progress in and risks arising from the transition to ABRs\n\nTo manage our transition to ABRs, we have implemented a comprehensive enterprise-wide program and governance structure that addresses the key areas of impact including contract remediation, funding and liquidity planning, risk management, financial reporting and valuation, systems, processes and client education and communication. Transition activities are focused on two broad streams of work: (i) developing new ABR linked products, and (ii) conversion of existing LIBOR based contracts to ABRs. Our program timelines are ultimately dependent on broader market acceptance of products that reference the new ABRs and our clients' readiness and ability to adopt the replacement products. Significant matters that we continue to evaluate include client product offerings, short and long-term funding strategies, and our hedging programs.",

These target dates reflect the announcement made on March 5, 2021 when the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator of the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) which administers LIBOR, announced the permanent cessation or loss of representativeness of all 35 LIBOR settings currently published by the IBA. As a result of this announcement, GBP LIBOR settings to which we have significant exposure will cease or lose their representativeness after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR settings to which we have significant exposure will predominantly cease or lose their representativeness after June 30, 2023.\n\nThe following tables show the Bank's significant exposures to financial instruments referencing benchmark interest rates subject to the Reform that have yet to transition to ABRs and maturing after December 31, 2021 for non-USD LIBOR instruments and after June 30, 2023 for USD LIBOR instruments.

        "page_content": "## Business model assessment\n\nWe determine our business models at the level that best reflects how we manage portfolios of financial assets to achieve our business objectives. Judgment is used in determining our business models, which is supported by relevant, objective evidence including:\n\n- GLYPH<129> How the economic activities of our businesses generate benefits, for example through trading revenue, enhancing yields or hedging funding or other costs and how such economic activities are evaluated and reported to key management personnel;\n- GLYPH<129> The significant risks affecting the performance of our businesses, for example, market risk, credit risk, or other risks as described in the Risk Management section of Management's Discussion and Analysis, and the activities undertaken to manage those risks;\n- GLYPH<129> Historical and future expectations of sales of the loans or securities portfolios managed as part of a business model; and\n- GLYPH<129> The compensation structures for managers of our businesses, to the extent that these are directly linked to the economic performance of the business model.\n\nOur business models fall into three categories, which are indicative of the key strategies used to generate returns:\n\n- GLYPH<129> HTC: The objective of this business model is to hold loans and securities to collect contractual principal and interest cash flows. Sales are incidental to this objective and are expected to be insignificant or infrequent.\n- GLYPH<129> HTC&S: Both collecting contractual cash flows and sales are integral to achieving the objective of the business model.\n- GLYPH<129> Other fair value business models: These business models are neither HTC nor HTC&S, and primarily represent business models where assets are held-for-trading or managed on a fair value basis.\n\n## SPPI assessment\n\nInstruments held within a HTC or HTC&S business model are assessed to evaluate if their contractual cash flows are comprised of solely payments of principal and interest. SPPI payments are those which would typically be expected from basic lending arrangements. Principal amounts include par repayments from lending and financing arrangements, and interest primarily relates to basic lending returns, including compensation for credit risk and the time value of money associated with the principal amount outstanding over a period of time. Interest can also include other basic lending risks and costs (for example, liquidity risk, servicing or administrative costs) associated with holding the financial asset for a period of time, and a profit margin.\n\nWhere the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or variability of cash flows that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Securities\n\nTrading securities include all securities that are classified as FVTPL by nature and securities designated as FVTPL. Obligations to deliver trading securities sold but not yet purchased are recorded as liabilities and carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are generally recorded as Trading revenue or Non-interest income - Other. Dividends and interest income accruing on Trading securities are recorded in Interest income. Interest and dividends accrued on interestbearing and equity securities sold short are recorded in Interest expense.\n\nInvestment securities include all securities classified as FVOCI and amortized cost. All investment securities are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured according to the respective classification.\n\nInvestment securities carried at amortized cost are measured using the effective interest method, and are presented net of any allowance for credit losses, calculated in accordance with our policy for Allowance for credit losses, as described below. Interest income, including the amortization of premiums and discounts on securities measured at amortized cost are recorded in interest income. Impairment gains or losses recognized on amortized cost securities are recorded in Provision for credit losses (PCL). When a debt instrument measured at amortized cost is sold, the difference between the sale proceeds and the amortized cost of the security at the time of the sale is recorded as Net gains on Investment securities in Non-interest income.\n\nDebt securities carried at FVOCI are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in Other components of equity. Impairment gains and losses are included in PCL and correspondingly reduce the accumulated changes in fair value included in Other components of equity. When a debt instrument measured at FVOCI is sold, the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from Other components of equity to Net gains on Investment securities in Non-interest income.\n\nEquity securities carried at FVOCI are measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recorded in Other components of equity and not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss when realized. Dividends from FVOCI equity securities are recognized in Interest income.\n\nWe account for all of our securities using settlement date accounting and changes in fair value between the trade date and settlement date are reflected in income for securities measured at FVTPL, and changes in the fair value of securities measured at FVOCI between the trade and settlement dates are recorded in OCI except for changes in foreign exchange rates on debt securities, which are recorded in Non-interest income-Other.\n\n## Fair value option\n\nA financial instrument with a reliably measurable fair value can be designated as FVTPL (the fair value option) on its initial recognition even if the financial instrument was not acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing. The fair value option can be used for financial assets if it eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities, or recognizing related gains and losses on a different basis (an accounting mismatch). The fair value option can be elected for financial liabilities if: (i) the election eliminates an accounting mismatch; (ii) the financial liability is part of a portfolio that is managed on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; or (iii) there is an embedded derivative in the financial or non-financial host contract and the derivative is not closely related to the host contract. These instruments cannot be reclassified out of the FVTPL category while they are held or issued.\n\nFinancial assets designated as FVTPL are recorded at fair value and any unrealized gain or loss arising due to changes in fair value is included in Trading revenue or Non-interest income - Other, depending on our business purpose for holding the financial asset.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated as FVTPL are recorded at fair value and fair value changes attributable to changes in our own credit risk are recorded in OCI. Own credit risk amounts recognized in OCI will not be reclassified subsequently to net income. The remaining fair value changes not attributable to changes in our own credit risk are recorded in Trading revenue or",

Upon initial recognition, if we determine that presenting the effects of own credit risk changes in OCI would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in net income, the full fair value change in our debt designated as FVTPL is recognized in net income. To make that determination, we assess whether we expect that the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk will be offset in profit or loss by a change in the fair value of another financial instrument measured at FVTPL. Such an expectation is based on an economic relationship between the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial instrument. The determination is made at initial recognition and is not reassessed. To determine the fair value adjustments on our debt instruments designated as FVTPL, we calculate the present value of the instruments based on the contractual cash flows over the term of the arrangement by using our effective funding rate at the beginning and end of the period.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We determine fair value by incorporating all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, including commonly accepted valuation approaches.\n\nThe Board of Directors provides oversight on valuation of financial instruments, primarily through the Audit Committee and Risk Committee. The Audit Committee reviews the presentation and disclosure of financial instruments that are measured at fair value, while the Risk Committee assesses the adequacy of governance structures and control processes for the valuation of these instruments.\n\nWe have established policies, procedures and controls for valuation methodologies and techniques to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. Major valuation processes and controls include, but are not limited to, profit and loss decomposition, independent price verification (IPV) and model validation standards. These control processes are managed by either Finance or Group Risk Management and are independent of the relevant businesses and their trading functions. Profit and loss decomposition is a process to explain the fair value changes of certain positions and is performed daily for trading portfolios. All fair value instruments are subject to IPV, a process whereby trading function valuations are verified against external market prices and other relevant market data. Market data sources include traded prices, brokers and price vendors. We give priority to those third-party pricing services and prices having the highest and most consistent accuracy. The level of accuracy is determined over time by comparing third-party price values to traders' or system values, to other pricing service values and, when available, to actual trade data. Quoted prices for identical instruments from pricing services or brokers are generally not adjusted unless there are issues such as stale prices. If multiple quotes for identical instruments are received, fair value is based on an average of the prices received or the quote from the most reliable vendor, after the outlier prices that fall outside of the pricing range are removed. Other valuation techniques are used when a price or quote is not available. Some valuation processes use models to determine fair value. We have a systematic and consistent approach to control the use of models. Valuation models are approved for use within our model risk management framework. The framework addresses, among other things, model development standards, validation processes and procedures and approval authorities. Model validation ensures that a model is suitable for its intended use and sets parameters for its use. All models are revalidated regularly by qualified personnel who are independent of the model design and development. Annually our model risk profile is reported to the Board of Directors.\n\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement permits an exception, through an accounting policy choice, to measure the fair value of a portfolio of financial instruments on a net open risk position basis when certain criteria are met. We have elected to use this policy choice to determine the fair value of certain portfolios of financial instruments, primarily derivatives, based on a net exposure to market or credit risk.\n\nWe record valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality of our derivative portfolio, differences between the actual counterparty collateral discount curve and standard overnight index swap (OIS) discounting for collateralized derivatives, funding valuation adjustments (FVA) for uncollateralized and under-collateralized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, unrealized gains or losses at inception of the transaction, bid-offer spreads, unobservable parameters and model limitations. These adjustments may be subjective as they require significant judgment in the input selection, such as implied probability of default (PD) and recovery rate, and are intended to arrive at a fair value that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument. The realized price for a transaction may be different from its recorded value, previously estimated using management judgment. Valuation adjustments may therefore impact unrealized gains and losses recognized in Non-interest income - Trading revenue or Other.\n\nValuation adjustments are recorded for the credit risk of our derivative portfolios in order to arrive at their fair values. Credit valuation adjustments (CVA) take into account our counterparties' creditworthiness, the current and potential future mark-to-market of transactions and the effects of credit mitigants such as master netting and collateral agreements. CVA amounts are derived from estimates of exposure at default (EAD), PD, recovery rates on a counterparty basis and market and credit factor correlations. EAD is the value of expected derivative related assets and liabilities at the time of default, estimated through modelling using underlying risk factors. PD is implied from the market prices for credit protection and the credit ratings of the counterparty. When market data is unavailable, it is estimated by incorporating assumptions and adjustments that market participants would use for determining fair value using these inputs. Correlation is the statistical measure of how credit and market factors may move in relation to one another. Correlation is estimated using historical data. CVA is calculated daily and changes are recorded in Non-interest income - Trading revenue.\n\nFVA are also calculated to incorporate the cost and benefit of funding in the valuation of uncollateralized and undercollateralized OTC derivatives. Future expected cash flows of these derivatives are discounted to reflect the cost and benefit of funding the derivatives by using a funding curve, implied volatilities and correlations as inputs.\n\nWhere required, a valuation adjustment is made to reflect the unrealized gain or loss at inception of a financial instrument contract where the fair value of that financial instrument is not obtained from a quoted market price or cannot be evidenced by other observable market transactions based on a valuation technique incorporating observable market data.\n\nA bid-offer valuation adjustment is required when a financial instrument is valued at the mid-market price, instead of the bid or offer price for asset or liability positions, respectively. The valuation adjustment takes into account the spread from the mid-market price to either the bid or offer price.",

        "page_content": "Some valuation models require parameter calibration from such factors as market observable option prices. The calibration of parameters may be sensitive to factors such as the choice of instruments or optimization methodology. A valuation adjustment is also estimated to mitigate the uncertainties of parameter calibration and model limitations.\n\nIn determining fair value, a hierarchy is used which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Determination of fair value based on this hierarchy requires the use of observable market data whenever available. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and model inputs that are either observable, or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 inputs are one or more inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value of the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available at the measurement date. The availability of inputs for valuation may affect the selection of valuation techniques. The classification of a financial instrument in the hierarchy for disclosure purposes is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value.\n\nWhere observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, proxy information from similar transactions, and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. For more complex or illiquid instruments, significant judgment is required in the determination of the model used, the selection of model inputs, and in some cases the application of valuation adjustments to the model value or quoted price for inactively traded financial instruments, as the selection of model inputs may be subjective and the inputs may be unobservable. Unobservable inputs are inherently uncertain as there is little or no market data available from which to determine the level at which the transaction would occur under normal business circumstances. Appropriate parameter uncertainty and market risk valuation adjustments for such inputs and other model risk valuation adjustments are assessed in all such instances.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans are debt instruments recognized initially at fair value and are subsequently measured in accordance with the Classification of financial assets policy provided above. The majority of our loans are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, which represents the gross carrying amount less allowance for credit losses.\n\nInterest on loans is recognized in Interest income using the effective interest method. The estimated future cash flows used in this calculation include those determined by the contractual term of the asset and all fees that are considered to be integral to the effective interest rate. Also included in this amount are transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Fees that relate to activities such as originating, restructuring or renegotiating loans are deferred and recognized as Interest income over the expected term of such loans using the effective interest method. Where there is a reasonable expectation that a loan will be originated, commitment and standby fees are also recognized as interest income over the expected term of the resulting loans using the effective interest method. Otherwise, such fees are recorded as other liabilities and amortized into Non-interest income over the commitment or standby period. Future prepayment fees on mortgage loans are not included as part of the effective interest rate at origination. If prepayment fees are received on a renewal of a mortgage loan before maturity, the fee is included as part of the effective interest rate, and if not renewed, the prepayment fee is recognized in interest income at the prepayment date.\n\nFor loans carried at amortized cost or FVOCI, impairment losses are recognized at each balance sheet date in accordance with the three-stage impairment model outlined below.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nAn allowance for credit losses (ACL) is established for all financial assets, except for financial assets classified or designated as FVTPL and equity securities designated as FVOCI, which are not subject to impairment assessment. Assets subject to impairment assessment include loans, debt securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, customers' liability under acceptances, accounts and accrued interest receivable, and finance and operating lease receivables. ACL on loans measured at amortized cost is presented in Allowance for loan losses. ACL on debt securities measured at FVOCI is presented in Other components of equity. Other financial assets carried at amortized cost are presented net of ACL on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nOff-balance sheet items subject to impairment assessment include financial guarantees and undrawn loan commitments. ACL on off-balance sheet items is separately calculated and included in Other Liabilities - Provisions.\n\nWe measure the ACL on each balance sheet date according to a three-stage expected credit loss impairment model:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Performing financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 1 - From initial recognition of a financial asset to the date on which the asset has experienced a significant increase in credit risk relative to its initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected to result from defaults occurring over the 12 months following the reporting date.\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 2 - Following a significant increase in credit risk relative to the initial recognition of the financial asset, a loss allowance is recognized equal to the credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset.\n- GLYPH<129> Impaired financial assets\n- GLYPH<129> Stage 3 - When a financial asset is considered to be credit-impaired, a loss allowance is recognized equal to credit losses expected over the remaining lifetime of the asset. Interest income is calculated based on the carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance, rather than on its gross carrying amount.\n\nThe ACL is a discounted probability-weighted estimate of the cash shortfalls expected to result from defaults over the relevant time horizon. For loan commitments, credit loss estimates consider the portion of the commitment that is expected to be drawn over the relevant time period. For financial guarantees, credit loss estimates are based on the expected payments required under the guarantee contract. For finance lease receivables, credit loss estimates are based on cash flows consistent with the cash flows used in measuring the lease receivable.\n\nIncreases or decreases in the required ACL attributable to model changes and new originations, sales or maturities, and changes in risk, parameters and exposures due to changes in loss expectations or stage transfers are recorded in PCL. Write-offs and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded against ACL.\n\nThe ACL represents an unbiased estimate of expected credit losses on our financial assets as at the balance sheet date. Judgment is required in making assumptions and estimations when calculating the ACL, including movements between the three",

The underlying assumptions and estimates may result in changes to the provisions from period to period that significantly affect our results of operations.\n\n## Measurement of expected credit losses\n\nExpected credit losses are based on a range of possible outcomes and consider all available reasonable and supportable information including internal and external ratings, historical credit loss experience, and expectations about future cash flows. The measurement of expected credit losses is based primarily on the product of the instrument's PD, loss given default (LGD), and EAD discounted to the reporting date. The main difference between Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit losses for performing financial assets is the respective calculation horizon. Stage 1 estimates project PD, LGD and EAD over a maximum period of 12 months while Stage 2 estimates project PD, LGD and EAD over the remaining lifetime of the instrument.\n\nAn expected credit loss estimate is produced for each individual exposure. Relevant parameters are modeled on a collective basis using portfolio segmentation that allows for appropriate incorporation of forward looking information. To reflect other characteristics that are not already considered through modelling, expert credit judgment is exercised in determining the final expected credit losses.\n\nFor a small percentage of our portfolios which lack detailed historical information and/or loss experience, we apply simplified measurement approaches that may differ from what is described above. These approaches have been designed to maximize the available information that is reliable and supportable for each portfolio and may be collective in nature.\n\nExpected credit losses are discounted to the reporting period date using the effective interest rate.\n\n## Expected life\n\nFor instruments in Stage 2 or Stage 3, loss allowances reflect expected credit losses over the expected remaining lifetime of the instrument. For most instruments, the expected life is limited to the remaining contractual life.\n\nAn exemption is provided for certain instruments with the following characteristics: (a) the instrument includes both a loan and undrawn commitment component; (b) we have the contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment; and (c) our exposure to credit losses is not limited to the contractual notice period. For products in scope of this exemption, the expected life may exceed the remaining contractual life and is the period over which our exposure to credit losses is not mitigated by our normal credit risk management actions. This period varies by product and risk category and is estimated based on our historical experience with similar exposures and consideration of credit risk management actions taken as part of our regular credit review cycle. Products in scope of this exemption include credit cards, overdraft balances and certain revolving lines of credit. Judgment is required in determining the instruments in scope for this exemption and estimating the appropriate remaining life based on our historical experience and credit risk mitigation practices.\n\n## Assessment of significant increase in credit risk\n\nThe assessment of significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment. Movements between Stage 1 and Stage 2 are based on whether an instrument's credit risk as at the reporting date has increased significantly relative to the date it was initially recognized. For the purposes of this assessment, credit risk is based on an instrument's lifetime PD, not the losses we expect to incur. The assessment is generally performed at the instrument level.\n\nOur assessment of significant increases in credit risk is performed at least quarterly based on three factors. If any of the following factors indicates that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, the instrument is moved from Stage 1 to Stage 2:\n\n- (1) We have established thresholds for significant increases in credit risk based on both a percentage and absolute change in lifetime PD relative to initial recognition. For our wholesale portfolio, a decrease in the borrower's risk rating is also required to determine that credit risk has increased significantly.\n- (2)  Additional qualitative reviews are performed to assess the staging results and make adjustments, as necessary, to better reflect the positions whose credit risk has increased significantly.\n- (3)  Instruments which are 30 days past due are generally considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk, even if our other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred.\n\nThe thresholds for movement between Stage 1 and Stage 2 are symmetrical. After a financial asset has transferred to Stage 2, if its credit risk is no longer considered to have significantly increased relative to its initial recognition, the financial asset will move back to Stage 1.\n\nFor certain instruments with low credit risk as at the reporting date, it is presumed that credit risk has not increased significantly relative to initial recognition. Credit risk is considered to be low if the instrument has a low risk of default, and the borrower has the ability to fulfill their contractual obligations both in the near term and in the longer term, including periods of adverse changes in the economic or business environment. Certain interest-bearing deposits with banks, assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements, insurance policy loans, and liquidity facilities extended to our multi-seller conduits have been identified as having low credit risk.\n\n## Use of forward-looking information\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses for each stage and the assessment of significant increase in credit risk considers information about past events and current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable projections of future events and economic conditions. The estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment.\n\nThe PD, LGD and EAD inputs used to estimate Stage 1 and Stage 2 credit loss allowances are modelled based on the macroeconomic variables (or changes in macroeconomic variables) that are most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. Each macroeconomic scenario used in our expected credit loss calculation includes a projection of all relevant macroeconomic variables used in our models for a five year period, subsequently reverting to long-run averages. Macroeconomic variables used in our expected credit loss models include, but are not limited to, unemployment rates, gross domestic product growth rates, equity return indices, commodity prices, and Canadian housing prices. Depending on their usage in the models, macroeconomic variables may be projected at a country, province/state or more granular level.\n\nOur estimation of expected credit losses in Stage 1 and Stage 2 is a discounted probability-weighted estimate that considers a minimum of three future macroeconomic scenarios. Our base case scenario is based on macroeconomic forecasts published",

        "page_content": "by our internal economics group. Upside and downside scenarios vary relative to our base case scenario based on reasonably possible alternative macroeconomic conditions. Additional and more severe downside scenarios are designed to capture a broader range of potential credit losses in certain sectors. Scenario design, including the identification of additional downside scenarios, occurs at least on an annual basis and more frequently if conditions warrant.\n\nScenarios are designed to capture a wide range of possible outcomes and weighted according to our best estimate of the relative likelihood of the range of outcomes that each scenario represents. Scenario weights take into account historical frequency, current trends, and forward-looking conditions and are updated on a quarterly basis. All scenarios considered are applied to all portfolios subject to expected credit losses with the same probabilities.\n\nOur assessment of significant increases in credit risk is based on changes in probability-weighted forward-looking lifetime PDs as at the reporting date, using the same macroeconomic scenarios as the calculation of expected credit losses.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe definition of default used in the measurement of expected credit losses is consistent with the definition of default used for our internal credit risk management purposes. Our definition of default may differ across products and consider both quantitative and qualitative factors, such as the terms of financial covenants and days past due. For retail and wholesale borrowers, except as detailed below, default occurs when the borrower is more than 90 days past due on any material obligation to us, and/or we consider the borrower unlikely to make their payments in full without recourse action on our part, such as taking formal possession of any collateral held. For certain credit card balances, default occurs when payments are 180 days past due. For these balances, the use of a period in excess of 90 days past due is reasonable and supported by observable data on write-off and recovery rates experienced on historical credit card portfolios. The definition of default used is applied consistently from period to period and to all financial instruments unless it can be demonstrated that circumstances have changed such that another definition of default is more appropriate.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets (Stage 3)\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for credit-impairment at each balance sheet date and more frequently when circumstances warrant further assessment. Evidence of credit-impairment may include indications that the borrower is experiencing significant financial difficulty, probability of bankruptcy or other financial reorganization, as well as a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows evidenced by the adverse changes in the payments status of the borrower or economic conditions that correlate with defaults. An asset that is in Stage 3 will move back to Stage 2 when, as at the reporting date, it is no longer considered to be credit-impaired. The asset will transfer back to Stage 1 when its credit risk at the reporting date is no longer considered to have increased significantly from initial recognition, which could occur during the same reporting period as the transfer from Stage 3 to Stage 2.\n\nWhen a financial asset has been identified as credit-impaired, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the asset's gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the instrument's original effective interest rate. For impaired financial assets with drawn and undrawn components, expected credit losses also reflect any credit losses related to the portion of the loan commitment that is expected to be drawn down over the remaining life of the instrument.\n\nWhen a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest ceases to be recognized on the regular accrual basis, which accrues income based on the gross carrying amount of the asset. Rather, interest income is calculated by applying the original effective interest rate to the amortized cost of the asset, which is the gross carrying amount less the related ACL. Following impairment, interest income is recognized on the unwinding of the discount from the initial recognition of impairment.\n\nACL for credit-impaired loans in Stage 3 are established at the borrower level, where losses related to impaired loans are identified on individually significant loans, or collectively assessed and determined through the use of portfolio-based rates, without reference to particular loans.\n\n## Individually assessed loans (Stage 3)\n\nWhen individually significant loans are identified as impaired, we reduce the carrying value of the loans to their estimated realizable value by recording an individually assessed ACL to cover identified credit losses. The individually assessed ACL reflects the expected amount of principal and interest calculated under the terms of the original loan agreement that will not be recovered, and the impact of time delays in collecting principal and/or interest (time value of money). The estimated realizable value for each individually significant loan is the present value of expected future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate for each loan. When the amounts and timing of future cash flows cannot be estimated with reasonable reliability, the estimated realizable amount may be determined using observable market prices for comparable loans, the fair value of collateral underlying the loans, and other reasonable and supported methods based on management judgment.\n\nIndividually-assessed allowances are established in consideration of a range of possible outcomes, which may include macroeconomic or non-macroeconomic scenarios, to the extent relevant to the circumstances of the specific borrower being assessed. Assumptions used in estimating expected future cash flows reflect current and expected future economic conditions and are generally consistent with those used in Stage 1 and Stage 2 measurement.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in assessing evidence of credit-impairment and estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining expected credit losses. Changes in the amount expected to be recovered would have a direct impact on PCL and may result in a change in the ACL.\n\n## Collectively assessed loans (Stage 3)\n\nLoans that are collectively assessed are grouped on the basis of similar risk characteristics, taking into account loan type, industry, geographic location, collateral type, past due status and other relevant factors.\n\nThe collectively-assessed ACL reflects: (i) the expected amount of principal and interest calculated under the terms of the original loan agreement that will not be recovered, and (ii) the impact of time delays in collecting principal and/or interest (time value of money).\n\nThe expected principal and interest collection is estimated on a portfolio basis and references historical loss experience of comparable portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics, adjusted for the current environment and expected future conditions. A portfolio specific coverage ratio is applied against the impaired loan balance in determining the collectivelyassessed ACL. The time value of money component is calculated by using the discount factors applied to groups of loans sharing",

The discount factors represent the expected recovery pattern of the comparable group of loans, and reflect the historical experience of these groups adjusted for current and expected future economic conditions and/or industry factors. Significant judgment is required in assessing evidence of impairment and estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows when determining expected credit losses. Changes in the amount expected to be recovered would have a direct impact on PCL and may result in a change in the ACL.\n\n## Write-off of loans\n\nLoans and the related ACL are written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, they are generally written off after receipt of any proceeds from the realization of collateral. In circumstances where the net realizable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write off may be earlier. For credit cards, the balances and related ACL are generally written off when payment is 180 days past due. Personal loans are generally written off at 150 days past due.\n\n## Modifications\n\nThe original terms of a financial asset may be renegotiated or otherwise modified, resulting in changes to the contractual terms of the financial asset that affect the contractual cash flows. The treatment of such modifications is primarily based on the process undertaken to execute the renegotiation and the nature and extent of the expected changes. In the normal course of business, modifications which are performed for credit reasons, primarily related to troubled debt restructurings, are generally treated as modifications of the original financial asset. Modifications which are performed for other than credit reasons are generally considered to be an expiry of the original cash flows; accordingly, such renegotiations are treated as a derecognition of the original financial asset and recognition of a new financial asset.\n\nIf a modification of terms does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, the carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate and a gain or loss is recognized. The financial asset continues to be subject to the same assessments for significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition and credit-impairment, as described above. A modified financial asset will transfer out of Stage 3 if the conditions that led to it being identified as credit-impaired are no longer present and relate objectively to an event occurring after the original credit-impairment was recognized. A modified financial asset will transfer out of Stage 2 when it no longer satisfies the relative thresholds set to identify significant increases in credit risk, which are based on changes in its lifetime PD, days past due and other qualitative considerations. The financial asset continues to be monitored for significant increases in credit risk and credit-impairment.\n\nIf a modification of terms results in derecognition of the original financial asset and recognition of the new financial asset, the new financial asset will generally be recorded in Stage 1, unless it is determined to be credit-impaired at the time of the renegotiation. For the purposes of assessing for significant increases in credit risk, the date of initial recognition for the new financial asset is the date of the modification.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWhen derivatives are embedded in other financial instruments or host contracts, such combinations are known as hybrid instruments. Some of the cash flows of a hybrid instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. If the host contract is a financial asset within the scope of IFRS 9, the classification and measurement criteria are applied to the entire hybrid instrument as described in the Classification of financial assets section of Note 2. If the host contract is a financial liability or an asset that is not within the scope of IFRS 9, embedded derivatives are separately recognized if the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, unless an election has been made to elect the fair value option, as described above. The host contract is accounted for in accordance with the relevant standards.\n\nDerivatives are primarily used in trading activities. Derivatives are also used to manage our exposure to interest, currency, credit and other market risks. The most frequently used derivative products are interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, options, futures and forward rate agreements, equity swaps and credit derivatives. All derivative instruments are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.\n\nWhen derivatives are used in trading activities, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives are recognized in Trading revenue in Non-interest income. Derivatives with positive fair values are reported as Derivative assets and derivatives with negative fair values are reported as Derivative liabilities. In accordance with our policy for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities, the net fair value of certain derivative assets and liabilities are reported as an asset or liability, as appropriate. Valuation adjustments are included in the fair value of Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities. Premiums paid and premiums received are shown in Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nWhen derivatives are used to manage our own exposures, we determine for each derivative whether hedge accounting can be applied, as discussed in the Hedge accounting section below.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets when our contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired, when we retain the rights to receive the cash flows of the assets but assume an obligation to pay those cash flows to a third party subject to certain pass-through requirements or when we transfer our contractual rights to receive the cash flows and substantially all of the risk and rewards of the assets have been transferred. When we retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets are not derecognized from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are accounted for as secured financing transactions. When we neither retain nor transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the assets, we derecognize the assets if control over the assets is relinquished. If we retain control over the transferred assets, we continue to recognize the transferred assets to the extent of our continuing involvement.\n\nManagement's judgment is applied in determining whether the contractual rights to the cash flows from the transferred assets have expired or whether we retain the rights to receive cash flows on the assets but assume an obligation to pay for those cash flows. We derecognize transferred financial assets if we transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership in the assets. When assessing whether we have transferred substantially all of the risk and rewards of the transferred assets, management considers the Bank's exposure before and after the transfer with the variability in the amount and timing of the net",

        "page_content": "cash flows of the transferred assets. In transfers in which we retain the servicing rights, management has applied judgment in assessing the benefits of servicing against market expectations. When the benefits of servicing are greater than fair value, a servicing asset is recognized in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the benefits of servicing are less than fair value, a servicing liability is recognized in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nWe derecognize a financial liability from our Consolidated Balance Sheets when our obligation specified in the contract expires, or is discharged or cancelled. We recognize the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability transferred and the consideration paid in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest is recognized in Interest income and Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for all interest-bearing financial instruments. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash flows over the expected life of the financial asset or liability to the net carrying amount upon initial recognition. Significant judgment is applied in determining the effective interest rate due to uncertainty in the timing and amounts of future cash flows.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognized when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually the date when shareholders have approved the dividend for unlisted equity securities.\n\n## Transaction costs\n\nTransaction costs are expensed as incurred for financial instruments classified or designated as FVTPL. For other financial instruments, transaction costs are capitalized on initial recognition. For financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, capitalized transaction costs are amortized through net income over the estimated life of the instrument using the effective interest method. For financial assets measured at FVOCI that do not have fixed or determinable payments and no fixed maturity, capitalized transaction costs are recognized in net income when the asset is derecognized or becomes impaired.\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset on the balance sheet when there exists both a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and sold under repurchase agreements\n\nWe purchase securities under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) and take possession of these securities. We monitor the market value of the securities purchased and additional collateral is obtained when appropriate. We have the right to liquidate the collateral held in the event of counterparty default. Reverse repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized lending transactions. We also sell securities under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), which are treated as collateralized borrowing transactions. The securities received under reverse repurchase agreements and securities delivered under repurchase agreements are not recognized on, or derecognized from, our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively, unless the risks and rewards of ownership are obtained or relinquished.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the amounts at which the securities were initially acquired or sold, except when they are classified or designated as FVTPL and are recorded at fair value. Interest earned on reverse repurchase agreements is included in Interest income, and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is included in Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in fair value for reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements designated as FVTPL are included in Trading revenue or Other in Non-interest income.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe have elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting principles under IAS 39 instead of those under IFRS 9.\n\nWe use derivatives and non-derivatives in our hedging strategies to manage our exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other market risks. Where hedge accounting can be applied, a hedge relationship is designated and documented at inception to detail the particular risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The documentation identifies the specific asset, liability or anticipated cash flows being hedged, the risk that is being hedged, the type of hedging instrument used and how effectiveness will be assessed. We assess, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are 'highly effective' in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged items. A hedge is regarded as highly effective only if the following criteria are met: (i) at inception of the hedge and throughout its life, the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, and (ii) actual results of the hedge are within a pre-determined range. We perform effectiveness testing to demonstrate that the relationship has been and is expected to be effective over the remaining term of the hedge. In the case of hedging a forecast transaction, the transaction must have a high probability of occurring and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect the reported net profit or loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is determined that the hedging instrument is no longer effective as a hedge, the hedging instrument or hedged item is terminated or sold, or the forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable. Refer to Note 8 for the fair value of derivatives and non-derivative instruments categorized by their hedging relationships, as well as derivatives that are not designated in hedging relationships.\n\nUntil the hedging relationships impacted by the Reform fully transition to ABRs, our prospective effectiveness testing is based on existing hedged cash flows or hedged risks and any ineffectiveness arising from retrospective testing does not result in a discontinuation of the hedge. Additionally, effectiveness testing is applied separately to hedged items referencing IBORs and those referencing ABRs, in accordance with the Amendments. Subsequently, when these relationships fully transition to ABRs, and provided qualifying criteria are met, we will amend the related hedge documentation for the ABR risk, including consequential changes to the description of the hedging instrument(s), the hedged item(s), and the method for assessing hedge effectiveness, without discontinuing the existing hedging relationships.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments (continued)\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nIn a fair value hedging relationship, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk and recognized in Non-interest income. Changes in fair value of the hedged item, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative, which are also recognized in Non-interest income. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the carrying value of the hedged item is no longer adjusted and the cumulative fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged items are amortized to Net income over the expected remaining life of the hedged items.\n\nWe predominantly use interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to changes in a fixed interest rate instrument's fair value caused by changes in interest rates. Until the hedging relationships impacted by the Reform fully transition to ABRs, we apply hedge accounting to IBOR rates which may not be contractually specified when that rate is separately identifiable and reliably measurable at inception of the hedge relationship.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nIn a cash flow hedging relationship, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative, net of taxes, is recognized in OCI and reclassified to profit or loss as the associated hedged forecast transaction occurs, while the ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the cumulative amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to Net interest income during the periods when the variability in the cash flows of the hedged item affects Net interest income. Unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are reclassified immediately to Net income when the hedged item is sold or terminated early, or when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.\n\nWe predominantly use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows related to a variable-rate asset or liability. Until the hedging relationships impacted by the Reform fully transition to ABRs, we treat the highly probable hedged IBOR based cash flows of groups of similar assets or liabilities with similar risk characteristics as unchanged as a result of the Reform. In addition, associated cash flow hedge reserves are not recycled into net income solely due to changes related to the transition from IBORs to ABRs. Subsequently, when some items in the group transition to ABRs before other items, the individual hedged items are allocated to subgroups based on the benchmark interest rate being hedged. We test hedge effectiveness based on the defined subgroups, in accordance with the Amendments, if eligibility requirements are met. If a subgroup fails the eligibility requirements, we would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the hedging relationship in its entirety.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nIn hedging our foreign currency exposure to a net investment in a foreign operation, the effective portion of foreign exchange gains and losses on the hedging instruments, net of applicable taxes, is recognized in OCI and the ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income. The amounts, or a portion thereof, previously recognized in Other components of equity are recognized in Net income on the disposal, or partial disposal, of the foreign operation.\n\nWe use foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency-denominated liabilities to manage our foreign currency exposures to net investments in foreign operations having a functional currency other than the Canadian dollar.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are contracts that contingently require us to make specified payments (in cash, other assets, our own shares or provision of services) to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Liabilities are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the inception of a guarantee for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. Financial guarantees are subsequently remeasured at the higher of (i) the amount of expected credit losses and (ii) the amount initially recognized less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognized.\n\nIf the financial guarantee contract meets the definition of a derivative, it is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date and reported under Derivatives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Insurance and segregated funds\n\nPremiums from long-duration contracts, primarily life insurance, are recognized when due in Non-interest income - Insurance premiums, investment and fee income. Premiums from short-duration contracts, primarily property and casualty, and fees for administrative services are recognized in Insurance premiums, investment and fee income over the related contract period. Unearned premiums of the short-duration contracts, representing the unexpired portion of premiums, are reported in Other liabilities. Investments made by our insurance operations are classified as FVOCI instruments and amortized cost instruments, except for investments supporting the policy benefit liabilities on life and health insurance contracts and a portion of property and casualty contracts. These are designated as FVTPL with changes in fair value reported in Insurance premiums, investment and fee income.\n\nInsurance claims and policy benefit liabilities represent current claims and estimates for future insurance policy benefits. Liabilities for life insurance contracts are determined using the Canadian Asset Liability Method (CALM), which incorporates assumptions for mortality, morbidity, policy lapses and surrenders, investment yields, policy dividends, operating and policy maintenance expenses and provisions for adverse deviation. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually and updated in response to actual experience and market conditions. Liabilities for property and casualty insurance represent estimated provisions for reported and unreported claims. Liabilities for life and property and casualty insurance are included in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities. Changes in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities are included in the Insurance policyholder benefits, claims and acquisition expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the estimates change.\n\nPremiums ceded for reinsurance and reinsurance recoveries on policyholder benefits and claims incurred are reported in income and expense as appropriate. Reinsurance recoverables, which relate to paid benefits and unpaid claims, are included in Other assets.\n\nAcquisition costs for new insurance contracts consist of commissions, premium taxes, certain underwriting costs and other costs that vary with the acquisition of new contracts. Deferred acquisition costs for life insurance products are implicitly",

        "page_content": "recognized in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities by CALM. For property and casualty insurance, these costs are classified as Other assets and amortized over the policy term.\n\nSegregated funds are lines of business in which we issue an insurance contract where the benefit amount is directly linked to the market value of the investments held in the underlying fund. The contractual arrangement is such that the underlying segregated fund assets are registered in our name but the segregated fund policyholders bear the risks and rewards of the funds' investment performance. Liabilities for these contracts are calculated based on contractual obligations using actuarial assumptions and are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices. Segregated funds' assets and liabilities are separately presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the segregated fund policyholders bear the risks and rewards of the funds' performance, investment income earned by the segregated funds and expenses incurred by the segregated funds are offset and are not separately presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Fee income we earn from segregated funds includes management fees, mortality, policy administration and surrender charges, and these fees are recorded in Non-interest income - Insurance premiums, investment and fee income. We provide minimum death benefit and maturity value guarantees on segregated funds. The liability associated with these minimum guarantees is recorded in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities.\n\nLiability adequacy tests are performed for all insurance contract portfolios at each balance sheet date to ensure the adequacy of insurance contract liabilities. Current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling and administration costs, and investment returns from the assets backing the liabilities are taken into account in the tests. When the test results indicate that there is a deficiency in liabilities, the deficiency is charged immediately to our Consolidated Statements of Income by writing down the deferred acquisition costs in Other assets and/or increasing Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities.\n\n## Employee benefits - Pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nOur defined benefit pension expense, which is included in Non-interest expense - Human resources, consists of the cost of employee pension benefits for the current year's service, net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset), past service cost and gains or losses on settlement. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation, which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognized immediately in OCI in the period in which they occur. Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments (the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred), as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions. Amounts recognized in OCI will not be reclassified subsequently to net income. Past service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment and is charged immediately to income.\n\nFor each defined benefit pension plan, we recognize the present value of our defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the plan assets as a defined benefit liability reported in Other liabilities - Employee benefit liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For plans where there is a net defined benefit asset, the amount is reported as an asset in Other assets Employee benefit assets on our Consolidated Balance sheets.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit expenses and obligations requires significant judgment as the recognition is dependent on discount rates and various actuarial assumptions such as healthcare cost trend rates, projected salary increases, retirement age and mortality and termination rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. For our pension and other post-employment benefit plans, the discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds. Since the discount rate is based on currently available yields, and involves management's assessment of market liquidity, it is only a proxy for future yields. Actuarial assumptions, set in accordance with current practices in the respective countries of our plans, may differ from actual experience as country specific statistics are only estimates of future employee behaviour. These assumptions are determined by management and are reviewed by actuaries at least annually. Changes to any of the above assumptions may affect the amounts of benefits obligations, expenses and remeasurements that we recognize.\n\nOur contributions to defined contribution pension plans are expensed when employees have rendered services in exchange for such contributions. Defined contribution pension expense is included in Non-interest expense - Human resources.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nWe offer share-based compensation plans to certain key employees and to our non-employee directors.\n\nTo account for stock options granted to employees, compensation expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is determined by using option valuation models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. When the options are exercised, the exercise price proceeds together with the amount initially recorded in equity are credited to common shares. Our other share-based compensation plans include performance deferred share plans and deferred share unit plans for key employees (the Plans). The obligations for the Plans are accrued over their vesting periods. The Plans are settled in cash.\n\nFor cash-settled awards, our accrued obligations are adjusted to their fair value at each balance sheet date. For sharesettled awards, our expected obligations recognized in equity are based on the fair value of our common shares at the date of grant. Changes in our obligations, net of related hedges, are recorded as Non-interest expense - Human resources in our Consolidated Statements of Income with a corresponding increase in Other liabilities for cash-settled awards and in Retained earnings for share-settled awards. Compensation expense is recognized in the year the awards are earned by plan participants based on the vesting schedule of the relevant plans, net of estimated forfeitures.\n\nThe compensation cost attributable to options and awards granted to employees who are eligible to retire or will become eligible to retire during the vesting period, is recognized immediately if the employee is eligible to retire on the grant date or over the period between the grant date and the date the employee becomes eligible to retire.\n\nOur contributions to the employee savings and share ownership plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax comprises current tax and deferred tax and is recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.\n\nCurrent income tax payable on profits is recognized as an expense based on the applicable tax laws in each jurisdiction in the period in which profits arise, calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

        "page_content": "## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments (continued)\n\ntax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. A deferred income tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference, except for earnings related to our subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in joint ventures where the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future and we have the ability to control the timing of reversal. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period that the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset when they are levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities within the same tax reporting group (which intends to settle on a net basis), and when there is a legal right to offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the same conditions are satisfied. Our Consolidated Statements of Income include items that are non-taxable or non-deductible for income tax purposes and, accordingly, this causes the income tax provision to be different from what it would be if based on statutory rates.\n\nDeferred income taxes accumulated as a result of temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards are included in Other assets and Other liabilities. On a quarterly basis, we review our deferred income tax assets to determine whether it is probable that the benefits associated with these assets will be realized; this review involves evaluating both positive and negative evidence.\n\nWe are subject to income tax laws in various jurisdictions where we operate, and the complex tax laws are potentially subject to different interpretations by us and the relevant taxation authorities. Significant judgment is required in the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and in assessing the probability of acceptance of our tax positions to determine our tax provision, which includes our best estimate of uncertain tax positions that are under audit or appeal by the relevant tax authorities. We perform a review on a quarterly basis to incorporate our best assessment based on information available, but additional liability and income tax expense could result based on the acceptance of our tax positions by the relevant tax authorities.\n\nThe determination of our deferred tax asset or liability also requires significant management judgment as the recognition is dependent on our projection of future taxable profits and tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Any changes in our projection will result in changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and also deferred tax expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\n## Business combinations, goodwill and other intangibles\n\nAll business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Non-controlling interests, if any, are recognized at their proportionate share of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities, unless otherwise indicated. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill and included in Other intangibles. Goodwill represents the excess of the price paid for the business acquired over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired on the date of acquisition.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Impairment testing is performed annually as at August 1, or more frequently if there are objective indicators of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit (CGU) with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its value in use (VIU) and its fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). VIU is the present value of the expected future cash flows from a CGU. FVLCD is the amount obtainable from the sale of a CGU in an orderly transaction between market participants, less disposal costs. The fair value of a CGU is estimated using valuation techniques such as a discounted cash flow method, adjusted to reflect the considerations of a prospective third-party buyer. External evidence such as binding sale agreements or recent transactions for similar businesses within the same industry is considered to the extent that it is available.\n\nSignificant judgment is involved in estimating the model inputs used to determine the recoverable amount of our CGUs, in particular future cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates, due to the uncertainty in the timing and amount of cash flows and the forward-looking nature of these inputs. Future cash flows are based on financial plans agreed by management which are estimated based on forecast results, business initiatives, planned capital investments and returns to shareholders. Discount rates are based on the bank-wide cost of capital, adjusted for CGU-specific risks and currency exposure as reflected by differences in expected inflation. Bank-wide cost of capital is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model. CGU-specific risks include country risk, business/operational risk, geographic risk (including political risk, devaluation risk, and government regulation), currency risk, and price risk (including product pricing risk and inflation). Terminal growth rates are based on the long-term steady state growth expectations in the countries within which the CGU operates. If the future cash flows and other assumptions in future periods deviate significantly from the current amounts used in our impairment testing, the value of our goodwill could become impaired, with any such impairment loss recognized in Non-interest expense.\n\nThe carrying amount of a CGU includes the carrying amount of assets, liabilities and goodwill allocated to the CGU. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other non-financial assets of the CGU proportionately based on the carrying amount of each asset. Any impairment loss is charged to income in the period in which the impairment is identified. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited.\n\nUpon disposal of a portion of a CGU, the carrying amount of goodwill related to the portion of the CGU sold is included in the determination of gains or losses on disposal. The carrying amount is determined based on the relative fair value of the disposed portion to the total CGU.\n\n## Other intangibles\n\nIntangible assets represent identifiable non-monetary assets and are acquired either separately or through a business combination, or generated internally. Intangible assets acquired through a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their fair value can be measured reliably. The cost of a separately acquired intangible asset includes its purchase price and directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for its intended use. In respect of internally generated intangible assets, cost includes all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce, and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Research and development costs that are not eligible for capitalization are expensed. After initial recognition, an intangible asset",

Intangible assets with a finite-life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: computer software - 3 to 10 years; and customer relationships - 10 to 20 years. We do not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\nIntangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting period. If there is an indication that an intangible asset may be impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount of the intangible asset to its recoverable amount. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, we estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of the asset (or CGU) is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the intangible asset is written down to its recoverable amount as an impairment loss.\n\nAn impairment loss recognized previously is reversed if there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset (or CGU) since the last impairment loss was recognized. If an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is revised to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization) had there been no prior impairment.\n\nDue to the subjective nature of these estimates, significant judgment is required in determining the useful lives and recoverable amounts of our intangible assets, and assessing whether certain events or circumstances constitute objective evidence of impairment. Estimates of the recoverable amounts of our intangible assets rely on certain key inputs, including future cash flows and discount rates. Future cash flows are based on sales projections and allocated costs which are estimated based on forecast results and business initiatives. Discount rates are based on the bank-wide cost of capital, adjusted for assetspecific risks. Changes in these assumptions may impact the amount of impairment loss recognized in Non-interest expense.\n\n## Other\n\n## Translation of foreign currencies\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost are translated into Canadian dollars at historical rates.\n\nAssets and liabilities of our foreign operations with functional currencies other than Canadian dollars are translated into Canadian dollars at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date, and income and expenses of these foreign operations are translated at average rates of exchange for the reporting period.\n\nUnrealized gains or losses arising as a result of the translation of our foreign operations along with the effective portion of related hedges are reported in Other components of equity on an after-tax basis. Upon disposal or partial disposal of a foreign operation, an appropriate portion of the accumulated net translation gains or losses is included in Non-interest income.\n\n## Premises and equipment\n\nPremises and equipment includes land, buildings, leasehold improvements, computer equipment, furniture, fixtures and other equipment, and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, except for land which is not depreciated, and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the purchase price, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use, and the initial estimate of any disposal costs. Depreciation is recorded principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 25 to 50 years for buildings, 3 to 10 years for computer equipment, and 5 to 10 years for furniture, fixtures and other equipment. The amortization period for leasehold improvements is the lesser of the useful life of the leasehold improvements or the lease term plus the first renewal period, if reasonably assured of renewal, up to a maximum of 10 years. Depreciation methods, useful lives, and residual values are reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as appropriate. Gains and losses on disposal are recorded in Non-interest income.\n\nPremises and equipment are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting period. If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, an impairment test is performed by comparing the asset's carrying amount to its recoverable amount.\n\nAfter the recognition of impairment, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset's revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is revised to the lower of the asset's recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had there been no prior\n\nimpairment loss. The depreciation charge in future periods is adjusted to reflect the revised carrying amount.\n\nRight-of-use assets are also included in premises and equipment.\n\n## Leasing\n\nAt inception of a contract, we assess whether a contract is or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and direct the use of, an identified asset for a period of time in return for consideration.\n\nWhen we are the lessee in a lease arrangement, we initially record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are unspecialized, common, technologically unsophisticated, widely available, and widely used non-infrastructure assets. For short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, we record the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWhere we are reasonably certain to exercise extension and termination options, they are included in the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted at our incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, recorded in Interest expense.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured based on the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments made on or before the commencement date, initial direct costs incurred, and an estimate of costs to dismantle, remove, or restore the asset, less any lease incentives received. Costs related to dismantling and removing leasehold improvements are capitalized as part of the leasehold improvement asset (rather than the right-of-use asset of the lease) when the leasehold improvements are separately capitalized.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated to the earlier of the lease term and the useful life, unless ownership will transfer to RBC or we are reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, in which case the useful life of the right-of-use asset is used. We apply IAS 36 Impairment of assets to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and account for any identified impairment loss as described in the premises and equipment accounting policies above.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies, estimates and judgments (continued)\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured as the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Significant judgment is required in determining whether a present obligation exists and in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows. We record provisions related to litigation, asset retirement obligations and other items.\n\nWe are required to estimate the results of ongoing legal proceedings, and expenses to be incurred to dispose of capital assets. The forward-looking nature of these estimates requires us to use a significant amount of judgment in projecting the timing and amount of future cash flows. We record our provisions on the basis of all available information at the end of the reporting period and make adjustments on a quarterly basis to reflect current expectations. It may not be possible to predict the resolution of these matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution. Should actual results differ from our expectations, we may incur expenses in excess of the provisions recognized. Where appropriate, we apply judgment in limiting the extent of our provisions-related disclosures as not to prejudice our positions in matters of dispute.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, such as an insurer, a separate asset is recognized if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received.\n\n## Commissions and fees\n\nCommissions and fees primarily relate to Investment management and custodial fees, Mutual fund revenue, Securities brokerage commissions, Services charges, Underwriting and other advisory fees, Card service revenue and Credit fees, and are recognized based on the applicable service contracts with customers.\n\nInvestment management and custodial fees and Mutual fund revenue are generally calculated as a percentage of daily or period-end net asset values (NAV) based on the terms of the contract with customers and are received monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually, depending on the terms of the contract. Investment management and custodial fees are generally derived from assets under management (AUM) when our clients solicit the investment capabilities of an investment manager or from assets under administration (AUA) where the investment strategy is directed by the client or a designated third-party manager. Mutual fund revenue is derived from the daily NAV of the mutual funds. Investment management and custodial fees and Mutual fund revenue are recognized over time when the service is provided to the customer, provided that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nCommissions earned on Securities brokerage services and Service charges that are related to the provision of specific transaction-type services are recognized when the service is fulfilled. Where services are provided over time, revenue is recognized as the services are provided.\n\nUnderwriting and other advisory fees primarily relate to underwriting of new issuances of debt or equity and various advisory services. Underwriting fees are generally expressed as a percentage of the funds raised through issuance and are recognized when the service has been completed. Advisory fees vary depending on the scope and type of engagement and can be fixed in nature or contingent on a future event. Advisory fees are recognized over the period in which the service is provided and are recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue will not occur.\n\nCard service revenue primarily includes interchange revenue and annual card fees. Interchange revenue is calculated as a fixed percentage of the transaction amount and recognized when the card transaction is settled. Annual card fees are fixed fees and are recognized over a 12 month period.\n\nCredit fees are primarily earned for arranging syndicated loans and making credit available on undrawn facilities. The timing of the recognition of credit fees varies based on the nature of the services provided.\n\nWhen service fees and other costs are incurred in relation to commissions and fees earned, we record these costs on a gross basis in either Non-interest expense - Other or Non-interest expense - Human resources based on our assessment of whether we have primary responsibility to fulfill the contract with the customer and have discretion in establishing the price for the commissions and fees earned, which may require judgment.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share is computed by dividing Net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Net income available to common shareholders is determined after deducting dividend entitlements of preferred shareholders and distributions on other equity instruments, any gains (losses) on redemption of preferred shares and other equity instruments net of related income taxes and the net income attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\nDiluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if additional common shares are assumed to be issued under securities or contracts that entitle their holders to obtain common shares in the future, to the extent such entitlement is not subject to unresolved contingencies. For contracts that may be settled in cash or in common shares at our option, diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the assumption that such contracts will be settled in shares. Income and expenses associated with these types of contracts are excluded from the Net income available to common shareholders, and the additional number of shares that would be issued is included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. This included certain convertible shares with the conversion assumed to have taken place at the beginning of the period or on the date of issue, if later. For stock options whose exercise price is less than the average market price of our common shares, using the treasury stock method, they are assumed to be exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase common shares at the average market price for the period. The incremental number of common shares issued under stock options and repurchased from proceeds is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Share capital and other equity instruments\n\nWe classify a financial instrument that we issue as a financial asset, financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.",

Upon the sale of treasury shares, the difference between the sale proceeds and the cost of the shares is recognized in Retained earnings. Financial instruments issued by us are classified as equity instruments when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other financial assets. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of equity instruments are included in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. Financial instruments that will be settled by a variable number of our common shares upon their conversion by the holders as well as the related accrued distributions are classified as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dividends and yield distributions on these instruments are classified as Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. For compound instruments comprised of both liability and equity components, the liability component is initially measured at fair value with any residual amount assigned to the equity component.\n\n## Future changes in accounting policy and disclosure\n\nThe following standards have been issued, but are not yet effective for us.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17)\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 to establish a comprehensive global insurance standard which provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 requires entities to measure insurance contract liabilities at their current fulfillment values using one of three approaches. In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17, including deferral of the effective date by two years. This new standard will be effective for us on November 1, 2023 and will be applied retrospectively with restatement of comparatives unless impracticable. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard and the amendments on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Note 3 Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Carrying value and fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe following tables provide a comparison of the carrying and fair values for each classification of financial instruments. Embedded derivatives are presented on a combined basis with the host contracts.

        "page_content": "Fair values of our significant assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are determined and classified in the fair value hierarchy table using the following valuation techniques and inputs.\n\n## Interest-bearing deposits with banks\n\nThe majority of our Interest-bearing deposits with banks are designated as FVTPL. These FVTPL deposits are composed of shortdated deposits placed with banks, and are included in Interest-bearing deposits with banks in the fair value hierarchy table. The fair values of these instruments are determined using the discounted cash flow method. The inputs to the valuation models include interest rate swap curves and credit spreads, where applicable. They are classified as Level 2 instruments in the hierarchy as the inputs are observable.\n\n## Government bonds (Canadian, U.S. and other OECD governments)\n\nGovernment bonds are included in Canadian government debt, U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt, Other OECD government debt and Obligations related to securities sold short in the fair value hierarchy table. The fair values of government issued or guaranteed debt securities in active markets are determined by reference to recent transaction prices, broker quotes, or third-party vendor prices and are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. The fair values of securities that are not traded in active markets are based on either security prices, or valuation techniques using implied yields and risk spreads derived from prices of actively traded and similar government securities. Securities with observable prices or rate inputs as compared to transaction prices, dealer quotes or vendor prices are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Securities where inputs are unobservable are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Corporate and U.S. municipal bonds\n\nThe fair values of corporate and U.S. municipal bonds, which are included in Corporate debt and other debt, U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt and Obligations related to securities sold short in the fair value hierarchy table, are determined using either recently executed transaction prices, broker quotes, pricing services, or in certain instances, the discounted cash flow method using rate inputs such as benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other similar reference rates) and risk spreads of comparable securities. Securities with observable prices or rate inputs are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Securities where inputs are unobservable are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Asset-backed securities and Mortgage-backed securities\n\nAsset-backed securities (ABS) and MBS are included in Asset-backed securities, Mortgage-backed securities, Canadian government debt, U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt, and Obligations related to securities sold short in the fair value hierarchy table. Inputs for valuation of ABS and MBS are, when available, traded prices, dealer or lead manager quotes, broker quotes and vendor prices of the identical securities. When prices of the identical securities are not readily available, we use industry standard models with inputs such as discount margins, yields, default, prepayment and loss severity rates that are implied from transaction prices, dealer quotes or vendor prices of comparable instruments. Where security prices and inputs are observable, ABS and MBS are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Otherwise, they are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Equities\n\nEquities consist of listed and unlisted common shares, private equities, mutual funds and hedge funds with certain redemption restrictions and are included in equities and obligations for securities sold short. The fair values of common shares are based on quoted prices in active markets, where available, and are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. Where quoted prices in active markets are not readily available, fair value is determined based on quoted market prices for similar securities or through valuation techniques, such as multiples of earnings and the discounted cash flow method with forecasted cash flows and discount rate as inputs. Private equities are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy as their inputs are not observable. Hedge funds are valued using Net Asset Values (NAV). If we can redeem a hedge fund at NAV prior to the next quarter end, the fund is classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. Otherwise, it is classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans include base metal loans, corporate loans, banker acceptances and asset-backed financing loans. Fair values are determined based on market prices, if available, or discounted cash flow method using the following inputs: market interest rates, base metal commodity prices, market based spreads of assets with similar credit ratings and terms to maturity, LGD, expected default frequency implied from credit derivative prices, if available, and relevant pricing information such as contractual rate, origination and maturity dates, redemption price, coupon payment frequency and day count convention. Loans with market prices or observable inputs are classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy and loans with unobservable inputs that have significant impacts on the fair values are classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe fair values of exchange-traded derivatives, such as interest rate and equity options and futures, are based on quoted market prices and are typically classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. OTC derivatives primarily consist of interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts and credit derivatives. The exchange-traded or OTC interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives are included in Interest rate contracts, Foreign exchange contracts and Other contracts, respectively, in the fair value hierarchy table. The fair values of OTC derivatives are determined using valuation models when quoted market prices or third-party consensus pricing information are not available. The valuation models, such as discounted cash flow method or Black-Scholes option model, incorporate observable or unobservable inputs for interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices (including indices), credit spreads, corresponding market volatility levels, and other market-based pricing factors. Other adjustments to fair value include bid-offer, CVA, FVA, OIS, parameter and model uncertainties, and unrealized gain or loss at inception of a transaction. A derivative instrument is classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy if observable market inputs are available or the unobservable inputs are not significant to the fair value. Otherwise, it is classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\n\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements In the fair value hierarchy table, these instruments are included in Assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed, and Obligations related to assets sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned.

        "page_content": "## Note 3 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)\n\nof these contracts are determined using valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method using interest rate curves as inputs. They are classified as Level 2 instruments in the hierarchy as the inputs are observable.\n\n## Deposits\n\nA majority of our deposits are measured at amortized cost but certain deposits are designated as FVTPL. These FVTPL deposits include deposits taken from clients, issuances of certificates of deposits and promissory notes, and interest rate and equity linked notes. The fair values of these instruments are determined using the discounted cash flow method and derivative option valuation models. The inputs to the valuation models include benchmark yield curves, credit spreads, interest rates, equity and interest rate volatility, dividends and correlation, where applicable. They are classified as Level 2 or 3 instruments in the hierarchy, depending on the significance of the unobservable credit spreads, volatility, dividend and correlation rates.\n\n## Quantitative

An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement and vice versa. A credit spread/discount margin is the difference between a debt instrument's yield and a benchmark instrument's yield. Benchmark instruments have high credit quality ratings, similar maturities and are often government bonds. The credit spread/discount margin therefore represents the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows of an asset to reflect the market return required for uncertainty in the estimated cash flows. The credit spread/discount margin for an instrument forms part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow method.\n\n## Funding spread\n\nFunding spreads are credit spreads specific to funding or deposit rates. A decrease in funding spreads, on its own, will increase the fair value of our liabilities, and vice versa.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3 Fair value of financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Default rates\n\nA default rate is the rate at which borrowers fail to make scheduled loan payments. A decrease in the default rate will typically increase the fair value of the loan, and vice versa. This effect will be significantly more pronounced for a non-government guaranteed loan than a government guaranteed loan.\n\n## Prepayment rates\n\nA prepayment rate is the rate at which a loan will be repaid in advance of its expected amortization schedule. Prepayments change the future cash flows of a loan. An increase in the prepayment rate in isolation will result in an increase in fair value when the loan interest rate is lower than the current reinvestment rate, and a decrease in the prepayment rate in isolation will result in a decrease in fair value when the loan interest rate is lower than the current reinvestment rate. Prepayment rates are generally negatively correlated with interest rates.\n\n## Recovery and loss severity rates\n\nA recovery rate is an estimation of the amount that can be collected in a loan default scenario. The recovery rate is the recovered amount divided by the loan balance due, expressed as a percentage. The inverse concept of recovery is loss severity. Loss severity rate is an estimation of the loan amount not collected when a loan defaults. The loss severity rate is the loss amount divided by the loan balance due, expressed as a percentage. Generally, an increase in the recovery rate or a decrease in the loss severity rate will increase the loan fair value, and vice versa.\n\n## Volatility rates\n\nVolatility measures the potential variability of future prices and is often measured as the standard deviation of price movements. Volatility is an input to option pricing models used to value derivatives and issued structured notes. Volatility is used in valuing equity, interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange options. A higher volatility rate means that the underlying price or rate movements are more likely to occur. Higher volatility rates may increase or decrease an option's fair value depending on the option's terms. The determination of volatility rates is dependent on various factors, including but not limited to, the underlying's market price, the strike price and maturity.\n\n## Dividend yields\n\nA dividend yield is the underlying equity's expected dividends expressed as an annual percentage of its price. Dividend yield is used as an input for forward equity price and option models. Higher dividend yields will decrease the forward price, and vice versa. A higher dividend yield will increase or decrease an option's value, depending on the option's terms.\n\n## Correlation rates\n\nCorrelation is the linear relationship between the movements in two different variables. Correlation is an input to the valuation of derivative contracts and issued structured notes when an instrument's payout is determined by correlated variables. When variables are positively correlated, an increase in one variable will result in an increase in the other variable. When variables are negatively correlated, an increase in one variable will result in a decrease in the other variable. The referenced variables can be within a single asset class or market (equity, interest rate, commodities, credit and foreign exchange) or between variables in different asset classes (equity to foreign exchange, or interest rate to foreign exchange). Changes in correlation will either increase or decrease a financial instrument's fair value depending on the terms of the instrument.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nAn interest rate is the percentage amount charged on a principal or notional amount. Increasing interest rates will decrease the discounted cash flow value of a financial instrument, and vice versa.\n\n## Consumer Price Index swap rates\n\nA CPI swap rate is expressed as a percentage of an increase in the average price of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food and medical care. An increase in the CPI swap rate will cause inflation swap payments to be larger, and vice versa.\n\n## EV/EBITDA multiples, P/E multiples, EV/Rev multiples, and liquidity discounts\n\nPrivate equity valuation inputs include EV/EBITDA multiples, P/E multiples and EV/Rev multiples. These are used to calculate either enterprise value or share value of a company based on a multiple of earnings or revenue estimates. Higher multiples equate to higher fair values for all multiple types, and vice versa. A liquidity discount may be applied when few or no transactions exist to support the valuations.\n\n## Credit Enhancement\n\nCredit enhancement is an input to the valuation of securitized transactions and is the amount of loan loss protection for a senior tranche. Credit enhancement is expressed as a percentage of the transaction sizes. An increase in credit enhancement will cause the credit spread to decrease and the tranche fair value to increase, and vice versa.\n\n## Interrelationships between unobservable inputs\n\nUnobservable inputs, including the above discount margin, default rate, prepayment rate, and recovery and loss severity rates, may not be independent of each other. For example, the discount margin can be affected by a change in default rate, prepayment rate, or recovery and loss severity rates. Discount margins will generally decrease when default rates decline or when recovery rates increase.",

For an asset or a liability that transfers into Level 3 during the period, the entire change in fair value for the period is excluded from the Gains (losses) included in earnings for positions still held column of the above reconciliation, whereas for transfers out of Level 3 during the period, the entire change in fair value for the period is included in the same column of the above reconciliation.\n\nTransfers between Level 1 and 2 are dependent on whether fair value is obtained on the basis of quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2021, transfers out of Level 1 to Level 2 included Obligations related to securities sold short of $498 million. During the year ended October 31, 2020, transfers out of Level 1 to Level 2 included Investment U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt of $1,200 million, Trading U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt of $1,125 million and Obligations related to securities sold short of $804 million.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2021, transfers out of Level 2 to Level 1 included Obligations related to securities sold short of $130 million. During the year ended October 31, 2020, transfers out of Level 2 to Level 1 included Investment U.S. federal, state, municipal and agencies debt of $937 million.\n\nTransfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are primarily due to either a change in the market observability for an input, or a change in an unobservable input's significance to a financial instrument's fair value.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2021, significant transfers out of Level 2 to Level 3 included:\n\n- GLYPH<129> $277 million of OTC equity options in Other contracts comprised of $17 million of derivative related assets and $294 million of derivative related liabilities, due to changes in the market observability of inputs and changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $154 million of Personal deposits, due to changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2020, significant transfers out of Level 2 to Level 3 included:\n\n- GLYPH<129> $624 million of Loans, due to changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $69 million of OTC equity options in Other contracts comprised of $51 million of derivative related assets and $120 million of derivative related liabilities, due to changes in the market observability of inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $113 million of Personal deposits, due to changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2021, significant transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 included:\n\n- GLYPH<129> $298 million of Loans, due to changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $245 million of OTC equity options in Other contracts comprised of $69 million of derivative related assets and $314 million of derivative related liabilities, due to changes in the market observability of inputs and changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $343 million of Personal deposits, due to changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2020, significant transfers out of Level 3 to Level 2 included:\n\n- GLYPH<129> $179 million of Loans, due to changes in significance of unobservable inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $107 million of Interest rate contracts comprised of $211 million of derivative related assets and $318 million of derivative related liabilities, due to changes in the market observability of inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $109 million of OTC equity options in Other contracts comprised of $76 million of derivative related assets and $185 million of derivative related liabilities, due to changes in the market observability of inputs.\n- GLYPH<129> $347 million of Personal deposits, due to changes in the significance of unobservable inputs.\n\n## Positive and negative fair value movements of Level 3 financial instruments from using reasonably possible alternative assumptions\n\nA financial instrument is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy if one or more of its unobservable inputs may significantly affect the measurement of its fair value. In preparing the financial statements, appropriate levels for these unobservable input parameters are chosen so that they are consistent with prevailing market evidence or management judgment. Due to the unobservable nature of the prices or rates, there may be uncertainty about the valuation of these Level 3 financial instruments.",

This sensitivity disclosure is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments. In reporting the sensitivities below, we offset balances in instances where: (i) the move in valuation factors cause an offsetting positive and negative fair value movement, (ii) both offsetting instruments are in Level 3, and (iii) exposures are managed and reported on a net basis. With respect to overall sensitivity, it is unlikely in practice that all reasonably possible alternative assumptions would simultaneously be realized.\n\n|                                     | As at               | As at                                                                        | As at                                                                        | As at               | As at                                                                        | As at                                                                        |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                     | October 31, 2021    | October 31, 2021                                                             | October 31, 2021                                                             | October 31, 2020    | October 31, 2020                                                             | October 31, 2020                                                             |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)      | Level 3  fair value | Positive fair value  movement from  using reasonably  possible  alternatives | Negative fair value  movement from  using reasonably  possible  alternatives | Level 3  fair value | Positive fair value  movement from  using reasonably  possible  alternatives | Negative fair value  movement from  using reasonably  possible  alternatives |\n| Securities                          |                     |                                                                              |                                                                              |                     |                                                                              |                                                                              |\n| Trading                             |                     |                                                                              |                                                                              |                     |                                                                              |                                                                              |\n| Debt issued or guaranteed by:       |                     |                                                                              |                                                                              |                     |                                                                              |                                                                              |\n| U.S. state, municipal and  agencies | $  25  $            | -

        "page_content": "## Amortized cost securities\n\nFair values of government bonds, corporate bonds, and ABS are based on quoted prices. Fair values of certain Non-OECD government bonds are based on vendor prices or the discounted cash flow method with yield curves of other countries' government bonds as inputs. For ABS, where market prices are not available, the fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method. The inputs to the valuation model generally include market interest rates, spreads and yields derived from comparable securities, prepayment, and LGD.\n\n## Assets purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed, and Obligations related to assets sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned\n\nValuation methods used for the long-term instruments are described in the Fair value of assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis and classified using the fair value hierarchy section of this note. The carrying values of short-term instruments generally approximate their fair values.\n\n## Loans - Retail\n\nRetail loans include residential mortgages, personal and small business loans and credit cards. For residential mortgages, and personal and small business loans, we segregate the portfolio based on certain attributes such as product type, contractual interest rate, term to maturity and credit scores, if applicable. Fair values of these loans are determined by the discounted cash flow method using applicable inputs such as prevailing interest rates, contractual and posted client rates, client discounts, credit spreads, prepayment rates and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. Fair values of credit card receivables are also calculated based on a discounted cash flow method with portfolio yields, write-offs and monthly payment rates as inputs. The carrying values of shortterm and variable rate loans generally approximate their fair values.\n\n## Loans - Wholesale\n\nWhere market prices are available, wholesale loans are valued based on market prices. Otherwise, fair value is determined by the discounted cash flow method using the following inputs: market interest rates and market based spreads of assets with similar credit ratings and terms to maturity, LGD, expected default frequency implied from credit default swap prices, if available, and relevant pricing information such as contractual rate, origination and maturity dates, redemption price, coupon payment frequency and date convention.\n\n## Deposits\n\nDeposits are comprised of demand, notice, and term deposits which include senior deposit notes we have issued to provide us with long-term funding. Fair values of term deposits are determined by one of several valuation techniques: (i) for term deposits and similar instruments, we segregate the portfolio based on term to maturity. Fair values of these instruments are determined by the discounted cash flow method using inputs such as client rates for new sales of the corresponding terms; and (ii) for senior deposit notes, we use actual traded prices, vendor prices or the discounted cash flow method using a market interest rate curve and our funding spreads as inputs. The carrying values of demand, notice, and short-term term deposits generally approximate their fair values.\n\n## Other assets and Other liabilities\n\nOther assets and Other liabilities include receivables and payables relating to certain commodities. Fair values of the commodity receivables and payables are calculated by the discounted cash flow method using applicable inputs such as market interest rates, counterparties' credit spreads, our funding spreads, commodity forward prices and spot prices.\n\n## Subordinated debentures\n\nFair values of Subordinated debentures are based on market prices, dealer quotes or vendor prices when available. Where prices cannot be observed, fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method, with applicable inputs such as market interest rates and credit spreads.",

Reconciling items include the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Model changes, which generally comprise the impact of significant changes to the quantitative models used to estimate expected credit losses and any staging impacts that may arise.\n- GLYPH<129> Transfers between stages, which are presumed to occur before any corresponding remeasurement of the allowance.\n- GLYPH<129> Purchases, which reflect the allowance related to assets newly recognized during the period, including those assets that were derecognized following a modification of terms.\n- GLYPH<129> Sales and maturities, which reflect the allowance related to assets derecognized during the period without a credit loss being incurred, including those assets that were derecognized following a modification of terms.\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in risk, parameters and exposures, which comprise the impact of changes in model inputs or assumptions, including changes in forward-looking macroeconomic conditions; partial repayments; changes in the measurement following a transfer between stages; and unwinding of the time value discount due to the passage of time.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses - securities at FVOCI (1)\n\n|                                           | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                           | October 31, 2021     | October 31, 2021     | October 31, 2021     | October 31, 2020     | October 31, 2020     | October 31, 2020     | October 31, 2020     | October 31, 2020     |                      |\n|                                           | Performing           | Performing           | Impaired             | Impaired             | Performing           | Performing           | Impaired             |                      |                      |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)            | Stage 1              | Stage 2              | Stage 3  (2)         | Total                | Stage 1              | Stage 2              | Stage 3 (2)          | Total                |                      |\n| Balance at beginning of period            | $ 12                 | $ -                  | $ (4)                | $ 8                  | $ 4                  | $ -                  | $ (7)                | $ (3)                |                      |\n| Provision for credit losses               |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |\n| Model changes                             | (4)                  | -                    | -                    | (4)                  | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    |                      |\n| Transfers to stage 1                      | 1                    | (1)                  | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    |                      |\n| Transfers to stage 2                      | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    |                      |\n| Transfers to stage 3                      | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | -                    |                      |\n| Purchases                                 | 8                    | -                    | -                    | 8                    | 18                   | -                    | -                    | 18                   |                      |\n| Sales and maturities                      | (10)                 | (1)                  | -                    | (11)                 | (13)                 | -                    | -                    | (13)                 |                      |\n| Changes in risk, parameters and exposures | (4)                  | 3                    | (9)                  | (10)                 | 3                    | -                    | 4                    | 7                    |                      |\n| Exchange rate and other                   | (1)                  | -                    | 1                    | -                    | -                    | -                    | (1)                  | (1)                  |                      |\n| Balance at end of period                  | $ 2                  | $ 1                  | $ (12)               | $ (9)                | $ 12                 | $ -                  | $ (4)                | $ 8                  |                      |",

The key drivers of changes in expected credit losses include the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in the credit quality of the borrower or instrument, primarily reflected in changes in internal risk ratings;\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in forward-looking macroeconomic conditions, specifically the macroeconomic variables to which our models are calibrated, which are those most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio;\n- GLYPH<129> Changes in scenario design and the weights assigned to each scenario; and\n- GLYPH<129> Transfers between stages, which can be triggered by changes to any of the above inputs.\n\nWhile the global economic recovery has continued throughout fiscal 2021, momentum has waned over the year amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reopening of economies and significant fiscal and monetary policy stimulus have generally supported lower defaults, and are contributing to stronger GDP growth and improved labour markets globally, though this remains uneven. Though increasing vaccination rates are expected to support a continued economic recovery, exceptional government support programs have begun to wind down, and uncertainty remains regarding the duration and ultimate impact on future losses from these programs. Supply chain disruptions, rising business input costs, and labour shortages are also limiting the pace of further improvement and adding to rising inflation concerns. As these factors may impact future losses, our allowances continue to require the application of heightened judgment, as there is a higher than usual degree of uncertainty and the inputs used are inherently subject to change, which may materially change our estimate of Stage 1 and Stage 2 allowance for credit losses in future periods.\n\nTo address the uncertainties inherent in the current and future environment and to reflect relevant risk factors not captured in our modelled results, we applied expert credit judgment in determining significant increases in credit risk since origination and our weighted allowance for credit losses. In light of the significant uncertainty on the progress of the economic recovery, the impact of expert credit judgment on our allowances remains elevated as compared to pre-pandemic levels. We applied quantitative and qualitative adjustments for the impacts of the unprecedented macroeconomic environment, including the impact of government support programs in offsetting the effect of COVID-19 related unemployment on the economy and on mitigating the losses for the sectors most sensitive to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Internal risk ratings\n\nInternal risk ratings are assigned according to the risk management framework outlined under the headings 'Wholesale credit risk' and 'Retail credit risk' of the Credit risk section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. Changes in internal risk ratings are primarily reflected in the PD parameters, which are estimated based on our historical loss experience at the relevant risk segment or risk rating level, adjusted for forward-looking information.\n\n## Forward looking macroeconomic variables\n\nThe PD, LGD and EAD inputs used to estimate stage 1 and stage 2 credit loss allowances are modelled based on the macroeconomic variables (or changes in macroeconomic variables) that are most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant portfolio. Each macroeconomic scenario used in our expected credit loss calculation includes a projection of all relevant macroeconomic variables used in our models for a five year horizon, reverting to long-run averages generally within the 2 to 5 year period. Depending on their usage in the models, macroeconomic variables are projected at a country, province/state or more granular level. These include one or more of the variables described below, which differ by portfolio and region.\n\nOur allowance for credit losses reflects our economic outlook as at October 31, 2021. Subsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in our allowance for credit losses in future periods. All of our IFRS 9 scenarios are designed to include the impact of COVID-19. Despite positive developments and continuous economic improvement, the possibility of a more prolonged recovery period, including monetary policy responses to rising inflation rates brought on in part by global supply chain disruptions, as well as heightened risk in the real estate sector, have been reflected in our scenario design and weights.\n\nOur base scenario reflects a continuation of the recovery that has been underway since the sharp drop in economic activity in calendar Q2 2020. Canadian and U.S. unemployment rates are expected to remain above pre-shock levels at the end of calendar 2021 and we expect GDP to continue growing from Q4 2021 consistent with our expectation that higher vaccination rates will enable a more significant and sustainable easing of containment measures.\n\nDownside scenarios, including two additional and more severe downside scenarios designed for the energy and real estate sectors, reflect the possibility of a second macroeconomic shock beginning in calendar 2022, in addition to the first shock in Q2 2020, with conditions deteriorating from Q4 2021 levels for up to 18 months, followed by a recovery for the remainder of the period. These scenarios assume a monetary policy response that returns the economy to a long-run, sustainable growth rate within the forecast period. The possibility of a more prolonged recovery period, including monetary policy responses to elevated inflation rates which may increase credit risk, have been reflected in our general downside scenario.\n\nThe upside scenario reflects a slightly faster and larger economic recovery than the base scenario, without prompting an offsetting monetary policy response, followed by a return to a long-run sustainable growth rate within the forecast period.",

        "page_content": "## Note 5 Loans and allowance for credit losses (continued)\n\nThe following provides additional detail about our forecasts for certain key macroeconomic variables used in the models to estimate ACL on performing loans, commitments and acceptances:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Unemployment - In our base forecast, calendar Q4 2021 unemployment rates are expected to decline to 6.7% in Canada and 4.7% in the U.S. We expect unemployment rates to continuously improve in both regions for the remainder of the year. We expect the Canadian unemployment rate to stabilize around its long run equilibrium by the latter half of calendar 2022 and for the U.S. unemployment rate to improve to better than the long run equilibrium beginning in calendar Q2 2022 reverting to the long run equilibrium towards the latter end of the forecast horizon.\n\n## Canada Unemployment Rate (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1) Represents the average quarterly unemployment level over the calendar quarters presented.\n\n## U.S. Unemployment Rate (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(1) Represents the average quarterly unemployment level over the calendar quarters presented.\n\n- GLYPH<129> Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - In our base forecast, we expect Canadian GDP in calendar Q4 2021 to be 0.5% above preshock levels and 2.7% above such levels in the U.S., with continuous improvement over the forecast horizon.\n\n## Canada Real GDP (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  Represents the seasonally adjusted annual rate indexed to 2012 Canadian dollar over the calendar quarters presented.\n\n## U.S. Real GDP (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- GLYPH<129> Oil price (West Texas Intermediate in US$) - In our base forecast, we expect oil prices to average $71 per barrel over the next 12 months and $56 per barrel in the following 2 to 5 years. The range of average prices in our alternative energy downside and upside scenarios is $27 to $89 per barrel for the next 12 months and $36 to $61 per barrel for the following 2 to 5 years. As at October 31, 2020, our base forecast included an average price of $43 per barrel for the next 12 months and $48 per barrel for the following 2 to 5 years.\n- GLYPH<129> Canadian housing price index - In our base forecast, we expect housing prices to grow by 0.1% over the next 12 months, with a compound annual growth rate of 4.1% for the following 2 to 5 years. The range of annual housing price growth (contraction) in our alternative real estate downside and upside scenarios is (29.6)% to 10.9% over the next 12 months and 4.2% to 9.6% for the following 2 to 5 years. As at October 31, 2020, our base forecast included housing price growth of 0.6% for the next 12 months and 4.5% for the following 2 to 5 years.\n\nThe primary variables driving credit losses in our retail portfolios are Canadian unemployment rates, Canadian GDP and Canadian housing price index. The Canadian overnight interest rate also impacts our retail portfolios. Our wholesale portfolios are affected by all of the variables discussed above; however, the specific variables differ by sector. Other variables also impact our wholesale portfolios including, but not limited to, Canadian and U.S. 10 year BBB corporate bond yield and credit spreads, 10 year government bond yields, Canadian consumer confidence index, Canadian and U.S. commercial real estate price indices, U.S. housing price index, natural gas prices (Henry Hub), and S&P 500 and EuroStoxx equity indices.\n\nIncreases in the following macroeconomic variables will generally correlate with higher expected credit losses: Canadian and U.S. unemployment rates, Canadian overnight interest rates, Canadian and U.S. 10 year BBB corporate bond yield and credit spreads, and 10 year government bond yields.",

        "page_content": "Increases in the following macroeconomic variables will generally correlate with lower expected credit losses: Canadian and U.S. housing price indices, Canadian and U.S. GDP, Canadian consumer confidence index, Canadian and U.S. commercial real estate price indices, oil and natural gas prices, and S&P 500 and EuroStoxx equity indices.\n\n## Scenario design and weightings\n\nOur estimation of expected credit losses in Stage 1 and Stage 2 considers five distinct future macroeconomic scenarios. Scenarios are designed to capture a wide range of possible outcomes and are weighted according to our expectation of the relative likelihood of the range of outcomes that each scenario represents at the reporting date. We then weight each scenario to take into account historical frequency, current trends, and forward-looking conditions which will change over time. The base case scenario is based on forecasts of the expected rate, value or yield for each of the macroeconomic variables identified above. The upside and downside scenarios are set by adjusting our base projections to construct reasonably possible scenarios and weightings that are more optimistic and pessimistic, respectively, than the base case. As described above, two additional downside scenarios capture the non-linear nature of potential credit losses across our portfolios.\n\nThe impact of each of our five scenarios varies across our portfolios given the portfolios have different sensitivities to movements in each macroeconomic variable. As described above, all scenarios are designed to include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as at October 31, 2021, reflective of current market conditions which have improved relative to the prior year. In determining our IFRS 9 allowance for credit losses, and to reflect the continued uncertainty and downside risk of a slower recovery than contemplated in our base scenario, we reassessed our scenario weights to more heavily weight the downside scenarios relative to October 31, 2020.\n\nThe impact of weighting these multiple scenarios increased our ACL on performing loans, relative to our base scenario, by $726 million at October 31, 2021 (October 31, 2020 - $606 million).\n\n## Transfers between stages\n\nTransfers between stage 1 and stage 2 are based on the assessment of significant increases in credit risk relative to initial recognition, as described in Note 2. The impact of moving from 12 months expected credit losses to lifetime expected credit losses, or vice versa, varies by product, reflects the economic recovery underway in 2021 following the sharp drop in economic activity in 2020 and is dependent on the expected remaining life at the date of the transfer. Stage transfers may result in significant fluctuations in expected credit losses.\n\nThe following table illustrates the impact of staging on our ACL by comparing our allowance if all performing loans were in stage 1 to the actual ACL recorded on these assets.\n\n|                      | As at                                  | As at              | As at              | As at                                  | As at              | As at              |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                      | October 31, 2021                       | October 31, 2021   | October 31, 2021   | October 31, 2020                       | October 31, 2020   | October 31, 2020   |\n|                      | ACL - All performing  loans in Stage 1 | Impact of  staging | Stage 1 and 2  ACL | ACL - All performing  loans in Stage 1 | Impact of  staging | Stage 1 and 2  ACL |\n| Performing loans (1) | $ 2,521                                | $ 1,125            | $ 3,646            | $ 4,028                                | $ 1,031            | $ 5,059            |",

In some cases, the original terms of the associated loans were renegotiated or otherwise modified, resulting in changes to the contractual terms of the loans that affect the contractual cash flows. For the year ended October 31, 2020, the amortized cost of the loans whose contractual terms were modified while in Stage 2 or Stage 3 at the quarter ended before the modification was $8,437 million, resulting in no material modification losses. The gross carrying amount of loans transferred to Stage 1 as a result of the modification whose contractual terms were previously modified while in Stage 2 or Stage 3 was not material for the years ended October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2021.\n\n## Note 6 Derecognition of financial assets\n\nWe enter into transactions in which we transfer financial assets such as loans or securities to structured entities or other third parties. The majority of assets transferred under repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements, and in our Canadian residential mortgage securitization transactions do not qualify for derecognition as we continue to be exposed to substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, such as prepayment, credit, price, interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\n## Transferred financial assets derecognized Government relief programs\n\nTo support our clients through unprecedented times due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are participating in government relief programs in Canada and in the U.S.\n\nUnder the Canadian Emergency Business Account program, we have provided interest-free loans to existing eligible small business clients funded by the Export Development Bank of Canada (EDC). As we do not retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets, and all cash flows are passed through to the EDC, these loans are not recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The application window for the CEBA program closed on June 30, 2021.\n\n## Transferred financial assets not derecognized Securitization of Canadian residential mortgage loans\n\nWe periodically securitize insured Canadian residential mortgage loans through the creation of MBS pools under the National Housing Act MBS (NHA MBS) program. All loans securitized under the NHA MBS program are required to be insured by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation or a third-party insurer. We require the borrower to pay for mortgage insurance when the loan amount is greater than 80% of the original appraised value of the property (LTV ratio). For residential mortgage loans securitized under this program with LTV ratios less than 80%, we are required to insure the mortgages at our own expense. Under the NHA MBS program, we are responsible for making all payments due on our issued MBS, regardless of whether we collect the necessary funds from the mortgagor or the insurer. When a borrower defaults on a mortgage, we submit a claim to the insurer if the amount recovered from the collection or foreclosure process is lower than the sum of the principal balance, accrued interest and collection costs on the outstanding loan. The insurance claim process is managed by the insurance provider in accordance with the insurer's policies and covers the entire unpaid loan balance plus generally up to 12 months of interest, selling costs and other eligible expenses. If an insurance claim is denied, a loss is recognized in Provision for credit losses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The amount recorded as a loss is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements and no significant losses were incurred due to legal action arising from mortgage defaults during 2021 and 2020.\n\nWe sell the NHA MBS pools primarily to a government-sponsored structured entity under the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. The entity periodically issues CMBs, which are guaranteed by the government, and sells them to third-party investors. Proceeds of the CMB issuances are used by the entity to purchase the NHA MBS pools from eligible NHA MBS issuers who participate in the issuance of a particular CMB series. Our continuing involvement includes servicing the underlying residential mortgage loans we have securitized, either ourselves or through a third-party servicer. We also act as counterparty in interest rate swap agreements where we pay the entity the interest due to CMB investors and receive the interest on the underlying MBS and reinvested assets. As part of the swaps, we are also required to maintain a principal reinvestment account for principal payments received on the underlying mortgage loans to meet the repayment obligation upon maturity of the CMB. We reinvest the collected principal payments in permitted investments as outlined in the swap agreements.\n\nWe have determined that certain of the NHA MBS program loans transferred to the entity do not qualify for derecognition as we have not transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. As a result, these transferred MBS continue to be classified as residential mortgage loans and recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash received for these transferred MBS is treated as a secured borrowing and a corresponding liability is recorded in Deposits - Business and government on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.",

A structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding control. Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities. We consolidate a structured entity when we control the entity in accordance with our accounting policy as described in Note 2. In other cases, we may sponsor or have an interest in such an entity but may not consolidate it.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nWe consolidate the following structured entities, whose assets and liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Third-party investors in these structured entities generally have recourse only to the assets of the related entity and do not have recourse to our general assets unless we breach our contractual obligations to those entities. In the ordinary course of business, the assets of each consolidated structured entity can generally only be used to settle the obligations of that entity.\n\n## RBC-administered multi-seller conduits\n\nWe generally do not maintain ownership in the multi-seller conduits that we administer and generally do not have rights to, or control of, their assets. However, we issue asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) through a multi-seller conduit that does not have a first loss investor with substantive power to direct the significant operating activities of the conduit. This conduit is consolidated because we have exposure to variability of returns from performance in the multi-seller arrangements through providing transaction-specific and program-wide liquidity, credit and loan facilities to the conduit and have decision-making power over the relevant activities. As of October 31, 2021, $1,076 million of financial assets held by the conduit was included in Loans (October 31, 2020 - $957 million) and $665 million of ABCP issued by the conduit was included in Deposits (October 31, 2020 - $558 million) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Credit card securitization vehicle\n\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card receivables through a structured entity on a revolving basis. The entity purchases co-ownership interests in a pool of credit card receivables and issues senior and subordinated term notes collateralized by that co-ownership interest in the underlying pool of credit card receivables. Investors who purchase the term notes have recourse only to that co-ownership interest in the underlying pool of credit card receivables.\n\nWe continue to service the credit card receivables and perform an administrative role for the entity. We also retain risk in the underlying pool of credit card receivables through our retained interest in the transferred assets, the cash reserve balance we fund from time to time, and also through certain subordinated notes which we retain. Additionally, we may own some senior notes as investments or for market-making activities and we act as counterparty to interest rate and cross currency swap agreements which hedge the entity's interest rate and currency risk exposure. We have also provided subordinated loans to the entity to pay upfront expenses; the loans were fully repaid during the year ended October 31, 2021.\n\nWe consolidate the structured entity because we have decision-making power over the timing and size of future issuances and other relevant activities which were predetermined by us at inception. We also obtain significant funding benefits and are exposed to variability from the performance of the underlying credit card receivables through our retained interest. As at October 31, 2021, $3 billion of notes issued by our credit card securitization vehicle were included in Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2020 - $6 billion).",

        "page_content": "## Collateralized commercial paper vehicle\n\nWe established a funding vehicle that provides loans to us and finances those loans by issuing commercial paper to third-party investors. The structured entity's commercial paper carries an equivalent credit rating to RBC because we are obligated to advance funds to the entity in the event there are insufficient funds from other sources to settle maturing commercial paper. We pledge collateral to secure the loans and are exposed to the market and credit risks of the pledged securities.\n\nWe consolidate the structured entity because we have decision-making power over the relevant activities, are the sole borrower from the structure, and are exposed to a majority of the residual ownership risks through the credit support provided. As at October 31, 2021, $13 billion of commercial paper issued by the vehicle was included in Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2020 - $12 billion).\n\n## Covered bonds\n\nWe periodically transfer mortgages to RBC Covered Bond Guarantor Limited Partnership (the Guarantor LP) to support funding activities and asset coverage requirements under our covered bonds program. The Guarantor LP was created to guarantee interest and principal payments under the covered bond program. The covered bonds guaranteed by the Guarantor LP are direct, unsecured and unconditional obligations of RBC; therefore, investors have a claim against the Bank which will continue if the covered bonds are not paid by the Bank and the mortgage assets in the Guarantor LP are insufficient to satisfy the obligations owing on the covered bonds. We act as general partner, limited partner, swap counterparty, lender and liquidity provider to the Guarantor LP, servicer for the underlying mortgages as well as the registered issuer of the covered bonds.\n\nWe consolidate the Guarantor LP as we have the decision-making power over the relevant activities through our role as general partner and are exposed to variability from the performance of the underlying mortgages. As at October 31, 2021, the total amount of mortgages transferred and outstanding was $80 billion (October 31, 2020 - $106 billion) and $37 billion of covered bonds were recorded as Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2020 - $40 billion).\n\n## Municipal bond TOB structures\n\nWe sell taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds into Tender Option Bond (TOB) structures, which consist of a bond that is credit enhanced by us and purchased by a TOB trust. The TOB trust finances the purchase from us by issuing floating-rate certificates to short-term investors and a residual certificate that is purchased by us. We are the remarketing agent for the floating-rate certificates and provide a liquidity facility to the short-term investors which requires us to purchase any certificates tendered but not successfully remarketed. We credit enhance the bond purchased by the TOB trust with a letter of credit under which we are required to extend funding if there are any losses on the underlying bonds. We earn interest on the residual certificate and receive market-based fees for acting as remarketing agent and providing the liquidity facility and letter of credit.\n\nWe consolidate the TOB trust when we are the holder of the residual certificate as we have decision-making power over the relevant activities, including the selection of the underlying municipal bonds and the ability to terminate the structure, and are exposed to variability from the performance of the underlying municipal bonds. As at October 31, 2021, $7 billion of municipal bonds were included in Investment securities related to consolidated TOB structures (October 31, 2020 - $8 billion) and a corresponding $7 billion of floating-rate certificates were included in Deposits on our Consolidated Balance Sheets (October 31, 2020 - $8 billion).\n\n## RBC managed investment funds\n\nWe are sponsors and investment managers of mutual and pooled funds, which give us the ability to direct the investment decisions of the funds. We consolidate those mutual and pooled funds in which our interests, which include direct investment in seed capital plus management or performance fees, indicate that we are acting as a principal. As at October 31, 2021, $514 million of Trading securities held in the consolidated funds (October 31, 2020 - $516 million) and $365 million of Other liabilities representing the fund units held by third parties (October 31, 2020 - $293 million) were recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nWe have interests in certain structured entities that we do not consolidate but have recorded assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to our transactions and involvement with these entities.\n\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and our maximum exposure to loss related to our interests in unconsolidated structured entities. It also presents the size of each class of unconsolidated structured entity, as measured by the total assets of the entities in which we have an interest.\n\n|                                                    | As at October 31, 2021         | As at October 31, 2021   | As at October 31, 2021              | As at October 31, 2021                | As at October 31, 2021   | As at October 31, 2021       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                     | Multi-seller  conduits  (1)    | Structured  finance      | Non-RBC  managed  investment  funds | Third-party  securitization  vehicles | Other                    | Total                        |\n| On-balance sheet assets                            |                                |                          |                                     |                                       |                          |                              |\n| Securities                                         | $ 12  $                        | -                        | $ 3,047  $                          | -                                     | $ 537  $                 | 3,596                        |\n| Loans                                              | -                              | 4,569                    | -                                   | 6,855                                 | 1,453                    | 12,877                       |\n| Derivatives                                        | 17                             | -                        | -                                   | -                                     | 108                      | 125                          |\n| Other assets                                       | -                              | 27                       | -                                   | -                                     | 363                      | 390                          |\n|                                                    | $                              | 29  $ 4,596  $           | 3,047  $                            | 6,855  $                              | 2,461  $                 | 16,988                       |\n| On-balance sheet liabilities                       |                                |                          |                                     |                                       |                          |                              |\n| Derivatives                                        | $ 93  $                        | -                        | $ -                                 | $ -                                   | $ -                      | $ 93                         |\n| Other liabilities                                  | -                              | -                        | -                                   | -                                     | -                        | -                            |\n|                                                    | $ 93  $                        | -                        | $ -                                 | $ -                                   | $ -                      | $ 93                         |\n| Maximum exposure to loss (2)                       | $ 40,893  $ 8,361  $           |                          | 3,651  $                            | 12,214  $                             | 4,057  $                 | 69,176                       |\n| Total assets of unconsolidated structured entities | $ 40,074  $19,881  $506,699  $ |                          |                                     |                                       |                          | 80,458  $392,348  $1,039,460 |",

Multi-seller conduits primarily purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing ABCP.\n\nIn certain multi-seller conduit arrangements, we do not maintain any ownership of the multi-seller conduits that we administer and have no rights to, or control of, its assets. As the administrative agent, we earn a residual fee for providing services such as coordinating funding activities, transaction structuring, documentation, execution and monitoring. The ABCP issued by each multi-seller conduit is in the conduit's own name with recourse to the financial assets owned by the multi-seller conduit, and is non-recourse to us except through our participation in liquidity and/or credit enhancement facilities.\n\nWe provide transaction-specific and program-wide liquidity facilities to the multi-seller conduits. In addition, we provide program-wide credit enhancement to the multi-seller conduits which obligate us to purchase assets or advance funds in the event the multi-seller conduit does not otherwise have funds from other sources, such as from the liquidity facilities, to settle maturing ABCP. In some cases, we or another third party may provide transaction-specific credit enhancement which can take various forms. We receive market-based fees for providing these liquidity and credit facilities.\n\nFor certain transactions, we act as counterparty to various hedging contracts to facilitate our clients' securitization of fixed rate and/or foreign currency denominated assets through the conduits. These may take the form of forward contracts, interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps. These derivatives expose us to foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are centrally managed by our foreign exchange trading and swap desks, respectively, and credit risk on the underlying assets that is mitigated by the credit enhancement described below.\n\nEach transaction is structured with transaction-specific first loss protection provided by the third-party seller. This enhancement can take various forms, including but not limited to overcollateralization, excess spread, subordinated classes of financial assets, guarantees or letters of credit. The amount of this enhancement varies but is generally designed to cover a multiple of historical losses.\n\nAn unrelated third party (expected loss investor) absorbs losses, up to a maximum contractual amount, that may occur in the future on the assets in the multi-seller conduits before the multi-seller conduits' debt holders and us. In return for assuming this multi-seller conduit first-loss position, each multi-seller conduit pays the expected loss investor a return commensurate with its risk position. The expected loss investor has substantive power to direct the majority of the activities which significantly impact the conduit's economic performance, including initial selection and approval of the asset purchase commitments and liquidity facilities, approval of renewal and amendment of these transactions and facilities, sale or transfer of assets, ongoing monitoring of asset performance, mitigation of losses, and management of the ABCP liabilities.\n\nWe do not consolidate these multi-seller conduits as we do not control the conduits as noted above.\n\n## Structured finance\n\nWe participate in certain municipal bond TOB structures that we do not consolidate. These structures are similar to those consolidated municipal bond TOB structures described above; however, the residual certificates are held by third parties. We provide liquidity facilities for the benefit of floating-rate certificate holders which may be drawn if certificates are tendered but not able to be remarketed. For a portion of these trusts, we also provide a letter of credit for the underlying bonds held in the trust. We do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities of the structures; therefore, we do not consolidate these structures.\n\nWe provide senior warehouse financing to structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans for the purposes of issuing a term collateralized loan obligation (CLO) transaction. Subordinated financing is provided during the",

        "page_content": "warehouse phase by one or more third-party equity investors. We act as the arranger and placement agent for the term CLO transaction. Proceeds from the sale of the term CLO are used to repay our senior warehouse financing, at which point we have no further involvement with the transaction. We do not consolidate these CLO structures as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities of the entity, which include the initial selection and subsequent management of the underlying debt portfolio.\n\nWe provide senior financing to unaffiliated structured entities that are established by third parties to acquire loans. These facilities tend to be longer in term than the CLO warehouse facilities and benefit from credit enhancement generally designed to cover a multiple of historical losses. We do not consolidate these structures as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities of the entity, which include the initial selection and subsequent management of the underlying debt portfolio.\n\n## Non-RBC managed investment funds\n\nWe enter into fee-based equity derivative transactions with third parties including mutual funds, unit investment trusts and other investment funds. These transactions provide their investors with the desired exposure to a reference fund, and we economically hedge our exposure to these derivatives by investing in those reference funds. We also act as custodian or administrator for several funds. We do not consolidate those reference funds that are managed by third parties as we do not have power to direct their investing activities.\n\nWe provide liquidity facilities to certain third-party investment funds. The funds issue unsecured variable-rate preferred shares and invest in portfolios of tax-exempt municipal bonds. Undrawn liquidity commitments expose us to the liquidity risk of the preferred shares and drawn commitments expose us to the credit risk of the underlying municipal bonds. We do not consolidate these third-party managed funds as we do not have power to direct their investing activities.\n\n## Third-party securitization vehicles\n\nWe hold interests in securitization vehicles that provide funding to certain third parties on whose behalf the entities were created. The activities of these entities are limited to the purchase and sale of specified financial assets from the sponsor. We, as well as other financial institutions, are obligated to provide funding up to our maximum commitment level and are exposed to credit losses on the underlying assets after various credit enhancements. Enhancements can take various forms, including but not limited to overcollateralization, excess spread, subordinated classes of financial assets, guarantees or letters of credit. The amount of this enhancement varies but is generally designed to cover a multiple of historical losses. We do not consolidate these entities as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities, including the entities' investing and financing activities.\n\n## Other\n\nOther unconsolidated structured entities include managed investment funds, credit investment products and tax credit funds. We are sponsors and investment managers of mutual and pooled funds, which gives us the ability to direct the investment decisions of the funds. We do not consolidate those mutual and pooled funds if we exercise our decision-making power as an agent on behalf of other unit holders.\n\nWe use structured entities to generally transform credit derivatives into cash instruments, to distribute credit risk and to create customized credit products to meet investors' specific requirements. We enter into derivative contracts, including credit derivatives, to purchase protection from these entities (credit protection) and convert various risk factors such as yield, currency or credit risk of underlying assets to meet the needs of the investors. We act as sole arranger and swap provider for certain entities and, in some cases, fulfill other administrative functions for the entities. We do not consolidate these credit investment product entities as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities, which include selection of the collateral and reference portfolio, and are not exposed to a majority of the benefits or risks of the entities.\n\nWe created certain funds to pass through tax credits received from underlying low-income housing, historic rehabilitation real estate projects to third parties, new market tax credits or renewable energy tax credits to third parties (tax credit funds). We are sponsors of the tax credit funds as a result of our responsibility to manage the funds, arrange the financing, and perform the administrative duties of these tax credit funds. We do not consolidate the tax credit funds as the third-party investors in these funds have the decision-making power to select the underlying investments and are exposed to the majority of the residual ownership and tax risks of the funds.\n\nWe also purchase passive interests in renewable energy tax credit entities created and controlled by third parties. We do not consolidate these third-party funds as we do not have decision-making power over the relevant activities and our investments are managed as part of larger portfolios which are held for trading purposes.\n\n## Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, we buy and sell passive interests in certain third-party structured entities, including mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and government-sponsored ABS vehicles. Our investments in these entities are managed as part of larger portfolios which are held for trading, liquidity or hedging purposes. We did not create or sponsor these entities and do not have any decision-making power over their ongoing activities. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our on-balance sheet investments in these entities, which are not included in the table above. As at October 31, 2021 and 2020, our investments in these entities were included in Trading and Investment securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 3 and Note 4 for further details on our Trading and Investment securities.\n\n## Sponsored entities\n\nWe are a sponsor of certain structured entities in which we have interests but do not consolidate. In determining whether we are a sponsor of a structured entity, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the purpose and nature of the entity, our initial and continuing involvement and whether we hold subordinated interests in the entity. We are considered to be the sponsor of certain credit investment products, tax credit entities, RBC managed mutual funds and a commercial mortgage securitization vehicle. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we did not transfer any commercial mortgages (October 31, 2020 $469 million) to a sponsored securitization vehicle in which we did not have any interests as at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Financial support provided to structured entities\n\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, we have not provided any financial or non-financial support to any consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities when we were not contractually obligated to do so. Furthermore, we have no intention to provide such support in the future.",

        "page_content": "## Note 8 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative instruments are categorized as either financial or non-financial derivatives. Financial derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying interest rate, foreign exchange rate, credit risk, and equity or equity index. Non-financial derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from a precious metal, commodity instrument or index. The notional amount of derivatives represents the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate payments. Notional amounts are generally not exchanged by counterparties, and do not reflect our EAD.\n\n## Financial derivatives\n\n## Forwards and futures\n\nForward contracts are non-standardized agreements that are transacted between counterparties in the OTC market, whereas futures are standardized contracts with respect to amounts and settlement dates, and are traded on regular futures exchanges. Examples of forwards and futures are described below.\n\nInterest rate forwards (forward rate agreements) and futures are contractual obligations to buy or sell an interest-rate sensitive financial instrument on a predetermined future date at a specified price.\n\nForeign exchange forwards and futures are contractual obligations to exchange one currency for another at a specified price for settlement at a predetermined future date.\n\nEquity forwards and futures are contractual obligations to buy or sell at a fixed value (the specified price) of an equity index, a basket of stocks or a single stock at a predetermined future date.\n\n## Swaps\n\nSwaps are OTC contracts in which two counterparties exchange a series of cash flows based on agreed upon rates applied to a notional amount. Examples of swap agreements are described below.\n\nInterest rate swaps are agreements where two counterparties exchange a series of payments based on different interest rates applied to a notional amount in a single currency. Certain interest rate swaps are transacted and settled through clearing houses which act as central counterparties. Cross currency swaps involve the exchange of fixed payments in one currency for the receipt of fixed payments in another currency. Cross currency interest rate swaps involve the exchange of both interest and notional amounts in two different currencies.\n\nEquity swaps are contracts in which one counterparty agrees to pay or receive from the other cash flows based on changes in the value of an equity index, a basket of stocks or a single stock.\n\n## Options\n\nOptions are contractual agreements under which the seller (writer) grants the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, either to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a security, exchange rate, interest rate, or other financial instrument or commodity at a specified price, at or by a predetermined future date. The seller (writer) of an option can also settle the contract by paying the cash settlement value of the purchaser's right. The seller (writer) receives a premium from the purchaser for this right. The various option agreements that we enter into include but are not limited to interest rate options, foreign currency options, equity options and index options.\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit derivatives are OTC contracts that transfer credit risk related to an underlying financial instrument (referenced asset) from one counterparty to another. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, credit default baskets and total return swaps.\n\nCredit default swaps provide protection against the decline in the value of the referenced asset as a result of specified credit events such as default or bankruptcy. They are similar in structure to an option, whereby the purchaser pays a premium to the seller of the credit default swap in return for payment contingent on a credit event affecting the referenced asset.\n\nCredit default baskets are similar to credit default swaps except that the underlying referenced financial instrument is a group of assets instead of a single asset.\n\nTotal return swaps are contracts where one counterparty agrees to pay or receive from the other cash amounts based on changes in the value of a referenced asset or group of assets, including any returns such as interest earned on these assets, in exchange for amounts that are based on prevailing market funding rates.\n\n## Other derivative products\n\nOther contracts are stable value and equity derivative contracts.\n\n## Non-financial derivatives\n\nOther contracts also include non-financial derivative products such as precious metal and commodity derivative contracts in both the OTC and exchange markets.\n\n## Derivatives issued for trading purposes\n\nMost of our derivative transactions relate to client-driven sales and trading activities, and associated market risk hedging. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to clients, enabling them to modify or reduce risks. Trading involves market-making, positioning and arbitrage activities. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants with the intention of generating revenue based on spread and volume. Positioning involves the active management of derivative transactions with the expectation of profiting from favourable movements in prices, rates, or indices. Arbitrage activities involve identifying and profiting from price differentials between markets and product types. Any realized and unrealized gains or losses on derivatives used for trading purposes are recognized immediately in Non-interest income - Trading revenue.\n\n## Derivatives issued for other-than-trading purposes\n\nWe also use derivatives for purposes other than trading, primarily for hedging, in conjunction with the management of interest rate, credit, equity and foreign exchange risk related to our funding, lending, investment activities and asset/liability management.",

        "page_content": "Interest rate swaps are used to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the repricing or maturity characteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. Purchased options are used to hedge redeemable deposits and other options embedded in consumer products. We manage our exposure to foreign currency risk with cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts. We predominantly use credit derivatives to manage our credit exposures. We mitigate industry sector concentrations and single-name exposures related to our credit portfolio by purchasing credit derivatives to transfer credit risk to third parties.\n\nCertain derivatives and cash instruments are specifically designated and qualify for hedge accounting. From time to time, we also enter into derivative transactions to economically hedge certain exposures that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting, or where hedge accounting is not considered economically feasible to implement. In such circumstances, changes in fair value are reflected in Other income in Non-interest income.\n\n## Notional amount of derivatives by term to maturity (absolute amounts) (1)\n\n|                                    | As at October 31, 2021   | As at October 31, 2021   | As at October 31, 2021   | As at October 31, 2021           | As at October 31, 2021                                                  | As at October 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                    | Term to maturity         | Term to maturity         | Term to maturity         | Term to maturity                 |                                                                         |                          |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)     | Within  1 year           | 1 through  5 years       | Over  5 years            | Total                            | Trading                                                                 | Other than  Trading      |\n| Over-the-counter contracts         |                          |                          |                          |                                  |                                                                         |                          |\n| Interest rate contracts            |                          |                          |                          |                                  |                                                                         |                          |\n| Forward rate agreements            | $ 866,704  $             | 161,835  $               |                          | 158  $ 1,028,697  $ 1,015,263  $ |                                                                         | 13,434                   |\n| Swaps                              | 3,936,638                | 6,559,032                | 4,268,243                | 14,763,913                       | 14,259,757                                                              | 504,156                  |\n| Options purchased                  | 266,798                  | 312,149                  | 185,547                  | 764,494                          | 764,494                                                                 | -

Therefore, derivative-related credit risk is represented by the positive fair value of the instrument and is normally a small fraction of the contract's notional amount.\n\nWe subject our derivative transactions to the same credit approval, limit and monitoring standards that we use for managing other transactions that create credit exposure. This includes evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties, and managing the size, diversification and maturity structure of the portfolio. Credit utilization for all products is compared with established limits on a continual basis and is subject to a standard exception reporting process. We use a single internal rating system for all credit risk exposure, as outlined in the internal ratings maps in the Credit risk section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n\nOffsetting is a technique that can reduce credit exposure from derivatives and is generally facilitated through the use of master netting agreements and achieved when specific criteria are met in accordance with our accounting policy in Note 2. A master netting agreement provides for a single net settlement of all financial instruments covered by the agreement in the event of default. However, credit risk is reduced only to the extent that our financial obligations to the same counterparty can be set off against obligations of the counterparty to us. We maximize the use of master netting agreements to reduce derivative-related credit exposure. Our overall exposure to credit risk that is reduced through master netting agreements may change substantially following the reporting date as the exposure is affected by each transaction subject to the agreement as well as by changes in underlying market rates. Measurement of our credit exposure arising out of derivative transactions is reduced to reflect the effects of netting in cases where the enforceability of that netting is supported by appropriate legal analysis as documented in our trading credit risk policies.\n\nThe use of collateral is another significant credit mitigation technique for managing derivative-related counterparty credit risk. Mark-to-market provisions in our agreements with some counterparties, typically in the form of a Credit Support Annex, provide us with the right to request that the counterparty pay down or collateralize the current market value of its derivatives positions when the value exceeds a specified threshold amount.\n\nReplacement cost and credit equivalent amounts are determined in accordance with OSFI's non-modelled regulatory SA-CCR under the CAR guidelines. The replacement cost represents the total fair value of all outstanding contracts in a gain position after factoring in the master netting agreements and applicable margins, scaled by a regulatory factor. The credit equivalent amount is defined as the replacement cost plus an additional amount for potential future credit exposure also scaled by a regulatory factor. The risk-weighted equivalent is determined by applying appropriate risk-weights to the credit equivalent amount, including those risk weights reflective of model approval under the internal ratings based approach.",

Derivatives in hedging relationships\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to minimize volatility in earnings and capital caused by changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Interest rate and currency fluctuations will either cause assets and liabilities to appreciate or depreciate in market value or cause variability in forecasted cash flows. When a hedging relationship is effective, gains, losses, revenue and expenses of the hedging instrument will offset the gains, losses, revenue and expenses of the hedged item.\n\nDerivatives used in hedging relationships are recorded in Other Assets - Derivatives or Other Liabilities - Derivatives on the Balance Sheet. Foreign currency-denominated liabilities used in net investment hedging relationships are recorded in Deposits Business and Government and Subordinated debentures on the Balance Sheet. Gains and losses relating to hedging ineffectiveness is recorded in Non-Interest income and amounts reclassified from hedge reserves in OCI to income is recorded in\n\nNet-interest income for cash flow hedges and Non-interest income for net Investment hedges.\n\nWe assess and measure the effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. When cash instruments are designated as hedges of foreign exchange risks, only changes in their value due to foreign exchange risk are included in the assessment and measurement of hedge effectiveness.\n\nPotential sources of ineffectiveness can be attributed to differences between hedging instruments and hedged items:\n\n- GLYPH<129> Mismatches in the terms of hedged items and hedging instruments, for example the frequency and timing of when interest rates are reset and frequency of payment.\n- GLYPH<129> Difference in the discounting factors between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, taking into consideration the different reset frequency of the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n- GLYPH<129> Hedging derivatives with a non-zero fair value at inception date of the hedging relationship, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item.",

        "page_content": "Below is a description of our risk management strategy for each risk exposure that we decide to hedge:\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nWe use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the repricing characteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. The swaps are designated in either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge and predominantly reference IBORs across multiple jurisdictions. Certain swaps will be affected by the Reform as the market transitions to ABRs by the end of 2021 or beyond.\n\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate contracts to manage the fair value movements of our fixed-rate instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. The interest rate swaps are entered into on a one-to-one basis to manage the benchmark interest rate risk, and its terms are critically matched to the specified fixed rate instruments.\n\nWe also use interest rate swaps in fair value hedges to manage interest rate risk from residential mortgage assets and funding liabilities. Our exposure from this portfolio changes with the origination of new loans, repayments of existing loans, and sale of securitized mortgages. Accordingly, we have adopted dynamic hedging for that portfolio, in which the hedge relationship is rebalanced on a more frequent basis, such as on a bi-weekly or on a monthly basis.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to cash flow variability of our variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates. The variable rate instruments and forecast transactions which reference certain IBORs will be affected by the Reform. Whilst some of the interest rate derivatives are entered into on a one-to-one basis to manage a specific exposure, other interest rate derivatives may be entered into for managing interest rate risks of a portfolio of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nWe manage our exposure to foreign currency risk with cross currency swaps in a cash flow hedge, and foreign exchange forward contracts in a net investment hedge. Certain cash instruments may also be designated in a net investment hedge, where applicable.\n\nFor cash flow hedges, we use cross currency swaps and forward contracts to manage the cash flow variability arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our issued foreign denominated fixed rate liabilities and highly probable forecasted transactions. The maturity profile and repayment terms of these swaps are matched to those of our foreign denominated exposures to limit our cash flow volatility from changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nFor net investment hedges, we use a combination of foreign exchange forwards and cash instruments, such as foreign denominated deposit liabilities, some of which reference IBORs that will be affected by the Reform, to manage our foreign exchange risk arising from our investments in foreign operations. Our most significant exposures include USD, GBP and Euro. When hedging net investments in foreign operations using foreign exchange forwards, only the undiscounted spot element of the foreign exchange forward is designated as the hedging instrument. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument as a result of changes in forward rates and the effects of discounting are not included in the hedging effectiveness assessment. Foreign operations are only hedged to the extent of the principal of the foreign denominated deposit liabilities or notional amount of the derivative; we generally do not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness on hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nWe use total return swaps in cash flow hedges to mitigate the cash flow variability of the expected payment associated with our cash settled share-based compensation plan for certain key employees by exchanging interest payments for indexed RBC share price change and dividend returns.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nWe predominantly use credit derivatives to economically hedge our credit exposures. We mitigate industry sector concentrations and single-name exposures related to our credit portfolio by purchasing credit derivatives to transfer credit risk to third parties.\n\n## Derivative instruments designated in hedging relationships\n\nThe following table presents the fair values of the derivative instruments and the principal amounts of the non-derivative liabilities, categorized by their hedging relationships, as well as derivatives that are not designated in hedging relationships.\n\n## Derivatives and non-derivative instruments (1)\n\n|                                | As at                             | As at                             | As at                             | As at                      | As at                                                       | As at                                                       | As at                                                       | As at                      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                | October 31, 2021                  | October 31, 2021                  | October 31, 2021                  | October 31, 2021           | October 31, 2020                                            | October 31, 2020                                            | October 31, 2020                                            | October 31, 2020           |\n|                                | Designated as hedging instruments | Designated as hedging instruments | Designated as hedging instruments |                            | Designated as hedging instruments  in hedging relationships | Designated as hedging instruments  in hedging relationships | Designated as hedging instruments  in hedging relationships |                            |\n|                                | in hedging relationships          | in hedging relationships          |                                   | Not designated             |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             | Not designated             |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars) | Fair value  Cash flow             |                                   | Net  investment                   | in a hedging  relationship | Fair value                                                  | Cash flow                                                   | Net  investment                                             | in a hedging  relationship |\n| Assets                         |                                   |                                   |                                   |                            |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |                            |\n| Derivative instruments         | $ 66  $                           | 9                                 | $ 98                              | $ 95,368                   | $ 102  $                                                    |                                                             | 1  $ 19                                                     | $ 113,366                  |\n| Liabilities                    |                                   |                                   |                                   |                            |                                                             |                                                             |                                                             |                            |\n| Derivative instruments         | 131                               | 20                                | 18                                | 91,270                     | 298                                                         | 30                                                          | 58                                                          | 109,541                    |\n| Non-derivative instruments     | -                                 | -                                 | 27,157                            | n.a.                       | -                                                           | -                                                           | 28,702                                                      | n.a.                       |",

The recoverable amount of a CGU is represented by its VIU, except in circumstances where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its VIU. In such cases, the greater of the CGU's FVLCD and its VIU is the recoverable amount. Our annual impairment test is performed as at August 1.\n\nIn our 2021 and 2020 annual impairment tests, the recoverable amounts of our Caribbean Banking and International Wealth Management CGUs were based on their FVLCD. The recoverable amounts of all other CGUs tested were based on their VIU.\n\n## Value in use\n\nWe calculate VIU using a five-year discounted cash flow method. Future cash flows are based on financial plans agreed by management, estimated based on forecast results, business initiatives, capital required to support future cash flows and returns to shareholders. Key drivers of future cash flows include net interest margins and average interest-earning assets. The values assigned to these drivers over the forecast period are based on past experience, external and internal economic forecasts, and management's expectations of the impact of economic conditions on our financial results. Beyond the initial cash flow projection period, cash flows are assumed to increase at a constant rate using a nominal long-term growth rate (terminal growth rate), with the exception of our U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) CGU where we applied a mid-term growth rate consistent with our growth expectations for this business, reverting to the terminal growth rate after 10 years. Terminal growth rates are based on the long-term steady state growth expectations in the countries within which the CGU operates. The discount rates used to determine the present value of each CGU's projected future cash flows are based on the bank-wide cost of capital, adjusted for the risks to which each CGU is exposed. CGU-specific risks include: country risk, business/operational risk, geographic risk (including political risk, devaluation risk, and government regulation), currency risk, and price risk (including product pricing risk and inflation).\n\nThe estimation of VIU involves significant judgment in the determination of inputs to the discounted cash flow model and is most sensitive to changes in future cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates applied to cash flows beyond the forecast period. The sensitivity of the VIU to key inputs and assumptions used was tested by recalculating the recoverable amount using reasonably possible changes to those parameters. As at August 1, 2021, no reasonably possible change in an individual key input or assumption, as described, would result in a CGU's carrying amount exceeding its recoverable amount based on VIU.",

We also considered reasonably possible alternative scenarios, including market comparable transactions, which yielded valuations ranging from a material surplus to an immaterial deficit. Cash flows are based on management forecasts, adjusted to approximate the considerations of a prospective third-party buyer. Cash flows beyond the initial 5-year period are assumed to increase at a constant rate using a nominal long-term growth rate. Future cash flows, terminal growth rates, and discount rates are based on the same factors noted above. This fair value measurement is categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as certain significant inputs are not observable. We use significant judgment to determine inputs to the discounted cash flow model which are most sensitive to changes in future cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates applied to cash flows beyond the forecast period. The sensitivity of the FVLCD to key inputs and assumptions was tested by recalculating the recoverable amount using reasonably possible change to those parameters.\n\nWith the improved economic environment in 2021, tempered by continued uncertainty related to COVID-19, the recoverable amount of our Caribbean Banking CGU has increased. As at August 1, 2021, the recoverable amount of our Caribbean Banking CGU, based on FVLCD, was 123% of its carrying amount (August 1, 2020 - the recoverable amount based on FVLCD approximated the carrying amount). In determining the recoverable amount, forecast future cash flows were discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10.9% (August 1, 2020 - 11.4%), reflecting geographic inflation rate expectations, partially offset by a lower terminal growth rate of 3.5% (August 1, 2020 - 3.7%), reflecting a long-term steady state growth rate for the CGU. A 50 bps change in the terminal growth rate would increase and decrease the recoverable amount by $339 million and $289 million, respectively. A 50 bps increase in the discount rate would decrease the recoverable amount by $360 million. A reduction in the forecasted cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by $469 million. Changes in these assumptions have been applied holding other individual factors constant. However, changes in one factor may be magnified or offset by related changes in other assumptions as impacts to the recoverable amount are highly interdependent and changes in assumptions may not have a linear effect on the recoverable amount of the CGU. In aggregate, the range of reasonably possible outcomes would not materially affect the recoverable amount of the CGU.",

We do not have a high degree of concentration risk due to our geographic diversity and business mix. Concentration risk is not a major concern for the life and health insurance business as it does not have a material level of regionspecific characteristics. Reinsurance is also used for a majority of our Canadian insurance business to lower our risk profile and limit the liability on a single claim. We manage underwriting and pricing risk through the use of underwriting guidelines which detail the class, nature and type of business that may be accepted, pricing policies by product line and controls over policy wordings. The risk that claims are handled or paid inappropriately is mitigated by using a range of information technology (IT) system controls and manual processes conducted by experienced staff. These, together with a range of detailed policies and procedures, ensure that all claims are handled in a timely, appropriate and accurate manner.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, our insurance operations reinsure risks to other insurance and reinsurance companies in order to lower our risk profile, limit loss exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. These ceding reinsurance arrangements do not relieve our insurance subsidiaries from our direct obligations to the insured parties. We evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurers and monitor our concentrations of credit risks to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvency. Reinsurance amounts (ceded premiums) included in Non-interest income are shown in the table below.\n\n## Net premiums and claims\n\n|                                          | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)           | October 31  2021     | October 31  2020     |\n| Gross premiums                           | $ 5,090              | $ 4,515              |\n| Premiums ceded to reinsurers             | (250)                | (249)                |\n| Net premiums                             | $ 4,840              | $ 4,266              |\n| Gross claims and benefits (1)            | $ 3,834              | $ 3,700              |\n| Reinsurers' share of claims and benefits | (287)                | (316)                |\n| Net claims                               | $ 3,547              | $ 3,384              |\n\n## Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities\n\nAll actuarial assumptions are set in conjunction with Canadian Institute of Actuaries Standards of Practice and OSFI requirements. The assumptions that have the greatest effect on the measurement of insurance liabilities, the processes used to determine them and the assumptions used as at October 31, 2021 are as follows:\n\nMortality and morbidity - Mortality estimates are based on standard industry insured mortality tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect our own experience. Morbidity assumptions are made with respect to the rates of claim incidence and claim termination for health insurance policies and are based on a combination of industry and our own experience.\n\nFuture investment yield - Assumptions are based on the current yield rate, a reinvestment assumption and an allowance for future credit losses for each line of business, and are developed using interest rate scenario testing, including prescribed scenarios for determination of minimum liabilities as set out in the actuarial standards.\n\nPolicyholder behaviour - Under certain policies, the policyholder has a contractual right to change benefits and premiums, as well as convert policies to permanent forms of insurance. All policyholders have the right to terminate their policies through lapse. Lapses represent the termination of policies due to non-payment of premiums. Lapse assumptions are primarily based on our recent experience adjusted for emerging industry experience where applicable.",

During the year, we reviewed all key actuarial methods and assumptions which are used in determining the policy benefit liabilities resulting in a $90 million net decrease to insurance liabilities comprised of: (i) a decrease of $94 million for revised actuarial reserves on interest rate risk; (ii) a decrease of $5 million due to reinsurance contract renegotiations; (iii) an increase of $34 million arising from insurance risk related assumption updates largely due to mortality, morbidity, and expense assumptions; and (iv) a decrease of $25 million due to changes to valuation models and related data.",

Amounts invested are at the policyholders' risk, except where the policyholders have selected options providing maturity and death benefit guarantees. A liability for the guarantees is recorded in Insurance claims and policy benefit liabilities.\n\nSegregated funds net assets are recorded at fair value. All of our segregated funds net assets are categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the segregated funds liabilities is equal to the fair value of the segregated funds net assets.

        "page_content": "## Note 16 Employee benefits - Pension and other post-employment benefits\n\n## Plan characteristics\n\nWe sponsor a number of programs that provide pension and post-employment benefits to eligible employees. The majority of beneficiaries of the pension plans are located in Canada and other beneficiaries of the pension plans are primarily located in the U.K. and the Caribbean. The pension arrangements including investment, plan benefits and funding decisions are governed by local pension committees or trustees, who are legally segregated from the Bank, or management. Significant plan changes require the approval of the Board of Directors.\n\nOur defined benefit pension plans provide pension benefits based on years of service, contributions and average earnings at retirement. Our primary defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members. New employees are generally eligible to join defined contribution pension plans. The specific features of these plans vary by location. We also provide supplemental nonregistered (non-qualified) pension plans for certain executives and senior management that are typically unfunded or partially funded.\n\nOur defined contribution pension plans provide pension benefits based on accumulated employee and Bank contributions. The Bank contributions are based on a percentage of an employee's annual earnings and a portion of the Bank contribution may be dependent on the amount being contributed by the employee and their years of service.\n\nOur primary other post-employment benefit plans provide health, dental, disability and life insurance coverage and cover a number of current and retired employees who are mainly located in Canada. These plans are unfunded unless required by legislation.\n\nWe measure our benefit obligations and pension assets as at October 31 each year. All plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method. We fund our registered defined benefit pension plans in accordance with actuarially determined amounts required to satisfy employee benefit obligations under current pension regulations. For our principal pension plan, the most recent funding actuarial valuation was completed on January 1, 2021, and the next valuation will be completed on January 1, 2022.\n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2021, total contributions to our pension plans (defined benefit and defined contribution plans) and other post-employment benefit plans were $456 million and $75 million (October 31, 2020 - $1,024 million and $63 million), respectively. For 2022, total contributions to our pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are expected to be $520 million and $84 million, respectively.\n\n## Risks\n\nBy their design, the defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans expose the Bank to various risks such as investment performance, reductions in discount rates used to value the obligations, increased longevity of plan members, future inflation levels impacting future salary increases as well as future increases in healthcare costs. These risks will reduce over time due to the membership closure of our primary defined benefit pension plans and migration to defined contribution pension plans.\n\nThe following table presents the financial position related to all of our material pension and other post-employment benefit plans worldwide, including executive retirement arrangements.\n\n|                                                             | As at                          | As at                                 | As at                          | As at                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | October 31, 2021               | October 31, 2021                      | October 31, 2020               | October 31, 2020                      |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                              | Defined benefit  pension plans | Other post- employment  benefit plans | Defined benefit  pension plans | Other post- employment  benefit plans |\n| Canada                                                      |                                |                                       |                                |                                       |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                   | $ 16,698                       | $ -                                   | $ 15,044                       | $ -                                   |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligation                 | 14,403                         | 1,703                                 | 15,408                         | 1,863                                 |\n| Net surplus (deficit)                                       | $ 2,295                        | $ (1,703)                             | $ (364)  $                     | (1,863)                               |\n| International                                               |                                |                                       |                                |                                       |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                   | $ 1,005                        | $ -                                   | $ 980                          | $ -                                   |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligation                 | 912                            | 77                                    | 943                            | 90                                    |\n| Net surplus (deficit)                                       | $ 93                           | $ (77)                                | $ 37                           | $ (90)                                |\n| Total                                                       |                                |                                       |                                |                                       |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                   | $ 17,703                       | $ -                                   | $ 16,024                       | $ -                                   |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligation                 | 15,315                         | 1,780                                 | 16,351                         | 1,953                                 |\n| Total net surplus (deficit)                                 | $ 2,388                        | $ (1,780)                             | $ (327)  $                     | (1,953)                               |\n| Effect of asset ceiling                                     | (6)                            | -                                     | (1)                            | -                                     |\n| Total net surplus (deficit), net of effect of asset ceiling | $ 2,382                        | $ (1,780)                             | $ (328)  $                     | (1,953)                               |\n| Amounts recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets       |                                |                                       |                                |                                       |\n| Employee benefit assets                                     | $ 2,640                        | $ -                                   | $ 143                          | $ -                                   |\n| Employee benefit liabilities                                | (258)                          | (1,780)                               | (471)                          | (1,953)                               |\n| Total net surplus (deficit), net of effect of asset ceiling | $ 2,382                        | $ (1,780)                             | $ (328)  $                     | (1,953)                               |",

The pension plans' investment strategy is to hold a diversified mix of investments by asset class and geographic location in order to reduce investment-specific risk to the funded status while maximizing the expected returns to meet pension obligations. Investment of the plan's assets follows an asset/liability framework as investment is conducted with careful consideration of the pension obligation's sensitivity to interest rates and credit spreads which are key risk factors impacting the obligation's value. Factors taken into consideration in developing our asset mix include but are not limited to the following:\n\n- GLYPH<129> the nature of the underlying benefit obligations, including the duration and term profile of the liabilities;\n- GLYPH<129> the member demographics, including expectations for normal retirements, terminations, and deaths;\n- GLYPH<129> the financial position of the pension plans;\n- GLYPH<129> the diversification benefits obtained by the inclusion of multiple asset classes; and\n- GLYPH<129> expected asset returns, including asset and liability correlations, along with liquidity requirements of the plan.\n\nTo implement our asset mix policy, we may invest in debt securities, equity securities, and alternative investments. Our holdings in certain investments, including common shares, debt securities rated lower than BBB and residential and commercial mortgages, cannot exceed a defined percentage of the market value of our defined benefit pension plan assets. We may use derivative instruments as either a synthetic investment to more efficiently replicate the performance of an underlying security, or as a hedge against financial risks within the plan. To manage our credit risk exposure, where derivative instruments are not centrally cleared, counterparties are required to meet minimum credit ratings and enter into collateral agreements.\n\nOur defined benefit pension plan assets are primarily comprised of debt and equity securities and alternative investments. Our equity securities generally have unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market (Level 1) and our debt securities generally have quoted market prices for similar assets in an active market (Level 2). Alternative investments and other includes cash, hedge funds, and private fund investments including infrastructure equity, real estate leases and private debt and equity. In the case of private fund investments, no quoted market prices are usually available (Level 2 or Level 3). These fund assets are either valued by an independent valuator or priced using observable market inputs.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2021, the management of defined benefit pension investments continued to focus on an increased allocation to risk reducing investments and strategies, improving diversification, while striving to maintain expected investment return. Over time, an increasing allocation to debt securities and debt securities sold under repurchase agreements are being used to reduce asset/liability duration mismatch and hence variability of the plan's funded status due to interest rate movement. Longer maturity debt securities, given their price sensitivity to movements in interest rates, are considered to be a good economic hedge to risk associated with the plan's liabilities, which are discounted using predominantly long maturity bond interest rates as inputs.\n\n## Asset allocation of defined benefit pension plans (1) , (2)\n\n|                                                    | As at            | As at                             | As at                          | As at            | As at                             | As at                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                    | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021                  | October 31, 2021               | October 31, 2020 | October 31, 2020                  | October 31, 2020              |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except percentages) | Fair value       | Percentage  of total  plan assets | Quoted  in active  market  (3) | Fair value       | Percentage  of total  plan assets | Quoted  in active  market (3) |\n| Equity securities                                  |                  |                                   |                                |                  |                                   |                               |\n| Domestic                                           | $ 1,879          | 11%                               | 100%                           | $ 1,493          | 9%                                | 100%                          |\n| Foreign                                            | 4,202            | 24                                | 100                            | 3,859            | 24                                | 100                           |\n| Debt securities                                    |                  |                                   |                                |                  |                                   |                               |\n| Domestic government bonds (4)                      | 3,766            | 21                                | -                              | 3,259            | 20                                | -                             |\n| Foreign government bonds                           | 71               | -                                 | -                              | 81               | 1                                 | -                             |\n| Corporate and other bonds                          | 3,844            | 22                                | -                              | 3,701            | 23                                | -                             |\n| Alternative investments and other                  | 3,941            | 22                                | 12                             | 3,631            | 23                                | 13                            |\n|                                                    | $ 17,703         | 100%                              | 37%                            | $ 16,024         | 100%                              | 36%                           |",

The derived curve is based on actual short and mid-maturity corporate AA rates and extrapolated longer term rates. The extrapolated corporate AA rates are derived from observed corporate A, corporate AA and provincial AA yields. For the International pension and other post-employment benefit plans, all future expected benefit payments at each measurement date are discounted at spot rates from a local AA corporate bond yield curve. Spot rates beyond 30 years are set to equal the 30-year spot rate. The discount rate is the equivalent single rate that produces the same discounted value as that determined using the entire discount curve. This valuation methodology does not rely on assumptions regarding reinvestment returns.\n\n## Rate of increase in future compensation\n\nThe assumptions for increases in future compensation are developed separately for each plan, where relevant. Each assumption is set based on the price inflation assumption and compensation policies in each market, as well as relevant local statutory and plan-specific requirements.\n\n## Healthcare cost trend rates\n\nHealthcare cost calculations are based on both short and long-term trend assumptions established using the plan's recent experience as well as market expectations.\n\n## Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligation\n\n|                                         | As at                          | As at                          | As at                                | As at                                |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                         | Defined benefit pension  plans | Defined benefit pension  plans | Other post-employment  benefit plans | Other post-employment  benefit plans |\n|                                         | October 31                     | October 31                     | October 31                           | October 31                           |\n|                                         | 2021                           | 2020                           | 2021                                 | 2020                                 |\n| Discount rate                           | 3.3%                           | 2.7%                           | 3.6%                                 | 3.0%                                 |\n| Rate of increase in future compensation | 3.0%                           | 3.3%                           | n.a.                                 | n.a.                                 |\n| Healthcare cost trend rates (1)         |                                |                                |                                      |                                      |\n| - Medical                               | n.a.                           | n.a.                           | 3.4%                                 | 3.5%                                 |\n| - Dental                                | n.a.                           | n.a.                           | 3.1%                                 | 3.1%                                 |",

The following table summarizes the mortality assumptions used for material plans.\n\n|                | As at            | As at            | As at            | As at            | As at                                                             | As at                                                             | As at                                                             | As at                                                             |\n|----------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2020  Life expectancy at 65 for a member currently at | October 31, 2020  Life expectancy at 65 for a member currently at | October 31, 2020  Life expectancy at 65 for a member currently at | October 31, 2020  Life expectancy at 65 for a member currently at |\n|                | Age 65           | Age 65           | Age 45           | Age 45           | Age 65                                                            | Age 65                                                            | Age 45                                                            | Age 45                                                            |\n| (In years)     | Male             | Female           | Male             | Female           | Male                                                              | Female                                                            | Male                                                              | Female                                                            |\n| Country        |                  |                  |                  |                  |                                                                   |                                                                   |                                                                   |                                                                   |\n| Canada         | 23.8             | 24.2             | 24.8             | 25.1             | 23.8                                                              | 24.1                                                              | 24.7                                                              | 25.1                                                              |\n| United Kingdom | 23.6             | 25.4             | 25.3             | 27.2             | 23.5                                                              | 25.3                                                              | 25.2                                                              | 27.1                                                              |\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAssumptions adopted can have a significant effect on the value of the obligations for defined benefit pension and other postemployment benefit plans and are based on historical experience and market inputs. The increase (decrease) in obligation in the following table has been determined for key assumptions assuming all other assumptions are held constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. The following table presents the sensitivity analysis of key assumptions for 2021.\n\n|                                                                      | Increase (decrease)  in obligation   | Increase (decrease)  in obligation     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                       | Defined benefit  pension plans       | Other post-  employment  benefit plans |\n| Discount rate                                                        |                                      |                                        |\n| Impact of 100 bps increase in discount rate                          | $ (2,113)                            | $ (223)                                |\n| Impact of 100 bps decrease in discount rate                          | 2,625                                | 282                                    |\n| Rate of increase in future compensation                              |                                      |                                        |\n| Impact of 50 bps increase in rate of increase in future compensation | 56                                   | -                                      |\n| Impact of 50 bps decrease in rate of increase in future compensation | (62)                                 | -                                      |\n| Mortality rate                                                       |                                      |                                        |\n| Impact of an increase in longevity by one additional year            | 444                                  | 31                                     |\n| Healthcare cost trend rate                                           |                                      |                                        |\n| Impact of 100 bps increase in healthcare cost trend rate             | n.a.                                 | 64                                     |\n| Impact of 100 bps decrease in healthcare cost trend rate             | n.a.                                 | (54)                                   |\n\n## Note 17 Other liabilities\n\n|                                         | As at            | As at            |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)          | October 31  2021 | October 31  2020 |\n| Accounts payable and accrued expenses   | $ 1,867          | $ 1,500          |\n| Accrued interest payable                | 2,178            | 2,855            |\n| Cash collateral                         | 16,712           | 19,433           |\n| Commodity liabilities                   | 7,916            | 8,354            |\n| Deferred income                         | 3,518            | 2,945            |\n| Deferred income taxes                   | 74               | 52               |\n| Dividends payable                       | 1,622            | 1,611            |\n| Employee benefit liabilities            | 2,038            | 2,424            |\n| Insurance related liabilities           | 366              | 341              |\n| Lease liabilities                       | 5,077            | 5,357            |\n| Negotiable instruments                  | 1,774            | 1,676            |\n| Payable to brokers, dealers and clients | 6,461            | 5,108            |\n| Payroll and related compensation        | 9,340            | 7,476            |\n| Precious metals certificates            | 613              | 623              |\n| Provisions                              | 601              | 618              |\n| Taxes payable                           | 3,403            | 2,209            |\n| Other                                   | 6,741            | 7,249            |\n|                                         | $ 70,301         | $ 69,831         |",

        "page_content": "## Restrictions on the payment of dividends\n\nWe are prohibited by the Bank Act (Canada) from declaring any dividends on our preferred or common shares when we are, or would be placed as a result of the declaration, in contravention of the capital adequacy and liquidity regulations or any regulatory directives issued under the Act. We may not pay dividends on our common shares at any time unless all dividends to which preferred shareholders are then entitled have been declared and paid or set apart for payment.\n\nCurrently, these limitations do not restrict the payment of dividends on our preferred or common shares.\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan\n\nOur dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) provides common and preferred shareholders with a means to receive additional common shares rather than cash dividends. The plan is only open to shareholders residing in Canada or the United States. The requirements of our DRIP are satisfied through either open market share purchases or shares issued from treasury. During 2021 and 2020, the requirements of our DRIP were satisfied through open market share purchases.\n\n## Shares available for future issuances\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, 42.8 million common shares are available for future issue relating to our DRIP and potential exercise of stock options and awards outstanding. In addition, we may issue up to 38.9 million common shares from treasury under the RBC Umbrella Savings and Securities Purchase Plan that was approved by shareholders on February 26, 2009.\n\n## Note 20 Share-based compensation\n\n## Stock option plans\n\nWe have stock option plans for certain key employees. Under the plans, options are periodically granted to purchase common shares. The exercise price for the majority of the grants is determined as the higher of the volume-weighted average of the trading prices per board lot (100 shares) of our common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (i) on the day preceding the day of grant; and (ii) the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the day of grant. The exercise price for the remaining grants is the closing market share price of our common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. All options vest over a four-year period, and are exercisable for a period not exceeding 10 years from the grant date.\n\nThe compensation expense recorded for the year ended October 31, 2021, in respect of the stock option plans was $6 million (October 31, 2020 - $7 million). The compensation expense related to non-vested options was $3 million at October 31, 2021 (October 31, 2020 - $2 million), to be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.0 years (October 31, 2020 - 1.9 years).

        "page_content": "The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year ended October 31, 2021 was estimated at $4.65 (October 31, 2020 - $6.08). This was determined by applying the Black-Scholes model on the date of grant, taking into account the specific terms and conditions under which the options are granted, such as the vesting period and expected share price volatility estimated by considering the historic average share price volatility over a historical period corresponding to the expected option life. The following assumptions were used to determine the fair value of options granted:\n\n## Weighted average assumptions\n\n|                                                           | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (Canadian dollars per share except percentages and years) | October 31  2021     | October 31  2020     |\n| Share price at grant date                                 | $ 104.86             | $104.80              |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                   | 0.48%                | 1.64%                |\n| Expected dividend yield                                   | 4.59%                | 3.90%                |\n| Expected share price volatility                           | 14%                  | 13%                  |\n| Expected life of option                                   | 6 Years              | 6 Years              |\n\n## Employee savings and share ownership plans\n\nWe offer many employees an opportunity to own our common shares through savings and share ownership plans. Under these plans, the employees can generally contribute between 1% and 10% of their annual salary or benefit base for commission-based employees. For each contribution between 1% and 6%, we will match 50% of the employee contributions in our common shares. For the RBC Dominion Securities Savings Plan, our maximum annual contribution is $4,500 per employee. For the RBC U.K. Share Incentive Plan, our maximum annual contribution is \u00a31,500 per employee. For the year ended October 31, 2021, we contributed $123 million (October 31, 2020 - $116 million), under the terms of these plans, towards the purchase of our common shares. As at October 31, 2021, an aggregate of 36 million common shares were held under these plans (October 31, 2020 - 36 million common shares).\n\n## Deferred share and other plans\n\nWe offer deferred share unit plans to executives, certain key employees and non-employee directors of the Bank. Under these plans, participants may choose to receive all or a percentage of their annual variable short-term incentive bonus, commission, or directors' fee in the form of deferred share units (DSUs). The participants must elect to participate in the plan prior to the beginning of the year. DSUs earn dividend equivalents in the form of additional DSUs at the same rate as dividends on common shares. The participant is not allowed to convert the DSUs until retirement or termination of employment/directorship. The cash value of the DSUs is equivalent to the market value of common shares when conversion takes place.\n\nWe also offer unit awards for certain key employees within Capital Markets. The bonus is invested as RBC share units and a specified percentage vests on a specified number of anniversary dates each year. Each vested amount is paid in cash and is based on the original number of share units granted plus accumulated dividends, valued using the average closing price of RBC common shares during the five trading days immediately preceding the vesting date.\n\nWe offer performance deferred share award plans to certain key employees, all of which vest at the end of three years. Upon vesting, the award is paid in cash and is based on the original number of RBC share units granted plus accumulated dividends valued using the average closing price of RBC common shares during the five trading days immediately preceding the vesting date. A portion of the award under certain plans may be increased or decreased up to 25%, depending on our total shareholder return compared to a defined peer group of global financial institutions.\n\nWe maintain non-qualified deferred compensation plans for certain key employees in the United States. These plans allow eligible employees to defer a portion of their annual income and a variety of productivity and recruitment bonuses and allocate the deferrals among specified fund choices, including a RBC Share Accounted fund that tracks the value of our common shares. The following table presents the units granted under the deferred share and other plans for the year.\n\n## Units granted under deferred share and other plans\n\n|                                               | For the year ended          | For the year ended                      | For the year ended          | For the year ended                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                               | October 31, 2021            | October 31, 2021                        | October 31, 2020            | October 31, 2020                        |\n| (Units and per unit amounts)                  | Units  granted  (thousands) | Weighted  average  fair value  per unit | Units  granted  (thousands) | Weighted  average  fair value  per unit |\n| Deferred share unit plans                     | 462                         | $ 113.34                                | 503                         | $ 98.91                                 |\n| Capital Markets compensation plan unit awards | 4,066                       | 128.95                                  | 4,796                       | 92.06                                   |\n| Performance deferred share award plans        | 2,486                       | 106.10                                  | 2,409                       | 104.14                                  |\n| Deferred compensation plans                   | 87                          | 104.21                                  | 92                          | 103.49                                  |\n| Other share-based plans                       | 767                         | 109.24                                  | 759                         | 100.55                                  |\n|                                               | 7,868                       | $ 118.62                                | 8,559                       | $ 96.74                                 |\n\nOur liabilities for the awards granted under the deferred share and other plans are measured at fair value, determined based on the quoted market price of our common shares and specified fund choices as applicable. Annually, our obligation is increased by additional units earned by plan participants, and is reduced by forfeitures, cancellations, and the settlement of vested units. In addition, our obligation is impacted by fluctuations in the market price of our common shares and specified fund units. For performance deferred share award plans, the estimated outcome of meeting the performance conditions also impacts our obligation.",

        "page_content": "## Note 21 Income taxes (continued)\n\nThe tax loss and tax credit carryforwards amount of deferred tax assets primarily relates to losses and tax credits in our Canadian, U.S., and Caribbean operations. Deferred tax assets of $242 million were recognized at October 31, 2021 (October 31, 2020 - $204 million) in respect of tax losses and tax credits incurred in current or preceding years for which recognition is dependent on the projection of future taxable profits. Management's forecasts support the assumption that it is probable that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred tax assets. The forecasts rely on continued liquidity and capital support to our business operations, including tax planning strategies implemented in relation to such support.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, unused tax losses and tax credits of $384 million and $207 million (October 31, 2020 - $389 million and $305 million) available to be offset against potential tax adjustments or future taxable income were not recognized as deferred tax assets. There are no unused tax losses that will expire within one year (October 31, 2020 - $nil), $2 million that will expire in two to four years (October 31, 2020 - $10 million) and $382 million that will expire after four years (October 31, 2020 $379 million). There are no tax credits that will expire in one year (October 31, 2020 - $nil), $115 million that will expire in two to four years (October 31, 2020 - $143 million) and $92 million that will expire after four years (October 31, 2020 - $162 million).\n\nThe amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized in the parent bank is $20 billion as at October 31, 2021 (October 31, 2020 - $22 billion).\n\n## Tax examinations and assessments\n\nDuring the year, we received reassessments from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), in respect of the 2015 and 2016 taxation years, which suggest that Royal Bank of Canada owes additional taxes of approximately $635 million as they denied the deductibility of certain dividends. The reassessments received during the year are consistent with the reassessments received for taxation years 2012 to 2014 of approximately $756 million of additional income taxes and the reassessments received for taxation years 2009 to 2011 of approximately $434 million of additional income taxes and interest in respect of the same matter. These amounts represent the maximum additional taxes owing for those years.\n\nLegislative amendments introduced in the 2015 Canadian Federal Budget resulted in disallowed deduction of dividends from transactions with Taxable Canadian Corporations including those hedged with Tax Indifferent Investors, namely pension funds and non-resident entities with prospective application effective May 1, 2017. The dividends to which the reassessments relate include both dividends in transactions similar to those which are the target of the 2015 legislative amendments and dividends which are unrelated to the legislative amendments.\n\nIt is possible that the CRA will reassess us for significant additional income tax for subsequent years on the same basis. In all cases, we are confident that our tax filing position was appropriate and intend to defend ourselves vigorously.\n\n## Note 22 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                               | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except share and per share amounts)                            | October 31  2021     | October 31  2020     |\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                      |                      |                      |\n| Net income                                                                                    | $ 16,050             | $ 11,437             |\n| Dividends on preferred shares and distributions on other equity instruments                   | (257)                | (268)                |\n| Net income attributable to non-controlling interests                                          | (12)                 | (5)                  |\n| Net income available to common shareholders                                                   | $ 15,781             | $ 11,164             |\n| Weighted average number of common shares (in thousands)                                       | 1,424,343            | 1,423,915            |\n| Basic earnings per share (in dollars)                                                         | $ 11.08              | $ 7.84               |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                                    |                      |                      |\n| Net income available to common shareholders                                                   | $ 15,781             | $ 11,164             |\n| Dilutive impact of exchangeable shares                                                        | -                    | 13                   |\n| Net income available to common shareholders including dilutive impact of exchangeable  shares | $ 15,781             | $ 11,177             |\n| Weighted average number of common shares (in thousands)                                       | 1,424,343            | 1,423,915            |\n| Stock options (1)                                                                             | 1,737                | 1,054                |\n| Issuable under other share-based compensation plans                                           | 655                  | 755                  |\n| Exchangeable shares                                                                           | -                    | 3,046                |\n| Average number of diluted common shares (in thousands)                                        | 1,426,735            | 1,428,770            |\n| Diluted earnings per share (in dollars)                                                       | $ 11.06              | $ 7.82               |",

Our clients generally have the right to request settlement of, or draw on, our guarantees and commitments within one year. However, certain guarantees can only be drawn if specified conditions are met. These conditions, along with collateral requirements, are described below. We believe that it is highly unlikely that all or substantially all of the guarantees and commitments will be drawn or settled within one year, and contracts may expire without being drawn or settled.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\n## Financial standby letters of credit\n\nFinancial standby letters of credit represent irrevocable assurances that we will make payments in the event that a client cannot meet its payment obligations to the third party. For certain guarantees, the guaranteed party can request payment from us even though the client has not defaulted on its obligations. The term of these guarantees generally have a term of five to seven years.\n\nOur policy for requiring collateral security with respect to these instruments and the types of collateral security held is generally the same as for loans. When collateral security is taken, it is determined on an account-by-account basis according to the risk of the borrower and the specifics of the transaction. Collateral security may include cash, securities and other assets pledged.\n\n## Commitments to extend credit\n\n## Backstop liquidity facilities\n\nBackstop liquidity facilities are provided to ABCP conduit programs administered by us and third parties as an alternative source of financing in the event that such programs are unable to access commercial paper markets, or in limited circumstances, when predetermined performance measures of the financial assets acquired or financed by these programs are not met. The average remaining term of these liquidity facilities is approximately four years.\n\nThe terms of the backstop liquidity facilities do not require us to advance money to these programs in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency and generally do not require us to purchase non-performing or defaulted assets.\n\n## Credit enhancements\n\nWe provide partial credit enhancement to multi-seller ABCP programs administered by us to protect commercial paper investors in the event that the collections on the underlying assets together with the transaction-specific credit enhancements or the liquidity facilities prove to be insufficient to pay for maturing commercial paper. Each of the asset pools is structured to achieve a high investment-grade credit profile through credit enhancements required to be provided by the third-party sellers related to each transaction. The average remaining term of these credit facilities is approximately three years.\n\n## Documentary and commercial letters of credit\n\nDocumentary and commercial letters of credit, which are written undertakings by us on behalf of a client authorizing a third party to draw drafts on us up to a stipulated amount under specific terms and conditions, where some are collateralized based on the underlying agreement with the client and others are collateralized by cash deposits or other assets of the client.\n\n## Other commitments to extend credit\n\nCommitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorizations to extend credit in the form of loans, reverse repurchase agreements, bankers' acceptances or letters of credit where we do not have the ability to unilaterally withdraw the credit extended to the borrower.",

        "page_content": "## Note 23 Guarantees, commitments, pledged assets and contingencies (continued)\n\n## Other credit-related commitments\n\n## Securities lending indemnifications\n\nIn securities lending transactions, we act as an agent for the owner of a security, who agrees to lend the security to a borrower for a fee, under the terms of a pre-arranged contract. The borrower must fully collateralize the security loaned at all times. As part of this custodial business, an indemnification may be provided to securities lending customers to ensure that the fair value of securities loaned will be returned in the event that the borrower fails to return the borrowed securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the fair value of those securities. These indemnifications normally terminate without being drawn upon. The term of these indemnifications varies, as the securities loaned are recallable on demand. Collateral held for our securities lending transactions typically includes cash, securities that are issued or guaranteed by the Canadian government, U.S. government or other OECD countries or high quality debt or equity instruments.\n\n## Performance guarantees\n\nPerformance guarantees represent irrevocable assurances that we will make payments to third-party beneficiaries in the event that a client fails to perform under a specified non-financial contractual obligation. Such obligations typically include works and service contracts, performance bonds, and warranties related to international trade. The term of these guarantees can range up to three to seven years.\n\nOur policy for requiring collateral security with respect to these instruments and the types of collateral security held is generally the same as for loans. When collateral security is taken, it is determined on an account-by-account basis according to the risk of the borrower and the specifics of the transaction. Collateral security may include cash, securities and other assets pledged.\n\n## Sponsored member guarantees\n\nFor certain overnight repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions, we act as a sponsoring member to eligible clients to clear transactions through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC). We also provide a guarantee to FICC for the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients' respective obligations under the FICC rules. The guarantees are fully collateralized by cash and securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government.\n\n## Indemnifications\n\nIn the normal course of our operations, we provide indemnifications which are often standard contractual terms to counterparties in transactions such as purchase and sale contracts, fiduciary, agency, licensing, custodial and service agreements, clearing system arrangements, participation as a member of exchanges, director/officer contracts and leasing transactions. These indemnification agreements may require us to compensate the counterparties for costs incurred as a result of changes in laws and regulations (including tax legislation) or as a result of litigation claims or statutory sanctions that may be suffered by the counterparty as a consequence of the transaction. The terms of these indemnification agreements vary based on the contract. The nature of the indemnification agreements prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount we could be required to pay to counterparties. Historically, we have not made any significant payments under such indemnifications.\n\n## Uncommitted amounts\n\nUncommitted amounts represent undrawn credit facilities for which we have the ability to unilaterally withdraw the credit extended to the borrower at any time. These include both retail and commercial commitments. As at October 31, 2021, the total balance of uncommitted amounts was $333 billion (October 31, 2020 - $317 billion).\n\n## Other commitments\n\nWe invest in private companies, directly or through third-party investment funds, including Small Business Investment Companies, real estate funds and Low Income Housing Tax Credit funds. These funds are generally structured as closed-end limited partnerships wherein we hold a limited partner interest. For the year ended October 31, 2021, we have unfunded commitments of $1,396 million (October 31, 2020 - $882 million) representing the aggregate amount of cash we are obligated to contribute as capital to these partnerships under the terms of the relevant contracts.\n\n## Pledged assets and collateral\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we pledge assets and enter into collateral agreements with terms and conditions that are usual and customary to our regular lending, borrowing and trading activities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following are examples of our general terms and conditions on pledged assets and collateral:\n\n- GLYPH<129> The risks and rewards of the pledged assets reside with the pledgor.\n- GLYPH<129> The pledged asset is returned to the pledgor when the necessary conditions have been satisfied.\n- GLYPH<129> The right of the pledgee to sell or re-pledge the asset is dependent on the specific agreement under which the collateral is pledged.\n- GLYPH<129> If there is no default, the pledgee must return the comparable asset to the pledgor upon satisfaction of the obligation.\n\nWe are also required to provide intraday pledges to the Bank of Canada when we use a real-time electronic wire transfer system that continuously processes all Canadian dollar large-value or time-critical payments throughout the day. The pledged assets earmarked for our Canadian dollar large-value or time-critical payments are normally released back to us at the end of the settlement cycle each day. Therefore, the pledged assets amount is not included in the following table. For the year ended October 31, 2021, we had on average $2 billion of assets pledged intraday to the Bank of Canada on a daily basis (October 31, 2020 - $3 billion). There are infrequent occasions where we are required to take an overnight advance from the Bank of Canada to cover a settlement requirement, in which case an equivalent value of the pledged assets would be used to secure the advance. There were no overnight advances taken on October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020.",

We are and have been subject to a variety of legal proceedings, including civil claims and lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, audits and requests for information by various governmental regulatory agencies and law enforcement authorities in various jurisdictions. Some of these matters may involve novel legal theories and interpretations and may be advanced under criminal as well as civil statutes, and some proceedings could result in the imposition of civil, regulatory enforcement or criminal penalties. We review the status of all proceedings on an ongoing basis and will exercise judgment in resolving them in such manner as we believe to be in our best interest. This is an area of significant judgment and uncertainty and the extent of our financial and other exposure to these proceedings after taking into account current accruals could be material to our results of operations in any particular period. The following is a description of our significant legal proceedings.\n\n## London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) litigation\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada and other U.S. dollar panel banks have been named as defendants in private lawsuits filed in the U.S. with respect to the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR including a number of class action lawsuits which have been consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints in those private lawsuits assert claims against us and other panel banks under various U.S. laws, including U.S. antitrust laws, the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, and state law.\n\nIn addition to the LIBOR actions, in January 2019, a number of financial institutions, including Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Capital Markets LLC, were named in a purported class action in New York alleging violations of the U.S. antitrust laws and common law principles of unjust enrichment in the setting of LIBOR after the Intercontinental Exchange took over administration of the benchmark interest rate from the British Bankers' Association in 2014.\n\nOn March 26, 2020, Royal Bank of Canada and RBC Capital Markets LLC were dismissed from the purported class action in New York alleging violations of the U.S. antitrust laws and common law principles of unjust enrichment in the setting of LIBOR after the Intercontinental Exchange took over administration of the benchmark interest rate from the British Bankers' Association in 2014. On April 24, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible at this time for us to predict the ultimate outcome of these proceedings or the timing of their resolution.\n\n## Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited proceedings\n\nOn April 13, 2015, a French investigating judge notified Royal Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited (RBC Bahamas) of the issuance of an ordonnance de renvoi referring RBC Bahamas and other unrelated persons to the French tribunal correctionnel to face the charge of complicity in estate tax fraud relating to actions taken relating to a trust for which RBC Bahamas serves as trustee. RBC Bahamas believes that its actions did not violate French law and contested the charge in the French court. On January 12, 2017, the French court acquitted all parties including RBC Bahamas and on June 29, 2018, the French appellate court affirmed the acquittals. The acquittals were appealed and on January 6, 2021, the French Supreme Court issued a judgment reversing the decision of the French Court of Appeal and sent the case back to the French Court of Appeal for rehearing.\n\nOn October 28, 2016, Royal Bank of Canada was granted an exemption by the U.S. Department of Labor that allows Royal Bank of Canada and its current and future affiliates to continue to qualify for the Qualified Professional Asset Manager (QPAM) exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act despite any potential conviction of RBC Bahamas in the French proceeding for a temporary one year period from the date of conviction. On November 3, 2020, the Solicitor of Labor of the U.S.",

        "page_content": "## Note 24 Legal and regulatory matters (continued)\n\nDepartment of Labor issued an opinion stating that a conviction under non-U.S. law is not a disqualifying event for purposes of the QPAM exemption. Based on that opinion, any conviction in a French court would not trigger disqualification of Royal Bank of Canada and its current and future affiliates under the QPAM exemption.\n\nRBC Bahamas continues to review the trustee's and the trust's legal obligations, including liabilities and potential liabilities under applicable tax and other laws. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters; however, we believe that the ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, although it may be material to our results of operations in the period it occurs.\n\n## Interchange fees litigation\n\nSince 2011, seven proposed class actions have been commenced in Canada: Bancroft-Snell v. Visa Canada Corporation, et al., 9085-4886 Quebec Inc. v. Visa Canada Corporation, et al., Coburn and Watson's Metropolitan Home v. Bank of America Corporation, et al. (Watson), Macaronies Hair Club and Laser Centre Inc. v. BofA Canada Bank, et al., 1023926 Alberta Ltd. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al., The Crown & Hand Pub Ltd. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al., and Hello Baby Equipment Inc. v. BofA Canada Bank, et al. The defendants in each action are VISA Canada Corporation (Visa), MasterCard International Incorporated (MasterCard), Royal Bank of Canada and other financial institutions. The plaintiff class members are Canadian merchants who accept Visa and/or MasterCard branded credit cards for payment. The actions allege, among other things, that from March 2001 to the present, Visa and MasterCard conspired with their issuing banks and acquirers to set default interchange rates and merchant discount fees and that certain rules (Honour All Cards and No Surcharge) have the effect of increasing the merchant discount fees. The actions include claims of civil conspiracy, breach of the Competition Act (the Act) interference with economic relations and unjust enrichment. The claims seek unspecified general and punitive damages. In Watson , a decision to partially certify the action as a class proceeding was released on March 27, 2014, and was appealed. On August 19, 2015, the British Columbia Court of Appeal struck the plaintiff class representative's cause of action under section 45 of the Act and reinstated the plaintiff class representative's cause of action in civil conspiracy by unlawful means, among other rulings. In October 2016, the trial court in Watson denied a motion by the plaintiff to revive the stricken section 45 Competition Act claim, and also denied the plaintiff's motion to add new causes of action. The Supreme Court of Canada declined the B.C. class action plaintiffs' request to appeal the decision striking the plaintiffs' cause of action under section 45 of the Competition Act. In October 2020, the parties agreed to adjourn the Watson trial.\n\nIn 9085-4886 Quebec Inc. v. Visa Canada Corporation, et al., the Quebec-court dismissed the Competition Act claims by Quebec merchants for post-2010 damages and certified a class action as to the remaining claims. The merchants appealed and on July 25, 2019, the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal to also authorize the merchants to proceed under section 45 of the Competition Act for claims after March 12, 2010 and for claims under section 49 of the Competition Act .\n\nA settlement agreement has been reached with class counsel, contingent on court approval. This settlement upon final court approval would resolve the claims of all Canadian merchants subject to limited rights to opt-out for Quebec merchants.\n\n## Foreign exchange matters\n\nVarious regulators are conducting inquiries regarding potential violations of antitrust law by a number of banks, including Royal Bank of Canada, regarding foreign exchange trading.\n\nBeginning in 2015, putative class actions were brought against Royal Bank of Canada and/or RBC Capital Markets, LLC in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil. These actions were each brought against multiple foreign exchange dealers and allege, among other things, collusive behaviour in global foreign exchange trading. In August 2018, the U.S. District Court entered a final order approving RBC Capital Markets' pending settlement with class plaintiffs. In November 2018, certain institutional plaintiffs who had previously opted-out of participating in the settlement filed their own lawsuit in U.S. District Court. In May 2020, the U.S. District Court dismissed Royal Bank of Canada from the November 2018 lawsuit brought by certain institutional plaintiffs who had previously opted-out of participating in the August 2018 settlement with class plaintiffs. The plaintiffs refiled their claim and in July 2021, the U.S. District Court granted a motion in favour of RBC Capital Markets to dismiss the action, however, denied the motion as to Royal Bank of Canada.\n\nOne other U.S. action that is purportedly brought on behalf of different classes of plaintiffs also remains pending. The Canadian class actions have been settled.\n\nIn its discretion Royal Bank of Canada may choose to resolve claims, litigations, or similar matters at any time. Based on the facts currently known, it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of the Foreign Exchange Matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution.\n\n## Other matters\n\nWe are a defendant in a number of other actions alleging that certain of our practices and actions were improper. The lawsuits involve a variety of complex issues and the timing of their resolution is varied and uncertain. Management believes that we will ultimately be successful in resolving these lawsuits, to the extent that we are able to assess them, without material financial impact to the Bank. This is, however, an area of significant judgment and the potential liability resulting from these lawsuits could be material to our results of operations in any particular period.\n\nVarious other legal proceedings are pending that challenge certain of our other practices or actions. While this is an area of significant judgment and some matters are currently inestimable, we consider that the aggregate liability, to the extent that we are able to assess it, resulting from these other proceedings will not be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n\n## Note 25 Related party transactions\n\n## Related parties\n\nRelated parties include associated companies, post-employment benefit plans for the benefit of our employees, key management personnel (KMP), the Board of Directors (Directors), close family members of KMP and Directors, and entities which are, directly or indirectly, controlled by, jointly controlled by or significantly influenced by KMP, Directors or their close family members.",

        "page_content": "## Note 26 Results by business segment\n\n## Composition of business segments\n\nFor management purposes, based on the products and services offered, we are organized into five business segments: Personal & Commercial Banking, Wealth Management, Insurance, Investor & Treasury Services and Capital Markets.\n\nPersonal & Commercial Banking provides a broad suite of financial products and services to individuals and businesses for their day-to-day banking, investing and financing needs through two businesses: Canadian Banking and Caribbean & U.S. Banking. In Canada, we provide a broad suite of financial products and services through our large branch network, automated teller machines, and mobile sales network. In the Caribbean and the U.S., we offer a broad range of financial products and services in targeted markets. Non-interest income in Personal & Commercial Banking mainly comprises Service charges, Mutual fund revenue and Card service revenue.\n\nWealth Management serves high net worth and ultra-high net worth individual and institutional clients with a comprehensive suite of advice-based solutions and strategies to help them achieve their financial goals through our lines of businesses in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., Europe and Asia, including Canadian Wealth Management, U.S. Wealth Management (including City National), Global Asset Management, and International Wealth Management. Non-interest income in Wealth Management mainly comprises Investment management and custodial fees, Mutual fund revenue and Securities brokerage commissions.\n\nInsurance has operations in Canada and globally, operating under two business lines: Canadian Insurance and International Insurance, providing a wide range of life, health, home, auto, travel, wealth, annuities, reinsurance advice and solutions, and business insurance solutions to individual, business and group clients. In Canada, we offer our products and services through a wide variety of channels, comprised of mobile advisors, advice centres, RBC insurance stores, and digital, mobile and social platforms as well as through independent brokers and travel partners. Outside Canada, we operate in reinsurance and retrocession markets globally offering life, disability and longevity reinsurance products. Non-interest income in Insurance comprises Insurance premiums, investment and fee income.\n\nInvestor & Treasury Services offers custody, fund and investment administration, shareholder services, private capital services, performance measurement and compliance monitoring, distribution, transaction banking, and treasury and market services (including cash and liquidity management, foreign exchange services and global securities finance). Non-interest income in Investor & Treasury Services mainly comprises Investment management and custodial fees, and Foreign exchange revenue, other than trading.\n\nCapital Markets provides expertise in advisory & origination, sales & trading, and lending & financing to corporations, institutional clients, asset managers, private equity firms and governments globally in our two main business lines: Corporate and Investment Banking and Global Markets. In North America, we offer a full suite of products and services which include equity and debt origination and distribution, advisory services, and sales & trading. Outside North America, we have a targeted strategic presence in the U.K. & Europe, Australia, Asia & other markets aligned to our global expertise. In the U.K. & Europe, we offer a diversified set of capabilities in key industry sectors of focus. In Australia and Asia, we compete with global and regional investment banks in targeted areas aligned to our global expertise, including fixed income distribution and currencies trading, secured financing, as well as corporate and investment banking. Non-interest income in Capital Markets mainly includes Trading revenue, Underwriting and other advisory fees and Credit fees.\n\nAll other enterprise level activities that are not allocated to these five business segments, such as certain treasury and liquidity management activities, including amounts associated with unattributed capital, and consolidation adjustments, including the elimination of the Taxable equivalent basis (Teb) gross-up amounts, are included in Corporate Support. Teb adjustments gross up income from certain tax-advantaged sources from Canadian taxable corporate dividends and U.S. tax credit investments recorded in Capital Markets to their effective tax equivalent value with the corresponding offset recorded in the provision for income taxes. Management believes that these Teb adjustments are necessary for Capital Markets to reflect how it is managed and enhances the comparability of revenue across our taxable and tax-advantaged sources. Our use of Teb adjustments may not be comparable to similarly adjusted amounts at other financial institutions. The Teb adjustment for the year ended October 31, 2021 was $518 million (October 31, 2020 - $513 million). Gains (losses) on economic hedges of our U.S. Wealth Management (including City National) share-based compensation plans, which are reflected in revenue, and related variability in share-based compensation expense driven by changes in the fair value of liabilities relating to these plans are also included in Corporate Support as this presentation more closely aligns with how we view business performance and manage the underlying risks.\n\n## Geographic segments\n\nFor geographic reporting, our segments are grouped into Canada, United States and Other International. Transactions are primarily recorded in the location that best reflects the risk due to negative changes in economic conditions and prospects for growth due to positive economic changes. This location frequently corresponds with the location of the legal entity through which the business is conducted and the location of our clients. Transactions are recorded in the local currency and are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations with respect to the movement in the Canadian dollar.\n\n## Management reporting framework\n\nOur management reporting framework is intended to measure the performance of each business segment as if it were a standalone business and reflects the way that the business segment is managed. This approach is intended to ensure that our business segments' results include all applicable revenue and expenses associated with the conduct of their business and depicts how management views those results. We regularly monitor these segment results for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. These items do not impact our consolidated results.\n\nThe expenses in each business segment may include costs or services directly incurred or provided on their behalf at the enterprise level. For other costs not directly attributable to one of our business segments, we use a management reporting framework that uses assumptions and methodologies for allocating overhead costs and indirect expenses to our business",

Activities and business conducted between our business segments are generally at market rates. All other enterprise level activities that are not allocated to our five business segments are reported under Corporate Support.\n\nOur assumptions and methodologies used in our management reporting framework are periodically reviewed by us to ensure that they remain valid. The capital attribution methodologies involve a number of assumptions that are revised periodically.\n\n|                                                                              | For the year ended October 31, 2021   | For the year ended October 31, 2021   | For the year ended October 31, 2021   | For the year ended October 31, 2021   | For the year ended October 31, 2021       | For the year ended October 31, 2021   | For the year ended October 31, 2021        | For the year ended October 31, 2021   | For the year ended October 31, 2021   | For the year ended October 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                               | Personal &  Commercial  Banking       | Wealth  Management  Insurance         |                                       | Investor &  Treasury  Services        | Capital  Markets  (1)                     | Corporate  Support  (1)               | Total                                      | Canada                                | United  States                        | Other  International                  |\n| Net interest income (2)                                                      | $ 12,621  $                           | 2,689  $                              | -

Our risk measurement and objectives, policies and methodologies for managing these risks are disclosed in the shaded text along with those tables specifically marked with an asterisk (*) in the Credit risk section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. These shaded text and tables are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk exist if a number of our counterparties are engaged in similar activities, are located in the same geographic region or have comparable economic characteristics such that their ability to meet contractual obligations would be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk indicate the relative sensitivity of our performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographic location. The amounts of credit exposure associated with certain of our on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments are summarized in the following tables.\n\n|

We are required to calculate our capital ratios using the Basel III framework. Under Basel III, regulatory capital includes Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. CET1 capital mainly consists of common shares, retained earnings and other components of equity. Regulatory adjustments under Basel III include deductions of goodwill and other intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, defined benefit pension fund assets, investments in banking, financial and insurance entities, and the shortfall of provisions to expected losses. Tier 1 capital comprises predominantly CET1 and Additional Tier 1 items including non-cumulative preferred shares and LRCNs that meet certain criteria. Tier 2 capital includes subordinated debentures that meet certain criteria, certain loan loss allowances and non-controlling interests in subsidiaries Tier 2 instruments. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n\nRegulatory capital ratios are calculated by dividing CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital by risk-weighted assets. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by an exposure measure. The exposure measure consists of total assets (excluding items deducted from Tier 1 capital) and certain off-balance sheet items converted into credit exposure equivalents. Adjustments are also made to derivatives and secured financing transactions to reflect credit and other risks.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we complied with all capital and leverage requirements, including the domestic stability buffer, imposed by OSFI.\n\n|                                                                                  | As at            | As at            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars, except percentage amounts and as otherwise noted) | October 31  2021 | October 31  2020 |\n| Capital  (1)                                                                     |                  |                  |\n| CET1 capital                                                                     | $ 75,583         | $ 68,082         |\n| Tier 1 capital                                                                   | 82,246           | 74,005           |\n| Total capital                                                                    | 92,026           | 84,928           |\n| Risk-weighted assets (RWA) used in calculation of capital ratios  (1)            |                  |                  |\n| Credit risk                                                                      | $ 444,142        | $ 448,821        |\n| Market risk                                                                      | 34,806           | 27,374           |\n| Operational risk                                                                 | 73,593           | 70,047           |\n| Total RWA                                                                        | $ 552,541        | $ 546,242        |\n| Capital ratios and Leverage ratio  (1)                                           |                  |                  |\n| CET1 ratio                                                                       | 13.7%            | 12.5%            |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio                                                             | 14.9%            | 13.5%            |\n| Total capital ratio                                                              | 16.7%            | 15.5%            |\n| Leverage ratio                                                                   | 4.9%             | 4.8%             |\n| Leverage ratio exposure (billions)                                               | $ 1,662          | $ 1,553          |\n\n## Note 29 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nOffsetting within our Consolidated Balance Sheets may be achieved where financial assets and liabilities are subject to master netting arrangements that provide the currently enforceable right of offset and where there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. For derivative contracts and repurchase and reverse repurchase arrangements, this is generally achieved when there is a market mechanism for settlement (e.g., central counterparty exchange or clearing house) which provides daily net settlement of cash flows arising from these contracts. Margin receivables and margin payables are generally offset as they settle simultaneously through a market settlement mechanism.\n\nAmounts that do not qualify for offsetting include master netting arrangements that only permit outstanding transactions with the same counterparty to be offset in an event of default or occurrence of other predetermined events. Such master netting arrangements include the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreement or certain derivative exchange or clearing counterparty agreements for derivative contracts, global master repurchase agreement and global master securities lending agreements for repurchase, reverse repurchase and other similar secured lending and borrowing arrangements.\n\nThe amount of financial collateral received or pledged subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements but do not qualify for offsetting refers to the collateral received or pledged to cover the net exposure between counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realized in an event of default or the occurrence of other predetermined events. Certain amounts of collateral are restricted from being sold or re-pledged unless there is an event of default or the occurrence of other predetermined events.",

As warranted, we manage the liquidity risk of various products based on historical behavioural patterns that are often not aligned with contractual maturities. Amounts to be recovered or settled within one year, as presented below, may not be reflective of our long-term view of the liquidity profile of certain balance sheet categories.\n\n|                                                                                        | As at            | As at            | As at            | As at            | As at             | As at            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|\n|                                                                                        | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2021 | October 31, 2020 | October 31, 2020  | October 31, 2020 |\n| (Millions of Canadian dollars)                                                         | Within one  year | After one  year  | Total            | Within one  year | After one  year   | Total            |\n| Assets                                                                                 |                  |                  |                  |                  |                   |                  |\n| Cash and due from banks (1)                                                            | $ 112,924  $     | 922  $           | 113,846          | $ 117,375  $     | 1,513  $          | 118,888          |\n| Interest-bearing deposits with                                                         |                  |                  |                  |                  |                   |                  |\n| banks                                                                                  | 79,638           | -
