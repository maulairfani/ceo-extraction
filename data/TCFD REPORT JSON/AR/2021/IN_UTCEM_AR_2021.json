The events of the last 24 months have heralded a new era of uncertainty where both the amplitude and frequency of shifts have vastly exceeded anything we have seen in recent decades. The unprecedented pandemic was followed by supply chain whiplash, and further disruption was brought on by the Russia-Ukraine war. We are now staring at the spectre of a high-interest rate and highinflation regime globally.\n\nOver the years, corporations have tried to /find a balance between ef/ficiency and resilience, with successive decades of growth having swung the pendulum in the direction of ef/ficiency. The events of the last two years have again taught us all the virtues of reserves and resilience.\n\nThis era of disruption also presents a unique\n\nopportunity for renewal. The exigencies of this disruption has pushed the boundaries of innovation. A world where traditional rules didn't apply, freed thinking from its conventional shackles. And we are clearly staring at a new age , with new paradigms and new ideas .\n\n## Global economy: The storm before the calm?\n\nThe Global economy recovered from the pandemic shock in 2022 on the back of supportive /fiscal and monetary policies and mass vaccination programmes. However, at the end of FY22, the war in Ukraine and the subsequent economic sanctions on Russia posed a large shock. It disrupted energy markets and supply chains and added to the already evolving in/flationary pressures and concerns over consumer demand. Consequently, growth forecasts have been slashed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expects the world economy to grow by",

Central banks have been forced to respond to surging prices with aggressive rate hikes. The pace of monetary tightening is turning out to be quite swift as central bankers attempt to catch up with the rising in/flation from their ultra-accommodative stance during the pandemic.\n\nAs the stance of monetary policy shifts, there is greater turbulence in currency markets. The dollar has strengthened, while emerging economies have witnessed downward pressure on their currencies. At the same time, energy and commodity markets have witnessed heightened volatility. Global supply chain disruptions due to pandemic-induced lockdowns have been replaced by new disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine and the economic sanctions.\n\nWhile the global economic backdrop remains challenging, there are reasons to remain optimistic. First, despite the slowdown, IMF's projection of world GDP growth in CY22 is still tracking the pre-pandemic average. Second, /fiscal support in developed economies remains above the prepandemic trend, even if somewhat diluted, versus past years. Third, mega-trends around sustainability, green investments, digitisation, and disintermediation remain well-entrenched and will support growth and productivity enhancement in the medium term.\n\nThus, while businesses will need to remain on guard regarding /financial market volatility and cost pressures this year, one could expect the mediumterm growth recovery to remain on track.\n\n## India: An engine of global growth\n\nThe Indian economy has not remained unscathed by these global developments. Partly on account of the elevated commodity prices in global markets, India's in/flation has pushed higher than the target of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). To control in/flationary risks, and reduce the pressure on the rupee, RBI has been selling reserves and unwinding the extraordinary liquidity support provided by it during the pandemic.\n\nOn the positive side, economic activity in India has witnessed a sharp recovery to pre-pandemic levels on the back of a rapid and widespread rollout of the vaccination programme. A strong digital ecosystem, /fiscal and monetary policy and various government schemes helped small and medium enterprises and the worst affected sections of the population to survive while reviving demand and bringing the economy back on track.\n\nEven as the global headwinds are being felt, India's growth recovery is progressing well, and most estimates peg economic growth during FY23 around the 7% range. India, therefore, is poised to be the fastest-growing major economy in the world and an engine of global growth.\n\nIndia's exports are exhibiting a strong buoyancy, and economic sentiment has been supported by a robust pipeline of infrastructure projects as well as the government's pragmatic policies, such as the production-linked incentives schemes. Many industries have witnessed fresh project investment announcements. Foreign direct investment /flows have remained strong. The burden of nonperforming assets in the banking sector seems to have peaked out and is easing. Dynamism in India's digital ecosystem, diversi/fication of global supply chains away from China and the greater emphasis of investors on sustainable /finance offer new opportunities for India.\n\nThe above trends lend con/fidence to a robust economic narrative for India in the medium term, which augurs well for the corporate sector as well.",

Against the backdrop of our long history as a group, dynamism leaps out as a common theme. Over the years, we have witnessed multiple business cycles. Across businesses and markets, our evolution is a story of continuous renewal and regeneration, as we aggressively invested in growth and created longterm value for all stakeholders.\n\nThis institutional dynamism and resilience helped us navigate an unprecedented business environment in FY22.\n\nThe pandemic inordinately impacted the future of work, workforce, and workplace. We have moved with the new work ethic by focusing on a holistic employee experience that puts equal emphasis on growth, engagement, and wellbeing. Our employees value and appreciate the One ABG culture, which is profoundly embedded across the organisation. This culture gives the ultimate competitive edge in a world where business models are easily upended.\n\nIt has been a matter of great pride for us that our employee engagement has continued to be strong despite the stresses of the pandemic. 87% of our employees stated in a survey that they have a colleague/friend at work to lean on during dif/ficult times. 96% of our employees experienced considerate behaviour from their managers during this period.\n\n## We are only as strong as our people.\n\nThe Group's continued focus and investment in its people processes in good times have helped us build and sustain a robust and agile workforce that is able to be nimble and responsive at all times. When corporates across the world are facing a rather unusual phenomenon The Great Resignation , our employee survey score for 'intent to stay' remained strong. It is higher than the Global High Performing organisations and almost similar to pre-COVID levels. This strong af/finity is a testimony to our relentless commitment to delivering a world of opportunities with care to our employees.\n\nInternal employee movements of over 5,000 (within the businesses) were up 18% from the average of the last two /fiscals. We also focussed on bringing in young talent, with 73% of new hires being under 35 years of age. Last year, over 9,000 new employees joined the Group refreshing our competence base.\n\nBuilding an aspirational workplace for a diverse workforce was identi/fied as one of the important aspects of our new HR strategy. Enhancing the diversity of our Group is a journey, and it is getting strengthened with targeted efforts over time. Our commitment to gender diversity is evident through the appointment of seven women to senior leadership roles. 21% of all new hires were women, and we had 102 women engineering graduates join us at plant locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Aditya Birla Group's pace of activity, range of businesses, and depth of global presence provide a useful compass to navigate this age of disruption.

In many ways, it has contributed to the resilience demonstrated by the business in navigating the challenges posed by the pandemic.\n\nWe have always looked for opportunities to showcase the power of our women leadership. This year, our cement business, UltraTech launched India's /first 'all-women' operated Ready-Mix Concrete (RMC) manufacturing plant at Bhugaon, Pune. Our list of /firsts includes Aditya Birla AMC's all-women Mutual Fund branch in Bhilai, Chhattisgarh and Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail's Madura manufacturing plants in the south zone, which has 85% women employees.\n\nOur learning strategy evolved continually to adapt in response to the dynamic external environment. This was achieved by re-designing innovative learning properties and methodologies focussing on building contemporary and contextual skills. We shifted gears across digital, blended, and now hybrid learning, making it easier to shift across modes of learning for different sets of learners. We strategically increased the adoption and penetration of our digital learning platform (Gyanodaya Virtual Campus) to cover 94% of our employees in the management cadre. Leveraging the power of internal and external networks, 500+ high-quality digital content modules were created on various themes and topics across ABG.\n\nThe spirit of ABG's resilience and dynamism was displayed at an individual, team, and business level. This has been re/flected in the business results for FY22. This year also saw the launch of new businesses, units, capacity, products, and brands. This happened seamlessly, presenting a unique human story of innovation and grit, and bringing alive our Group values of commitment and passion. We have together navigated an unprecedented period\n\nof disruption and emerged stronger and sharper demonstrating that care, empathy, and results are mutually compatible. And especially so in periods of turmoil.\n\n## Your Company's performance\n\nDuring FY22, your Company recorded net revenues of US$ 7.1 billion ( ' 52,599 crores) and an EBITDA of US$ 1.6 billion ( ' 12,022 crores).\n\nThe Indian cement industry will add 80-100 million tonnes capacity by FY25, driven by increased spending on housing and infrastructure.

This is the /first phase of the 19.5 mtpa capacity expansion announced in December 2020 and will help your Company service the fast-growing cement demand in the Eastern and Central regions of India.\n\nYour Company has also commenced operations from the bulk terminal at Kalamboli, Navi Mumbai, which is your Company's 7 th bulk terminal.\n\nIn addition, your Company's Board of Directors has recently approved a fresh capex of ' 12,886 crores towards increasing capacity by 22.6 mtpa with a mix of brown/field and green/field expansion. The additional capacity would be created across the country and achieved by setting-up integrated and grinding units as well as bulk terminals. Commercial production from these new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner by FY25.\n\nUpon completion of the latest round of expansion, your Company's capacity will grow to 159.25 mtpa, reinforcing its position as the third largest cement company in the world, outside of China.",

        "page_content": "## Analysis\n\nWe keep ourselves aware of the ever-changing dynamics of the risk umbrella. We undertook a comprehensive and holistic risk analysis and created 50 impact cards containing externalities and factors that could pose a risk to our business.\n\nThe externalities spanned a wide range of departmental risks. Each one of these impact cards were then expanded to identify the risks they pose to the business. They were rated in terms of likelihood of the risk, and its consequence was decided across factors like EBITDA, reputation and license to operate, impact on staff, business operations, injury/safety, business objectives, regulatory and legal action.\n\nRegular awareness and training sessions are conducted where all the departmental heads deliberate on the impact and decide upon the corresponding mitigation plan. The risks are rated based on the likelihood of occurrence and consequence on the business.\n\n## Future scenarios\n\nEvery few years, new risks emerge with changing scenarios. These have the potential to impact the Company's operations. With this view, we regularly identify the emerging risks for the next 3-5 years and make plans to mitigate them. We have identi/fied two emerging risks including global regulations on curbing GHG Emissions and pandemic/epidemic-linked disruptions.\n\n## Global regulations on curbing GHG Emissions\n\nThe nature of our business is such that it is carbon intensive. We have to increase our production capacity to meet India's infrastructural demands as a developing country. This increased consumption of limestone and fossil fuels with a corresponding rise in carbon emissions due to the calcination and combustion processes, make us vulnerable to external risks, such as compliance with policy changes.\n\nsuch as introduction of Carbon tax and/or Emission Trading Scheme in the Indian market, and the global climate change goal of below 1.5 degree. This will lead to higher production cost of cement, higher compliance costs and need for an optimised fuel mix, to ensure both-transition to a low carbon technology as well as manufacturing of low carbon products in the coming years.\n\n## Efforts to mitigate our impact\n\nWe are focusing on different options to reduce our carbon footprint and other emissions, such as replacing traditional fuels with alternative fuels, improving the energy ef/ficiency and using clinker additives. Optimising our fuel mix helps ensure both, transition to a low carbon technology and manufacturing low carbon products. We have proposed long-term investments for reducing our carbon footprint. Some of the investment decisions taken are i) WHRS installations at various locations and increasing energy ef/ficiency, ii) increasing the /fly ash absorption rate and AFR usage and iii) adoption of higher usage of renewable energy. All these will help us in achieving our SBTi target of reducing  our Scope 1 GHG emissions by 27% per tonne of cementitious material by FY32 from a FY17 base year and also reducing our Scope 2 GHG emissions by 69% per tonne of cementitious material within the same time frame.\n\nAt UltraTech, we are constantly working to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels by increasing our use of renewable energy. Green energy accounts for 17.64% of the Company's overall power usage (renewable energy + waste heat recovery). UltraTech has more than doubled its renewable energy capacity in the last two years. We have also increased our use of biomass as a source of alternative energy. We have adopted means of sustainable transportation across 15+ locations by adopting CNGbased vehicles as an alternative means of transport for the road dispatches. On par with the concept of using 'Green Mobility' for its product dispatch, UltraTech is among the /first cement companies in India to introduce CNG-based trucks for the dispatch of cement. CNG-based vehicles contribute to a 10-15% reduction in carbon emission as compared to conventional diesel-based trucks.\n\nIn the coming years, the cost of conventional sources of energy critical to our industry, like coal, and the associated emissions linked to our production process, will escalate, with the increase in production capacity. In this situation, we anticipate risks arising from carbon limiting regulations\n\n<!-- image -->",

We make the use of captive jetties to serve coastal demand.\n\n60,000 Truck Fleet\n\n25,000+ Destinations\n\nNet Debt ( ' in crores)\n\n9,000 Daily truck movement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures undertaken to manage logistics-related costs:\n\n- \u00b7  Increase in railway dispatches\n- \u00b7  Higher utilisation of grinding units and bulk terminals\n- \u00b7  Sensitisation and collaborative discussions between direct dispatches and sales team\n- \u00b7  Reduce road freight cost through increase in backhaul opportunities\n- \u00b7  Faster loading/unloading of captive bulk rakes at terminals\n\n## Road safety\n\nTo promote safe driving practices among our drivers, we undertake training and road safety campaigns at all our plant locations.\n\nWe have an 8-point check list highlighting vehicle safety compliance and we identify high risk routes and install monitoring devices like GPS tagging, speed control and night driving. In addition, we introduced an initiative to develop 'Model Truck Parking Yard' as per UltraTech parking guidelines which are developed by Driver Management Centre.\n\n## Case Study\n\n## Deployment of eco-friendly vehicles to reduce our CO 2 emissions by 25% by 2030\n\nAbout 69% of our transport movement is conducted through roadways. CNG is known to be a cleaner form of fuel, and we have been promoting the switch from diesel to CNG run vehicles by all our primary and secondary logistics service providers. Our plant teams work with the transporters to create CNG awareness and improved deployment of CNG trucks at primary and secondary locations.\n\nThis has led to a movement of 190+ CNG vehicles running at our locations. We have adopted a target to increase environment-friendly vehicles by 25-30% in line with our commitment to achieve sustainable transportation. Our ultimate aim is to reduce our carbon emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the Union Budget 2022-23 providing higher allocation for infrastructure, affordable housing and road projects, the cement industry is poised for a volume surge. /uni00A0\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nYour Directors present the 22 nd Annual Report together with the audited accounts of your Company for the year ended 31 st March, 2022.\n\n## OVERVIEW AND THE STATE OF YOUR COMPANY'S AFFAIRS\n\nThe International Monetary Fund ('IMF') lowered its global growth forecast by 0.8 percentage points to 3.6%, as in/flation rises and supply chains continue to be in disarray. With ongoing supply chain disruptions and high energy prices continuing in 2022, in/flation is expected to remain elevated for an extended period of time, and is likely to come down only gradually as supply - demand imbalances wane and the effects of monetary policy responses in major economies kick in./uni00A0\n\nTowards the end of FY22, the war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions that disrupted global commodity markets and supply chains further aggravated the situation. Further more, the frequent and wide-ranging lockdowns in China - including in key manufacturing hubs - have also had a far reaching impact on global supply chains. Other global risks may crystallise as geopolitical tensions remain high.\n\nIndia is expected to remain the fastest growing major economy over 2021-24, according to the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank. The country recorded GDP of 8.7% for FY22, with the industrial sector staging a sharp rebound from a contraction of 7% in FY21. The services sector expanded by 8.2%, owing to the rapid\n\ngrowth in software and IT-enabled services exports while agriculture and allied sectors grew by 3.9%, with food grain production for the kharif season at a record level of 150.5 million tonnes.\n\nThe recent times have put to test the resilience of health systems, economies, governments across the globe in face of the pandemic. With the pandemic continuing to evolve, the need for an effective global health strategy has never been so pronounced. Worldwide access to vaccines, tests, and treatments is essential to reduce the risk from other COVID-19 variants.\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, monetary policies have been geared towards mitigating the adverse impact of the unprecedented demand and supply-side shocks in/flicted on the economy. This, in turn, led to an overall stable economic environment. Several high frequency indicators, such as electricity consumption, PMI manufacturing, exports, and e-way bill creation, GST collections re/flect this. This bodes well for the Indian economy in 2022-23, barring any geopolitical and economic surprises.\n\n## Cement Industry FY22\n\nThe /first half of FY22 witnessed a sharp recovery in demand, supported by the low base of the pandemic-hit H1FY21. However, H2FY22 was impacted as the demand for cement declined due to unexpected rains in different parts of the country, ban on construction activities in the National Capital Region ('NCR') and shortages of labour and sand in the eastern region.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough the macroeconomic factors around India's cement industry remain positive and will be driven by a revival in demand, the sector is facing headwinds from a surge in costs. The key cost constituents - coal, pet coke and diesel, have seen a signi/ficant escalation in prices. The increase in diesel prices resulted in an increase in transport and logistics costs, putting further pressure on businesses.  These commodity prices are not under the control of any constituent and there is little that the ef/ficiency improvement programs can do to cushion the impact of rising costs.\n\nAs per a recent report by a credit rating agency, the Indian cement industry will add 80-100 million tonnes capacity by FY25, driven by increased spending on housing and infrastructure. With the Union Budget 2022-23 providing higher allocation for infrastructure, affordable housing and road projects, the cement industry is poised for a volume surge. Further, the Union Government's thrust on developing and improving public infrastructure (roads, highways, metros and railways, airports, ports, logistics) through projects like PM GatiShakti, National Infrastructure Pipeline ('NIP'), Urban Rejuvenation Mission: AMRUT and Smart Cities Mission is likely to boost cement demand. Demand for affordable houses, with ticket size < ' 4050 lakhs, is expected to rise in Tier 2 and 3 cities. The affordable rental housing scheme, which is a sub-scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana ('PMAY'), is also likely to drive demand for cement in low-cost housing.\n\nGiven its PAN India presence, your Company has the advantage to cater to demand across the country. This coupled with its focus on controlling costs, conserving cash, advancing employee well-being and sustainability, makes your Company well placed to tide over the\n\nuncertainties arising out of the pandemic and deliver a robust performance.\n\n## BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\n\n## Production and capacity utilisation (grey cement)\n\n| Particulars                         | FY22   | FY21   |   %  change |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Installed capacity in India  (MTPA) | 114.55 | 111.35 |        2.87 |\n| Production (MMT)                    | 86.98  | 79.70  |        9.13 |\n| Capacity Utilisation                | 77%    | 71%    |        6    |\n\nMTPA - Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum;\n\nMMT- Million Metric Tonnes\n\nCement production in FY22 was higher by 9% at 86.98 million tonnes as compared to FY21 while capacity utilisation was at 77% as against 71%.\n\n## Sales volume\n\n## (Figures in MMT)\n\n| Particulars            |   FY22 | FY21   | %  change   |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Grey Cement - India    |  87.25 | 80.18  | 8.8         |\n| Grey Cement - Overseas |   4.93 | 4.90   | 4.8         |\n| White Cement           |   1.46 | 1.32   | 11.2        |\n| Others                 |   0.35 | -      | -           |\n| Total Sales Volume     |  93.99 | 86.42  | 8.8         |\n\nDomestic sales volume registered a growth of 9% in FY22.

It is a measure of the degree to which a company is /financing its operations through debt versus wholly-owned funds. It is calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholder's equity. Your Company's Debt Equity Ratio (Net) has improved by 50% mainly on account of reduction in Net Debt during the year.\n- (vi) Operating Profit Margin (%) is a pro/fitability or performance ratio used to calculate the percentage of pro/fit a company generates from its operations. It is calculated by dividing the PBIDT (excluding Other Income) by turnover. Your Company's Operating Pro/fit Margin decreased by 3.7% mainly on account of higher costs and partly set-off by higher volume and higher realisations during the year.\n- (vii) Net Profit Margin (%) is equal to how much net income or pro/fit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It is calculated by dividing the pro/fit for the year by turnover. Your Company's Net Pro/fit Margin decreased by 1.4% mainly on account of higher costs, and partly set-off by higher volume, lower interest outgo and higher realisations during the year.\n- (viii) Return on Net Worth ('RONW') is a measure of pro/fitability of a company expressed in percentage. It is calculated by dividing Net Pro/fit from continuing operations for the year by average Net Worth during the year.\n- (ix) Return on Capital Employed ('ROCE') is a /financial ratio that measures a company's pro/fitability and the ef/ficiency with which its capital is used. In other words, the ratio measures how well a company is generating pro/fits from its capital. It is calculated by\n- dividing pro/fit before interest, exceptional items and tax by average capital employed during the year.\n- (x) Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is the portion of a company's pro/fit allocated to each share. It serves as an indicator of a company's pro/fitability. It is calculated by dividing pro/fit for the year by weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. For your Company, the EPS improved on account of increase in Net Pro/fit by 3.9% over that of the previous year.\n\n## Cash Flow Statement\n\n|                                                          | ( '  in crores)   | ( '  in crores)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| /uni00A0                                                 | FY22              | FY21              |\n| SOURCES OF CASH                                          |                   |                   |\n| Cash from Operations                                     | 9,237             | 9,569             |\n| Non-operating Cash Flow                                  | 286               | 172               |\n| Proceeds from Issue of Share Capital                     | 4                 | 7                 |\n| (Increase) / Decrease in Working Capital                 | (567)             | 1,979             |\n| Total                                                    | 8,960             | 11,728            |\n| USES OF CASH                                             |                   |                   |\n| Net Capital Expenditure                                  | 5,422             | 1,724             |\n| (Redemption) / Increase in Investments                   | (5,925)           | 7,433             |\n| Repayment of Borrowings (net)                            | 7,360             | 891               |\n| Repayment of Lease Liability including  Interest thereof | 160               | 121               |\n| (Issue) / Sale of Treasury Shares (net)                  | 83                | (7)               |\n| Interest                                                 | 838               | 1,213             |\n| Dividend                                                 | 1,065             | 375               |\n| Total                                                    | 9,002             | 11,749            |\n| Increase / (Decrease) in Cash & Cash  Equivalents        | (42)              | (21)              |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The agenda was to discover any gaps in safety processes through regular conversations with contract workers. Weekly observations were circulated across Units through mailers to encourage safe behaviour at work.\n\n## Safety Inspection:\n\nWalk Through Inspection ('WTI'):\n\nTo make your Company's workplaces free from unsafe conditions, WTI has been institutionalised through development of standard inspection checklists for 41 sections (including RMC) and integrating those with the organisational safety management system portal for ease of reporting and analysis.\n\nPratibimb ('Leaders Connect with employees') to review Walk Through Inspection:\n\nTo review and improve effectiveness of Walk-Through Inspections, each Cluster Head virtually connected with any four employees on a weekly basis. Through this, 16 employees of 4 Units learned about the focus areas and methods for improvement towards workplace safety.\n\n## Capability building:\n\nSafety Standard Champions Training:\n\nTo build a pool of competent in-house resource, employees across Units were trained on 18 safety standards through virtual 'Standard Champions training' programme. This enabled them to further impart training to employees and ensure compliance. 515 employees quali/fied as standard champions through this program.\n\n## Digital intervention:\n\n- a. Addressing high-risk operations through augmented process knowledge:\n- To enhance technical knowledge of employees associated with speci/fic high-risk operations, e-learning modules have been developed and uploaded in the learning management platform. Employees were mandatorily required to complete the\n\n- e-learning course which helped them to become fully aware of the processes to prevent any incident.\n- b. Data analytics:\n- By integrating mySetu (your Company's safety portal) with Tableau,  your Company's online reporting platform, in-depth analysis of various leading indicators was carried out and focused action was taken for improvement of identi/fied areas. This resulted in reducing high-risk unsafe conditions related to machine guarding and acts related to procedure violation across Units.\n- c. 'Speech to text' for Walk Through Inspection:\n- To facilitate line team members in making walk through inspection reports, speech to text feature was added in the process, thereby bringing more ease and comfort. This resulted in substantial reduction of time required for doing the exercise. While the manual method took around one hour, with this intervention, WTI takes only 25 minutes.\n- d. Virtual inspection using gadget ('Realwear'):\n- Cluster Heads conducted virtual safety inspection of respective Units by using gadgets (Realwear), identi/fied discrepancies and monitored compliance. This led to reduction in high-risk unsafe conditions relating to housekeeping, electrical safety, work at height.\n\n## Project Safety:\n\nTo give greater thrust to safe execution of multiple projects going on simultaneously, multilayer monitoring was introduced over and above existing safety management systems. Virtual training on Vishwakarma (project safety guidelines) was imparted to all employees deployed at various project sites. Safety Experts were deployed at Pali, Dhar and Hirmi and rigging and scaffolding experts were deployed at project sites to support safe execution.\n\n## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nIn terms of the provisions of Section 135 of the Act read with the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014, the Board of Directors of your Company has constituted a Corporate Social Responsibility ('CSR') Committee chaired by Mrs. Rajashree Birla.

SEBI, vide the aforesaid circular, has made BRSR mandatory for the top 1,000 listed companies (by market capitalisation) from /fiscal 2023, while disclosure is voluntary for /fiscal 2022. Your Company has adopted the BRSR voluntarily for FY22 and also publishes a comprehensive Sustainability Report annually, based on GRI standards. The Sustainability Report is available at https://www.ultratechcement.com/ about-us/sustainability/sustainability.\n\nThe BRSR forms part of this Integrated Annual Report.\n\n## CONTRACT AND ARRANGEMENT WITH RELATED PARTIES\n\nRelated party transactions entered into by your Company during the /financial year were completely on an arm's length basis and in the ordinary course of business. There were no material transactions with any related party, as de/fined under Section 188 of the Act read with the Companies (Meetings of Board and its Powers) Rules, 2014. All related party transactions have been approved by the Audit Committee of your Company and reviewed by it on a periodic basis. The policy on Related Party Transactions, as approved by the Audit Committee and the Board, is available at https://www.ultratechcement.com/ investors/corporate-governance#policies.\n\nThe details of contracts and arrangements with related parties of your Company for the /financial year ended 31 st /uni00A0March, 2022 is provided in Note No. 38 to the standalone /financial statements of your Company.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk is an integral and unavoidable component of business. Given the challenging and dynamic environment of your Company's operations, it is committed to proactively managing risk in accomplishing its ambitious goals. Though risks cannot be eliminated, an effective risk management program ensures that risks are reduced, avoided, mitigated, or shared.\n\nTo maintain oversight of your Company's risks, the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee ('RMS Committee') of your Company is mandated to review its Enterprise Risk Management Framework (including plan / process), analyse the risks more deeply and de/fine risk mitigation actions, where necessary. Through the Annual Risk Report processes, which are based upon the business environment, operational controls and compliance procedures, your Company aims to assess and prioritise risks, according to their signi/ficance and likelihood.\n\nThe key risks identi/fied by your Company include economic environment and market demand; in/flation and cost of production; legal and compliance with local laws; /financial and accounting; environment, climate and sustainability; information technology and talent management. Needless to mention, with the challenges presented by the COVID-19 outbreak, pandemic and epidemic-related business risks have been identi/fied by your Company. Further, the Ukraine war has resulted in geopolitical tension, thereby impacting fuel prices, which would have an adverse impact on the operations of your Company.\n\nThe risk horizon considered includes long-term strategic risks, short to medium-term risks as well as single events. The risks are analysed considering likelihood and impact as a basis to determine their management.\n\n## Key Business Risks identified by your Company:\n\n## Economic Environment and Market Demand\n\nThe demand for construction material is fundamentally driven by the economic growth in the country. Economic slowdown and subdued infrastructural development might lead to a slowdown in construction projects, thus leading to a reduction in cement consumption in the country. The growth in construction activity in the country has been slow over the last few years, impacting the cement consumption. In a scenario where incremental capacity addition exceeds incremental cement demand, the government's push for infrastructure and housing will aid the growth in cement consumption and reduce the overcapacity gap.\n\nThe cement industry in India is an aggregation of small and large companies. In such an environment, the risk of protecting market share is optimal. With the expanding capacities of existing players and the emergence of new entrants, competition is a sustained risk. To mitigate this, continuous endeavours to enhance brand equity through innovative marketing activities, enhancement in the product portfolio and value-add services have been the thrust areas for your Company. The engineering expertise of your Company and its emphasis on quality also minimise its risk against market /fluctuations considerably.\n\n## Inflation and Cost of Production\n\nYour Company faces the risk of in/flation and price /fluctuations in the cost of coal, pet coke, power, and other fuels since these are market driven. The cement industry is extremely energy intensive, changes in fuel prices can signi/ficantly impact production cost. To derisk, your Company has established speci/fic policies",

Your Company mitigates this risk through the establishment of exhaustive policies for procurement of speci/fic raw materials and stores and those amenable to just in time inventories.\n\nLimestone being the primary raw material required to produce cement, its continuous and long-term availability is critical, particularly under the dynamic regulatory environment. Your Company currently possesses suf/ficient limestone reserves. Securing additional reserves is critical to address your Company's expansion plans. Apart from the preservation and extension of existing reserves, a range of measures including strategic sourcing and changing input mix are adopted by your Company to mitigate the risk of unavailability of limestone.\n\n## Legal and Compliance\n\nThis risk relates to any inadvertently violated laws covering business conduct.\n\nThe country's regulatory framework is ever-evolving and the risk of non-compliance and penalties may increase for your Company, leading to reputational risks. A comprehensive risk-based compliance programme, involving inclusive training and adherence to the Code of Conduct, is thus institutionalised by your Company.\n\nAs a step to mitigate the legal and compliance risk, your Company's management encourages its employees to place their reliance on professional guidance and opinion to discuss the impact of any changes in laws and regulations to ensure total compliance. Periodic and adhoc reporting to various internal committees for oversight ensures the effectiveness of such a programme.\n\n## Financial\n\nThis comprises the risk of exposure to interest rates,\n\nforeign exchange rates and commodity price /fluctuations. The risk management strategy is to identify the risk exposure, measure and evaluate the /financial impact, and decide on steps to mitigate the risks together with ensuring regular monitoring and reporting.\n\nWith the objective of minimising risks arising from uncertainty and volatility of foreign exchange /fluctuations, an elaborate /financial risk management policy is followed for every transaction undertaken in foreign currency. Your Company's policies to counter such risks are reviewed\n\nperiodically and constantly aligned with the /financial market practices and regulations.\n\nChanging laws, rules, regulations and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance, public disclosure and listing regulations are generating newer and unforeseen risks for companies. The new or changed laws, regulations and standards may lack precedence and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. Thus, your Company maintains a high standard of corporate governance and public disclosure to de-risk itself from such dynamic regulatory changes.\n\n## Environment\n\nThis comprises risks associated with environmental pollution through the discharge of waste and GHG emissions, which may cause damage to the local ecology and environment.\n\nVarious initiatives such as sewage treatment plants, recycling of industrial wastewater, bag-house, WHRS and extensive plantation and creation of green belts have been undertaken by your Company to de-risk and protect the environment.\n\nApart from a targeted reduction of CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 by 27% and Scope 2 by 69% by 2032), your Company's risk mitigation strategy includes a change in product mix, energy ef/ficiency, use of alternative fuels and raw materials, WHRS and the increased use of renewable energy. Your Company has also adopted measures such as rainwater harvesting and water recharge that help it overcome challenges related to water availability.\n\n## Climate and Sustainability\n\nSustainability-related climate change risks and opportunities are assessed in line with your Company's risk management policy and have been integrated in its multi-disciplinary Risk Management Framework. Classi/fied as ESG risks, these relate to energy, emissions and water, among other issues. Sectoral review and relevant stakeholder interactions are conducted regularly to develop a list of climate-related risks speci/fic to business and location. Identi/fied risks are then mapped to your Company's risk matrix, which classi/fies the risk according to its impact and likelihood.\n\nPrioritised climate risks are managed through Unit-level committees. Unit and Functional Heads are responsible for identifying risks, developing mitigation plans, updating and reviewing their respective risk registers as per the de/fined process. The consolidated risk report is submitted to the Board-level committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report and Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)\n\nScenario based analysis has been conducted for physical as well as transition risks. For physical risks, four scenarios have been considered that are linked to Representative Concentration Pathway ('RCP'), which is a GHG concentration trajectory adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ('IPCC'). These include RCP 8.5, RCP 6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 scenarios. The pathways describe four possible climate futures on the basis of the volume of GHG emitted in the coming years. All four scenarios have been considered to assess the impact of temperature and precipitation changes in areas where your Company operates. Maximum possible impact has been considered based on projections up to the year 2100.\n\nYour Company has conducted risk assessment exercise to identify climate-related physical and transition risks. Risks are assessed based on the de/fined time horizons over short term (0-3 years), medium term (3-10 years) and long term (10-30 years). The categorisation of risks into physical and transition risks has been done in alignment with TCFD guidelines.\n\nIn case of assessing the impact of transition risks on your Company, scenario analysis has been conducted in alignment with ETP B2DS and IPCC 1.5-degree scenarios. The potential impact of the evolution of climate policies has been considered under both scenarios to assess the resilience of your Company, as well as the potential pathways for decarbonisation so that it can comply with policy mechanisms such as emission trading schemes.\n\nProduct mix is an important variable in managing climaterelated risks. Your Company is not only focused on developing sustainable products but also aims to embed sustainability in the entire construction value chain. As many as 73 UltraTech products are certi/fied by GreenPro, the largest Ecolabel in India, which enables end users in the built environment sector to choose sustainable materials for reducing the environmental impact during construction, operation as well as use phase of buildings.\n\n## Your Company's approach is highlighted below:\n\n- \u00b7  Enhancing resilience of the building sector: Extreme weather events due to climate change, such as /floods, cyclones and heat waves, may impact the building sector considerably. To mitigate the impact of physical risks on the building sector and society at large, your Company is working with the built environment sector to make buildings more resilient to climate change effects.\n- \u00b7  Your Company is committed to developing products and solutions that reduce carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle of the built environment sector. It offers building products and solutions that lead to optimisation\n\n- of concrete mixing, improving overall quality and strength of construction, and thus alleviating the impact of physical risks.\n- \u00b7  Your Company has introduced many new products that are designed to make buildings more resilient to dampness.\n\nThis also leads to reduced wear and tear of buildings, increasing longevity, thereby reducing the use of input materials and natural resources during their entire lifetime.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nAcute physical risks: Such risks can potentially impact sales volumes because of disruption of business operations due to interruption in supply chain, rise in logistics costs, power outage, infrastructure damages and manpower shortage among other aspects.\n\nFew sites of your Company have been exposed to extreme weather events during the last few years, such as /floods and cyclones. In the last three years, sites located in Bhubaneswar, Chennai and Gujarat have been impacted due to extreme weather events. Some of your Company's sites are in geographies that are susceptible to periodic heat waves.\n\nHowever, your Company has implemented several measures to mitigate the impact of physical risks.\n\nGiven its pan-India presence, your Company's sites are highly diversi/fied geographically. If a manufacturing plant faces business disruption or shutdown due to extreme weather events, alternative plants in other locations can serve the market need. Also, its wide logistics network, with warehouses across different parts of the country, enable /flexibility in your Company's operations.\n\nAnnual weather forecasts are considered in supply chain decisions in order to mitigate the risk of delays in sourcing of fuels. Your Company has developed strategic partnerships with geographically diverse global vendors for fuels. Regular monitoring of environmental, political and regulatory developments, coupled with /flexible contracts mitigate risks of supply chain disruptions. Inventory norms for fuels are periodically reviewed considering probability and expected impact of likely supply chain disruptions due to above developments. Insurance coverage is in place to protect against damages to business assets or loss of material in warehouses due to extreme weather events.\n\nYour Company has not witnessed any impact of heat waves on its facilities. Nevertheless, it ensures that its employees are protected during peak summer days. It is committed to the WASH Pledge, ensuring adequate availability of safe drinking water to workers. Warehouses",

Risk mitigation measures have largely insulated your Company from the impact of extreme weather events.\n\n## Chronic physical risks\n\nYour Company's vast geographical presence makes it vulnerable to long-term chronic physical risks, such as variation in temperature, precipitation and water scarcity. Potential impact of variation in temperature and precipitation patterns has been assessed through scenario analysis across all four scenarios. Less than a quarter of your Company's cement plants are in sites with extremely high water-stress, combined with a projected long-term decrease in precipitation patterns.\n\nYour Company has implemented several measures which protect the business from the identi/fied chronic risks. Rainwater harvesting systems have also been installed across sites. Harvested rainwater is either used within the sites or recharged into the ground for raising groundwater levels. In addition, your Company's manufacturing sites are Zero Liquid Discharge ('ZLD') and they reuse 100% of treated water within the sites. As a result, nearly 43 out of 58 sites are water positive. The endeavour is to make all sites water positive, enabling your Company to be futureready for mitigating risks of water stress.\n\n## Transitional risks\n\nEmerging climate-related regulations and carbon pricing mechanisms may /financially impact business in the long run. For example, Emission Trading Scheme ('ETS') and Carbon Tax have been adopted in several geographies around the world. India has committed to reducing its emission intensity by 33-35% by 2030 and is on track to achieve this target /five years in advance (2025). National level commitments may, in the future, cascade down to various industry sectors through the introduction of new climate change policies. The estimated impact of a policy such as ETS on your Company is estimated to be less than 1% of EBITDA, considering commitments already made to decarbonise the business.\n\nYour Company is prepared to mitigate emerging risks pertaining to climate change policy changes through its existing voluntary GHG reduction targets which are SBTi validated, sustainability-linked bonds, its commitment to the GCCA announced '2050 Climate Ambition' and so on.\n\nDelay in adopting low-carbon technologies may lead to increased indirect operating costs. This could be through early retirement of existing assets. Your Company has strategically reduced its dependence on coal-based power generation and is focused on increasing the share of WHRS and renewable energy. Further, initiatives to utilise waste or by-products from other industries, and reducing clinker ratio are driving down emissions intensity. There are also efforts to track the technology and cost trends in emerging areas such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage ('CCUS'), and hydrogen and kiln electri/fication. Also, your Company is committed to aligning with the Paris Agreement Goals and is judiciously monitoring climate change performance at the Board-level, Unit-level and across all relevant functions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Information Technology Risks\n\nThis comprises risks related to Information Technology ('IT') systems; data integrity and physical assets. Your Company deploys IT systems, including ERP, SCM, Data Historian, and Mobile Solutions to support its business processes, communications, sales, logistics, and production. Risks could primarily arise from the unavailability of systems and/or loss or manipulation of information. To mitigate these risks, your Company uses backup procedures and stores information at two different locations. Systems are upgraded regularly with the latest security standards. For critical applications, security policies and procedures are updated periodically, and users are educated on adherence to the policies to eliminate data leakages.\n\n## Talent Management\n\nYour Company's growth has been driven by its ability to attract and retain top-quality talent while effectively engaging them in the right jobs. The risks in talent management are mitigated by following a policy of being an employer of choice and inculcating a sense of belonging. Specialised training courses are adopted to enhance and reskill employees to prepare them for future roles and create a talent pipeline.\n\n## Pandemic-linked Disruptions in Global Markets\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak caused a huge impact on people's lives, families and communities. Your Company continues to update and expand its crisis management and business continuity plans with an emphasis on employees, customers, supply chain, contacts, other stakeholders and business assets.\n\n## Geopolitical tension\n\nThe rising fuel prices in the wake of geopolitical tensions have had an adverse impact on the cost of manufacturing cement owing to increased raw material, fuel and energy costs. For your Company's business, raw material, fuel and logistics account for a major share of the manufacturing cost. The anticipated rise in the procurement of raw materials and high consumption of energy is likely to lead to the need for prioritising local dependence for raw material and energy ful/filment in order to mitigate the disruption caused due to such global geopolitical tension.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND THEIR ADEQUACY\n\nYour Company has put in place adequate internal control systems that are commensurate with the size of its operations. Internal control systems comprising policies and procedures are designed to ensure sound management\n\nof your Company's operations, safekeeping of its assets, optimal utilisation of resources, reliability of its /financial information, and compliance.

        "page_content": "## Annexure VII\n\nUltraTech Cement Limited ('the Company') an Aditya Birla Group Company adopts/shall adopt this Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy as applicable across Group Companies. This philosophy / policy is detailed below.\n\n## Aditya Birla Group: Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy\n\nAt the Aditya Birla Group, we expect our executive team to foster a culture of growth and entrepreneurial risk-taking. Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy supports the design of programs that align executive rewards including incentive programs, retirement bene/fit programs, promotion and advancement opportunities - with the longterm success of our stakeholders.\n\n## Our business and organisational model\n\nOur Group is a conglomerate and organised in a manner such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure. This results in uniformity of business processes and systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary customer experiences.\n\n## I. Objectives of the Executive Remuneration Program\n\nOur executive remuneration program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success and thereby build value for our shareholders.\n\nOur executive remuneration program is intended to:\n\n- 1. Provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements to our executives on a holistic basis.\n- 2. Emphasise 'Pay for Performance' by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed Group, business and individual goals.\n\n## II. Executives\n\nOur Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy applies to the following:\n\n- 1. Directors of the Company.\n- 2. Key Managerial Personnel: Chief Executive Of/ficer and equivalent (eg: Deputy Managing Director), Chief Financial Of/ficer and Company Secretary.\n\n## III.    Business and Talent Competitors\n\nWe benchmark our executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of similar size. In addition, we look at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and levels across the Group are broadly equitable and support the Group's global mobility objectives for executive talent. Secondary reference points bring to the table, the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and industries, to appreciate the differences in levels and medium of pay and build in as appropriate for decision making.\n\n## IV.   Executive Pay Positioning\n\nWe aim to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to our executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and bene/fits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive payouts at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognise the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience of incumbents while positioning our executives.\n\nWe use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should re/flect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector.\n\n## V. Executive Pay-Mix\n\nOur executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Bene/fits.\n\n## Annual Incentive Plan:\n\nWe tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant /financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. We annually align the /financial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for the business.\n\n- 3. Senior Management: as may be decided by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Performance Goal Setting\n\nWe aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic.\n\nThreshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall re/flect a base-line level of performance, re/flecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement.\n\nTarget performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance.\n\nMaximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, re/flecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement.\n\n## VII.   Executive Benefits and Perquisites\n\nOur executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee bene/fit plans. In addition to these broadbased plans, they are eligible for perquisites and bene/fits plans commensurate with their roles. These\n\nbene/fits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group.\n\n## Other Remuneration Elements\n\nEach of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for our executives including continuity of service across the Group Companies.\n\nWe limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and generally do not provide for any tax grossups for our executives.\n\n## Risk and Compliance\n\nWe aim to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration programs for factors such as, remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives, uncapped pay- outs, unreasonable goals or thresholds, steep payout cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds.\n\n## Claw back Clause\n\nIn an incident of restatement of /financial statements, due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules made thereafter, we shall recover from our executives, the remuneration received in excess, of what would be payable to him / her as per restatement of /financial statements, pertaining to the relevant performance year.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination, Remuneration and Compensation Committee in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy. These services will be established through 'arm's length', agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.",

        "page_content": "## Social Report\n\n## Water: Our Eternal Lifeline\n\n'Water, the life force for humanity, is the absolutely essential building block. It is the central piece for our planet. Recount Leonardo da Vinci, who said, 'Water is the driver of nature'.\n\nWater and decent sanitation are inextricably linked to all development processes. International agencies such as UNICEF, United Nations University, United Nations Sustainable Development Report, among others record that, water scarcity impairs over 40% of the global population and 2.4 billion people do not have access to basic sanitation services. Sadly, every year 300,000 children succumb to water borne diseases. It augurs well that Goal-6 of SDG focuses on clean water and sanitation. It underpins other SDGs as well. Water is the lifeline, any which way.\n\nBy and large the UNSDGs, viewed in totality are a revolutionary leap, a kind of wake-up call to every nation to pay close attention to people largely from the vulnerable sector and the planet. It has heightened sensitivities across 193 countries. A shot in the arm of the move towards a fair and equitable society, the UNSDGs have an appealing logic.\n\nAt our Aditya Birla Group, our underlying motto in our CSR engagement has always been to engage, uplift and empower communities, and in doing so perpetually be a force for good and enriched lives. We are heavily invested in healthcare, education, sustainable livelihood and infrastructure development. Water is the pivotal force that propels our projects in business and beyond. It is the most critical resource. Its sustainable management is of immense importance for our business community. So the SDG Goal-6 is of great signi/ficance to us.\n\nClimate change, dwindling ecosystems, exploitation of natural resources besides pollution, have accelerated the stress on water resources in terms of its availability and quality. While the report spells out all of your Company's CSR engagements, for any progress, availability of water is the most critical factor. Towards building water resilience, our businesses at Aditya Birla Group have taken a comprehensive stepwise approach both inside the location boundaries as well as in the watersheds of our operation. We have put in place our Water Stewardship Policy championed by our Group Chairman, Business Directors/CEOs and other seniors. This aims at protection and conservation of water resources through excellent water management practices and governance systems and is being operationalised through performance targets and roadmaps across our sites.\n\nWhen one thinks of water in the hinterland of India with its rugged pathways, the picture that immediately surfaces in the mind's eye is that of a woman with pitcher on her head, trudging miles on end to fetch it. Today, the scenario is very different. In quite a few of the 9,000 villages that we work in, we have met this arduous task of ensuring water availability for households and farmers. The Government has rightfully given access to water in rural areas, the primacy it deserves. The plan is to provide tap water for all under the 'Har Ghar, Nal Se Jal' scheme. The scheme's dashboard reports that over 5.6 crore homes now have water on tap.\n\nAn integrated aggressive watershed management programme implemented as part of our CSR engagement has yielded rich dividends as well. Its components include water harvesting structures: construction of check-dams, instituting tube wells, tanks and water reservoirs. Side-by-side rainwater harvesting, including rooftops, reinventing step-wells, lakes (talaos), wells (bowris), soil conservation, refurbishing aquatic ecosystems, setting up reverse osmosis plants and water ATMs, have brought much succour to a water starved populace pan India. Besides the admirable Government support, we partner extensively with development agencies such as NABARD, MYRADA, ICRISAT and AFPRO on the technical side, among others. The water conserved annually is over 33 billion litres, of which your Company has conserved 1.55 billion litres. Water user groups are formed at the plants to make sure that eventually the villagers become self-reliant. There is a sense of joy and lightness among them. Numbers mean a lot, but smiles mean a lot more.\n\nIn the words of our visionary Prime Minister, 'Jal hai toh kal hai'.\n\n## Rajashree Birla\n\nChairperson,\n\nAditya Birla Centre for Community Initiatives and Rural Development\n\nChairperson, UltraTech Cement Limited Corporate Social Responsibility Committee",

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone /financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of reports of one of the joint auditors referred to in the 'Other Matters' section below is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone /financial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of matter\n\nWe draw attention to Note 33(b) of the standalone /financial statements, which refers to the orders dated 31 August 2016 (Penalty of ' 1,449.51 crores) and 19 January 2017 (Penalty of ' /uni00A068.30 crores) of the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against which the Company had /filed appeal. Upon the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ('NCLAT') disallowing its appeal against the CCI order dated 31 August 2016, the Company has /filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which has by its order dated 5 October 2018, granted a stay against the NCLAT order. Consequently, the Company has deposited an amount of ' /uni00A0144.95 crores equivalent to 10% of the penalty of ' /uni00A01,449.51 crores recorded as asset. The Company, backed by legal opinions, believes that it has a good case in both the matters basis which no provision has been recognised in the books of account. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of these matters.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the standalone /financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

Due to a complex regulatory environment, there is an inherent risk of litigations and claims.\n- \u00b7 Consequently, provisions and contingent liability disclosures may arise from indirect tax proceedings, legal proceedings, including regulatory and other government/ department proceedings, as well as investigations by authorities and commercial claims.\n- \u00b7 The Company applies signi/ficant judgement in estimating the likelihood of the future outcome in each case and in determining the provisions or disclosures required for each matter.\n- \u00b7 Resolution of tax and legal proceedings may span over multiple years due to the highly complex nature and magnitude of the legal matters involved and may involve protracted negotiation or litigation.\n- \u00b7 These estimates could change signi/ficantly over time as new facts emerge and each legal case progresses.\n- \u00b7 Given the inherent complexity and magnitude of potential exposures and the judgement necessary to estimate the amount of provisions required or to determine required disclosures, this is a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 We have assessed the Company's accounting policies relating to revenue, discounts, incentives and rebates by comparing with applicable accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 We have assessed the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of Company's internal controls over the provisions, approvals and disbursements of discounts, incentives and rebates.\n- \u00b7 We have assessed the Company's computations for accrual of discounts, incentives and rebates, on a sample basis, and compared the accruals made with the approved schemes and underlying documents.\n- \u00b7 We have veri/fied, on a sample basis, the underlying documentation for discounts, incentives and rebates recorded and disbursed during the year.\n- \u00b7 We have compared the historical trend of payments and reversal of discounts, incentives and rebates to provisions made to assess the current year accruals.\n- \u00b7 We have examined the manual journals posted to discounts, rebates and incentives to identify unusual or irregular items.\n\n## Our audit procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 We understood the processes, evaluated the design and implementation of controls and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the recording and re-assessment of uncertain legal positions, claims (including claims receivable) and contingent liabilities.\n- \u00b7 We have gained an understanding of outstanding litigations against the Company from the Company's inhouse legal counsel and other key managerial personnel who have knowledge of these matters.\n- \u00b7 We have read the correspondence between the Company and the various indirect tax/legal authorities and the legal opinions of external legal advisors, where applicable, for signi/ficant matters.\n- \u00b7 We have tested the completeness of the litigations and claims by examining, on a sample basis, the Company's legal expenses and minutes of the board meetings.\n- \u00b7 We have challenged the Company's estimate of the possible outcome of the disputed cases based on applicable indirect tax laws and legal precedence by involving our tax specialists.\n- \u00b7 We have assessed the adequacy of the Company's disclosures in respect of contingent liabilities for indirect tax and legal matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the Company's annual report, but does not include the standalone /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone /financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone /financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed and based on the work done/ audit report of one of the joint auditors, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

        "page_content": "## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7  Obtain suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial statements of Trust of the Company to express an opinion on the standalone /financial statements. For the Trust included in the standalone /financial statements, which have been audited by one of the joint auditors, such joint auditor remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in paragraph (a) of the section titled 'Other Matters' in this audit report.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone /financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone /financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the standalone /financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and ef/ficient conduct of its business, including adherence to Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements were established and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements included obtaining an understanding of such internal /financial controls, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nA Company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of /financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the",

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial controls with reference to standalone /financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## For B S R & Co.

Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not affect this classi/fication.\n\nAll other liabilities are classi/fied as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classi/fied as non-current only.\n\n## (c) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\n\nThe initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the assets's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf signi/ficant parts of an item of PPE have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\nMaterial items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and service equipment are classi/fied as PPE when they meet the de/finition of PPE as speci/fied in Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of PPE is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nPPE except freehold land are stated at their cost of acquisition/installation or construction net of accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n\nExpenditure during construction period:\n\nExpenditure/ Income during construction period (including /financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-in-Progress, and the same is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of their construction. Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other non-current Assets'.\n\n## (d) Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II to the Act or as per technical assessment. Freehold Land with inde/finite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Company, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Company.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Company uses different useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic bene/fits from those classes of assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of such item of intangible asset and are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (f) Assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale:\n\nThe Company classi/fies assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and its sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities held for sale' respectively. Once classi/fied as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.",

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identi/fied, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identi/fied.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/finite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n- Valued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the /finished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n- \u00b7   Work-in- progress (WIP), finished goods, stockin-trade and trial run inventories:\n- Valued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods, WIP and trial run inventories includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of Stock-in Trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n- \u00b7   Waste / Scrap:\n- Waste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n- Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## (i) Employee Share based payments:\n\nEquity- settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the employee stock options at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.\n\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is amortised over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss such that the cumulative expense re/flects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee bene/fits reserve.\n\nFor Stock Appreciation Rights ('SARs') which are cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of liability is recognised for the services acquired over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the payment. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on the fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (j) Treasury  Shares:\n\nThe Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing the Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (k) Borrowing  Costs:\n\nGeneral and speci/fic borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset is ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost incurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange difference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n## (l) Government  Grants:\n\nGovernment grants, related to assets, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with VAT / GST payment, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nThe bene/fit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates and is being recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (m)   Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out/flow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash /flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci/fic to the liability.

However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in /financial statements, where an in/flow of economic bene/fits is probable.\n\n## (n) Mines Restoration Provision:\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The costs are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to re/flect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a /finance cost in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (o) Revenue  Recognition:\n\n- (i) Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n- \u00b7   Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that re/flects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n- \u00b7   Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable taking into account the amount of discounts,\n\nincentives, volume rebates, and outgoing taxes on sales. Any amounts receivable from the customer are recognised as revenue after the control over the goods sold are transferred to the customer which is generally on dispatch/delivery of goods.\n\n- \u00b7   Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a signi/ficant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7   Signi/ficant /financing component - Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a signi/ficant /financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n- (ii) Dividend income is accounted for when the right to receive the income is established.\n- (iii) Interest income is recognised using the Effective Interest Method.\n\n## (p) Lease:\n\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset, the Company assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identi/fied asset;\n- (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic bene/fits from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe ROU is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises /fixed payments, including in-substance /fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except those which are payable other than functional currency which is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU, or is recorded in Statement of\n\nPro/fit or Loss if the carrying amount of the ROU has been reduced to zero.\n\nLease Liabilities have been presented as separate line and the 'ROU' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classi/fied as /financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Company has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash /flows are classi/fied as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classi/fied as a /finance or operating lease by reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (q) Employee  benefits:\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans:\n\nFor de/fined bene/fit plans, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out by a quali/fied independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is re/flected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense on the plan amendment or when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement, is recognized immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit or Loss when the plan amendment or when a curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.

The Company provides bene/fits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as de/fined contribution plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit plan, payable to the employees is the based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the services of the Company and is in accordance with the Rules of the Company for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment. Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net de/fined bene/fit liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. De/fined bene/fit costs are categorised as follows:\n\nservice cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);net interest expense or income; and re-measurement.\n\nThe present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. The de/fined bene/fit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual de/ficit or surplus in the Company's de/fined bene/fit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic bene/fits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Company are eligible for participation in de/fined contribution plans such superannuation and national pension fund. Contributions towards these funds are recognized as an expense periodically based on the contribution by the Company, since Company has no further obligation beyond its periodic contribution.\n\n## Provident  Fund\n\nThe eligible employees of the Company are entitled to receive bene/fits in respect of provident fund, which is a de/fined bene/fit plan, for which both the employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the covered employees' salary. The contributions as speci/fied under the law are made to the approved provident fund which is set up by the Company. The Company is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government speci/fied minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognised for bene/fits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee bene/fits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the bene/fits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee bene/fits are measured using the projected unit credit method by a quali/fied independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period, at the present value of the estimated future cash out/flows expected to be made by the Company in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. With reference to some employees, liability of other /fixed long-term employee bene/fits is recognised at the present value of the future cash out/flows expected to be made by the Company.\n\nRemeasurement gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (r) Income  Taxes:\n\nIncome Tax expenses comprise current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.\n\nCurrent Tax is measured on the basis of estimated taxable income for the current accounting period in accordance with the applicable tax rates and the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and other applicable tax laws.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax asset are recognised for deductible temporary differences,\n\n<!-- image -->",

Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credits are in the form of unused tax credits that are carried forward by the Company for a speci/fied period of time, hence it is grouped with Deferred Tax Asset. MAT is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the speci/fied period.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis.

The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for treasury shares.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net pro/fit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares and is adjusted for the treasury shares held by the Company to satisfy the exercise of the share options by the employees.\n\n## (t) Foreign Currency transactions:\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.

Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the statement of Pro/fit and Loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nIdenti/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when, there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated /first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other\n\nassets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in Statement of Pro/fit or Loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Company determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identi/fied all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identi/fied, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the Business combination as a bargain purchase, the Company recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as Capital Reserve.\n\nContingent consideration is classi/fied either as equity or /financial liability. Amount classi/fied as /financial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## Note 1(C) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe preparation of the Company's /financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements\n\n## (a) Critical judgments in applying accounting policies:\n\nIn the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most signi/ficant effect on the amounts recognised in the /financial statements.\n\n- (i) Classification of Madanpur (North) Coal Company Private Limited as Investment in an Associate:\n\nA Joint Venture Company (JV) 'Madanpur (North) Coal Company Private Limited' was formed by allocatees of Madanpur North Coal Block. As per Ind AS 111, when all the parties, or a group of parties, considered collectively, are able to direct the activities that signi/ficantly affect the returns of the arrangement (i.e. the relevant activities), the parties control the arrangement collectively. Also, joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties. In terms of the JV agreement between the parties, each JV partner has right to nominate one director on the board of JV and major decisions shall be taken by a majority of 75% of the directors present. Since there is no unanimous consent required from the parties, in the judgement of the management the Company does not have joint control over the JV. However, considering the Company's representation in the board and the extent of its ability to exercise the in/fluence over the decision over the relevant activities, the JV has been considered as an associate and accounted under the equity method.\n\n## (b) Key  assumptions:\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a signi/ficant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the /financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are re/flected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n- (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n- The Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/ component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n- (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable pro/fit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fits and business developments.\n\n- (iii) Income  Taxes:\n\nThe Company calculates income tax expense based on reported income and estimated exemptions / deduction likely available to the Company. The Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Company has applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to realised or settled in the future when the Company may be subject to lower tax rate based on the future /financials projections.\n\n- (iv) Fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of /financial assets and /financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are\n\n<!-- image -->",

Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (v) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe cost of the de/fined bene/fit gratuity plan, provident fund and other post-employment medical bene/fits and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a de/fined bene/fit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n## (vi) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.\n\n## (vii) Share-based  payments:\n\nThe Company measures the cost of equitysettled transactions with employees using BlackScholes model and cash settled transactions with employees using binomial tree model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\nThis estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\n\nThe assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 43.\n\n## (viii)  Litigation and contingencies:\n\nThe Company has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities. Where an out/flow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management's assessment of speci/fic circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the /financial statements.\n\n## (ix) Business  Combination:\n\n- (a)  Fair Valuation of Intangibles:\n\n## Mining Rights:\n\nThe Company has used royalty saved method for value analysis of limestone mining rights. The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Company, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## Brand:\n\nThe Company has used relief from royalty method for value analysis of Brand. The method estimates the value as the present value of the after-tax projected revenues cash /flows attributable to the Brand value.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk associated with the Brand Name.\n\n- (b)   Fair Valuation of Tangibles:\n\n## Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of similar plots of land, circle rates provided by department of revenue and general market intelligence based on the size of land parcel.",

In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## (x) Classification of Lease Ind AS 116:\n\nInd AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any signi/ficant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Company's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term re/flects the current economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate speci/fic to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In particular, this exposes the Company to actuarial risk such as adverse salary growth, change in demographic experience, inadequate return on underlying plan assets. This may result in an increase in cost of providing these bene/fits to employees in future. Since the bene/fits are lump sum in nature, the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.\n\n## (b) Pension:\n\nThe Company considers pension for some of its employees at senior management based on the period of service and contribution for the Company.

Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset liability matching strategy.\n\nThere is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully prefund the liability of the Plan.

The inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of /financial instruments are:\n\n- Level 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of all bonds which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date.\n- Level 2: The fair value of /financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (For example traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on company speci/fic estimates. The mutual fund units are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all signi/ficant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n- Level 3: If one or more of the signi/ficant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main purpose of these /financial liabilities is to /finance the Company's operations. The Company's principal /financial assets, other than derivatives include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.\n\nThe Company's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of /financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the /financial performance of the Company. The Company uses derivative /financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity /fixed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.\n\n## The sources of risks that the Company is exposed to and their management is given below:\n\n| Risk            | Risk                  | Exposure Arising From                                                                                         | Management                                                                                                  | Management                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| I)  Market Risk | I)  Market Risk       |                                                                                                               |                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                         |\n| A)              | Currency Risk         | Committed commercial transaction Financial asset and Liabilities not  denominated in INR                      | (a)   Forward foreign exchange contracts (b)   Foreign currency options (c)   Principal only/Currency swaps | Foreign  Cash Flow Forecasting Sensitivity Analysis                                                                                     |\n| B)              | Interest  Rate  Risk  | Long Term Borrowings at variable rates Investments in Debt Schemes of Mutual  Funds and Other Debt Securities | (a)   Interest Rate swaps, Coupon only  swaps (b)  Portfolio  Diversi/fication                              | Sensitivity Analysis,  Interest rate movements                                                                                          |\n| C)              | Commodity  Price Risk | Movement in prices of commodities  mainly Imported Thermal Coal and Pet  Coke                                 | (b)                                                                                                         | Sensitivity Analysis,  Commodity price tracking (a)   Commodity Fixed Prices Swaps/Options                                              |\n|                 | II)   Credit Risk     | Trade receivables, Investments,  Derivative Financial instruments, Loans  and Bank balances                   |                                                                                                             | Ageing analysis, Credit  Rating (a)   Diversi/fication of mutual fund  investments, (b)   Credit limit & credit worthiness  monitoring, |\n|                 |                       |                                                                                                               |                                                                                                             | (c)   Criteria based approval process                                                                                                   |\n\nThe Company has standard operating procedures and investment policy for deployment of surplus liquidity, which allows investment in debt securities, /fixed deposits and mutual fund schemes of debt categories only and restricts the exposure in equity markets.\n\nCompliances of these policies and principles are reviewed by the internal auditors/internal risk management committee on periodical basis.\n\nThe Corporate Treasury team updates the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis about the implementation of the above policies. It also updates the Risk Management Committee of the Company on periodical basis about the various risks to the business and status of various activities planned to mitigate the risks.\n\n## (I) Market Risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive /financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint venture in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated /financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of reports of the other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) of the 'Other Matters' section below, is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of matter\n\n- (a) We draw attention to Note 37(b) of the consolidated /financial statements which refers to orders dated 31 August 2016 (Penalty of Rs.1,449.51 crores) and 19 January 2017 (Penalty of Rs.68.30 crores) of the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against which the Company had /filed appeal. Upon the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ('NCLAT') disallowing its appeal against the CCI order dated 31 August 2016, the Company has /filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which has by its order dated 5 October 2018, granted a stay against the NCLAT order. Consequently, the Company. has deposited an amount of Rs.144.95 crores equivalent to 10% of the penalty of Rs. 1,449.51 crores recorded as asset. The Company, backed by legal opinions, believes that it has a good case in both the matters basis which no provision has been recognised in the books of account. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of these matters.\n- (b) We draw attention to Note 37(b) of the consolidated /financial statements, where in case of UltraTech Nathdwara Cement Limited ('UNCL'), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, one of the joint auditors of the Company has audited the /financial statements and without modifying their opinion on the audited consolidated /financial statements of UNCL for the year ended 31 March 2022 reported that the Order dated 31 August 2016 (penalty of Rs. 167.32 crores) was passed by the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against which UNCL had /filed appeal. Upon the NCLAT disallowing its appeal against the CCI order dated 31 August 2016, UNCL /filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which has by its order dated 5 October 2018, granted a stay against the NCLAT order. Consequently, UNCL has deposited an amount of Rs. 16.73 crores equivalent to 10% of the penalty of Rs. 167.32 crores recorded as asset in the consolidated /financial statements.

The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint venture are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated /financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated /financial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated /financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint venture are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal /financial controls with reference to /financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated /financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint venture to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated /financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7  Obtain suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial statements//financial information of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint venture to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the /financial statements//financial information of such entities included in the consolidated /financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated /financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in paragraph (a) of the section titled 'Other Matters' in this audit report.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated /financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A company's internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/flect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of /financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the /financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial controls with Reference to consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal /financial controls with reference to consolidated /financial statements insofar as it relates to /five subsidiary companies and one associate company which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.\n\n## For B S R & Co.

Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not affect this classi/fication.\n\nAll other liabilities are classi/fied as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classi/fied as non-current only.\n\n## (b) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\n\nThe initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, net of any trade discounts and rebates, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic bene/fits associated with the item will /flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf signi/ficant parts of an item of PPE have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\nMaterial items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and service equipment are classi/fied as PPE when they meet the de/finition of PPE as speci/fied in Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of PPE is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nPPE except freehold land are stated at their cost of acquisition/installation or construction net of accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n\n## (c) Expenditure during construction period:\n\nExpenditure/ Income during construction period (including /financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-in-Progress and the same is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of their construction. Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other non-current Assets'.\n\n## (d) Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II to the Act or as per technical assessment. Freehold Land with inde/finite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Company, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Company.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Company uses different useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic bene/fits from those classes of assets. he estimated useful life are reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and its sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets/ Disposal Group held for sale' and 'Liabilities/ Disposal Group held for sale' respectively. Once classi/fied as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.",

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identi/fied, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identi/fied.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/finite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n- Valued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the /finished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n- \u00b7  Work-in-progress (WIP), finished goods, stockin-trade and trial run inventories:\n- Valued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods and WIP includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of Stock-in Trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n- \u00b7  Waste / Scrap:\n- Waste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n- Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## (i) Employee Share based payments:\n\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the employee stock options at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.\n\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is amortised over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (j) Treasury Shares:\n\nThe Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing the Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (k) Borrowing Costs:\n\nGeneral and speci/fic borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset is ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost incurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange difference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n## (l) Government Grants:\n\nGovernment grants, related to assets, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company\n\nrecognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with VAT / GST payment, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nThe bene/fit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates and is being recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (m)   Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out/flow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash /flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci/fic to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss as a /finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to re/flect the current best estimate.\n\nA present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an out/flow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be con/firmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.\n\nClaims against the Company where the possibility of any out/flow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.",

However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in /financial statements, where an in/flow of economic bene/fits is probable.\n\n## (n) Mines Restoration Provision:\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The cost are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to re/flect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance, and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a /finance cost in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n## (o) Revenue Recognition:\n\n- (i) Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n- \u00b7  Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that re/flects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n- \u00b7  Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable taking into account the amount of discounts, incentives, volume rebates and outgoing taxes on sales. Any amounts receivable from the customer are recognised as revenue after the control over the goods sold are transferred to\n- the customer which is generally on dispatch / delivery of goods.\n- \u00b7  Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a signi/ficant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7  Signi/ficant /financing component - Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a signi/ficant /financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n- (ii) Dividend income is accounted for when the right to receive the income is established.\n- (iii) Interest income is recognised using the Effective Interest Method.\n\n## (p) Lease:\n\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fied asset, the Company assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identi/fied asset;\n- (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic bene/fits from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a lease liability at the lease commencement\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe ROU is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises /fixed payments, including in-substance /fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except those which are payable other than functional currency which is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU or is recorded in Statement of Pro/fit or Loss if the carrying amount of the right-ofuse asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n'Lease Liabilities' and 'Right of Use Assets' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classi/fied as /financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Company has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash /flows are classi/fied as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classi/fied as a /finance or operating lease by reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (q) Employee benefits:\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans:\n\nFor de/fined bene/fit plans, the cost of providing bene/fits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out by a quali/fied independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is re/flected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense on the plan amendment or when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement, is recognized immediately in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss when the plan amendment or when a curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe retirement bene/fit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.

The Company provides bene/fits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as de/fined contribution plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a de/fined bene/fit plan, payable to the employees is based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the services of the Company and is in accordance with the Rules of the Company for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment. Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net de/fined bene/fit liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. De/fined bene/fit costs are categorised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);\n- \u00b7  net interest expense or income; and\n- \u00b7  re-measurement\n\nThe present value of the de/fined bene/fit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.

Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic bene/fits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Company are eligible for participation in de/fined contribution plans such as superannuation and national pension fund. Contributions towards these funds are recognized as an expense periodically based on the contribution by the Company, since Company has no further obligation beyond its periodic contribution.\n\n## Provident  Fund\n\nThe eligible employees of the Company are entitled to receive bene/fits in respect of provident fund, which is a de/fined bene/fit plan, for which both the employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a speci/fied percentage of the covered employees' salary. The contributions as speci/fied under the law are made to the approved provident fund which is set up by the Company. The Company is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government speci/fied minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognised for bene/fits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee bene/fits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the bene/fits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee bene/fits are measured using the projected unit credit method by a quali/fied independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period, at the present value of the estimated future cash out/flows expected to be made by the Company in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. With reference to some employees, liability of other /fixed long-term employee bene/fits is recognised at the present value of the future cash out/flows expected to be made by the Company.\n\nRemeasurement gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (r) Income Taxes:\n\nIncome Tax expenses comprise current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.\n\nCurrent Tax is measured on the basis of estimated taxable income for the current accounting period in accordance with the applicable tax rates and the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and other applicable tax laws.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax asset are\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credits are in the form of unused tax credits that are carried forward by the Company for a speci/fied period of time, hence it is grouped with Deferred Tax Asset. MAT is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the speci/fied period.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized except:\n\n- a) When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting pro/fit nor taxable pro/fit or loss; and\n- b) In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable pro/fit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer probable respectively that the related tax bene/fit will be realised.\n\nThe Government of India, on September 20, 2019, vide the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019, inserted a new Section 115BAA in the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides an option to the Company for paying Income Tax at reduced rates as per the provisions/conditions de/fined in the said section. The Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Company has estimated and applied the lower income tax rate on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realized or settled in the future period when the Company may be subjected to lower tax rate.\n\n## (s) Earnings Per Share:\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is computed by dividing the net pro/fit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for treasury shares.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net pro/fit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares and is adjusted for the treasury shares held by the Company to satisfy the exercise of the share options by the employees.\n\n## (t) Foreign Currency transactions:\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.

The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into INR at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are recognized in OCI and accumulated in equity (as exchange differences on translating the /financial statements of a foreign operation), except to the extent that the exchange differences are allocated to NCI.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, signi/ficant in/fluence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to that foreign operation recognized in OCI is reclassi/fied to Statement of Pro/fit and Loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /financial assets or /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss are charged to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss over the tenure of the /financial assets or /financial liabilities.\n\nClassification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets\n\nThe Company classi/fies /financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVOCI') or Fair Value through Pro/fit or Loss ('FVTPL') on the basis of following:\n\n- \u00b7  the entity's business model for managing the /financial assets and\n- \u00b7  the contractual cash /flow characteristics of the /financial asset.\n\n## Amortised  Cost:\n\nA /financial asset shall be classi/fied and measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7  the /financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold /financial assets in order to collect contractual cash /flows and\n- \u00b7  the contractual terms of the /financial asset give rise on speci/fied dates to cash /flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nIn case of /financial assets classi/fied and measured at amortised cost, any interest income, foreign exchange gains or losses and impairment are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For /financial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the Company recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated or acquired /financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the /financial asset has not increased signi/ficantly since its initial recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on /financial asset increases signi/ficantly since its initial recognition.\n\nThe Company's trade receivables do not contain signi/ficant /financing component and as per simpli/fied approach, loss allowances on trade receivables are measured using provision matrix at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall.\n\nThe impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nDerecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities:\n\nThe Company derecognises a /financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the /financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /financial asset, the Company continues to recognise the /financial asset and recognises an associated liability for amounts it has to pay.",

The difference between the carrying amount of the /financial liability de-recognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n\nFinancial Guarantee Contract Liabilities\n\nFinancial Guarantee Contract Liabilities are disclosed in /financial statements in accordance with Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\n## (w)  Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insigni/ficant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.\n\n## (x) Financial liabilities and equity instruments:\n\n- \u00b7  Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classi/fied as either /financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the de/finitions of a /financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n- \u00b7  Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.\n\n## (y) Derivative financial instruments:\n\nThe Company enters into derivative /financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Company\n\ndoes not hold derivative /financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash/flow hedge or used in a net investment hedge.\n\n## (z) Hedge accounting:\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk as cash /flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash /flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash /flow hedges is recognised in OCI and accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in pro/fit or loss.\n\nAmounts previously recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to effective portion as described above are reclassi/fied to Statement of Pro/fit or Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects the Statement of Pro/fit or Loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-/financial asset or a non-/financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-/financial asset or non-/financial liability.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer quali/fies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.

Net investment hedges are accounted for similar to cash /flow hedges and accordingly, any foreign exchange differences on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation reserve ('FCTR') so as to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is immediately recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss. The amounts accumulated in equity are included in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss when the foreign operation is disposed or partially disposed.\n\n## (aa)  Segment Reporting: Identification of Segments:\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to make decisions for which discrete /financial information is available. Based on the management approach as de/fined in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.\n\n## (bb) Goodwill:\n\nGoodwill arising out of Consolidation of /financial statements of subsidiaries are tested for impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## (cc)  Cash Flow Statement:\n\nCash /flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net pro/fit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or /financing cash /flows. The cash /flows from operating, investing and /financing activities of the Company are segregated.\n\n## (dd) Business Combination and Goodwill:\n\nThe Company applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Company to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nIdenti/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identi/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when, there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated /first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in pro/fit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Company determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identi/fied all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identi/fied, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the Business combination as a bargain purchase, the Company recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as Capital Reserve.\n\nContingent consideration is classi/fied either as equity or /financial liability. Amount classi/fied as /financial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in statement of pro/fit and loss.\n\n## (ee)  Discontinued Operations:\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations and cash/flows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and\n\n- \u00b7  Is a part of single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n- \u00b7  Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.\n\nClassi/fication as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classi/fied as held for sale, if earlier.\n\nWhen an operation is classi/fied as a discontinued operation, the comparative Statement of Pro/fit and Loss is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.\n\n## Note 1(C) Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe preparation of the Company's /financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\n## (a) Critical judgments in applying accounting policies:\n\nIn the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management has made the following judgments, which have the most signi/ficant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n- (i) Classification of Madanpur (North) Coal Company Private Limited as Investment in an Associate:\n\nA Joint Venture Company (JV) 'Madanpur (North) Coal Company Limited' was formed by allocatees of Madanpur North Coal Block. As per Ind AS 111, when all the parties, or a group of parties, considered collectively, are able to direct the activities that signi/ficantly affect the returns of the arrangement (i.e. the relevant activities), the parties control the arrangement collectively. Also, joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of all the parties. In terms of the JV agreement between the parties, each JV partner has right to nominate one director on the board of JV and major decisions shall be taken by a majority of 75% of the directors present. Since there is no unanimous consent required from the parties, in the judgement of the management the Company does not have joint control over the JV. However, considering the Company's representation in the board and the extent of its ability to exercise the in/fluence over the decision over the relevant activities, the JV has been considered as an associate and accounted under the equity method.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the /financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are re/flected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n- (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n\nThe Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/ component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n\n- (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable pro/fit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fits and business developments.\n\n- (iii) Income Taxes:\n\nThe Company calculates income tax expense based on reported income and estimated exemptions / deduction likely available to the Company. The Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Company has applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred\n\ntax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to realised or settled in the future when the Company may be subject to lower tax rate based on the future /financials projections.\n\n- (iv) Fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of /financial assets and /financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (v) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe cost of the de/fined bene/fit gratuity plan, provident fund and other post-employment medical bene/fits and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a de/fined bene/fit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n- (vi) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.\n\n- (vii)  Share-based payments:\n\nThe Company measures the cost of equitysettled transactions with employees using BlackScholes model and cash settled transactions with employees using binomial tree model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires",

Where an out/flow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management's assessment of speci/fic circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the /financial statements.\n\n## (ix)  Business Combination:\n\n- (a)  Fair Valuation of Intangibles:\n\n## Mining Rights:\n\nThe Company has used royalty saved method for value analysis of limestone mining rights. The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Company, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## Brand:\n\nThe Company has used relief from royalty method for value analysis of Brand. The method estimates the value as the present value of the after-tax projected revenues cash /flows attributable to the Brand value.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk associated with the Brand Name, which is higher than the overall business.\n\n- (b)  Fair Valuation of Tangibles:\n\n## Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of similar plots of land, circle rates provided by department of revenue and general market intelligence based on size of land parcel.\n\n## Leasehold land:\n\nLeasehold land was valued basis the leasehold interest for the remaining duration of the lease.\n\n## Other Assets:\n\nThe cost approach has been adopted for fair valuing all the /fixed assets except vehicles which have been measured at the old book values less depreciation.\n\nThe cost approach includes calculation of depreciated replacement cost using price trends applied to historical cost and capitalisation of all the indirect cost, these trends are on the basis of price indices obtained from recognized sources such as the RBI/ OEA or market intelligence. In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## (x) Disposal Groups:\n\nThe Company has used comparable market multiple approach to assess the fair value of the disposal group.\n\nUnder the market multiple approach, enterprise value of a company is determined by using multiples derived from valuations of comparable companies, as manifested through stock market valuations of listed companies considering Enterprise Value/ Revenue and Enterprise value/\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend\n\nor terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any signi/ficant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Company's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term re/flects the current economic circumstances.

It is utilised in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to issue bonus shares, to provide for premium on redemption of shares or debentures, equity related expenses like underwriting costs, etc.\n- c) Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR): The Company has issued redeemable non-convertible debentures. Accordingly, the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 (as amended), requires the company to create DRR out of pro/fits of the company available for payment of dividend. DRR is required to be created for an amount which is equal to 25% of the value of debentures issued. However, this requirement is no more applicable w.e.f. April 1, 2018 as per the amendment in the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 vide dated August 16, 2019; accordingly the Company has not made any new addition in the said reserve and accounted the reversal of outstanding reserve linked to payment of speci/fic non-convertible debentures.\n- d) General  reserve: The Company has transferred a portion of the net pro/fit of the Company before declaring dividend to general reserve pursuant to the earlier provision of Companies Act, 1956. Mandatory transfer to general reserve is not required under the Act.\n- e) Shares Options Outstanding Reserve: The Company has three share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Company's shares have been granted to certain executives and senior employees. The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration.\n- f) Treasury  Shares: The Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employees Stock Options Scheme, 2018 (ESOS 2018). As per Ind AS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation, Reacquired equity shares of the Company are called Treasury Shares and deducted from equity.\n- g) Cashflow Hedge Reserve: The Company has designated its hedging instruments as cash /flow hedges and any effective portion of cash/flow hedge is maintained in the said reserve. In case the hedging becomes ineffective, the amount is recognised to the Statement of Pro/fit and Loss.\n- h) Exchange differences on translating the financial statements of foreign operations: Exchange variation in Opening Equity Share Capital, Reserves and Surplus, Assets and Liabilities of UltraTech Cement Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, UltraTech Cement Middle East Investments Ltd, PT UltraTech Mining Indonesia and PT UltraTech Investment Indonesia is accounted under this reserve.",

Changes in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## (iii)  Loss of control\n\nWhen the Company loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the Statement of Pro/fit or Loss.\n\n## (iv)  Equity accounted investees\n\nThe Group's interests in equity accounted investees comprise interest in associates and joint venture.\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has signi/ficant in/fluence, but not control or joint control, over the /financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nInterests in associates and joint venture are accounted for using equity method. They are initially recognized at cost which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated /financial statements include the Group's share of pro/fit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees until the date on which signi/ficant in/fluence or joint control ceases.\n\n## (v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nThe /financial statements of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Joint Venture and Associates used in the consolidation procedure are drawn upto the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2022.\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements of the Group and its subsidiary companies are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.

In particular, this exposes the Company to actuarial risk such as adverse salary growth, change in demographic experience, inadequate return on underlying plan assets. This may result in an increase in cost of providing these bene/fits to employee in future. Since the bene/fits are lump sum in nature the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.\n\n## (b) Pension:\n\nThe Company considers pension for some of its employees at senior management based on the period of service and contribution for the Company.

Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset liability matching strategy.\n\nThere is no compulsion on the part of the Group to fully prefund the liability of the Plan. The Group's philosophy is to fund these bene/fits based on its own liquidity and the level of underfunding of the plan.\n\n(xv) The Group's expected contribution during next year is ' 1.43 Crores.

The inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of /financial instruments are:\n\n- Level 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of all bonds which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date.\n- Level 2: The fair value of /financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (For example traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on company speci/fic estimates. The mutual fund units are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all signi/ficant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n- Level 3: If one or more of the signi/ficant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n\n|                                                       | '  in Crores           | '  in Crores           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                       | Fair Value             | Fair Value             |\n| Particulars                                           | As at   March 31, 2022 | As at   March 31, 2021 |\n| Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss |                        |                        |\n| Investments - Level 2                                 | 5,899.52               | 11,804.32              |\n| Investments - Level 3                                 | 71.08                  | 44.99                  |\n| Fair value Hedge Instruments                          |                        |                        |\n| Derivative Assets - Level 2                           | 406.15                 | 469.47                 |\n| Total                                                 | 6,376.75               | 12,318.78              |\n| Fair value Hedge Instruments                          |                        |                        |\n| Derivative Liability - Level 2                        | 10.51                  | 6.34                   |\n| Total                                                 | 10.51                  | 6.34                   |\n\nThe management assessed that the carrying amounts of cash and bank balances, trade receivables, loans, trade payables, cash credits, commercial papers and other /financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:\n\n- (a) The fair values of the quoted investments/units of mutual fund schemes are based on market price/net asset value at the reporting date.\n- (b) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash /flows based on observable yield curves and an appropriate discount factor.\n- (c) The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value determined using forward exchange rates and interest rate curve of the respective currencies.\n- (d) The fair value of currency swap is calculated as the present value determined using forward exchange rates, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and an appropriate discount factor.\n- (e) The fair value of foreign currency option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model.\n- (f) The fair value of the remaining /financial instruments is determined using discounted cash /flow analysis. The discount rates used is based on management estimates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main purpose of these /financial liabilities is to /finance the Group's operations. The Group's principal /financial assets, other than derivatives include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of /financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the /financial performance of the group. The group uses derivative /financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity /fixed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.\n\n## The several sources of risks which the Group is exposed to and their management are given below:\n\n| Risk        | Risk                  | Exposure Arising From                                                                                                                                        | Measurement   | Management                                                                                                  |\n|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| I)          | Market Risk           |                                                                                                                                                              |               |                                                                                                             |\n| A)  Foreign | Currency Risk         | Committed commercial transaction Financial asset and Liabilities not  denominated in INR Cash Flow Forecasting Sensitivity Analysis                          |               | (a)   Forward foreign exchange contracts (b)   Foreign currency options (c)   Principal only/Currency swaps |\n| B)          | Interest  Rate  Risk  | Long Term Borrowings at variable rates Investments in Debt Schemes of Mutual  Funds and Other Debt Securities Sensitivity Analysis,  Interest rate movements |               | (a)   Interest Rate swaps, Coupon only  swaps (b)  Portfolio  Diversi/fication                              |\n| C)          | Commodity  Price Risk | Movement in prices of commodities mainly  Imported Thermal Coal and Pet Coke Sensitivity Analysis,  Commodity price tracking                                 |               | (a)   Commodity Fixed Prices (b)  Swaps/Options                                                             |",

It also updates the Risk Management Committee of the Group on periodical basis about the various risks to the business and status of various activities planned to mitigate the risks.\n\n## I) Market Risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash /flows that may result from a change in the price of a /financial instrument. The value of a /financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive /financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\n## A) Foreign Currency Risk:\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash /flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which /fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of fuels, raw materials & spare parts, capital expenditure, exports of cement and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.\n\nIn Crores\n\n| Outstanding foreign currency exposure (Gross) as at   | March 31, 2022   | March 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Trade and advances receivables                        |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 1.29             | 2.31             |\n| Trade Payables                                        |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 23.03            | 5.21             |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.62             | 0.20             |\n| Others                                                | 0.46             | 0.06             |\n| Borrowings                                            |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 40.00            | 54.64            |\n| Investments                                           |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 25.14            | 25.14            |\n| LKR                                                   | 0.65             | 0.65             |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This derivative is being used to hedge the Group's exposure to AED foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to OCI to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries. There is no ineffectiveness during the year ended March 31, 2022. The Group has not entered into any hedge of net investments in foreign operation during the year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the forward contracts.\n\n| Particulars                                                        | As at  March 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Currency exchange risk hedged                                      | AED to INR              |\n| Nominal amount of hedging instruments                              | AED 661.31 Million      |\n| Maturity date                                                      | March 2023              |\n| Carrying value of hedging instruments (Derivative Assets)          | '  9.19 Cr              |\n| Change in the fair value of the hedging instrument during the year | '  9.19 Cr              |\n| Fair value gain on effective hedge                                 | '  9.19 Cr              |\n\nThe hedging gain recognised in OCI before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for measuring effectiveness. There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the Statement of Pro/fit or Loss.\n\n## D) Commodity price risk management:\n\nCommodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to /fluctuations in coal and pet coke prices linked to various external factors, which can affect the production cost of the Company. Since the Energy costs is one of the primary costs drivers, any /fluctuation in fuel prices can lead to drop in operating margin. To manage this risk, the Company enters into forward covers for imported coal, enter into long-term supply agreement for pet coke, identifying new sources of supply etc. While forward covers are prevailing in the markets for coal but in case of pet coke no such derivative is available; it has to be procured at spot prices. Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management and fuel requirement are monitored by the central procurement team.\n\n## II) Credit Risk Management:\n\nCredit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a /financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a /financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its /financing / investing activities, including deposits with banks//financial institutions, mutual fund investments, and investments in debt securities, foreign exchange transactions and /financial guarantees. The Group has no signi/ficant concentration of credit risk with any counterparty.\n\n## Trade  receivables\n\nTrade receivables are consisting of a large number of customers. The Group has credit evaluation policy for each customer and based on the evaluation credit limit of each customer is de/fined. Wherever the Group assesses the credit risk as high the exposure is backed by either bank guarantee / letter of credit or security deposits.\n\nTotal Trade receivables as on March 31, 2022 is ' 3,071.61 Crores (March 31, 2021: ' 2,571.73 Crores)\n\nThe Group does not have higher concentration of credit risks to a single customer. Single largest customer has total exposure in sales of 2.4% (March 31, 2021: 2.0%) and in receivables of 10.2% (March 31, 2021: 9.5%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

(Refer Note 37(c)).\n\n## III) Liquidity risk management:\n\nLiquidity risk is de/fined as the risk that the Group will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at reasonable price. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining suf/ficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The Group's treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Group's liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash /flows.\n\nThe table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of /financial liabilities and investments held for managing the risk at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments.",

Assignment of the loan was along with securities which included pledge over certain assets and shares of 3B in various forms in favour of UNCL. Since 3B has been in continuous default in servicing the loan, UNCL has enforced its pledge of 3B shares, consequent to which 3B has become a wholly owned subsidiary of UNCL w.e.f. March 12, 2021. The above asset held for sale was recorded at its fair value of ' 741.56 crores as on March 31, 2021 based on an independent valuation report after considering an impairment of ' 271.18 crores for the year ended March 31, 2021.\n\nFurther, during the year ended March 31, 2022, UNCL entered into an agreement with Galata Chemicals Holding Gmbh, Germany ('Galata') as per which Galata along with its af/filiates has made necessary payments to UNCL for the purposes of re/financing the loans given to 3B and acquisition of entire shareholding of UNCL in 3B and UNCL has, inter alia, transferred its entire shareholding in 3B to Galata as on March 31, 2022. Consequent to the transaction, 3B has ceased to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company and recognised ' 159.92 crores as exceptional gain for the year ended March 31, 2022.\n\n- (b) The Company has identi/fied certain assets like Land, Aggregate Mines, Coal Washery, Wagon Tippler, etc. which are available for sale in its present condition. The Company is committed to plan the sale of asset and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated. The Company expects to dispose off these assets in the due course.\n- (c) UCMEIL has identi/fied one of the assets 'Waste Heat Recovery System' (WHRS) which is not useful anymore as it is not productive and not giving the desired result. The realizable value after considering the impairment, scrap and dismantling cost is reclassi/fied as assets for disposal. UCMEIL is committed to plan the sale of this asset, is in the process of discussion with vendors and contractor, and expects the same to be disposed off within the due course.\n\n## Note 56: Revenue (Ind AS 115)\n\n- (A) The Company is primarily in the Business of manufacture and sale of cement and cement related products.
