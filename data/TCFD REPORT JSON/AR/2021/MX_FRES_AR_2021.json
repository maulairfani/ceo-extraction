As we move into 2022, we are continuing to adjust to the labour reform and invest in infrastructure that will make Fresnillo a more resilient business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Having been a member of the Board since 2012, I know that I have the support of a committed Board and management team executing a proven long-term strategy. Under my chairmanship, continuity will be the watchword: we will remain loyal to our core principles, ensuring we always behave in a way that is faithful to our Purpose and contributes to the wellbeing of all stakeholders - including shareholders, our workforce, local communities, suppliers, government authorities and the environment.\n\nBefore turning to our performance for 2021, I would like to pay personal tribute to my father Alberto Baill\u00e8res, who sadly passed away on 2 February 2022, having stepped down as Chairman in April 2021. He chaired Fresnillo with distinction since our listing in London in 2008, though his leadership of the Group extended over half a century. The Board and I believe that the best way to honour his memory is to preserve and build on his legacy of responsibility, integrity and respect - these are not only the values of Fresnillo but also the principles by which my father lived his professional and personal life.\n\n## Delivering on our promises\n\nAs we anticipated, the pandemic again disrupted our activities in 2021, although not to the same extent as the previous year. The introduction of new labour legislation added to the challenges we faced and caused additional disruption during the year, primarily at our underground mines. This meant that silver production fell marginally below guidance, while higher production at Herradura helped us to exceed our guidance for gold production.\n\nWe achieved US$2,703.1 million in total revenue and US$2,847.9 million in adjusted revenue\n\nduring the year. This represented an increase of 11.2% and 9.2% respectively, primarily due to higher prices for silver. Gross profit rose yearon-year by 6.1% to US$936.9 million, primarily driven by higher prices. Cash and other liquid funds increased from US$1,070.4 million to US$1,235.3 million, reflecting the increased cash generated by the mines. Please see pages 58-69 for further details on our financial performance.\n\nOur approach is to remain steady, constant and focused on the long term through the cycles that may impact our business. Our strategy is well established, and our dividend policy remains unchanged. We aim to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. Our goal is to maintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.\n\nWe declared an interim dividend of $9.90 US cents per share, with a final dividend of 24.0 US cents per share, bringing the total for the year to 33.9 US cents per share.\n\n## Living up to our Purpose\n\nOnce again, our Purpose has been at the heart of how we think and act, and it has supported our people and their communities through what were at times difficult and demanding days.\n\nOur Purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold.\n\nThanks in large part to the protocols we introduced in our mines and to the testing and vaccination programme that we continued to support for our people and their communities, we have managed to loosen the grip of the pandemic. We have built on the extensive and unprecedented experience we gained in the previous year, working with the local and federal authorities to enable our people to continue working through the third and fourth waves of Covid-19, albeit with some inevitable restrictions.\n\n' OUR PURPOSE IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELLBEING OF PEOPLE THROUGH THE SUSTAINABLE MINING OF SILVER AND GOLD.'",

They were of course familiar with the words, but since the onset of the pandemic they have witnessed the actions behind those words. Our Purpose is not an empty corporate promise but a way of thinking and acting that guides everything we do and every decision we take, from the mine stope to Boardroom - with the health and safety of our people always our overriding priority.\n\n## Building up our resilience\n\nOur experience with the pandemic has underlined the need for our business, our people and our communities to be resilient to many factors that could affect us. During 2021 we focused on building up our resilience across four key areas.\n\nFor example, we continued to build greater production resilience through the development of our new mine at Juanicipio, which we expect to produce an annual average of 11.7 moz silver and 43.5 koz gold when fully operational. Following construction of the Juanicipio plant on schedule, we expected to be granted approval for connection to the national power grid by\n\nthe end of the year. Unfortunately, this was delayed and as a result we have extended the commissioning timeline by approximately six months to comply with new requirements from the authorities. Future Group production will also be underpinned by the start-up of the new Pyrites plant at Fresnillo. In addition, we continued to invest in efficiency improvements at the Fresnillo mine through a series of infrastructure investments.\n\nOur exploration activities have continued to deliver a more resilient pipeline, with the increased budget for 2021 supporting extensive brownfield activities in the Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n Districts, as well as good progress at Guanajuato.\n\nAcross the business, the support of our workforce has been vital to our past successes and future plans. We rely on our people for their skills and commitment and do everything we can to provide them with rewarding careers. During 2021, one of our greatest challenges was to continue to benefit from a trained and supportive workforce in the face of major legislative change. Mexico's new labour reform law came into effect in September, restricting our ability to subcontract labour. Our response\n\n## ' DURING 2021 WE FOCUSED ON BUILDING UP OUR RESILIENCE ACROSS FOUR KEY AREAS.'\n\nwas to work hard to retain as many of our contractors' people as possible, bringing them in-house to join our unionised employees. This was a demanding and somewhat disruptive process, and I would like to thank everybody involved for their perseverance and patience. Ultimately, we believe that although the move away from outsourcing may be a challenge in the short term, in the medium and long term it will lead to a more cohesive and resilient workforce. The Chief Executive comments further on labour reform in his statement on pages 16-19.\n\nDuring the year, we also supported greater resilience in the communities where our people live, by maintaining our commitment to investment in local healthcare - including providing Covid-19 testing equipment and vaccines - employment, education programmes, capacity building, training and support for local entrepreneurs.\n\n## Board activities\n\nThe Board met regularly through the year and discussed a wide range of matters, from how the Company was supporting vaccination programmes in remote communities to the impact of the new labour reforms.\n\nOne of our most important tasks is to maintain oversight of Fresnillo's culture, and we received regular updates on how our Purpose and values continued to be the beacons that guide our actions. During 2021, we were pleased to see our teams develop a five-hour online training module to promote diversity, equality and inclusion. We comply with the ethnic diversity",

This includes promoting the participation of women in our workforce, with the total percentage of women increasing to 11.0% in 2021 from 9.7% in the previous year. Our Board composition during 2021 meant that we were one of the most gender progressive companies in Mexico according to both the 50/50 Women on Boards Gender Diversity Index and the Women Corporate Directors Foundation.\n\nWorkforce engagement was again a key agenda item for the Board. Bringing workers' voices into the Boardroom enables us to incorporate their perspective into our strategic discussions and decision-making. Our Designated Non-Executive Director (NED) for workforce engagement held two online meetings with unionised and nonunionised employees during the year, gaining valuable insight into strategically important topics such as health, safety, Covid-19, ethical culture, inclusion, and gender equality.\n\nI provide more details of the Board's activities in my introduction to the Governance Report on pages 156-157, including how we supported our people and local communities through the pandemic.\n\n## Board changes\n\nIn April 2021, we announced a number of Board changes that took effect at the AGM in June, including the stepping-down of my father as Chairman of Fresnillo and my subsequent appointment as his successor.\n\nThe Board was delighted to welcome two new Directors at the AGM. H\u00e9ctor Rangel joined us as an independent Non-Executive Director - a position he previously held from April 2008 to January 2009 - and Eduardo Cepeda as a Non-Executive Director. Both Directors have extensive expertise in finance and the business environment in Mexico and have already brought valuable insights to the Board.\n\nH\u00e9ctor is the President of BCP Securities Mexico, a joint venture with BCP Securities LLC, a US investment bank specialising in emerging markets. Prior to this role, he was the Chief Executive Officer of Nacional Financiera S.N.C. and Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior and a member of Mexico's cabinet under President Felipe Calderon. He has wide-ranging corporate and investment banking expertise having held various executive positions with the Grupo Financiero Bancomer from 1991 until 2008, including a tenure as Chairman of the Board. H\u00e9ctor has also been appointed a member of the Audit Committee.\n\nEduardo was President and Senior Country Officer at JP Morgan based in Mexico City from 1993 to 2019. He was also Chief Executive Officer of JP Morgan Wealth Management Latin America from 2009 to 2012.

These included the appointment of Alberto Tiburcio as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, with Charles Jacobs becoming a member of the Nominations Committee. At the same time, I was honoured to succeed my father as Chairman of the Nominations Committee, and as a member of the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThere is an inevitable degree of caution around expectations for 2022 and beyond, with operational challenges being potentially worsened by the pandemic - and the knockon effect on workforce availability - as well as by the ongoing impact following the implementation of the new labour law. However, one thing is certain: we will remain steadfast to our Purpose and will continue to put the health and safety of our people at the centre of every decision.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our people - from those working in the mines to our executive management team for their dedication and expertise during the year. We have increased production, built up our resilience and equipped Fresnillo with the strength and attributes to continue delivering long-term value to all our stakeholders. Together, supported by our culture and guided by our Purpose, we face the future with confidence.\n\n## Alejandro Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Although Covid-19 again cast a shadow over the world, the lessons we learned during 2020 were instrumental in helping Fresnillo minimise the pandemic's impact - keeping our people safe, supporting our efficiency improvement programmes and, ultimately, enabling us to record a creditable performance. While we remain vigilant regarding the evolution of the pandemic and its potential impact on our operations, our teams have adapted well to new protocols and this helped us deliver silver production marginally short of guidance, with gold production exceeding expectations.\n\nTo support the wellbeing of our people and their communities, we continued to engage extensively and play our part as a large employer and supportive neighbour. As a result, we maintained our investment in local healthcare for example by contributing testing equipment and vaccines - as well as in the provision of employment opportunities and education programmes, including an initiative to ensure that families in remote communities could access educational content via the internet while schools were closed due to the pandemic.\n\nEnvironment, Social and Governance (ESG) matters sit at the heart of our Purpose, and in 2021 we further strengthened our commitment by expanding our ESG team. Our first ESG Compliance Manager is now in post - and in the coming months we expect to appoint an ESG Operations Manager based in the mines to provide feedback directly to our senior management.\n\n## Production highlights and price review\n\nWith some restrictions necessitated by the pandemic adding to limited short term disruption as a result of the new labour reforms discussed below, our production of silver fell marginally below guidance while production of gold exceeded forecasts.\n\nTotal silver production was 53.1 moz, in line with the previous year. Higher ore grades at San Juli\u00e1n DOB and, to a lesser extent, the contribution of development ore from Juanicipio, were offset by a lower ore grade and volume at Saucito and Fresnillo.\n\nGold production was down by 2.4% vs. the previous year, to 751.2 koz. This was primarily due to a lower ore grade at Ci\u00e9nega, and a lower ore grade and volume of ore processed at San Juli\u00e1n Veins, partly mitigated by a greater volume of ore processed and a higher ore grade at Noche Buena.\n\nAttributable by-product lead production decreased 10.5% to 56,573 tonnes primarily due to a decrease in volume of ore processed and lower ore grade at Saucito and Fresnillo and a lower ore grade at Ci\u00e9nega, while attributable by-product zinc production decreased 6.9% due to a lower volume of ore processed and ore grade at Saucito and, to a lesser extent, lower ore grade and recovery at Ci\u00e9nega.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease find more details on production at each of our mines on pages 40-57\n\nPrecious metals prices began the year on a high, continuing the trend established in 2020. However, they fell away to an extent during the second half as the global economic uncertainty created by the pandemic receded and investors again sought returns in areas such as equities and crypto currencies. The average realised silver price was US$24.9 per ounce, an increase of 16.9% over 2020, while gold prices remained relatively flat at US$1,795.0 per ounce. Average prices for zinc and lead increased by 31.7% and 21.6% respectively. Please see pages 26-27 for more detail on prices and how they have been influenced by market dynamics.\n\n## Delivering value through a proven strategy\n\nOur strategy has remained unchanged since our earliest days. Tried, tested and proven to deliver long-term shareholder value, it was again the engine room for our performance during 2021. The strategy consists of four distinct pillars:\n\n## Maximising the potential of existing operations\n\nOur ability to drive production was impacted to an extent by Mexico's new labour reform which restricted our ability to subcontract labour. The law came into effect on 1 September 2021, and led to us having to bring a proportion of our contractor workforce into the company as\n\nemployees. Historically, a trained and motivated contractor workforce has been a key aspect of our way of working and the reform has necessitated significant work. While we took steps to prepare following the announcement of the reform in April, subsequent contractor uptake varied. In particular, our underground mines in the Fresnillo District and at Ci\u00e9nega were more affected due to a higher number of contractor personnel working on site, and this led to an increased number of staff vacancies and greater workforce rotation. This in turn affected equipment availability and utilisation rates.\n\nWe continue to take a series of actions to mitigate the impact of the law, including new recruitment campaigns, training and investment in new equipment. These actions are proving effective and we expect to complete the staffing process in the Fresnillo District and Ci\u00e9nega in the third quarter of 2022. Our open pit mines, which have experienced less of an impact, should be fully staffed during the first quarter of 2022. I believe that in the long term the switch to relying on our own resources instead of those of contractors will make Fresnillo a more operationally resilient business. For details of our workforce composition at the end of the year, see page 79.\n\nHome to the Fresnillo and Saucito mines as well as our new mine at Juanicipio, the Fresnillo district is the foundation for the Group's silver production, due to its extensive reserves and resources. As we mine deeper, our challenge is to develop more metres across a greater number of veins and to focus on productivity, cost control and technology investment. We made progress on a number of infrastructure investments during the year, including a new pumping station, and electricity and ventilation infrastrucutre.\n\n' TO SUPPORT THE WELLBEING OF OUR PEOPLE AND THEIR COMMUNITIES, WE CONTINUED TO ENGAGE EXTENSIVELY AND PLAY OUR PART AS A LARGE EMPLOYER AND SUPPORTIVE NEIGHBOUR.'",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's Statement continued\n\nThe deepening of the San Carlos shaft at Fresnillo remains on track for completion in 2022. It will provide easier and faster access to 56% of the mine's reserves, enabling us to significantly reduce haulage costs.\n\nAt Saucito, we continued with the project to deepen the Jarillas shaft to 1,000 metres. Again, when completed in 2025, this will reduce haulage costs by providing access to deeper levels of the mine where almost half of the reserves are located.\n\n## Delivering growth through development projects\n\nOur new mine at Juanicipio was completed towards the end of 2021, as planned. Unfortunately, approval to complete the tie-in to the national power grid was not granted by Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the state-owned electricity company, before year end as expected. The mill commissioning timeline was therefore extended by approximately six months to comply with new requirements from Centro Nacional de Control de Energ\u00eda (CENACE), In the meantime, we are continuing pre-commissioning testing before ramping up operations once the required permits have been granted.\n\nFrom 2022 onwards, Juanicipio will be an increasingly major influence in our operations, with silver and gold production expected to reach annual averages of 11.7 moz and 43.5 koz respectively. During 2021, development ore from Juanicipio was processed in the Fresnillo processing plant, with 1.8 moz of silver and 3.7 koz of gold produced during the period.\n\nDelays related to energy inspection and certification, together with issues caused by the pandemic, also affected the start-up of the new Pyrites Plant at the Fresnillo mine. Although completed late in 2020, connection to the national power grid was unexpectedly delayed by similar circumstances to those we experienced at Juanicipio. The result was again an extension of six months to the commissioning timeline in order to comply with new requirements. Once the Pyrites Plant is fully operational, we anticipate that it will produce an average of 3.5 moz of silver and 13 koz of gold per year, including production from Saucito.\n\nThe US$30 million plant optimisation project to improve recovery of lead and zinc from the lower levels at the Fresnillo mine continued as planned. The flotation circuit was connected on schedule early in the year and we are now seeing an improved quality of concentrates, better recovery rates and greater control of impurities. Originally planned for 2022, the installation of vibrating screens to improve milling capacity at the plant continues to be an option. However, we are not yet totally satisfied that doing so will create the right balance between throughput and recovery, and other courses of action remain under consideration.\n\n## Extending the growth pipeline\n\nThe increased exploration budget for 2021 supported an intensive programme across all our operations, with the aim of increasing the resource base, converting inferred resources into indicated, and improving the confidence of the grade distribution in our reserves. In total, our exploration teams drilled 835,396 metres, around 91% of which was in brownfield sites, notably in the Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n districts. We obtained good results that have increased both inferred and indicated resources at these sites. The remaining 9% involved activities on greenfield projects in Guanajuato in Mexico and at the Capricornio and Condoriaco projects in Chile. We also intensified our geological mapping and geochemical sampling activities in the Fresnillo, Herradura and San Juli\u00e1n districts, as well as in Guanajuato.\n\nOur advanced exploration projects at Rodeo and Orisyvo continued to make good progress. We engaged local communities to acquire access to land at Rodeo, which holds inferred and indicated resources amounting to 13.8 moz of silver and 1.3 moz of gold. Although negotiations have been subject to delay, we nevertheless expect to finalise them in 2022. At Orisyvo, we carried out conceptual work - including detailed metallurgy testing which has enabled us to update the feasibility study - and have prepared a 6,000-metre drilling programme to confirm the geotechnical model. The key to further progress is again access to land, and we have started discussions with the owners. We currently expect to commence production at Orisyvo towards the end of 2025.\n\nExploration continued in Peru and Chile, where we developed new drill targets and restructured our organisation and reporting procedures in order to speed and streamline our activities. We also participated in a number of the new arrangements for awarding concessions that are currently being pursued by the Peruvian government.\n\nWith inflationary pressures likely to compress our margins and the labour reform challenges of this year set to continue, we have reduced the exploration budget for 2022. Nevertheless, I am confident that the skills of our exploration teams and the outstanding geologies of both our brownfield and greenfield sites will continue to ensure that we increase or maintain our reserves and resource bases.\n\nSilver resources stood at 2.3 boz, a slight increase of 1.2% over 2020 mainly as a result of the exploration efforts at Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n Veins. Gold resources remained stable at 39.0 moz. Silver reserves decreased 8.2% to 419.8 moz mainly due to depletion at Fresnillo, Saucito and San Juli\u00e1n (DOB). Gold reserves decreased by 7.1% to 7.8 moz primarily due to more stringent geotechnical and cost considerations at Herradura and depletion at Noche Buena.\n\n## Advancing and enhancing the sustainability of our operations\n\nThe safety of our people is always our top priority, and we continued to roll out the 'I Care, We Care' programme across the business. This has helped us achieve a significant reduction in incidents over recent years, including in 2021 when we saw the Total Recordable frequency rate improve from 13.9 injuries per one million hours worked to 10.4 and the Lost Time Injury rate from 6.2 to 5.8. However, we were deeply saddened that in August one of our employees experienced a fatal accident at the Fresnillo mine. We worked with the relevant authorities to carry out a full independent investigation and are continuing to provide support to the employee's family and colleagues. We are committed to following up on this incident and to complying with measures derived from the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process in order",

This incident is a timely reminder that no matter how hard we may work to reduce the likelihood of incidents, safety is a never-ending challenge that requires diligence and the correct observance of protocols at all times.\n\nWe have continued to build greater resilience into our portfolio of Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) and are committed to implementing sector-specific standards and best practices that follow the guidelines of the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM), the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA) and the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). Our Independent Tailings Review Panel provides holistic guidance and recommendations for the safe design, construction and operation of our TSFs. We also have Master Services Agreements in place with a number of consultancies and, through them, have named our Engineers of Record. In addition, we have implemented satellite monitoring of our units and have reinforced surveillance and instrumental monitoring of our structures to enable improved decision-making during construction and operation. We fully understand community concerns around TSFs and will continue to invest in their safety in the short, medium and long term.\n\nAs the COP26 conference again underlined, climate change is engaging and energising governments and organisations across the world - and we are committed to playing our part by mitigating our environmental impact wherever possible. We will complete our project to install dual fuel engines that run on both Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) and diesel in 2022 as planned, and during the last year we invested in infrastructure to ensure we have the appropriate LNG storage capacity at Herradura. We anticipate seeing the first environmental and cost benefits next year, as both our diesel\n\nconsumption and CO 2 footprint decrease. In addition, we remain committed to achieving our target of using wind power to provide 75% of our electricity by 2030, assuming that Mexico's energy policy allows us to do so.\n\nWe continue to analyse our Energy Strategy in order to pursue a decarbonisation pathway that will be operationally and technologically viable. We are committed to playing our role in mitigating climate change and have improved our TCFD disclosures year on year. During the year ahead, we aim to carry out a thorough review of our current operations to gain insights that will allow us to ramp up our actions from disclosure to action and set emission reduction targets.\n\nThe hard work and commitment of our people towards ESG was again recognised by a broad group of authorities and our peers. For example, we were proud to be recognised as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, for the second successive year. We have also been members of the FTSE4Good Index since 2017.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nA degree of uncertainty surrounds the coming 12 months, driven to a significant extent by issues that are beyond our control. Inflationary pressures, the impacts of various laws and the attitude of the Government in Mexico to mining all have the potential to influence our progress. Part of a broad range of issues that are currently affecting many industries in Mexico, the exploration, concessions and permitting processes for mining are no longer as efficient and dynamic as in the past, and these could present difficulties. Furthermore, there is a latent risk that power self-supply contracts could be annulled along with the Wholesale Electricity Market (MEM), hampering our ability to increase the role of renewables in our energy portfolio and potentially increasing operating costs.\n\n## ' FROM 2022 ONWARDS, JUANICIPIO WILL BE AN INCREASINGLY MAJOR INFLUENCE IN OUR OPERATIONS.'\n\nLower production and recovery rates at Herradura and the continuing workforce shortages at Saucito caused by the new labour reform - as well as the impact of recent geotechnical instability in the Saucito area are also likely to add to the pressures we may face in 2022. In addition, the extension to the timeline for the tie-in to the national grid of both the Juanicipio plant and the Pyrites Plant mean that we now expect lower contributions than previously anticipated from these operations during 2022.\n\nOn the upside, we expect our exploration pipeline to continue making good progress, particularly at the Rodeo and Orisyvo projects as well as at Guanajuato and across the Fresnillo district. Precious metals prices also established what looks to be a realistic floor towards the end of the year. Although prices in 2022 will as always be influenced by economic conditions in China, the US and the EU, as well as other variables, our view is that a period of higher prices is the most likely outcome.\n\nI would like to thank the Board and all our people for their support over the last 12 months. This has been another challenging period for a variety of reasons, and Fresnillo would not have been able to deliver such a good set of results in difficult circumstances without their expertise, cooperation and willingness to always go the extra mile for our business.\n\nTo conclude, on behalf of all my colleagues at Fresnillo, I would like to offer my sincere condolences following the death of Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res. His leadership, vision and direction were largely responsible for making our Company the force it is today, and our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.

With the development and increasing roll-out of vaccines across the world, in conjunction with substantial fiscal and monetary policy support, industrial activity in a number of segments has returned to pre-crisis levels. Increased market confidence is demonstrated by the US Federal Reserve's decision to begin tapering its monthly pace of asset purchases through to the first half of 2022. While asset purchases may slow, interest rates in the US (historically perceived to be negatively correlated with the price of gold and silver) have remained flat, with a first rate hike anticipated in March of 2022.\n\nWhile positive signs of a sustained global recovery are evident, uncertainty persists. This is in part due to the emergence of new variants of Covid-19, alongside the global supply shocks seen during the second half of the year, driven by higher commodity prices, fewer workers, a shortage of parts, and sticky global distribution channels, combining to push inflation rates up to multi-decade highs towards the year end.\n\n## Market backdrop and precious metals prices performance\n\nFrom 2014 to early in 2020, the price of silver was range bound, fluctuating between US$12 per ounce up to US$20 per ounce. Following the outbreak of Covid-19 in March 2020, the price of silver recorded impressive gains as the global macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop turned increasingly supportive for precious metals investment, reaching multi-year highs of around US$30 per ounce in early July that same year - a level last seen in early 2013. In 2021, silver held some of these gains, averaging US$25.1 per ounce, 22.4% higher on average than 2020 and also ahead of 2019's average of US$16.1 per ounce.\n\nFollowing an impressive price performance during 2020, when its price reached an all-time high of US$2,075 per ounce in August, gold has also managed to hold on to some of its recent gains, averaging US$1,800 per ounce, 1.7% higher on average than 2020 and also ahead of 2019's average of US$1,393 per ounce.\n\nThe gains in precious metals prices we saw during 2020, and continued to experience in 2021, were driven by the global macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, including uncertainty due to the persistence of Covid-19, exacerbated by the additional risk of higher inflation.\n\nLooking ahead, the backdrop of negative real interest rates driven by rising inflation and the persistent uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 mean that the fundamentals around gold and silver remain strong. In the medium and long term, we could yet experience further demand upside to both precious metals driven by increased industrial demand from the ongoing revolution in green technologies, which we examine in more detail below, alongside the greater challenges of discovering new worldclass deposits.\n\n## Our principal products\n\nOur principal products are silver and gold. Supply and demand associated with each product is affected by a variety of factors. You can read more about how the sustainable mining of these products contributes to the wellbeing of people, and supports our Purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee 'Our Purpose' section on pages 10-13\n\nPlease also see page 10 for more details about how silver in particular is helping in the world's fight against climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee 'Climate Change' section on pages 88-100\n\n## Silver demand\n\nSilver has significant appeal as an investment commodity (forecast to represent 26% of demand in 2021 according to the Silver Institute's Interim review 1 ) because it is viewed as a safe haven and hedge against inflation during times of economic uncertainty.\n\nSilver is also increasingly important in industrial applications, which accounted for 51% of demand in 2021. With the greatest electrical and thermal conductivity of all metals, silver is a key component in many products, and is essential to the rapid and sustained growth of technologies that enable connectivity and help combat climate change.\n\n## Driving connectivity\n\n- \u00b7 The world is becoming more connected. According to the Pew Research Centre 2 , many experts predict enormous potential for improved quality of life thanks to internet connectivity.\n- \u00b7 Almost every electronic device depends on silver for its functionality.\n- \u00b7 5G networks and the 'internet of things' mean that billions of physical devices are now connected to the internet\n- \u00b7 Industries including mining are also adopting smart technology at pace.\n\n## Combating climate change\n\n- \u00b7 Silver is a key component for many green technologies including renewable power, off grid energy storage, and electric vehicle charging stations.\n- \u00b7 The EV automotive industry demand for silver is forecast to rise from an estimated 51 moz (1,600t) last year to 88 moz (2,700t) in five years' time according to the Silver Institute Market trend report 3 . Deloitte 4 states that sales of EVs are set to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% over the next ten years.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 CRU (a business intelligence company) forecasts that electricity generated from renewable sources will more than double from 2,159 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2019 to 4,243 TWh in 2025, accounting for 8.1% of total global generation in 2019 and 14.0% in 2025.\n- \u00b7 The World Bank 5 forecasts that by 2050 consumption of silver in energy technologies could reach a level equivalent to more than 50% of current total silver demand; the largest proportion for any non-battery level. More than 95% of this increase is due to an expansion of solar PV power generation.\n\n## Silver supply\n\nGlobal silver supply is predominantly from two sources: mine production; and recycled scrap. In 2021, mine production is forecast to contribute 81% of total silver supply, with scrap providing 19% and any balance made up by net official sector sales. 2021 saw an increase in silver mine production year-on-year, reversing the downward decline seen since 2015, up 6% against 2020 to 829 moz. This increase was driven by major silver mining producers being able to operate at full capacity and not being required to temporarily halt production, as was the case in 2020 driven by Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nSilver production from mines is primarily generated from by-product output which accounts for around 73% of total production, led by output from lead-zinc, copper, and gold mining activities. Primary silver mines such as the Fresnillo, Saucito and San Juli\u00e1n mines generated the balance.\n\nFor more detailed information on the current\n\nsilver industry and market information, please visit the Silver Institute's website at https://www.silverinstitute.org/.\n\n## Gold demand\n\nRegarded as a reliable safe haven asset and store of wealth, gold is primarily an investment commodity, held as a hedge against inflation. Gold is also fashioned into jewellery and works of art and has industrial applications, primarily in dentistry and high-end electronics.\n\nDemand for gold is driven by four markets: jewellery fabrication; bar and coin investment; central banks; and technology. In 2021, these markets accounted for 55.2%, 25.0%, 11.5% and 8.2% of total global demand respectively, according to the World Gold Council 6 . Total  gold demand increased to 4,021 tonnes, up 9.9% compared with 2020, propelled by the fourth quarter demand which jumped almost 50% to a 10-quarter high. Demand recouped much of the Covid-19-related losses sustained during 2020. The consumer-driven jewellery and technology sectors recovered throughout the year in line with economic growth and sentiment, while central bank buying also far outpaced that of 2020. Investment demand was mixed in an environment of opposing forces: high inflation competed with rising yields for investors' attention.\n\nLooking ahead, short-term demand for gold is strongly impacted by the perception of risk in the global economy and with central banks beginning to raise interest rates or taper asset purchases, some headwinds are expected. On the other hand, continued uncertainties relating to new variants of Covid-19 alongside global supply shocks driven by higher commodity prices, fewer workers and shortage of parts are among the factors that are pushing inflation rates up to multi-decade highs, providing tailwinds to the price of gold. In the longer term, gold is supported by the growing social economic development in emerging markets and the continued perception of gold's role as a store of wealth.\n\n## Gold supply\n\nGold supply primarily originates from two sources: mine production; and recycled scrap. In 2021, mine production and recycled scrap accounted for 76.3% and 24.6% of total gold supply respectively, with net producer hedging accounting for the remainder.\n\nGold mine production increased to 3,561 tonnes in 2021, up 2% year-on-year though still lower than 2019 and 3% lower than 2018, which stands as the year during which most gold was mined 7 . For more detailed information on the current gold industry and market information, please visit the World Gold Council website at https://www.gold.org/.\n\n## Relative scarcity of gold and silver\n\nDespite year-on-year increases in the total production of silver, the long documented downward trend in the number of major new gold, copper and zinc deposits (major sources of silver mine production) being discovered annually continues. It remains challenging for gold producers to discover and develop highquality gold mines (high grade and low cost) in low-risk geographic regions. For example, according to S&P Capital IQ's 8 annual analysis of major gold discoveries, 329 deposits have been discovered over the 1990-2020 period, containing 2.58 billion ounces of gold in reserves, resources and past production. Only 29 of these deposits were discovered over the past decade and contain only 208 moz, or 8%, of all gold discovered since 1990.\n\nWhile our own exploration activities have been instrumental in the development of new mines such as Saucito and, most recently, Juanicipio, the higher exploration spending of many producers in recent years has so far failed to return significant numbers of major discoveries. This has led to a shift by many producers towards brownfield exploration, which aims to extend or expand production from existing operations, a relatively lower risk option. In 2020, this shift became clear as the brownfield share of global exploration budgets hit an all-time high of 41%, with those for greenfield exploration falling to an all-time low of 24%, again according to S&P Capital IQ.\n\nAs we explain in our Exploration section on pages 35-38, our focus has also moved towards brownfield opportunities, although not to the same extent as some of our peers. While following a brownfield exploration strategy at established mines is relatively low risk, these mines often become less productive over time as initial mining schedules frequently target the easiest to access ore promising the best returns. Over time, average grades decline, ore haulage distances increase, and mine preparation requirements take longer, impacting production and increasing mining costs. At Fresnillo, we are investing in infrastructure to help us maintain and where possible improve production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See 'Operations' section\n\non pages 40-57\n\nFurthermore, environmental standards are rising in most countries, with a particular focus on the safety of tailings storage facilities and a strong commitment to supporting the communities where mines operate, both crucial elements of sustainable mining. While absolutely necessary and fully supported by responsible Companies such as Fresnillo, they inevitably lead to longer environmental approval processes and increased costs.\n\nOn average, it takes between ten to 20 years 9 for a mine to start producing. As a result of the capital-intensity of the process and the relative scarcity of silver and gold, supply is put under pressure and we expect this situation to become more challenging.\n\nThere are various reasons for the lack of exploration success, not least because the easier, higher-return ore deposits have already been discovered. While advances in exploration techniques have improved over time, the undiscovered deposits that remain are often smaller, more remote, lower grade and ultimately higher risk to develop.\n\n- 1 Refinitiv Interim Silver Market Review, 17 November 2021 - Online webinar.\n- 2 Pew Research Centre, 28 October 2019, The internet will continue to make life better, Kathleen Stansberry et al.\n- 3 Silver Institute, Market Trend Report: Silver and Global Connectivity, 2021.\n- 4 Deloitte Insights, 28 July 2020, Electric Vehicles, Setting a course for 2030, Dr Bryn Walton et al.\n- 5 World Bank, Minerals for Climate Change: The mineral intensity of the clean energy transition, 2020.\n- 6 World Gold Council, Gold Demand Trends Full year 2021, 28 January 2022.\n- 7 Using annual data back to 1970.\n\n8\n\nS&P Capital, Gold price increase drives surge of smaller discoveries, 8 July 2021.\n\n- 9 According to the World Gold Council.",

By continuing to invest in exploration across all precious metals price cycles and regardless of the peaks and troughs of economies, we aim to keep our pipeline well-stocked with a steady flow of opportunities and, specifically, to replace reserves mined each/uni00A0year.\n\nDuring the current Covid-19 pandemic, our teams deployed in Mexico, Peru, and Chile adhered strictly to Fresnillo and government sanitary protocols in order to continue making progress in our exploration programmes without compromising the health of our personnel. Our compliance with Covid-19-related preventive measures will remain a top operational priority during 2022.\n\nOur exploration teams have a proud and highly respected reputation in the Mexican mining industry. They have been responsible for our most significant breakthroughs, such as those at San Juli\u00e1n and Saucito, and are ideally qualified to identify and develop new opportunities. One of the most important roles of our teams is to engage with local communities and seek their participation at an early stage of a project. Not only does this help safeguard our licence to operate, it also gives us the opportunity to meet and consult with local people, thereby ensuring that we are able to tailor any subsequent community support programmes to meet their specific needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on community engagement See pages 109-112",

        "page_content": "## Review of operations - exploration continued\n\nOur focus remains on Latin America, and in particular on maximising the geological potential in and around our current operations. At the same time, we are continuing to look to locate and consolidate new districts in Mexico, Chile and Peru where we have identified favourable gold-silver potential.\n\nAll our exploration projects are measured against a set of strict criteria to ensure they meet our operational and revenue objectives. For example, we will only proceed with a standalone project if it offers a minimum potential of 150 moz of silver or 2 moz of gold. We also consider a range of additional factors before commencing activities, such as ore grades, metallurgical recoveries, extraction costs, environmental impact, and sustainability and community investment, as well as the available infrastructure. Only those projects that score well against these requirements receive the green light.\n\nFurthermore, and in line with our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint, we have started to include our most advanced exploration projects in our Energy Strategy. In 2020, we mapped and considered the potential environmental impact of the Rodeo, Orisyvo and Guanajuato projects, three of our more advanced exploration projects, however we need to continue to update their exploration programme before being able to evaluate their carbon pricing.\n\n## 2021 performance\n\n## Mineral resources and ore reserves\n\nEstimations of our mineral resources and ore reserves are developed by our corporate technical teams in line with industry standards, and audited every year by independent expert firms prior to public statement under the JORC Code reporting standards. 2021 mineral resources and ore reserve estimates were based on price assumptions of US$1,450/oz for gold and US$18.5/oz for silver, with open pit mineral resources estimated at US$1,600/oz for gold.\n\nSilver resources increased by 1.2% to 2,319.7 moz primarily due to successful exploration at Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n veins, partly offset by depletion and higher cut-off grades at Saucito and San Juli\u00e1n (DOB); gold resources remained stable at 39.0 moz.\n\nSilver reserves decreased 8.2% to 419.8 moz mainly due to depletion and exploration results at Fresnillo, and depletion at Saucito and San Juli\u00e1n (DOB), partly offset by exploration at San Juli\u00e1n veins. Gold reserves decreased 7.1% to 7,834 koz primarily due to depletion at Herradura and Noche Buena.\n\nIn 2020, we initiated a major technical development effort to upgrade our mineral resource modelling and improve the ore reserve engineering functions, both of which made important progress in 2021.\n\nWith a team of 24 dedicated specialists, geotechnical, structural, cost and ventilation modelling continued to progress in 2021, as did the open pit and underground ore reserve engineering processes. As a result, we were able to report proven reserves for the open pit operating mines.\n\nThe technical team will continue developing all disciplines in 2022, with special focus on the reconciliation of the geological, underground geotechnical and structural models, and further process upgrades.\n\nIn 2021, our drilling programmes increased by 22% with respect to 2020, with a total of 835,396 metres drilled. 91% of drilling activities were carried out at, or close to, our existing operations, in line with our continued focus on brownfield exploration which maximises the possibility of good returns. The following section provides details about our exploration pipeline, highlighting progress made in 2021 as well as outlining our plan for the year ahead. We drilled 72,623 metres in greenfield targets where we are consolidating districts.\n\n## Exploration at our existing mines\n\nExcellent exploration potential exists around our operating mines, where numerous drill targets have been identified using geological, geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing data, which is analysed and interpreted by our expert team. Exploring these targets represents a good opportunity to add value to our current operations by increasing our resource and reserve base. In line with this approach, 91% of the 835,396 metres drilled in 2021 were devoted to brownfield targets, including 605,323 metres drilled by the mine operation teams, and 157,450 completed by the Exploration Division.\n\nThe objectives of the drilling campaigns at our mines are threefold: (i) replenish and augment our mineral reserves, converting inferred resources into the indicated category with infill drilling; (ii) increase the total and inferred resources by drilling at extensions of known mineralisation and also by testing new targets; and (iii) continue to ensure the quality of the reserves blocks scheduled to be mined in the short term, with selected additional drilling carried out wherever deemed necessary due to grade variations. We work hard to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and to drive growth by replenishing depleted reserves and maintaining a robust growth pipeline.\n\n## Fresnillo district\n\nWhile Fresnillo is one of the most important silver districts in the world, our exploration activities show that it remains under-explored. We are addressing this opportunity through an integrated approach based on detailed mapping, geophysics and geochemistry. We are following up three high-priority exploration targets located within the area of influence of the processing facilities, with positive results.\n\nAcross the district, the mines and exploration teams drilled 314,171 metres during the year. 38,952 metres were drilled in high priority targets within reach of the existing mineral processing facilities. Veins carrying economic silver-gold grades have been discovered, and drilling is progressing well towards defining additional resources in the district.\n\n## Herradura District\n\nWe drilled a total of 103,561 metres in the Herradura District in 2021, with activities focused within the final Centauro pit to identify additional mineralised sections and to better define reserve blocks, and to evaluate potentially mineable sectors of the Noche Buena mine open pits. Beyond the pit limits, drilling was intensified in the high-grade gold veins, where mineable thickness and good grade continuity was successfully confirmed.\n\n## Ci\u00e9nega district\n\n79,228 metres of core drilling were completed at Ci\u00e9nega during 2021, with a continued focus on the new veins discovered in the northeastern part of the District, including Santa Alicia, Rosario Transversal, AFT and the Jessica Transversal vein discovered in 2021. The latter is the host of a good grade, near-surface ore shoot extending at least 600 metre along strike. In addition, extensions of the most promising veins in the central and western sections of the mine are being drill tested along with targets in the Taspana satellite operation. A thorough review of the stratigraphy and mineralised areas around the main mineral zone at Ci\u00e9nega revealed the new El Arco-Casas del Bajo target which will be drilled in 2022.\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n district\n\nAn intense drill programme amounting to 265,814 metres was implemented by the mine and district exploration teams. Results were positive both in finding extensions to the veins under exploitation and in delineating new goodgrade veins easily accessible from the current mine development works. A significant amount of new and indicated resources were added to the near- and medium-term mine plans.\n\nWe also initiated a drill programme to test exploration targets for new disseminated deposits. Targets were identified by the integration of a robust geological, geochemical, and geophysical database accumulated in the previous years. Preliminary drilling over these targets has yielded significant drill intercepts carrying base metals and anomalous silver; additional targets on favourable lithological settings have been defined and will be drilltested in the near future.\n\nThe continuous mapping and geochemical sampling programmes implemented in the district have produced several new exploration targets within trucking distance from the processing facilities. Additional work will be completed to advance those to the drill-ready stage.",

        "page_content": "## Development projects, preliminary economic assessments and feasibility studies\n\nProjects in this category have shown good potential for supporting our growth ambitions and have therefore been brought forward for further work. We carry out a wide range of exploration activities for these projects. For example, for projects in the relatively early stages we may conduct preliminary economic assessments (PEAs), which comprise an economic analysis of the potential viability of mineral resources. For more advanced projects such as Juanicipio, we undertake extensive de-risking activities to refine models, explore the extents of mineralisation and provide comprehensive support to a project as it moves into and through the development stage - a key moment in the journey towards becoming an operational mine.\n\n## Juanicipio - development project (56% Fresnillo plc, 44% MAG Silver)\n\n46,777 metres of core drilling were completed during 2021 over the main NW-trending Valdeca\u00f1as and subsidiary veins, carried out by both the Exploration Division and the project development teams. While the existing mineral inventory had only marginal changes, a good conversion rate from inferred to indicated category was attained, and the vein extensions at depth were confirmed, although at lowerthan-average silver grades. Continuity of other veins, both parallel and oblique to the main Valdeca\u00f1as trend, were proven, thus providing additional targets that warrant drilling. The NE-trending target located in the western part of the tenement was advanced to drill-ready status, after obtaining the required land access and environmental permits; drilling of this target is slated for 1Q 2022.\n\n## Advanced exploration projects Orisyvo\n\nDetailed engineering data accumulation advanced at Orisyvo during 2021. An updated metallurgical investigation conducted over both the oxide and sulphide ores of this world-class deposit delivered positive results with respect to gold recoveries and provided useful information for refining the design of a processing facility.\n\nWe designed a 6,080 metre drill programme focused on geotechnical evaluation of the main host rocks, and achieved 70% progress during the year. The resource estimation was updated to include additional geochemical and geologic elements for geometallurgical domaining, and detailed social and environmental studies started. An updated mining scenario is currently being evaluated, and the results will be summarised in a feasibility study scheduled to be completed in 2023.\n\n## Guanajuato\n\nGuanajuato is a historic, world-class gold and silver mineral system, which displays numerous attractive exploration targets that have the potential to increase its already large preciousmetals endowment. 49,047 metres of core drilling were completed in 2021 over priority vein\n\nzones, designed to increase both the total and the indicated resources, and to test at depth several pristine new veins discovered. Follow-up work on mineralogical anomalies determined using air-borne hyperspectral technology detected strong trace-element epithermal signatures, along with minor gold and silver showings. An upper level epithermal model was developed over the District and has proved to be exposed over the Guanajuato corridor at different erosion levels. Drilling below geochemical trace-element anomalies accompanied by the key mineralogical alteration signature defined has proved to carry precious metals at depth at several locations. As a result, the drilling rate was increased in 2021 and will continue over the coming years. In sectors where ore-grades are outcropping, additional ore bodies amenable to massive, low-cost, underground mining methods are being evaluated. Both the total and the indicated resources have increased and are approaching a critical mass which will be best evaluated in an updated PEA expected to be completed in 2023.\n\n## Rodeo\n\nThe Rodeo District contains a sizeable gold resource and a number of exploration targets in the neighbouring areas. The mineralised zone is amenable to open-pit mining and gold recovery using heap-leach technologies. We have strengthened a region-wide community relations programme and advanced negotiations with local landowners. Further exploration and development works have been delayed until an agreement is reached with the local Ejidos indigenous people.\n\n## Tajitos\n\nGeological mapping and geochemical sampling completed in 2021 over Fresnillo land delivered additional exploration targets in the district. Government permits will be obtained to ensure a 1H 2022 start-up of drilling at these targets. Additional land access is currently being negotiated in areas close to the current resources and, once obtained, an application for environmental permits will be submitted and an infill and step-out drill programme implemented.\n\n## Prospects\n\n## Mexico\n\n2021 was a difficult year for regional prospecting given the variable degree of travel restrictions related to the Covid-19 pandemic throughout the country. However, based upon the best sanitary practices available and following official regulations, we developed a strict health protocol that enabled our teams to carry out geological reconnaissance programmes and associated geochemical sampling. Regional exploration targets in Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, Zacatecas and Guanajuato states were evaluated in this way, producing a number of areas worthy of follow-up work to be executed during 2022 and 2023.\n\nAssessment work required to maintain our mining claims in good standing was completed in several locations across Mexico. In addition, advanced projects such as Candame\u00f1a and\n\nSan Juan will see additional drilling in 2022; the first round of drilling will also be carried out in a number of early-stage projects in Sonora, Durango and Zacatecas.\n\n## Peru\n\nNo drilling was carried out in Peru in 2021. The Pilarica silver and the Supaypacha gold-copper projects remained in stand-by. However, our teams managed to strengthen our community relations programmes in all our projects to help solve the outstanding issues. Although the social and political scenario in Peru remains challenging, we are confident that we will be able to resume drilling at these locations in 2022. At Santo Domingo, all social and government permits for drilling were obtained and the required logistics are being carried out to support a 1Q start-up of our maiden drill programme at this high potential gold and silver project. In addition, several new prospective areas were staked throughout the country, with semi-detailed geological and geochemical work scheduled for 2022.\n\n## Chile\n\nThe Capricornio project, located in the Antofagasta region, displays a significant quartz vein system with interesting preciousmetals values at the surface. In 2021, our core drilling amounted to 5,040 metres including the stepping out from previous intercepts and the testing of some new veins. These activities delivered interesting results which merit further exploration. An electromagnetic geophysical survey was conducted over most of the tenements in two stages. Having initially explored the outcropping veins system, we subsequently used the signatures obtained to interpret the geophysical responses found below the extensive caliche-covered valley in the northern part of the project along several survey lines. We have identified additional drill targets to be tested in 2022.\n\nAt the Condoriaco project near La Serena, in 2021 we drilled 9,606 metres to test four vein clusters occurring in the 5 x 8 kilometre vein field, obtaining mixed results. The 2022 programme will investigate extensions to nearsurface shoots, evaluate the deeper portions of some of the veins, and test the most promising unexplored veins.\n\n## Early stage exploration\n\nWe routinely carry out activities at all six exploration offices to accumulate regional geological, geophysical, structural and geochemical data and analyse them in a GIS environment. Areas identified with good potential are followed-up by gathering remote sensing hydrothermal alteration data commissioned from international high quality service providers. The information gained is integrated into the database to refine our understanding of the targeted ore deposit systems. Furthermore, our regional prospecting teams in Mexico, Peru and Chile carry out the field work required to validate the exploration targets and eventually incorporate them into our prospect pipeline.",

This is a standalone project, located 14 kilometres from the Fresnillo mine, which is being constructed, developed and operated by Fresnillo plc.\n\nThe Juanicipio deposit consists of two main vein systems, the Valdeca\u00f1as vein system and the Juanicipio vein, which are significant silver-gold epithermal structures. The Valdeca\u00f1as vein system displays the vertical grade transition typical of the principal veins in the Fresnillo district, observed as a change from silver- and gold-rich zones at the top to increased lead and zinc in the deeper reaches.\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nDevelopment of the mine continued to advance, reaching 45 km by the end of the year. One of the two ventilation shafts for the mine began operations during the year.\n\nAs planned, development ore continued to be processed at the Fresnillo beneficiation plant through the year, with 251,906 tonnes processed. Attributable production was 1.8 moz of silver, 3.7 koz of gold, 671.3 tonnes of lead and 1,035.8 tonnes of zinc (on a 100% basis: 3.2 moz silver, 6.6 koz of gold, 1,198.8 tonnes of lead and 1,849.7 tonnes of zinc).\n\n- 1 Feasibility study 2018.\n- 2 Represents 100% of investment (56% Fresnillo plc, 44% Mag Silver).\n- 3 Mineral resources quoted reflect Fresnillo plc's attributable 56% ownership.\n\nThe construction of the Juanicipio plant was completed in 4Q 2021 despite the continued disruption caused by Covid-19. However, permits to connect to the power grid were not granted in 4Q 2021 as anticipated, due to Covid-19 related delays and new requirements from the state owned electric company and the energy regulator. As a result, the mill commissioning timeline was extended by approximately six months.\n\nTo minimise any potential adverse effect from this delay, unused plant capacity at both the Fresnillo and Saucito beneficiation plants will be made available in order to process mineralised material produced at Juanicipio.\n\nSilver resources 3 at Juanicipio remained largely unchanged at 158 moz (161 moz in 2020), while gold resources increased by 2.3% to 836 koz. Silver reserves at the project decreased 2.3% to 86 moz while gold reserves increased by 6.7% to 447 koz.\n\n## 2022 Priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Subject to permits being obtained, start-up of flotation plant and ramp-up of commercial production to 85-90% of nameplate capacity by the end of 2022.",

Added to these issues, we experienced setbacks which affected production, including seismic activity and flooding, as well as unforeseen delays in the commissioning of both our major development projects. The pandemic, labour reform and operational issues are separate but inextricably linked challenges. During 2021, we faced a rapidly evolving and dynamic situation where these different issues came together to present a set of significant difficulties for our business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Our priorities for the future are clear: in the short term, to navigate and manage the unpredictable challenges of the pandemic, to continue adapting our business to the new environment created by the labour reform, and to improve our operational performance; in the long term, we must build on the progress we expect to see in 2022 to become a more resilient business.\n\n## Pandemic\n\n## What happened in 2021\n\nDuring most of 2021, the world saw a welcome downward trend in cases of Covid-19 as vaccines began to have the desired impact. We worked with local, regional and national authorities to support a comprehensive vaccination programme for our people and local communities. Vaccine uptake at our facilities was excellent, reaching approximately 78% of our people across mining units, while our support also enabled local communities - many of them in remote areas - to stay safe. The high vaccination rate helped to minimise disruption to our operations for most of the year. However, in the first weeks of December Mexico experienced a sharp increase in cases following the arrival of the more contagious Omicron variant. This led to a rapid rise in absenteeism which added to the workforce shortages caused by the labour reform discussed below and disrupted our operations, development work and planning.\n\n## Where we are now\n\nWhile we are relieved that Omicron presents a lesser health risk than previous variants, we are nonetheless seeing high levels of absenteeism which is leading to a reduced workforce and an inevitable impact on our business. Although the evolution of Covid-19 and its impact on economies remains uncertain, we have continued to experience a negative impact on our operations during the first quarter of 2022. Strict protocols and preventive measures remain in place across our operations, including vaccinations and extensive testing and tracing of the workforce through both PCR and antigen tests. To further mitigate the disruption caused by higher absenteeism, we have reduced the required isolation period, in line with the World Health Organization's guidelines: initially from 14 to ten days and most recently to seven days. However, in the interests of public health, any worker having close contact with an infected person is also required to isolate for seven days and this has had a further knock-on effect on workforce numbers.\n\n## How we are building up our future resilience\n\nVaccination is recognised as the only feasible route for the world to return to business as usual. Committed to playing our part on behalf of our stakeholders, we will continue to support the vaccination efforts of the Mexican authorities. In particular we will provide medical facilities and equipment, including booster doses of the vaccine, promote testing, donate protective equipment to local communities and initiate and fund campaigns to raise awareness of how to prevent infection.\n\n## Labour reform\n\n## What happened in 2021\n\nWe have traditionally relied on contractors to carry out several activities at our mines, with the number of contractor personnel increasing in recent years as they became a key foundation for our growth. The new labour reform in Mexico, which restricted the ability to subcontract labour, therefore affected us more than many of our peers operating in Mexico. Although the use of contractors is still allowed for 'specialised services' the reform meant that we had to internalise the contractors who we had previously relied on to carry out activities categorised as our 'core business'. In line with our conservative approach to business, we included almost all development and haulage work under the 'core business' heading and subsequently launched a programme to bring the relevant contractors into our business as unionised employees.\n\nUnfortunately, a large number of contractors chose to focus on the short-term financial advantages of contracting rather than the long term benefits of employment. This led to a serious shortage of trained and experienced personnel - and because we historically relied on contractors' equipment as well as their labour, it also led to a lack of equipment. The situation was further exacerbated by absenteeism caused by the pandemic and the existing skills shortage in Mexico's mining sector.\n\n## Where we are now\n\nWe are continuing to work hard to manage the fallout from the reform by addressing labour shortages, for example by implementing intensive recruitment campaigns, increasing our focus on training, and launching initiatives to improve retention. At the same time, we are continuing to rent equipment from contractors in order to maintain production until the orders we have placed for new equipment can be fulfilled by manufacturers. While we have made some progress in recent months, we expect disruption to continue during 2022. We estimate that our open pit mines should be fully staffed during the first quarter while the staffing process in the Fresnillo District and Ci\u00e9nega, which have been affected to a greater extent, will be complete in the third quarter. We are therefore planning for three quarters of disruption before recovery. The workforce at Saucito is currently down by around 25%, while the workforce at Fresnillo is running at 7% below optimum.\n\n## How we are building up our future/uni00A0resilience\n\nBy continuing and where appropriate reinforcing the activities already underway - notably the drives to internalise our contractor workforce, ramp up our recruitment and maintain strict pandemic controls - we expect to have regained workforce stability by 4Q 2022. In the meantime, we will continue to analyse and identify how the combination of the labour reform, the skills shortage in Mexico and the pandemic will impact workforce availability, and evolve our future initiatives accordingly.\n\n' FOLLOWING A PLEASING FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR WHICH SAW A RECOVERY IN PRODUCTION LEVELS AT THE FRESNILLO MINE, THE SECOND HALF WAS DISAPPOINTING.'",

        "page_content": "## Review of operations continued\n\n## Operational challenges\n\n## What happened in 2021\n\nFollowing a pleasing first half of the year which saw a recovery in production levels at the Fresnillo mine, the second half was disappointing. While much of the difficulties we experienced across the business can be laid at the door of labour shortages caused by the pandemic and labour reform, events at Saucito and Fresnillo also contributed to the lower production, despite a positive performance at San Juli\u00e1n. At Saucito, increased seismic activity within the Jarillas veins that represents 28% of the mine's total volumes led to instability. With the safety of our people always the first priority in our decision-making, we slowed mining activities and established a new mining sequence. To mitigate the impact and recapture operational flexibility, we targeted the development of new areas of the mine but this was not fully possible due to shortages of labour and equipment. At Fresnillo, unexpected work on the electricity infrastructure necessitated a reduction in pumping capacity and led to flooding which, together with a temporary ventilation system failure, severely curtailed our development activities and restricted access to certain production and haulage areas of the mine.\n\n## Where we are now\n\nAs stated above, we are continuing to address the workforce shortages caused by Covid-19 and the labour reform, together with equipment shortages, and therefore expect to see production increase steadily through 2022.\n\nAt Saucito, we are in the process of hiring a specialised third party to analyse seismicity and work with our teams to identify a safe and realistic pathway to the full restoration of development activities within the Jarillas veins. At Fresnillo, we are commissioning a new pumping station, with no further impact from flooding expected beyond the second quarter, which will enable us to regain full access to ramps and stopes. Attributable silver production for 2022 is expected to be in line with 2021, driven by the challenges at Saucito and lower than forecast contributions from Juanicipio and the Pyrites Plant at Fresnillo, due to the delays explained below.\n\n## How we are building up our future/uni00A0resilience\n\nOur increased focus on recruiting, training and retaining our people will underpin our evolution towards more resilient development and production. At the same time, we will ensure that availability of equipment is smoother as we actively collaborate with manufacturers and suppliers to improve delivery times and/uni00A0reliability.\n\n## Projects\n\n## What happened in 2021\n\nAlthough construction of the Juanicipio plant and the Pyrites Plant at Fresnillo were both delivered on schedule, the permits to connect these development projects to the power grid were not granted in 4Q 2021 as anticipated. This was due to Covid-19 related delays and new requirements from the state-owned electricity company and the energy regulator. As a result,\n\nthe timelines for the tie-in to the national grid at both Juanicipio and the Pyrites Plant were extended by approximately six months.\n\n## Where we are now\n\nWe are focusing on complying with the new requirements from the electricity company and the energy regulator to complete the tie-in to the national power grid. Following the delay to our timeline, we expect commissioning at both Juanicipio and the Pyrites Plant to take place in mid-2022. To mitigate potential adverse effects caused by the delay at Juanicipio, we are making available any unused plant capacity at our Fresnillo and Saucito operations to process material produced at Juanicipio. Once the required permits have been granted, we will continue with the pre-commissioning testing and will look to ramp up operations to 85%90% capacity by the end of the year.\n\n## How we are building up our future/uni00A0resilience\n\nWe are working hard to establish closer relationships with the electricity company and regulator. Our aim is to fully understand their requirements and identify how we can best collaborate to ensure that future develop projects are able to proceed quickly and efficiently in order to deliver benefits to our business, local communities and, through tax revenue, the Government.\n\n## Tom\u00e1s Iturriaga\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Review of operations - mines in operation continued\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production decreased by 8.2% versus 2020, driven by the labour reform in Mexico which resulted in staff vacancies and a higher workforce rotation. In turn, this affected equipment availability and utilisation rates due to the reduced availability of specialised mechanics and trained machine operators. This restricted operational flexibility and prevented access to higher ore grade areas of the mine. In addition, a number of other factors affected operations during the year, including a power cut, which in turn reduced pumping capacity and led to flooding, together with a temporary ventilation system failure. Combined, these factors adversely impacted the average ore throughput at the mine leading to a 5.2% drop year-on-year to 6,616 tpd in 2021 (2020: 6,976/uni00A0tpd).\n\nThe average development rate in the year decreased by 2.6% to 3,050 metres per month (2020: 3,130 metres per month). During the first half of the year, development rates averaged 3,285 metres per month. However, following the labour reform, rates dropped to an average of 2,815 metres per month, driven by the uncertainty which negatively impacted contractor performances, together with the flooding of certain areas which limited the extraction of waste material through the ramps.\n\nFurthermore, the contribution of the tunnel boring machine (TBM) was less than expected, as we were trialling it in a production area that featured less advantageous geomechanical characteristics than those found in development areas. As a result, the TBM advanced at a slower pace. We now plan to relocate it to a development area, and therefore anticipate that performance will return to previous levels.\n\nWe expect to regain a rate of 2,900 to 3,100 metres per month on average during 1H22 and gradually increase it to the required levels in the following months.\n\nProductivity, calculated as tonnes of ore milled per person, decreased compared to 2020 as the labour reform, and other factors mentioned above, impacted our ability to process higher volumes of ore. Although we successfully internalised a number of contractors in response to the labour reform, thereby increasing the number of unionised personnel, we nevertheless required additional contractors to work on specialised services during the year. This had the effect of maintaining our contractor base for 2021 at similar levels to that for 2020, thus increasing the total headcount at the mine and impacting the productivity metric.\n\n## Financial performance 4\n\n| Financial highlights                    |   2021 |   2020 | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                 |  459.5 |  407.2 | 12.8       |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)        |  187.7 |  162   | 15.9       |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                   |  224.6 |  191   | 1 7. 6     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)              |  108.3 |   92.6 | 1 7. 0     |\n| Exploration (US$m)                      |    9.3 |    9.2 | 1. 1       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                    |   84.7 |   69.9 | 21.2       |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz silver)               |    5.4 |    5.9 | (8.3)      |\n| Margin (US$/oz) 5                       |   19.4 |   15.4 | 26.0       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) |   78.1 |   72.3 |            |\n| All-in sustaining cost (US$)            |   16.3 |   12.9 | 26.5       |\n\nAdjusted revenue, excluding inter-segment sales, increased by 12.8% to US$459.5 million, principally due to the 16.9% increase in the silver price.\n\nCost per tonne increased 21.2% to US$84.7 in 2021, with the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar together with cost inflation of 9.83% at this mine accounting for approximately half of the increase. The remaining increase was primarily driven by: i) additional costs associated with maintenance to the vertical conveyor; ii) increased use of explosives, due to the use of electronic initiators to improve the precision and safety of explosive charges; iii) increase in the consumption of reagents due to smaller\n\n- 4 Financial figures for Fresnillo exclude ore sales from Juanicipio.\n- 5 Margin defined as average realised price less cash cost per ounce.\n\nparticles of zinc contained in the mineral; and iv) increase in personnel costs in preparation for the start of operations at the Pyrites Plant and the new labour reform. Additionally, the lower volume of ore fed to the mills (-5.2%) also had a negative effect.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce decreased to US$5.4 (2020: US$5.9) principally due to higher byproduct credits and lower treatment and refining charges, partly offset by a higher cost per tonne. Margin per ounce increased 26.0% to US$19.4. Expressed as a percentage of the silver price, it increased to 78.1% (2020: 72.3%).\n\nAll-in sustaining cost increased 26.5% over 2020 to US$16.3, explained by a higher sustaining capex in absolute terms and per ounce (-5.0% silver ounces sold).\n\nWhile our improvement initiatives made progress, further work is required to help control dilution, particularly on the narrower veins. During the year, we redefined a number of key processes and variables around dilution control and implemented new technology to more accurately measure dilution. We take confidence that these measures will provide a sound basis for dilution control going forward as part of our day-to-day operations management. Our drilling programme, focused on increasing resources and improving the certainty of the geological model, met its objectives for the year and this will continue into 2022 and beyond, continuously improving our knowledge and understanding of the vein system and thereby the certainty of our mine planning.\n\nDuring the year, as part of the optimisation of the beneficiation plant, the connection of the new circuit to the Fresnillo flotation plant was completed, increasing the plant's capacity to process ore with higher lead and zinc grades, without impacting recovery rates.\n\n## FRESNILLO\n\n(US$/tonne milled)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n84.7\n\n|   2021 |   84.7 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2020 |   69.9 |\n|   2019 |   62.7 |\n|   2018 |   49.4 |\n|   2017 |   47.5 |\n\n## FRESNILLO ORE MILLED PER PERSON (Tonnes)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n589\n\n|   2021 | 589   |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2020 | 655   |\n|   2019 | 712   |\n|   2018 | 745   |\n|   2017 |       |\n\n## FRESNILLO CASH COST\n\n(Silver US$/ounce)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5.4\n\n- % figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.",

        "page_content": "A new pumping station was constructed during the year and commissioned at the beginning of 2022 to further increase water pumping capacity, helping our teams to regain access to some mining and haulage areas that were affected during 2021.\n\nThe deepening of the San Carlos shaft continued to progress with commissioning expected in the second half of 2022. This project is expected to support a reduction in haulage costs.\n\n## Pyrites Plant at Fresnillo\n\nConstruction of the flotation plant at the Fresnillo mine (phase II) to improve overall recoveries of gold and silver was concluded on time in 4Q 2020. Due to a combination of Covid-19 related delays and new requirements from the state-owned electrical company and the energy regulator, the plant start-up was pushed back and we now expect to complete the tie-in to the national power grid by mid-2022.\n\nThis US$155.0 facility, together with Saucito's pyrites plant (phase I), are expected to produce an average of 3.5 moz silver and 13 koz gold per year once both are operating at full capacity.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver reserves decreased 24.0% due to depletion and exploration results, while silver resources increased 11.1% as a result of the exploration programme, which added several structures.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nTotal capex spend in 2021 was US$91.8 million, which included sustaining capex, mine development, the deepening of the San Carlos shaft, construction of a new pumping station, and the tailings management programme (see pages 102-104). We continued to invest in our IT projects, including wireless telecommunication systems in new production areas, remote controlled drilling equipment, Track Plus, Ventilation Plus, MineOps Optimiser and training required for the stochastic modelling of the mine resources.\n\n## 2022 outlook\n\nFor 2022, the silver ore grade is expected to be in the range of 190-200 g/t, with the gold ore grade around 0.50-0.70 g/t.\n\nThe majority of our investment in the year ahead will focus on mine development and sustaining capex, including the conclusion of the deepening of the San Carlos shaft and the acquisition of additional mine equipment required for operation by personnel recently internalised following the labour reform. Furthermore, in 2022 we will continue implementing tracking for personnel and mining equipment and will pilot a technology to minimise dilution on the long-drill stopes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Geomechanical monitoring equipment is being installed in these areas to enable an efficient and optimal mining sequence, while prioritising the safety of our teams. Furthermore, additional contractors were hired to prepare new stopes.\n\nProduction was also impacted by the implementation of the labour reform which had a particular effect at Saucito due to a larger and less predictable contractor base compared to our other operations.

To address this challenge, we have initiated recruitment campaigns, increased training and invested in new equipment.\n\nAs part of our day-to-day operation management, we continue to review our processes and invest in technology to more accurately measure and control dilution.\n\nAnnual gold production increased 4.2% driven by higher ore grades, partially offset by lower volumes of ore processed.\n\nProductivity decreased compared to 2020 reflecting the adverse impact of the seismicity and workforce shortages on volumes of ore processed, as described above. Although we successfully internalised a number of contractors in response to the labour reform, thereby increasing the number of unionised personnel, we nevertheless required additional contractors to work on specialised services during the year. This had the effect of maintaining our contractor base for 2021 at similar levels to that for 2020, thus increasing the total headcount at the mine and impacting the productivity metric.\n\nThe Pyrites Plant at Saucito produced 567 koz of silver and 2.3 koz of gold during the year, lower year-on-year due to a decrease in volumes processed at Saucito and the lower tailings processed at the Pyrites Plant. In 2022, we expect production from this plant,\n\nexcluding the expected production from the Fresnillo Pyrites Plant, to marginally increase to within the range of 700 to 750 koz of silver and between 1.5 to 2.5 koz of gold.\n\nThe project to deepen the Jarillas shaft from 630 metres to 1,000 metres advanced, with good progress made in horizontal development required to install shaft infrastructure. However, given the shortage of personnel, Covid-19 protocols and operational challenges, we anticipate a delay to the timeline of this project, now expected to be completed by 2025.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver reserves decreased 10.5% due to depletion. Similarly, silver resources decreased by 10.6% as a result of depletion and a higher cut-off grade.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 totalled US$101.4 million, mainly allocated to in-mine development, sustaining capex, including additional mining equipment to maintain operations following internalisation of certain contractors, engineering for the tailings dam, safety and environment and the project to deepen the Jarillas shaft. Furthermore, we continued making minor investments in technology to consolidate Track plus following the mine's growth, real time tracking of equipment for production and maintenance purposes, big data analysis (SmartOps) to focus on productivity initiatives and predictive maintenance as well as software required for the stochastic modelling of the mine's resources.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                    | 2021   |   2020 | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                 | 594.5  |  593.6 | 0.2        |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)        | 218.6  |  199.2 | 9.7        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                   | 321.3  |  325.1 | (1.2)      |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)              | 101.2  |   73.4 | 37.9       |\n| Exploration (US$m)                      | 18.7   |   13.9 | 34.5       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                    | 89.8   |   72   | 24.7       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz silver)                 | (0.8)  |    0.8 | N/A        |\n| Margin ($/oz)                           | 25.7   |   20.5 | 25.4       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) | 103.2  |   96.2 |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)            | 9.5    |    6.9 | 37.7       |\n\nAdjusted revenue at Saucito remained flat yearon-year, mainly as a result of higher silver, lead and zinc prices, offset by the lower volumes of silver sold.\n\nCost per tonne increased 24.7% to US$89.8, with the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar and cost inflation of 9.85% at this mine accounting for approximately half of the increase. The remaining increase was primarily driven by: i) electrical maintenance and repairs to rectify damage to the pumping equipment caused by two floods during the year, and mechanical corrective maintenance to the flotation plant; ii) increase in personnel in preparation for the labour reform; iii) increase in contractors due to higher volume of waste hauled and supportive works such as anchoring and shotcreting to mitigate risks caused by increased seismicity\n\nin operating areas, and increased development. Additionally the lower volume of ore fed to the mill (-12.0%) had a negative effect.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce decreased to -US$0.9 per ounce (2020: US$0.8 per silver ounce) mainly as a result of higher gold, lead and zinc by-product credits per silver ounce. This was partially offset by an increase in cost per tonne and a lower silver ore grade. Margin per ounce increased to US$25.8 in 2021 (2020: US$20.5). Expressed as a percentage of the silver price, it increased from 96.2% to 103.6%.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost increased to US$9.5 per ounce due to higher sustaining capex related to higher sustaining capex in absolute terms and per ounce (-20.1% silver ounces sold), mitigated by lower cash cost.\n\n## 2022 outlook\n\nDriven by a shortage of personnel following the labour reform, in conjunction with absenteeism due to Covid-19, and additional development to recapture operational flexibility, we expect volumes of ore processed to decrease.\n\nWe are targeting a return to an average development rate of more than 3,000 metres a month during 2022, as our actions to address labour shortage issues take effect during the first three quarters of the year.\n\nThe decline in the ore grade seen over the past few years is expected to continue going into 2022, with higher ore grade areas in the Jarillas vein affected by increased seismicity and therefore requiring additional development to recapture operational flexibility. As a result, the silver ore grade is expected to average between 175-195 g/t while the gold ore grade is expected to average between 1.1-1.2 g/t.\n\nA detailed third-party review of the full mine planning cycle will be undertaken early in 2022 to identify any other subjacent factor impacting grades mined compared to long term reserve estimated grades.\n\nCapex will primarily be allocated to increasing development rates, sustaining capex, safety and environment and the deepening of the Jarillas shaft. In 2022, we will focus on Mine Optimiser, a system that monitors and optimises tasks carried out in our mines, and enables us to make accurate decisions in real time from a control room, in order to achieve our goal of completing the short-term mine plan.\n\n## SAUCITO\n\n(US$/tonne milled)\n\n## 89.8\n\n|   2021 |   89.8 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2020 |   72   |\n|   2019 |   67.8 |\n|   2018 |   60.1 |\n|   2017 |   47.6 |\n\n## SAUCITO ORE MILLED PER PERSON (tonnes)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2021 | 721   |       |\n|--------|-------|-------|\n|   2020 | 858   | 858   |\n|   2019 | 749   | 749   |\n|   2018 | 849   | 849   |\n|   2017 |       | 1,065 |\n\n721\n\n## SAUCITO CASH COST\n\n(Silver US$/ounce)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-0.8\n\n|   2021 | -0.8   | 24.87 103.2%   |\n|--------|--------|----------------|\n|   2020 | 0.8    | 21.28 96.4%    |\n|   2019 |        | 16.10 85.7%    |\n|   2018 |        | 15.54 93.8%    |\n|   2017 | 1. 5   | 16.97 90.9%    |\n\nSilver price             Cash cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n%  figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.",

In 2021, it contributed 31.6% to total silver production and generated 18.9% of total adjusted revenue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOwnership: 100% Fresnillo plc\n\nIn operation since: 2016 (Veins)/ 2017 (Disseminated Ore Body)\n\nFacilities: Underground mine, flotation plant and a dynamic leaching plant\n\nWorkforce: 465 employees, 1,577 contractors\n\nLocation: Chihuahua/Durango border\n\nMine life (years): 4.4 Veins (2020: 2.8), 3.1 Disseminated Ore Body (2020: 3.6)\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production at San Juli\u00e1n veins increased 4.8% year-on-year driven by a higher ore grade, while gold production decreased by 16.1% due to a lower ore grade. This was due to the depletion of higher ore grade areas and, to a lesser extent, lower volume of ore processed driven by two electricity outages by the state-owned utility Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE).\n\nSilver production increased 35.3% at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body versus 2020, driven by two primary factors: firstly the positive variation with the geological model in the central area of the ore body; and secondly, the regaining of access to higher ore grade areas following the mine resequencing in 2019. These factors compensated for the lower volume of ore processed, which was driven by the temporary impact at the beginning of the year of the minor structural damage to the lead circuit housing at the end of 2020, and by the two electricity outages, as mentioned above.\n\nAs a result of the higher than expected ore grades found in the core of the ore body, we reviewed the reconciliation of the actual silver grade with the geological model. This review increased the confidence of the geological model, in particular within the higher grade core of the ore body.\n\nProductivity increased due to the decrease in contractors, which more than offset the adverse impact of the lower volumes processed at San Juli\u00e1n (Veins) and San Juli\u00e1n (DOB).\n\nConstruction of the third phase of the tailings dam will commence in mid-2022 following a comprehensive review of design and construction methodology. Construction of phase four will follow immediately after the conclusion of phase three.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver and gold reserves at San Juli\u00e1n veins increased 82.5% and 47.2% respectively yearon-year mainly as a result of the exploration programme in the southern areas of the district. Similarly, silver and gold resources increased year-on-year despite a 10.2% increase in the cut-off grade.\n\nSilver and gold reserves and resources at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body decreased due to depletion of the ore body.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapex spend in 2021 was US$51.3 million, mainly allocated to mining works, sustaining capex and the implementation of IT initiatives to improve the mine's operational performance through investment in remote controlled drilling equipment and big data analysis (SmartOps). However, training required for the stochastic modelling of the mine's resources was not possible due to the high rotation of personnel. Training will take place once workforce and rotation has been stabilised.\n\n## 2021 objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Convert probable reserves into the proven category.\n- \u00b7 Ramp up the use of semi-autonomous drilling machines.\n- \u00b7 Advance the construction of the third phase of the tailings dam, due to be completed in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Advance the process to achieve the International Cyanide Management Code Certification.\n- \u00b7 Continue to maintain operational continuity without geotechnical issues.\n- \u00b7 Continue to implement cost control initiatives, targeting a 5% improvement year-on-year.\n\n## 2021 performance\n\n- \u00b7 Reserves at San Juli\u00e1n (Veins) increased due to the conversion of resources into reserves, although reserves in the proven category were not achieved.\n- \u00b7 Semi-autonomous drilling represented 63% of the total metres drilled during the year, versus 41% in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Further analysis to obtain the Cyanide Management Code Certification was conducted. However, this highlighted the need for additional modifications at the flotation plant, and means that we will re-evaluate the economics of going ahead with this certification.\n- \u00b7 Operational continuity of the mine was maintained, with no geotechnical issues detected.\n- \u00b7 Cost initiatives resulted in cost savings, although these were more than offset by 7.68% inflation.\n\n## 2022 objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Mitigate the impact of the labour reform through our recruitment campaigns, training and investment in new equipment.\n- \u00b7 Continue exploration in the region, targeting a similar disseminated ore body.\n- \u00b7 Conclude a pilot project to confirm the feasibility for the extraction of ore panels under paste fill.",

The remaining increase was driven by higher contractor costs.\n\nCash cost per ounce of silver increased mainly due to lower gold by-product credits and higher cost per tonne; mitigated by a higher silver ore grade. Margin per ounce decreased to US$23.0 (2020: US$27.3), while margin expressed as a percentage of the silver price decreased from 128.2% in 2020 to 92.6% in 2021.\n\nAll in sustaining cost increased to US$14.0 per ounce due to higher sustaining capex and capitalised mine development.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                                             |   2021 | 2020   | % change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                                          |  537   | 409.3  | 31.2       |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)                                 |  179.1 | 177.1  | 1. 1       |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                                            |  322.7 | 211.7  | 52.4       |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)                                       |   40.9 | 36.3   | 12.7       |\n| Exploration (US$m)                                               |   23.9 | 20.6   | 16.0       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$) (Veins)                                     |   81.5 | 71.8   | 13.5       |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz silver) (Veins)                                |    1.8 | (6.0)  | N/A        |\n| Margin (US$/oz) (Veins)                                          |   23   | 27.3   | (15.8)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) (Veins)                  |   92.6 | 128.2  |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (Veins) (US$)                             |   14   | 5.04   | 177.8      |\n| Cost per tonne (US$) (Disseminated Ore Body)                     |   39.2 | 39.0   | 0.5        |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz silver)   (Disseminated Ore Body)              |    4.8 | 7. 0   | (31.4)     |\n| Margin (US$/oz) (Disseminated Ore Body)                          |   20   | 14.3   | 39.9       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price)  (Disseminated Ore Body) |   80.5 | 67.1   | 20.0       |\n| All in sustaining cost   (Disseminated Ore Body) (US$)           |    6.3 | 8.9    | (29.2)     |\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n (DOB)\n\nCost per tonne remained stable at US$39.2 per tonne, mainly due to the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar, and cost inflation of 7.68% at this mine, which together represented approximately 85% of the total adverse effect. Additionally, the 7.1% decrease in volumes of ore processed further impacted cost per tonne. These adverse effects were practically offset by the decrease in the use of contractors for supporting works.\n\nCash cost decreased 31.4% to US$4.8 per ounce of silver driven by a higher silver ore grade and lower treatment and refining charges, partially offset by the higher cost per tonne and increased special mining rights.\n\nThe 29.2% decrease in all in sustaining cost was mainly driven by the lower cash cost.",

Furthermore, the implementation of the labour reforms adversely impacted the volume of ore processed, driven by increased workforce rotation and lower utilisation rates of equipment, together with an electricity outage by the stateowned utility Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE) in December.\n\nProductivity decreased as the labour reform affected contractor productivity in the second half of the year, impacting volumes processed.\n\nConstruction of the second stage of the third tailings dam commenced and progressed as planned. In addition, the high-tension electrical cable to the district's satellite operations was completed during 2021, helping to lower our future energy costs as our reliance on diesel generators will be reduced.\n\nOur exploration programme continued throughout 2021. While mineralised volumes identified in the satellite zones can be processed utilising the current capacity of the beneficiation plant at Ci\u00e9nega, we will evaluate the possible expansion of the plant if additional mineralisation is discovered in the future.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver reserves increased 2.7% year-on-year, while gold reserves decreased 3.4% as a result of depletion. Silver and gold resources both decreased, down 6.3% and 6.7% respectively due to depletion and a higher cut-off grade.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapex in 2021 totalled US$41.8 million and was allocated primarily to mine development, sustaining capex and safety and environment, including the construction of the tailings dam. In addition, minor investments in IT included the implementation of MineOps Optimiser, which commenced in 4Q 2021 and will continue into\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2021    | 2020    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 227.8   | 248.3   | (8.3)      |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 110.4   | 101.2   | 9.1        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 106.5   | 129.5   | (17.8)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 45.4    | 35.1    | 29.3       |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 8.2     | 6.5     | 26.2       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 86.1    | 76.7    | 12.3       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz gold)                 | (523.1) | (276.2) | (89.4)     |\n| Margin ($/oz)                         | 2,318.1 | 2,068.6 | 12.1       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 129.1   | 115.4   |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)          | 656.1   | 618.3   | 6.1        |\n\nAdjusted revenue decreased 8.3% over 2020, mainly due to lower volumes of gold, silver, lead and zinc sold, mitigated by higher silver, lead and zinc prices. Ci\u00e9nega is the Group's most polymetallic mine, a fact demonstrated by the 64.4% contribution from silver, lead and zinc in 2021 (2020: 56.3%).\n\nCost per tonne increased 12.3% to US$86.1, driven by the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar and cost inflation of 7.84% at this mine, which together represented approximately 80% of the increase. The remaining 20% was primarily the result of higher contractor costs due to an increase in mine development. Additionally, the 2.7% decrease in volume of ore processed further impacted cost per tonne.\n\nThe decrease in cash cost per gold ounce from -US$276.2 per ounce in 2020 to -US$523.1 per ounce in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in silver by-product credits. This was partly offset by a lower gold ore grade and higher cost per tonne. Margin per ounce increased to US$2,318.1 in 2021 (2020: US$2,068.6). Expressed as a percentage of the gold price, the margin increased to 129.1% (2020: 115.4%).\n\nThe US$37.8 per ounce increase in all in sustaining cost was primarily driven by the higher sustaining capex, mitigated by the lower cash cost.\n\n2022, and the personnel training required for the stochastic modelling of the mine's resources, which was not possible due to high workforce rotation in the year. We will resume the focus on training in 2022.\n\n## 2022 outlook\n\nIn 2022, the average gold ore grade is expected to be between 1.20-1.40 g/t, with the silver ore grade expected to average 145-155 g/t.\n\nBudgeted capex for 2022 will continue to be primarily focused on safety and environment, mining works and sustaining capex. In terms of IT, we will continue with the implementation of MineOps Optimiser and will commence the training required for the stochastic modelling of the mine's resources.\n\n## CI\u00c9NEGA\n\n(US$/tonne milled)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2021 |   86.1 |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2020 |   76.7 |\n|   2019 |   78.3 |\n|   2018 |   70.8 |\n|   2017 |   66.5 |\n\n86.1\n\n## CI\u00c9NEGA ORE MILLED PER PERSON (tonnes)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n842\n\n|   2021 | 842   |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2020 | 900   |\n|   2019 | 791   |\n|   2018 | 1,252 |\n|   2017 | 1,322 |\n\n## CI\u00c9NEGA CASH COST\n\n(Gold US$/ounce)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-523.1\n\nGold price             Cash cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- %  figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.",

Furthermore, the internalisation of contractors at this mine, in response to the labour reform, was more efficient than at some of our underground mines, and this limited the impact on contractors' productivity.\n\nDuring the year, we increased the scope of the Carbon in Column project to provide a larger capacity, and this required additional engineering and work during the year. We expect to\n\ncommission the project and ramp up the plant in mid-2022, increasing gold recovery from the old leaching pads.\n\nIn 2019, we began rolling out dual fuel systems into our haulage fleet. This programme involved the installation of engines which are able to automatically switch between powering the trucks by diesel and by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), depending on the terrain. By the end of 2021, the entire 785 and 793 haulage fleet had been converted.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nGold reserves and resources decreased mostly due to depletion, with exploration results and cut-off updates balancing stricter geotechnical and cost assumptions.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 totalled US$105.7 million, which was focused on sustaining capex, mining works, safety and environment,\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2021    | 2020    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 770.8   | 778.9   | (1.0)      |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 440.8   | 361.4   | 22.0       |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 285.3   | 400.5   | (28.8)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 54.4    | 30.2    | 80.1       |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 19.0    | 1 7. 6  | 8.0        |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 21.7    | 18.3    | 18.6       |\n| Cost per tonne hauled (US$)           | 3.5     | 3.3     | 6.1        |\n| Cash cost ($/oz gold)                 | 900.4   | 727.9   | 23.7       |\n| Margin ($/oz)                         | 894.6   | 1,064.5 | (16.0)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 49.8    | 59.4    |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)          | 1,100.2 | 881.9   | 24.8       |\n\nAdjusted revenue remained flat year-on-year due to a similar gold price and volume of gold sold.\n\nCost per tonne of ore deposited increased 18.6%, with the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar and cost inflation of 10.17% at this mine accounting for approximately half of the increase. The remaining increase was primarily driven by: i) the increase of the stripping ratio from 4.5:1 in 2020 to 5.1:1 in 2021; and ii) the adverse effect of recognising unproductive costs within cost of sales but excluded from adjusted production costs during the temporary suspension of mining activities at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 1H20. This was mitigated by efficiencies gained through lower consumption of diesel, explosives and reagents\n\nper tonne processed and the 2.6% increase in the volume of ore processed.\n\nCash cost per gold ounce increased to US$900.4 per ounce of gold mainly as a result of: i) a lower ore grade; ii) higher cost per tonne. These adverse effects were mitigated by the favourable effect of the variation of change in inventories and the lower mining rights. Margin per ounce and margin expressed as a percentage of the gold price decreased to US$894.6 and 49.8%, respectively.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost increased to US$1,100.2 per ounce mainly due to the higher cash cost and increased capitalised stripping.\n\nthe construction of the 14th leaching pad and construction of the activated carbon project. Other investments included big data analysis (SmartOps) to focus on productivity initiatives and predictive maintenance, autonomous equipment, slope monitoring equipment for pit walls and the tailings dam.\n\n## 2022 outlook\n\nGold ore grades in 2022 are expected to be in the range of 0.65-0.75 g/t.\n\nCapex for 2022 will continue to focus primarily on sustaining capex, mining works, construction of the 15th leaching pad and the implementation of the activated carbon process to increase gold recovery. Minor investments scheduled for 2022 also include a technical evaluation of automatic haulage equipment.\n\n## HERRADURA\n\n(US$/tonne deposited)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n21.7\n\n|   2021 | 21.7   |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2020 | 18.3   |\n|   2019 | 18.1   |\n|   2018 | 13.2   |\n|   2017 |        |\n\n## HERRADURA ORE/WASTE MOVED PER PERSON\n\n(tonnes)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2021 | 42,672   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2020 | 39,531   |\n|   2019 | 49,974   |\n|   2018 | 61,510   |\n|   2017 | 72,518   |\n\n## 42,672\n\n## HERRADURA CASH COST\n\n(Gold US$/ounce)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 900.4\n\n|   2021 |       | 900.4 1,795.0 49.8%   |\n|--------|-------|-----------------------|\n|   2020 | 727.9 | 1,792.4 59.4%         |\n|   2019 |       | 818.6 1,418.0 42.3%   |\n|   2018 | 504.0 | 1,269.3 60.3%         |\n|   2017 | 493.4 | 1,267.4 61.1%         |\n\nGold price             Cash cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- %  figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.",

This was partly offset by a lower recovery rate due to shorter irrigation cycles as a result of the ore being deposited in smaller areas as we approach the end of mine life, in addition to increased sulphide content in the ore.\n\nThe focus remained on improving gold recovery and reducing costs by processing ore through the Carbon in Column (CiC) process, which started operations at the beginning of 2020. As we approach the end of mine life, we are beginning to implement our mine closure plan.\n\nProductivity decreased compared to 2020 due to the reduction in volumes hauled as the mine approaches the end of its life.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2021    | 2020    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 169.9   | 152.6   | 11. 3      |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 98.7    | 72.0    | 37.1       |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 77.2    | 53.7    | 43.8       |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 0.4     | 19.7    | (98.0)     |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 1.1     | 1. 6    | (31.3)     |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 11.0    | 10.8    | 1. 9       |\n| Cost per tonne hauled (US$)           | 3.8     | 3.3     | 15.2       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz gold)                 | 1,029.5 | 1,158.5 | (11.1)     |\n| Margin ($/oz)                         | 765.4   | 633.9   | 20.7       |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 42.6    | 35.4    |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)          | 1,122.2 | 1,502.9 | (25.3)     |\n\nAdjusted revenue at Noche Buena increased 11.3% to US$169.9 million as a result of the higher volumes of gold sold.\n\nCost per tonne increased marginally to US$11.0 in 2021, due to: i) the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar, and cost inflation of 9.87% at this mine; ii) increase in the use of contractors; and iii) the adverse effect of recognising unproductive costs from the suspension of mining activities at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic within cost of sales but excluded from adjusted production costs in 2020.

This Financial Review is intended to convey the main factors affecting performance and to provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance understanding of the Group's Financial Statements. All comparisons refer to 2021 figures compared to 2020, unless otherwise noted. The financial information and year-on-year variations are presented in US dollars, except where indicated. The full financial statements and their accompanying notes can be found on pages 220-265.\n\nThe following report presents how we have managed our financial resources.\n\n## Commentary on financial performance\n\nIn 2021, the Group achieved a satisfactory financial performance which was supported by higher metals prices, and partly offset by cost inflation, the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar and Company-specific challenges. In particular, Adjusted revenue increased 9.2% over 2020 primarily due to a higher silver price, while revenue increased 11.2% year-on-year to US$2,703.1 million due to the higher adjusted revenue combined with lower treatment and refining charges. Adjusted production costs 1 increased mainly as a result of 9.6% cost inflation combined with the 5.6% average revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar. These increases were amplified by the higher volumes of ore processed at Herradura and Noche Buena and the increase in waste material moved at Herradura following the lifting of Covid-19 operational restrictions in 1H20, and by increased consumption of operating materials, higher maintenance costs and additional personnel required to comply with the labour reform. Additionally, costs from processing development ore at Juanicipio further increased adjusted production costs. As a result, gross profit and EBITDA increased to US$936.9 million and US$1,206.3 million, a 6.5% and 3.2% increase over 2020 respectively.\n\nWe maintained our strong financial position, with US$1,235.3 million in cash and other liquid funds1 as of 31 December 2021 notwithstanding paying dividends of US$245.6 million in accordance with our policy, investing US$592.1 million in capex and spending US$130.3 million on exploration expenses to underpin our future growth.\n\n## Income Statement\n\n|                                                                                             | 2021   US$ million   | 2020   US$ million   | Amount Change  US$ million   | Change %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue 2                                                                          | 2,847.9              | 2,608.1              | 239.8                        | 9.2        |\n| Total revenue                                                                               | 2,703.1              | 2,430.1              | 273.0                        | 11. 2      |\n| Cost of sales                                                                               | (1,766.2)            | (1,550.7)            | (215.5)                      | 13.9       |\n| Gross profit                                                                                | 936.9                | 879.4                | 57.5                         | 6.5        |\n| Exploration expenses                                                                        | 130.3                | 107.3                | 23.0                         | 21.4       |\n| Operating profit                                                                            | 666.7                | 649.7                | 1 7. 0                       | 2.6        |\n| EBITDA 3                                                                                    | 1,206.3              | 1,169.1              | 37.2                         | 3.2        |\n| Income tax expense including special mining rights                                          | 173.1                | 175.6                | (2.5)                        | (1.4)      |\n| Profit for the period                                                                       | 438.5                | 375.6                | 62.9                         | 16.7       |\n| Profit for the period, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects                              | 438.8                | 325.9                | 112.9                        | 34.6       |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share (US$/share)  4                                         | 0.572                | 0.508                | 0.064                        | 12.6       |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects   (US$/share) | 0.572                | 0.440                | 0.132                        | 30.0       |\n\nThe Group's financial results are largely determined by the performance of our operations.

These include:\n\n## Metals prices\n\nThe average realised silver price increased 16.9% from US$21.3 per ounce in 2020 to US$24.9 per ounce in 2021, while the average realised gold price remained flat year-on-year at US$1,795.0 per ounce in 2021 (up 0.1%). Furthermore, the average realised lead and zinc by-product prices increased 21.6% and 31.7% over the previous year, to US$1.00 and US$1.39 per pound, respectively.\n\n- 1 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs. The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving production costs in terms of the different stages involved in the mining and plant processes, including efficiencies and inefficiencies as the case may be and other factors outside the Company's control such as cost inflation or changes in accounting criteria.\n- 2 Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and metals prices hedging.\n- 3 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is calculated as profit for the year from continuing operations before income tax, less finance income, plus finance costs, less foreign exchange gain/(loss), less revaluation effects of the Silverstream contract and other operating income plus other operating expenses and depreciation.\n- 4 The weighted average number of Ordinary Shares was 736,893,589 for 2021 and 2020.

        "page_content": "## MX$/US$ exchange rate\n\nThe Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2021 was $20.58 per US dollar, compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2020 of $19.95 per US dollar. The 3.2% spot devaluation had an adverse effect on taxes and mining rights as it resulted in an increase in related deferred tax liabilities. It also affected the net monetary peso asset position, which contributed to the US$1.9 million foreign exchange loss recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate appreciated by 5.6% from $21.49 per US dollar in 2020 to $20.28 per US dollar in 2021. As a result, there was an adverse effect of US$36.0 million on the Group's costs denominated in Mexican pesos (approximately 45% of total costs) when converted to US dollars.\n\n## Cost inflation\n\nIn 2021, cost inflation was 9.6%. The main components of our cost inflation basket are listed below:\n\n## Labour\n\nUnionised employees received on average a 6.5% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, while non-unionised employees received on average a 4.0% increase in wages in Mexican pesos; when converted to US dollars, this resulted in a weighted average labour inflation of 12.0%.\n\n## Energy\n\n## Electricity\n\nThe weighted average cost of electricity in US dollars increased 12.6% from US$7.77 cents per kW in 2020 to US$8.74 cents per kW in 2021, due to the higher average generating cost of the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the national utility.\n\n## Diesel\n\nThe weighted average cost of diesel in US dollars increased 21.8% to 87.9 US cents per litre in 2021, compared to 72.2 US cents per litre in 2020. This was primarily due to the global economic recovery following the sharp slowdown in trade in 1H20 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Operating materials\n\n|                                             | Year over year  change in unit  price %   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Steel balls for milling                     | 11. 9                                     |\n| Sodium cyanide                              | 9.8                                       |\n| Other reagents                              | 8.0                                       |\n| Lubricants                                  | 5.7                                       |\n| Steel for drilling                          | 5.2                                       |\n| Explosives                                  | 2.8                                       |\n| Tyres                                       | 0.8                                       |\n| Weighted average of all operating materials | 6.2                                       |\n\nUnit prices of the majority of our key operating materials increased in US dollar terms. This was primarily driven by higher demand for some of these products as global mining activity recovered following the adverse impact of Covid-19, while several mines and projects worldwide also continued to ramp up production. As a result, the weighted average unit prices of all operating materials increased year-on-year by 6.2%.\n\n## Contractors\n\nAgreements are signed individually with each contractor company and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, amongst others. Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs. In 2021, increases per unit (i.e. per metre developed/per tonne hauled) granted to contractors whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulted in a weighted average increase of approximately 9.5% in US dollars, after considering the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nUnit prices of spare parts for maintenance increased by 4.5% on average in US dollar terms.\n\n## Other costs\n\nOther cost components include freight which increased by an estimated 7.0% in US dollars, while insurance costs increased by 15.3% in US dollars mainly due to higher market premiums as a result of Covid-19 claims. The remaining cost inflation components experienced average deflation of 0.3% in US dollars over 2020.\n\nThe effects of the above external factors, combined with the Group's internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.",

Treatment and refining charges decreased 20.5% as explained below. As a result, total revenue rose to US$2,703.1 million, an 11.2% increase against 2020.\n\n## Adjusted revenue 1 by metal\n\n|                        | 2021        | 2021   | 2020        | 2020   |                                |                               |                                 |       |\n|------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------|\n|                        | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %      | Volume  Variance   US$ million | Price  Variance   US$ million | Total net  change   US$ million | %     |\n| Gold                   | 1,305.2     | 45.8   | 1,327.9     | 50.9   | (24.6)                         | 1. 9                          | (22.7)                          | (1.7) |\n| Silver                 | 1,163.9     | 40.9   | 970.5       | 37.2   | 27.7                           | 165.8                         | 193.4                           | 19.9  |\n| Lead                   | 11 7. 4     | 4.1    | 104.9       | 4.0    | (9.3)                          | 21.8                          | 12.5                            | 11. 9 |\n| Zinc                   | 261.3       | 9.2    | 204.7       | 7. 9   | (7.3)                          | 63.9                          | 56.6                            | 27.7  |\n| Total adjusted revenue | 2,847.9     | 100.0  | 2,608.1     | 100.0  | (13.6)                         | 253.4                         | 239.8                           | 9.2   |\n\nThe higher silver, zinc and lead prices resulted in a positive effect on Adjusted revenue of US$253.4 million. This was partially offset by the US$13.6 million adverse effect of the lower volumes of gold, lead and zinc sold, mitigated by higher silver sales volumes. The lower gold volumes sold were primarily due to a lower ore grade at Ci\u00e9nega and Herradura, and a lower ore grade and volume of ore processed at San Juli\u00e1n Veins, while the higher silver volumes resulted from the higher ore grade at San Juli\u00e1n DOB and the contribution of development ore from Juanicipio (for further details, see 2021 Operational Review).\n\nChanges in the contribution by metal were the result of the relative changes in metals prices and volumes produced. The contribution of gold to total adjusted revenues decreased from 50.9% in 2020 to 45.8% in 2021, while that for silver increased from 37.2% in 2020 to 40.9% in 2021.\n\n## Adjusted revenue by mine\n\nHerradura continued to be the greatest contributor to Adjusted revenue, representing 27.1% (2020: 30.0%). Saucito's contribution reduced to 21.0% in 2021 (2020: 22.8%) driven by the lower volumes of silver sold, mitigated by the higher silver price and increased volumes of gold sold. Fresnillo remained the third most important contributor to Adjusted revenue, with its share increasing to 16.1% (2020: 15.6%). San Juli\u00e1n's contribution to the Group's Adjusted revenue increased to 18.8% in 2021 (2020: 15.6%) primarily due to the increase in volumes of silver sold as a result of the higher silver ore grade at the DOB. Ci\u00e9nega's contribution to the Group's Adjusted revenue decreased to 8.0% (2020: 9.6%) as a result of the lower gold and silver volumes sold, mitigated by the higher silver price. Noche Buena's contribution to Adjusted revenue remained stable at 6.0% in 2021 (5.8% in 2020).\n\nThe contribution by metal and by mine to Adjusted revenues is expected to change further in the future, as new projects are incorporated into the Group's operations and as precious metals prices fluctuate.\n\n|                    | 2021          | 2021   | 2020          | 2020   |\n|--------------------|---------------|--------|---------------|--------|\n|                    | (US$ million) | %      | (US$ million) | %      |\n| Herradura          | 770.8         | 27.1   | 778.9         | 29.9   |\n| Saucito            | 597.7         | 21.0   | 593.6         | 22.8   |\n| Fresnillo          | 459.5         | 16.1   | 407.2         | 15.6   |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (DOB)   | 344.5         | 12.1   | 218.0         | 8.3    |\n| Ci\u00e9nega            | 227.8         | 8.0    | 248.3         | 9.6    |\n| San Juli\u00e1n (Veins) | 192.5         | 6.7    | 191.2         | 7. 3   |\n| Noche Buena        | 169.9         | 6.0    | 152.6         | 5.8    |\n| Juanicipio         | 85.2          | 3.0    | 18.3          | 0.7    |\n| Total              | 2,847.9       | 100    | 2,608.1       | 100    |\n\n- 1 Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and metals prices hedging.",

Similar to last year's transaction, this was structured as a collar with an average floor price of US$22 per ounce, and an average price ceiling of US$50.33 per ounce.\n\nAdditionally, a portion of our by-product zinc production during 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 was hedged using a similar financial structure to that of silver.\n\nThe table below illustrates the expired structures, their results and the outstanding volume as of 31 December 2021.\n\n| Concept                   | As of 31 December 2021   | As of 31 December 2021   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                           | Silver 1                 | Zinc 2                   |\n| Weighted floor            | 20.60 US$/oz             | 2,491 US$/tonne          |\n| Weighted cap              | 49.79 US$/oz             | 3,130 US$/tonne          |\n| Expired volume            | 5,748,000 oz             | 16,960 tonnes            |\n| Profit/Loss (US$ dollars) | 0                        | (1,351,186)              |\n| Total outstanding volume  | 300,000 oz               | 5,960 tonnes             |\n\n## Treatment and refining charges\n\nTreatment and refining charges 3 are reviewed annually using international benchmarks. Treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc concentrate decreased in dollar terms by 14.6% and 39.6% respectively. Furthermore, silver refining charges remained flat over the year. The decrease in treatment charges per tonne of lead and zinc, combined with the lower volumes of lead and zinc concentrates shipped from our mines to Met-Mex, resulted in a 20.5% decrease in treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement in absolute terms when compared to 2020.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\n| Concept                                                                           | 2021   US$ million   | 2020   US$ million   | Amount   US$ million   | Change %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted production costs 4                                                       | 1,255.1              | 1,079.1              | 176.0                  | 16.3       |\n| Depreciation                                                                      | 528.2                | 505.4                | 22.8                   | 4.5        |\n| Profit sharing                                                                    | 15.6                 | 18.7                 | (3.1)                  | 16.6       |\n| Hedging                                                                           | (3.8)                | (4.1)                | 0.3                    | (7.7)      |\n| Change in work in progress                                                        | (29.6)               | (66.4)               | 36.8                   | (55.4)     |\n| Unproductive costs including inventory reversal and unabsorbed production costs 5 | 0.8                  | 18.0                 | (17.2)                 | (95.6)     |\n| Cost of sales                                                                     | 1,766.2              | 1,550.7              | 215.5                  | 13.9       |\n\nCost of sales increased 13.9% to US$1,766.2 million in 2021. The US$215.5 million increase is due to a combination of the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 An increase in Adjusted production costs (+US$176.0 million). This was primarily due to: i) cost inflation, excluding the Mexican peso vs. US dollar revaluation effect (US$66.2 million); ii) the adverse effect of the 5.6% revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. US dollar average exchange rate (US$36.0 million) 6 ; iii) a higher volume of material moved at Herradura and Noche Buena following the lifting of Covid-19 operational restrictions in 1H20 (US$51.8 million); iv) increased development and infrastructure works at our underground mines, maintenance, personnel, consumption of operating materials (US$41.2 million); v) costs from the start-up of operations at Juanicipio (US$14.0 million); and vi) higher stripping ratio at Herradura (US$12.1 million). These adverse effects were mitigated by a decreased volume of ore processed at our underground mines (-US$43.5 million) and others (-US$1.8 million).\n- \u00b7 The variation in the change in work in progress had a negative effect of US$36.8 million versus 2020. This resulted mainly from the recognition of a smaller favourable effect from the reassessment of recoverable gold inventories at the leaching pads in 2021 compared to that recognised in 2020, together with the increase in the cost per ounce in the last quarter of the year at Herradura: US$29.6 million in 2021 vs. US$66.4 million in 2020.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation (+US$22.8 million). This is mainly due to higher depreciation at Noche Buena as it approaches the end of its mine life and increased amortisation of capitalised mining works and increased depletion factors at Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n.\n- \u00b7 Profit sharing (-US$3.1 million).\n- \u00b7 Mexican peso/US dollar hedging (+US$0.3 million). As part of our programme to manage our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with costs incurred in Mexican pesos, we entered into a combination of put and call options structured at zero cost (collars) in 2021. These derivatives finally expired in March 2021 and they generated a positive result of US$3.8 million during the first quarter of 2021. As of 31 December 2021, there was no further outstanding position.\n\n## These negative effects were mitigated by:\n\n- \u00b7 The variation in unproductive costs, which had a favourable effect of US$17.2 million. In 2021, US$0.8 million was registered as unproductive costs related to fixed production cost (labour cost and depreciation) incurred in Minera San Juli\u00e1n due to a shortfall in electricity; in 2020 US$18.0 million was registered in relation to costs incurred during the partial stoppages at Herradura and Noche Buena as a result of the Covid-19 measures imposed by the state government.\n- 3 Treatment and refining charges include the cost of treatment and refining as well as the margin charged by the refiner.\n- 4 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs. The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving production costs in terms of the different stages involved in the mining and plant processes, including efficiencies and inefficiencies as the case may be and other factors outside the Company's control such as cost inflation or changes in accounting criteria.\n- 5 Unproductive costs primarily include unabsorbed production costs such as fixed production cost (labour cost and depreciation) incurred in Minera San Juli\u00e1n due to a shortfall in electricity and fixed costs incurred in Minera Penmont during the temporary suspension of mining activities at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and other costs related to the subsequent ramp-up of operations and the underutilisation of production capacity once mining activity was resumed. Unproductive costs are recognised within cost of sales but excluded from adjusted production costs.\n- 6 Cost inflation of 9.55% (including the effect of the Mexican peso revaluation) had an adverse effect of US$102.2 million (the sum of i and ii).",

These positive effects were partially offset by: i) cost inflation, including the effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso (-US$102.2 million); ii) the smaller favourable effect from the reassessment of recoverable gold inventories at the leaching pads in 2021 compared to the one recorded in 2020 (-US$58.0 million); iii) an increase in cost related to development, infrastructure, maintenance and increased workforce, mainly at Saucito, and Fresnillo (-US$41.2 million); iv) the adverse effect of lower volumes processed at the underground mines, net of the positive impact from the higher volume of ore processed at the open pit mines (-US$40.9 million); v) higher volume moved at Herradura due to continuous operations in 2021 vs. the disruption in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic (-US$32.1 million); vi) higher depreciation (-US$22.8 million); and vii) higher stripping at Herradura (-US$12.1 million).\n\nHerradura remained the largest contributor to the Group's consolidated gross profit despite recording a decrease in its percentage share from 43.4% in 2020 to 30.7% in 2021. Saucito remained the second largest contributor to consolidated gross profit, albeit decreasing its participation to 22.7% in 2021 as a result of its relative weighting. The higher silver grade at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB), together with the higher silver, lead and zinc prices, resulted in a US$171.5 million gross profit in 2021, increasing its contribution from 8.4% in 2020 to 18.7% in 2021. San Juli\u00e1n replaced Fresnillo as the third largest contributor to consolidated gross profit despite an increase in Fresnillo's percentage share from 12.7% in 2020 to 14.7% in 2021. Ci\u00e9nega's share of the Group's total gross profit decreased to 4.6% in 2021, while Noche Buena's contribution continued to decrease as it approaches the end of its mine life. Notwithstanding, Noche Buena generated an EBITDA and cash flow from operating activities of US$66.6 million and US$75.2 million, respectively, recording a US$24.7 million gross profit.\n\n## Contribution by mine to consolidated gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses\n\n|                                      | 2021        | 2021   | 2020        | 2020   | Change      | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|----------|\n|                                      | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %      | US$ million | %        |\n| Herradura                            | 281.1       | 30.6   | 372.3       | 43.4   | (91.2)      | (24.5)   |\n| Saucito                              | 208.7       | 22.7   | 200.2       | 23.4   | 8.5         | 4.2      |\n| San Juli\u00e1n                           | 173.1       | 18.8   | 71.9        | 8.4    | 101.2       | 140.8    |\n| Fresnillo                            | 136.7       | 14.9   | 109.1       | 12.7   | 27.6        | 25.3     |\n| Juanicipio                           | 53.5        | 5.8    | 0.0         | 0.0    | 53.5        | N/A      |\n| Ci\u00e9nega                              | 42.5        | 4.6    | 64.4        | 7. 5   | (21.9)      | (34.0)   |\n| Noche Buena                          | 23.5        | 2.6    | 39.0        | 4.6    | (15.5)      | (39.7)   |\n| Total for operating mines            | 919.1       | 100    | 856.9       | 100    | 62.2        | 7. 3     |\n| Metal hedging and other subsidiaries | 1 7. 8      |        | 22.5        |        | (4.7)       | (20.9)   |\n| Total Fresnillo plc                  | 936.9       |        | 879.4       |        | 57.5        | 6.5      |\n\n## Administrative and corporate expenses\n\nAdministrative and corporate expenses increased 10.8% from US$93.4 million in 2020 to US$103.5 million in 2021, due to an increase in fees paid to advisers (legal, labour, tax and technical), the increase in non-recurring corporate services provided by Servicios Industriales Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. and the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs. the US dollar.",

The year-on-year increase of US$23.0 million was due to our intensified exploration activities aimed at increasing the resource base, converting resources into reserves and improving the confidence of the grade distribution in reserves. An additional US$9.8 million was capitalised, mainly relating to exploration expenses at the Juanicipio project. As a result, risk capital invested in exploration totalled US$140.1 million in 2021, compared to US$115.8 million in 2020(of which US$8.5 million was capitalised) This represents a yearon-year increase of 21.0%.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n|                                                     | 2021   US$ million   | 2020   US$ million   | Amount   US$ million   | Change %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Profit from continuing operations before income tax | 611.5                | 551.3                | 60.2                   | 10.9       |\n| - Finance income                                    | (8.9)                | (12.2)               | 3.3                    | (27.0)     |\n| + Finance costs                                     | 61.8                 | 141.3                | (79.5)                 | (56.3)     |\n| - Revaluation effects of Silverstream contract      | 0.4                  | (71.0)               | 71.4                   | N/A        |\n| - Foreign exchange loss, net                        | 1.9                  | 40.3                 | (38.4)                 | (95.3)     |\n| - Other operating income                            | (11.9)               | (10.0)               | (1.9)                  | 19.0       |\n| + Other operating expense                           | 23.3                 | 14.8                 | 8.5                    | 57.4       |\n| + Depreciation                                      | 528.2                | 505.4                | 22.8                   | 4.5        |\n| + Depreciation included in unproductive costs       | -                    | 9.2                  | (9.2)                  | (100.0)    |\n| EBITDA                                              | 1,206.3              | 1,169.1              | 37.2                   | 3.2        |\n| EBITDA margin                                       | 44.6                 | 48.1                 | -                      | -          |\n\nEBITDA is a gauge of the Group's financial performance and a key indicator to measure debt capacity. It is calculated as profit for the year from continuing operations before income tax, less finance income, plus finance costs, less foreign exchange gain/(loss), less the net Silverstream effects and other operating income plus other operating expenses and depreciation. In 2021, EBITDA increased 3.2% to US$1,206.3 million primarily driven by the higher gross profit, partly offset by higher exploration and administrative expenses. As a result, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased, from 48.1% in 2020 to 44.6% in 2021.\n\n## Other operating income and expense\n\nIn 2021, a net loss of US$11.3 million was recognised in the income statement mainly as a result of maintenance costs of closed mines and remediation works at both a tailings facility at Fresnillo and at Saucito, following the presence of high temperature water in an underground production area.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\n## Silverstream effects\n\nThe Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. The net Silverstream effect recorded in the 2021 income statement was a small loss of US$0.4 million (US$43.0 million amortisation profit and US$43.4 million revaluation loss), which compared negatively to the net gain of US$71.0 million registered in 2020. The negative revaluation was mainly driven by the decrease in the forward silver price curve, increase in the LIBOR reference rate; and a decrease in the production plan following an update to the Sabinas silver resource; partially mitigated by higher inflation expectations and amortisation effects.\n\nSince the IPO, cumulative cash received has been US$736.3 million vs. US$350 million initially paid in 2007. The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses related to the valuation of the Silverstream will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract. Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section in notes 13 and 29 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Net finance costs\n\nNet finance costs of US$52.9 million compared favourably to the US$129.1 million recorded in 2020. The US$76.2 million decrease was primarily due to payments made in 2020, which did not apply in 2021, in relation to: i) the US$60.8 million premium paid on early redemption of 60.2% of the existing US$800 million principal senior notes due 2023; and ii) US$24.9 million in interest and surcharges, which resulted from the 2020 tax amendment agreed with the Mexican Tax Administration Service.\n\nThe 2021 net finance costs mainly reflected: i) interest paid on the outstanding US$317.9 million from the US$800 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023, and ii) interest paid on the US$850 million principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. Detailed information is provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. A portion of the interest from the Senior Notes is capitalised, hence not included in finance costs. During the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group capitalised US$8.4 million of borrowing costs (2020: US$8.8 million).\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nA foreign exchange loss of US$1.9 million was recorded as a result of the 3.2% devaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar over the period. This compared favourably to the US$40.3 million loss in 2020.\n\nThe Group also enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in euro (EUR) and Swedish krona (SEK). As of 31 December 2021, the total EUR and SEK outstanding net forward position was EUR 25.7 million and SEK 5.1 million with maturity dates through September 2022. Volumes that expired during 2021 were EUR 16.3 million with a weighted average strike of 1.2012 USD/EUR and SEK 25.36 million with a weighted average strike of 8.5703 SEK/ USD, which have generated a marginal loss in the period of -US$0.7 million.\n\n## Taxation\n\nIncome tax expense for the period was US$156.5 million, which was similar to that of US$140.6 million in 2020. The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was 25.6%, which was below the 30% statutory tax rate. The reason for the lower effective tax rate was the significant permanent differences between the tax and the accounting treatment related mainly to: i) the inflation rate which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (-US$49.4 million); ii) the border zone tax benefit which benefited the Herradura and Noche Buena operations (-US$10.1 million); and iii) special mining right taxable for corporate income tax (-US$5.0 million). These factors were partially offset by: i) the devaluation of the Mexican peso which had an important impact on the tax value of assets and liabilities (US$32.1 million); and ii) deferred tax assets not recognised (US$6.5 million).\n\nThe effective tax rate in 2020 was 25.5% mainly due to: i) the border zone tax benefit which benefited the Herradura and Noche Buena operations (-US$35.8 million); ii) the inflation rate which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (-US$23.0 million); iii) taxable/ deductible foreign exchange effects for Mexican tax purposes (-US$16.9 million); and iv) special mining right taxable for corporate income tax (-US$10.5 million). These factors were partially offset by: i) the devaluation of the Mexican peso which had an important impact on the tax value of assets and liabilities (US$55.1 million); and ii) deferred tax assets not recognised (US$4.9 million).\n\nMining rights in 2021 were US$16.6 million compared to US$35.0 million charged in 2020.\n\n## Profit for the period\n\nProfit for the period increased from US$375.6 million in 2020 to US$438.5 million in 2021, a 16.8% increase year-on-year as a result of the factors described above.\n\nExcluding the effects of the Silverstream contract, profit for the year increased from US$325.9 million to US$438.8 million, a 34.6% increase.",

Working capital decreased US$58.0 million, mainly due to: i) a US$85.6 million decrease in accounts receivable due to: a) decrease in trade receivables from related parties (US$61.8 million); b) VAT recovered (US$30.0 million); c) MXP/USD exchange rate effect (-US$7.9 million); and others d) US$1.7 million); and ii) a US$19.2 million increase in accounts payable. This was partly offset by: i) an increase in ore inventories of US$44.6 million; and ii) a US$2.2 million increase in prepayments.\n\nTaxes and employee profit sharing paid increased 206.0% over 2020 to US$371.1 million mainly due to: i) an increase in provisional tax payments resulting from the higher profit factor determined to calculate the estimated taxable income; ii) higher final income tax paid in March 2021, net of provisional taxes paid (corresponding to the 2020 tax fiscal year); iii) an increase in mining rights; and iv) higher profit sharing paid.\n\nAs a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities decreased 2.5% from US$917.7 million in 2020 to US$895.1 million in 2021.\n\nThe Group received other sources of cash, including: i) capital contribution and note payable by minority shareholders in subsidiaries of US$73.6 million; and ii) the proceeds of the Silverstream contract of US$49.0 million.\n\nFurthermore, in December 2020, the Group entered into multiple contracts with Orla Mining Ltd., granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo oxide pit onto Fresnillo's mineral concession. The effectiveness of the agreement was subject to the approval of the Mexican Federal Competition Commission (COFECE), which was granted in February 2021, at which time, a payment of US$25.0 million was made to Fresnillo plc (See note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).",

The 2021 payment included the 2020 final dividend of 23.5 cents per share paid in June 2021, totalling US$172.6 million, and the 2021 interim dividend paid in September of US$73.0 million.\n- iii)  Financial expenses and foreign exchange effects of US$39.9 million decreased US$4.3 million vs. 2020. Financial expenses in 2021 included: i) interest paid on the outstanding US$317.9 million from the US$800 million 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023, and ii) interest paid on the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. In 2020, financial expenses reflected the interest paid in relation to the US$800 million Senior Notes due 2023 before the tender offer in October 2020, ii) the interest paid on the remaining US$317.9 million of outstanding debt following the tender offer.\n\nThe sources and uses of funds described above resulted in an increase in net cash of US$164.9 million (net increase in cash and other liquid assets), which combined with the US$1,070.4 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash and other liquid assets of US$1,235.3 million at the end of December 2021.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nFresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position during the period with cash and other liquid funds 1 of US$1,235.3 million as of 31 December 2021, increasing 15.4% versus 31 December 2020. Taking into account the cash and other liquid funds of US$1,235.3 million and the US$1,167.8 million outstanding Senior Notes, Fresnillo plc's net cash was US$67.5 million as of 31 December 2021. This compares to the net debt position of US$97.4 million as of 31 December 2020. Considering these variations, the balance sheet at 31 December 2021 remains strong, with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of -0.06x 2 .\n\nInventories increased 10.1% to US$487.8 million mainly due to the increase of the inventories of gold content in ore on leaching pads valued at cost.\n\nTrade and other receivables decreased 15.0% to US$436.1 million as a result of reduced receivables to Met-Mex and a decrease in value added tax receivables.\n\nThe change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$576.1 million at the end of 2020 to US$529.5 million as of 31 December 2021 reflects proceeds of US$46.2 million corresponding to 2021 (US$49.0 million in cash and -US$2.8 million in accounts receivables) and the Silverstream effect in the income statement of -US$0.4 million.\n\nThe net book value of property, plant and equipment was US$2,799.1 million at 31 December 2021, representing a 3.4% increase over 31 December 2020. The US$90.9 million increase was mainly due to construction of leaching pads, capitalised development works and the purchase of in-mine equipment.\n\nThe Group's total equity was US$3,802.7 million as of 31 December 2021, a 5.2% increase over 31 December 2020. This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2021 profit.\n\n- 1 Cash and other liquid funds are disclosed in note 30(c) to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 2 Net debt is calculated as debt at 31 December 2021 less Cash and other liquid funds at 31 December 2021 divided by the EBITDA generated in the last 12 months.",

        "page_content": "## Dividends\n\nBased on the Group's 2021 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of 24.0 US cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 27 May 2022 to shareholders on the register on 29 April 2022. The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars. This is in addition to the interim dividend of 9.90 US cents per share amounting to US$73.0 million. This final dividend is higher than the previous year due to the higher profit in 2021, and remains in line with the Group's dividend policy (see page 7).\n\nAs previously disclosed, the corporate income tax reform introduced in Mexico in 2014 created a withholding tax obligation of 10% relating to the payment of dividends, including to foreign nationals.\n\nHistorically the Company has been making dividend payments out of retained earnings generated before the tax reform came into force and no withholding tax has therefore been applied. Dividend payments relating to 2021 and future years will attract the withholding obligation. However, foreign shareholders may be able to recover such tax depending on their tax residence and the existence of double taxation agreements.",

        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chairman of the Health, Safety, Environment & Community Relations (HSECR) Committee\n\n## Dear Shareholder,\n\nWe are committed to our Purpose: 'Contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold'. This means delivering a strong business performance while earning the trust of our people, communities, governments and society at large. On behalf of the Board, the HSECR Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Company's strategies to manage matters concerned with Health, Safety, Environment & Community Relations (HSECR).\n\nAt the time of writing this letter, Covid-19 remains an unparalleled challenge. We have ensured that our workforce and neighbouring communities remain our number one priority in response to Covid-19. During the year, the Committee monitored the effectiveness of the Company's preventive measures and the strategy to engage with our workforce including our unionised and non-unionised employees and contractors. Preventive measures include: vaccination, mandatory use of masks, control of entry points, social distancing, hygiene and disinfection measures, testing, contact tracing, self-quarantine and monitoring of suspected and confirmed cases. We have made significant progress in the vaccination of our workforce by collaborating with public health authorities, supporting the logistics of vaccination centres and engaging our workforce on the benefits of vaccination. We recognise that the variants of concern bring additional uncertainty regarding transmission, the severity of disease and the effectiveness of vaccines. Therefore, the Committee will continue to closely monitor the approach and effectiveness of the measures to minimise the impacts of Covid-19 on our workforce and the communities where we operate.\n\nWhile we recognise the importance of Covid-19 and have prioritised our response, we have also ensured that the Company made solid progress on Safety, tailing storage facilities (TSF) management, Community Relations and climate change disclosures within the Framework of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). As Chairman of the HSECR Committee, I am pleased to present the activities that the HSECR Committee undertook during the year.\n\nSafety remains a top priority for the Committee. Despite the sustained improvement in total and lost time injury frequency rates, I deeply regret to report that one fatal accident occurred in 2021 and another in early 2022. The regrettable loss of our colleagues is unacceptable and our most sincere condolences go out to their families. We are firmly committed to eliminating fatal injuries. To this end, the Committee has reviewed the progress of the High Potential Incident and Critical Risk Control programmes. The Company is sharing the lessons learnt following every accident or high potential incident with our employees and contractors across all our operations. Management and the workforce are collaborating to identify, design, implement and verify on-site the critical controls to prevent fatal and serious injuries. The Committee reviewed the approach and effectiveness of the 'I Care, We Care' programme in fostering leadership, accountability, safety culture, risk-based management and engineering systems, and lessons learnt. These are among the positive steps we have taken towards the Company's goal of zero-fatalities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Committee also reviewed progress in the Company's approach to the safe management of tailing storage facilities (TSFs). Engineering and Governance Structures are in place to ensure that the Company's stewardship of TSFs meets internationally recognised best practices. The Company recruited internationallyrenowned experts to operate an Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP) that advises on the design, construction, operation and closure of TSFs. Long term agreements have been signed with several internationally-recognised engineering consultancies to lead Dam Safety Reviews (DSRs) and Dam Safety Inspections (DSIs), to recommend required improvement actions and then provide qualified Engineers of Record (EoRs) for the Company's TSFs. The Company's Tailings Management and Stewardship Team comprises qualified professionals fully dedicated to implementing governance controls and engineering best practices. In 2021, the Company invested US$70 million, including to improve our monitoring through sensors and technology, carry out remedial reinforcing of some of our TSFs and benefit from highly trained and responsible executives fully dedicated to TSF management, as well as to hire top consultants. The Company CAPEX in 2022 will amount to US$60 million. In recognition of the importance of TSF management, this strategic topic was part of all our HSECR meetings in 2021.\n\nWater is a valuable resource. We closely monitor the Company's performance and the expectations of our stakeholders regarding water stewardship. New technologies in mineral processing play a key role in making tailings safer and reducing our water and carbon footprints. We have reviewed the approach followed by the Company to evaluate and adopt new technologies based on: i) safety improvements; ii) impacts on the efficiency of our operations; and iii) a reduction in environmental footprint and risks. The Company actively explores strategic opportunities to develop and research new technologies in tailings and water management.\n\nThe Company has collaborated remarkably closely with public health authorities in Mexico to support vaccination in the regions where we operate. The Company also helps to provide transport for communities, accommodation\n\nfor health authorities, and facilities and volunteers for vaccination campaigns. This effort has significantly increased the vaccination coverage of our workforce and neighbouring communities. Additionally, the Company supported the safe return to school in the regions where we operate, sharing preventive measures and donating masks and sanitising products. In partnership with Larousse Foundation, we donated books to our communities and produced Covid-19 preventive videos for children, with the support of INNOVEC. The Company also pursued its capacity building programmes with the appropriate Covid-19 preventive measures. In addition, I am pleased to announce the reinstatement of our Health Week in Penmont with the support of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Foundation, local health authorities and the Sonora Centre of the Teleton Foundation.\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time. The Company is following a structured approach to maturing its understanding of the physical and transition impacts of climate change, as well as aligning reporting to the principles of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Additionally, the Company joined the Mexican TCFD Consortium to promote and share best practices. Wherever feasible, renewable sources of electricity are used by our operating subsidiaries, with the aim of increasing the role of renewables in our overall energy portfolio. However, the Mexican Government's current energy policies present challenges to the development of clean energies. An energy reform was submitted to Congress to increase government control of the energy sector. This reform, in its current form, would allocate over half of the wholesale electricity market to the state-owned power utility CFE, cancel the self-supply mechanism used by private companies and eliminate requirements for Clean Energy Certificates, which is the most important decarbonisation policy instrument of the Mexican Power Sector. The Committee will follow any energy policy developments in Mexico with great interest.\n\nThe Committee has closely monitored the development of the Company's strategy to increase the participation of women. The\n\nCompany has conducted surveys and focus groups to gain a deeper understanding of the expectations and concerns of the workforce on Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). This evaluation identified positive signs regarding the level of awareness of DEI and provided valuable feedback to the Board in order to strengthen the Company's DEI programmes. In 2021, we also evaluated progress of Fresnillo's Ethics Culture and reviewed the Modern slavery report.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role and duties of the HSECR Committee are set out in its terms of reference, a copy of which can be found on the Company's website at www.fresnilloplc.com\n\n## HSECR Committee Membership\n\n- \u00b7 Mr. Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez (Chairman), Dame Judith Macgregor, Mr. Fernando Ruiz and Mrs. Georgina Kessel.\n- \u00b7 Key contributors: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operations Officer, CEO Engineering Services (Pe\u00f1oles Baluarte), Safety Assistant VP, Head of Legal, Compliance Officer, Sustainability and Community Relations Assistant VP and Human Resources Assistant VP.\n\n## HSECR Committee Activity\n\nDuring the year, the Committee met in accordance with its terms of reference.\n\nI am very pleased to report that during 2021 Fresnillo was recognised as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere and remained a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index. Creating a sustainable business is a continuous journey, and we continue to be fully committed to making further improvements on ESG issues that are significant to the Company and its stakeholders.\n\nWe remain dedicated to promoting a long-term focus and to rigorous analysis of the Company's HSECR strategy and performance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nChairman, Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations Committee",

This belief underlines the importance of integrating responsible business practices deeply into our business model and considering factors that affect stakeholders at every critical decision-making level.\n\n## OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE MINING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graphic below shows how we assess the materiality of non-financial issues:\n\n## STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION\n\nOur relevant stakeholders are identified by a multidisciplinary team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ISSUE IDENTIFICATION\n\nWe identify issues relevant to our industry by monitoring and evaluating international trends, regulations and ESG questionnaires.\n\n## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\n\nWe engage our internal and external stakeholders to assess the current relevance of issues and the expected relevance in ten years.\n\nThe year saw many examples of our commitment to contribute to 'the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold'. For example, throughout our response to Covid-19 we made sure that our people and communities were always our number one priority. In addition, our initiative to achieve excellence in the safety and governance of our tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is enhancing our resilience and maintaining the trust of our stakeholders.\n\nOur initiatives regarding renewable energy, intelligent mine ventilation and innovative dual fuel trucks also give us the flexibility to transition to a low-carbon economy, while reducing operating costs. Furthermore, our closed-circuit processes, reuse of municipal wastewater, and collaboration with authorities and communities strengthen our water stewardship strategy to ensure water access for our operations and social acceptability. We have also adapted our community engagement and social investment portfolio to support our communities during the Covid-19 emergency.\n\n## Our priorities\n\nWe engage our stakeholders in order to better understand the issues that matter to them and are material to our business.\n\nThis process, known as materiality assessment, helps us focus our sustainability strategy and reporting. Because society and our industry are dynamic, and expectations shift over time, we conduct in-depth materiality assessments every few years. Covid-19 brought unprecedented challenges and became the most relevant issue with implications for our main stakeholders. In this Annual Report, we focus on the issues that are currently or expected to be significantly relevant.

Our aspiration was 'a well-established ethics culture demonstrated by our behaviours and actions'. We have deployed this ethics culture initiative in two phases:\n\n- \u00b7 Phase 1: Raising Awareness (2013-2015): The objective of this first phase was to reduce behavioural risk, which is the gap between the intended behaviours (Purpose, Values, Code of Conduct, etc.), the expressed behaviours (training, advice, tone at the top, etc.), and the actual behaviours demonstrated by employees and leaders.\n- \u00b7 Phase 2: 'Step-Up' Culture (2016 to present): We retained our focus on raising awareness and developing the ethical decision-making competencies of our people. In this phase we also wanted to go beyond individual decision-making, engaging our people to become stewards of our ethical culture.\n\n## ETHICAL CONDUCT KPIs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Type                                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Harassment                                 | 71     | 39     |\n| Inappropriate  arrangement  with suppliers | 29     | 27     |\n| Abuse of authority                         | 21     | 21     |\n| Inappropriate  behaviour    at work        | 16     | 4      |\n| Conflict of interest                       | 5      | 5      |\n| Fraud                                      | 5      | 1      |\n| Professional negligence                    | 4      | 7      |\n| Other                                      | 4      | 4      |\n| Unsafe conditions                          | 2      | -      |\n| Theft                                      | -      | 2      |\n| Total                                      | 157    | 110    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Whistleblowing - Number of reports\n\nWhistleblowing - Number of cases\n\n- Tone from the top - Number of reports related to managers\n- Discipline - Number of disciplinary actions\n- Discipline - Number of control reinforcement\n\nNote: Cases reported to the Honour Commission from the whistleblowing mechanism.

        "page_content": "## Sustainability at the core of our Purpose continued\n\n## ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n## Preventing harassment\n\nAt Fresnillo plc we believe that a healthy work environment improves the wellbeing of our workforce and has a direct impact on productivity. Encouraged by this ingrained belief and convinced that a communication campaign alone would not suffice, our Honour Commission requested a comprehensive programme to prevent and address harassment in the workplace. In June 2019, we carried out a diagnosis exercise to identify the root causes that triggered these behaviours. This diagnosis comprised direct observations of work dynamics and social interactions, face-to-face interviews, psychological workshops for all the workforce, and perception surveys. The model was tested in the San Juli\u00e1n and Fresnillo mines and modified to create a protocol to prevent and address workplace harassment in a reliable, accessible, efficient and fair way for all our unionised and non-unionised employees. This protocol was implemented in August 2020.\n\nIt has three focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Prevention: address the internal and external conditions of workers and raise awareness.\n- \u00b7 Care: address instances of harassment with trained personnel.\n- \u00b7 Restoration: train staff involved in harassment situations, improve our processes and introduce initiatives to prevent these situations developing.\n\nTo build a culture of prevention and wellbeing at work that discourages harassment, we need to ensure that all our people embrace the idea that this task requires responsibility and commitment from all members of the organisation. We therefore developed a company-wide training scheme during 2021, making sure that this could be implemented in accordance with safety measures to combat Covid-19. The scheme comprised:\n\n- \u00b7 Online courses aimed at non-unionised personnel, raising awareness of the ways in which harassment behaviours may manifest, and the mechanisms to report them. Implemented in February, these courses also became part of our induction programme for new personnel.\n- \u00b7 Awareness workshops aimed at managers, deputy directors and human resources personnel to reinforce their knowledge and behaviour with a greater understanding of inclusion and the importance of zero tolerance for harassment. The first workshops were held in May. Following these, the rest of our organisation received face-to-face training on this matter.\n\n\u00b7\n\nFace-to-face workshops in two formats:\n\n- -Six-hour training sessions for team leaders focusing on their leadership role to drive a culture of zero tolerance of harassment.\n- -Four-hour training sessions to raise awareness of how to avoid risks and discourage harassment behaviours.\n\nBetween May and November 2021, 7,451 people received awareness training across our operating units. The workshops fostered an open, respectful and receptive environment for the exchange of ideas and experiences, encouraging participants to manage harassment through exercises and experiential group dynamics. The workshops were positively received by most participants, who challenged beliefs and paradigms that they had internalised as normal - such as male chauvinism or gender violence - and developed new perspectives and tools to handle situations differently. Another favourable outcome was that these workshops helped lay the foundations of trust in our whistleblowing mechanism: harassment-related grievances increased not only from one year to another but also as a share of all reported categories.\n\nINTEGRITY CULTURE SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHAVE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF INTEGRITY CULTURE\n\n97 %\n\n93 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHAVE POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARDS INTEGRITY CULTURE\n\nAGREE THAT THE COMPANY TAKES PREVENTIVE MEASURES TO REDUCE ILLICIT BEHAVIOUR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE WHISTLEBLOWING MECHANISM\n\n100 %\n\nTo eradicate any manifestation of workplace violence, reduce risks, increase productivity and maintain optimal occupational health, we believe we must continue promoting well-being and respectful relationships, raising awareness to prevent harassment in the workplace and building confidence in the whistleblowing mechanism.\n\n## AWARENESS WORKSHOPS IN 2021 BY WORKFORCE GROUP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Next steps:\n\nIn 2022 we will continue to strengthen harassment prevention.\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Ongoing 'train the trainer' sessions so that our trainers are able to raise awareness among new and pending employees.\n- \u00b7 Communication campaigns on specific topics such as microaggressions: myths and reality, consent.\n- \u00b7 Contests to promote participation and assess understanding of training.\n- \u00b7 Reinforcement, consolidation and adjustment of the procedures of the programme, two years after its implementation.\n\n90 %",

We believe that the best retention strategy is to provide opportunities for people to grow and develop.\n\nA cohort (batch) system is used to recruit short- and long-term interns. We also team up with leading educational institutions in Mexico to attract young and diverse talent studying for mining and metals-related degrees. One of our most successful programmes is Engineers in Training, which includes 12 months of training in technical, administrative and social competencies, to instil our organisational culture in undergraduates in fields such as mining, geology and\n\nmetallurgy, as well as electrical, mechanical and chemical engineering. Each undergrad is assigned a coach from our operations team who supervises their development and provides performance appraisals - those with good appraisals receive permanent job offers, thus securing the talent pipeline for our growth strategy. This programme enables us to engage students in the earlier stages of college education and to encourage more women to participate in the mining industry. Additionally, during the Covid-19 outbreak, we transformed our short-term internships into online training sessions on mining, geology, safety and communication to engage with universities and promote the Company.\n\n## DIVERSITY IN TALENT ATTRACTION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2017\n\n35%\n\n52% Men\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWomen\n\nLong-term internships and Engineers in Training.\n\nOur performance assessment mechanism allows us to determine and align specific training needs as well as to identify high potential candidates for our Institutional Development programme. We develop our high-potential middle managers through the Leaders with Vision programme, which comprises technical seminars taught by senior executives throughout the year. These sessions not only add value by sharing knowledge and experience, but also as a mechanism to engage and inspire participants. Executives take part in both training programmes, which are organised by the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM) - a leading higher education university.\n\n## Union relations\n\nUnions are our strategic partners and key players in our drive to foster productivity and develop a safety culture. We believe that fair and respectful relations with unions build trust and mutual accountability and that win-win relations are the foundation for fair collective bargaining. We respect the rights of employees to freedom of expression, association and collective bargaining. We engage unions to build trust through continuous dialogue, leadership development programmes, wellbeing activities such as sports and cultural events, and continuous improvement projects.\n\nThe CEO and the Head of Human Resources engage with union senior leadership while our business units regularly engage with local union committees and their delegates. These close relationships enable collaboration on capacity building of newly elected union committees. During 2021, we did not experience any work stoppages or industrial action because of labour/uni00A0disputes.\n\nThe unions and the Company collaborate in an annual symposium on Safety - with supplementary contributions from regulators to present best practices and promote meaningful dialogue to help identify our industry's challenges and opportunities. In addition, we work closely with unions to jointly implement periodic 'LEAL' (Loyal) surveys on work behaviours and wellbeing. We use the insights gained to improve our workforce engagement strategy.",

Equity and inclusion can lead to improvements in the attraction, retention and development of talent, as well as promoting innovation and creativity.\n\nOur approach is inspired by the principle of equality and recognises the importance of treating people appropriately and providing equal access to opportunities. Our aim is to foster an inclusive workplace where openness, belonging, and respect allow people to have a meaningful impact on the workplace.\n\nIncreasing the participation and inclusion of women is the first step in the journey to make diversity a competitive advantage. We have two strategic objectives:\n\n- 1. Enhance the contribution of women to the success of the Company.\n- 2.  Have a positive impact on female employees.\n\nOur goal is to increase the overall representation of women from 10% to 12% by 2025 and to challenge the glass ceiling at the operating manager and superintendent level, raising the percentage of women in these roles from 2% to 8% by 2025.

Based on salary scales, we have policies in place to close the gender pay gap. In 2021, the gender pay gap for nonunionised, Non-Executive employees was -2.28% compared to -2.64% in 2021. The gap is calculated using the weighted average salary per hierarchical level. The head count per hierarchical level and business unit is used to determine the weights in the overall average gap calculation. For the first time, we also studied the support and administrative staff gender pay gap for senior management and found it was -3.96%. We are committed to closing this gap and to promoting women in our operations, projects and exploration activities.\n\n## OVERALL GENDER PAY GAP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nXXX\n\n2017",

Based on the findings, a strategic planning workshop was held in partnership with Aequales. This enabled us to draw up an action plan to implement recommendations in order to achieve greater equity in the organisation, formalise our commitment to promote equal representation of both genders at all levels and in all areas, improve wellbeing and flexibility to achieve a work-life balance, and to internalise a prevention culture and zero tolerance of sexual and workplace harassment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Overseen directly by the Human Resources department, the centre incorporates separate access from the industrial facilities to improve safety protocols and will also be available for training requirements from other operating units. It comprises:\n\n- 1.   Main lecture hall for theoretical training.\n- 2.   Area for rescue squad training and practice.\n- 3.   Dedicated training area for light vehicle and mobile equipment - for example, specialised trucks used in underground mining operations, light trucks and buses for transporting personnel. Internal licences will be issued once competencies, protocols and trainings are completed and certified - including defensive driving courses.\n- 4.  Safety module protocols:\n- \u00b7 Working at height, to improve the understanding of equipment and safety measures.\n- \u00b7 Material handling - focused on different types of hoists - to provide training on standard ways to lift materials.\n- \u00b7 Ground control, to practise different techniques to avoid rockfalls - such as manual scaling with aluminium bars or reading geomechanical lights.\n- \u00b7 Hazardous materials handling, to identify and handle harmful substances.\n- \u00b7 Safety guards, to learn how to use them in transportation bands or power transmission equipment.\n- \u00b7 Explosive management, to learn how to transport, store and handle explosives.\n\n\u00b7\n\nDe-energisation, isolation, lockout and\n\nlabelling, through hands-on experience\n\nwith electricity boards.\n\n- \u00b7 Confined spaces manoeuvring.\n- \u00b7 Mobile equipment simulator, to train workers on driving within industrial facilities.\n- \u00b7 Light vehicle simulator, to improve worker safety in vehicles used in underground mining operations.\n\n## THE FUNDAMENTALS OF CRITICAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- 1.

Our focus is on prevention and emergency response, the promotion of healthier lifestyles, and the enhancement of wellbeing through the early identification and management of health risks to prevent occupational and chronic diseases. During the Covid-19 outbreak, we have continued to prioritise our employees' and contractors' health and wellbeing across our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we will win\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and monitor the level of exposure to physical and chemical risks to the health of our people (noise, dust, vibration, heavy metal contamination, extreme temperatures, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Determine operating procedures, equipment, training and controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate and improve the ergonomics to prevent musculoskeletal disorders.\n- \u00b7 Ensure that everyone entering the workforce has a health check, including physical and psychosocial evaluations.\n- \u00b7 Perform regular check-ups to screen for occupational diseases and advise on preventive care measures.\n- \u00b7 Manage our own rehabilitation facilities to accelerate recovery from injuries.\n- \u00b7 Implement our Healthy Lifestyles programme to support good dietary habits and the prevention and control of obesityrelated diseases.\n- \u00b7 Carry out biological monitoring to prevent sanitary risks.\n- \u00b7 Hold behavioural change workshops, facilitated by psychologists who provide guidance and counsel on personal issues that may lead to accidents or workplace stress.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nIn 2020, at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in Mexico, we engaged with the authorities and our industry peers to develop a preventive protocol based on international best practices. During 2021, we maintained these protocols as well as the Health Safety Certification provided by the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), having incorporated them permanently into our day-to-day operations. These measures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating committees: Through fortnightly virtual meetings, statistical trends are reviewed, and commitments are established to prevent contagion, with management and the executive team updated accordingly.\n- \u00b7 Protecting the vulnerable workforce: We identified vulnerable members based on criteria issued by the Federal Government in 2020. We continue to monitor their glucose levels, blood pressure and nutritional status and pregnancies, among others, to remain prepared in the event of new contagion waves or variants.\n- \u00b7 Raising awareness and enforcing vaccination: We launched permanent communication campaigns to educate our people about preventive measures, raise awareness and combat misinformation. In addition, during municipalities' vaccination campaigns, we provided support to ensure personnel attendance, such as transportation, medication for side effects and giving employees time off.\n- \u00b7 Social distancing in the workplace: We adopted social distancing measures and appropriate protection equipment at all our facilities. To support compliance, we use floor markings in common areas; limit capacity in canteens to avoid crowding, install protective barriers between seating, and provide packaged cutlery; personnel commuting services work at minimum capacity with staggered seating; the group size in training sessions and work meetings has been limited, favouring ventilated spaces, while we also supply antibacterial gel and chlorine wipes, and encourage video conferences when possible. Additionally, non-essential personnel with administrative duties work from home.\n- \u00b7 Hygiene and sanitation: We mandated the use of masks and hygiene measures, notably handwashing and the use of antibacterial gel. In addition, we implemented a daily sanitisation programme for work areas, accommodation and transportation.\n- \u00b7 Sanitary filters: We established checkpoints to control access, monitor body temperature and enquire about symptoms or contact with people suspected to have the disease. Additionally, random testing is deployed across all units. For workers in remote locations, monitoring takes place before transportation and on arrival at site.\n- \u00b7 Testing, monitoring and contagion traceability: We test regularly for contagion and to ensure traceability. Furthermore, we monitor the progress of confirmed cases daily, and offer psychological care and emotional support.\n\nDuring 2021, almost 80,000 Covid-19 PCR, antibody and antigen tests were carried out on our people. In addition, our strategy to enforce vaccination in our workforce resulted in 78.2% being vaccinated - 17.7% with at least one dose and 60.5% with a complete schedule.\n\n## SUPPORT WITH ANTIGEN TESTS FOR OUR WORKFORCE AND FAMILIES\n\nDuring the December and January holiday period, all mining units conducted antigen tests for unionised and nonunionised workers and their families. This was carried out both before travelling, to prevent contagion moving from origin to destination, and again following their return to work.\n\nIn the Fresnillo, Saucito and Juanicipio units, we established a district module in our Multipurpose Centre in the city of Fresnillo. At the Ci\u00e9nega unit, tests were performed at our clinic, while in the San Juli\u00e1n and Penmont units, they were carried out at the sanitary checkpoints outside the industrial area.",

Preventive care and the promotion of healthier lifestyles can limit certain chronic diseases and enhance overall wellness and fitness for work. While our focus is on prevention, emergency response is a core competence of all our health teams. Occupational health is multidisciplinary and requires the effort, support and commitment of all members of the organisation.\n\n## Certifications\n\n|

RISK FACTORS IN THE WORKPLACE\n\nThe Mexican standard NOM-035-STPS aims to establish the capabilities that companies need to identify, analyse and prevent psychosocial risk factors, as well as to promote a positive and supportive workplace environment. Our strategy is to implement the standard through:\n\n- 1. Dissemination: A two-fold programme to support the standard, the internal policy, the constitution of a labour behaviour commission to deal with harassment issues and the establishment of a whistleblowing mechanism to report grievances. Initially, our focus was on email campaigns, group training and meetings, and this was followed by reinforcing the message and providing updates of adopted risk controls through printed and online media.\n- 2. Identification and channelling: The reference questionnaires (or guides) are applied to a representative sample of the unit's different departments. Personnel exposed to traumatic events or psychosocial risks are then filtered and channelled for psychological assessment.\n- 3. Psychological assessment: Personnel identified as at risk are assessed by means of interviews and psychological surveys of stress disorders - general or post-traumatic - anxiety, depression and burnout. This process leads to a diagnostic evaluation and recommendations, based on a level from 10 to 100 from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).\n- 4. Treatment: Depending on the diagnosis, an eight-session course can be provided by the teams of clinical psychologists that are present in all mining units. Depending on circumstances, individuals receive periodic follow-up, and are eventually discharged. If necessary, personnel may be removed from operations to a job with lower risk exposure.\n\nDuring 2021, the main risks detected were workload, work shifts, lack of control over work, work-life balance, and work relationships.",

Optimising our use of resources, curbing any negative impact of our activities and being transparent and accountable regarding our environmental footprint are crucial elements of sustainable mining and help us to retain our social licence to operate.\n\nClean technologies play an important role in improving environmental performance and reinforcing the social acceptability of the mining industry. We support the Colorado Cleantech Challenge, an innovation showcase that connects mining companies with clean technology solution providers, with the mutually beneficial goal of meeting our industry's\n\nenvironmental challenges. In addition, our CEO, Octavio Alv\u00eddrez, is a member of the Lowell Institute for Mineral Resources of the University of Arizona. This leading research institute has the depth of expertise necessary to tackle the challenges that are critically important to modern mining.\n\nWe are also part of the World Environment Centre (WEC), a think tank that advances sustainable development through the business practices of member companies and in partnership with governments, nongovernmental organisations and other stakeholders.\n\n## Environmental impact assessments\n\nBefore developing any mining project, we conduct environmental impact assessments (EIAs), which identify potential impacts and the actions required to manage them. EIAs address many issues, such as surface and groundwater resources, water quality, air quality, soils, biodiversity (including threatened or endangered species), landscape, and socioeconomic conditions. The insights gained from EIAs form the foundation for our environmental management plans and systems such as ISO 14001.\n\n## 2021 Certifications and awards\n\n|                                                                                                           |             |            |            |            |            |         | Penmont   | Penmont     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|---------|-----------|-------------|\n| Certification/Award                                                                                       | Exploration | Juanicipio | San Juli\u00e1n | Fresnillo  | Saucito    | Ci\u00e9nega | Herradura | Noche Buena |\n| ISO 14001                                                                                                 | Certified   | -          | -          | Certified  | Certified  | -       | Certified | Certified   |\n| Framework and criteria for an effective  environmental management system.                                 |             |            |            |            |            |         |           |             |\n| Clean Industry                                                                                            | -           | In process | In process | In process | In process | -       | Certified | -           |\n| Certificate granted by the Mexican Environmental                                                          |             | Level 2    | Level 1    | Level 2    | Level 2    |         | Level 2   |             |\n| Authority to promote environmental audits,  compliance with regulations and adoption   of best practices. |             |            |            |            |            |         |           |             |\n| Level 1 - Basic.                                                                                          |             |            |            |            |            |         |           |             |\n| Level 2 - Advanced.                                                                                       |             |            |            |            |            |         |           |             |\n| International Cyanide Management Code                                                                     | -           | -          | -          | -          | -          | -       | Certified | Certified   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our report complies with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TFCD) recommended reporting principles, except for the following where our disclosure is partial:\n\n## Strategy\n\n- \u00b7 Recommended Disclosure B: Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n- \u00b7 Recommended Disclosure C: Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration different climaterelated scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\nReasons for partial compliance: Lack of climate projections at the geographic scales required for engineering purposes.\n\nNext steps for compliance: A comprehensive integration of climate change considerations into financial planning relies on capital budgeting of mitigation and adaptation measures. The mitigation strategy, based on increasing the supply of renewable electricity, is already integrated into our strategic plan. We expect to mature our approach to internal carbon pricing. We are therefore developing a roadmap to integrate adaptation measures into our financial planning. This roadmap relies on the use of regional climate modelling to provide our engineering teams with actionable climate outputs to identify vulnerabilities, design adaptation measures, plan for their implementation and allocate financial resources. This is a long and challenging journey. We will report annually on our progress.\n\n## Metrics  and Targets\n\n- \u00b7 Recommended Disclosure C: Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.\n\n## Reasons for partial compliance: The\n\nconnections between climate change and other relevant ESG risks are at an early stage of development.\n\nNext steps for compliance: We are monitoring progress towards our goal of achieving 75% of the supply of electricity from renewable sources by 2030, together with the relevant transition risks. We are currently experiencing regulatory uncertainty regarding the legal framework for renewables in Mexico which has introduced further uncertainties to our analysis of a sciencebased target aligned with the Paris Agreement. We expect to mature our approach in order to more explicitly incorporate physical risks into our health, safety, environment and community relations KPIs and targets.\n\nWe are committed to integrating climate change into our engineering and financial decisions during 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes in average temperature, rainfall and other conditions are shifting from climate normals. As the climate continues to change, the potential impacts on ecosystems, economies and on society at large are expected to increase over time.\n\n## Relevance and risk in the lifecycle of mining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPreventing the worst outcomes of climate change requires unprecedented global cooperation to pursue the Paris Agreement goals. The inspiration for our climate change strategy comes from our Purpose: 'Contribute to the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold'. We are committed to mitigating our impact on climate change by reducing our GHG emissions (SDG 13), integrating clean energy sources into our electricity mix and improving our energy efficiency (SDG 7).\n\nWe recognise the importance of a robust climate strategy in ensuring that our business continues to thrive. In 2021 we conducted a comprehensive identification of climate-related risks and opportunities (CROs) in our business model, connecting our people in interdisciplinary working groups and enhancing the use of scenarios to evaluate and prioritise CROs. We believe that an enhanced understanding of the CROs is an important milestone in our journey to mature our climate strategy. We moved beyond managing climate change as a sustainability issue by fully incorporating the risks and opportunities in our enterprise risk management (ERM) and energy strategy. We are committed to maturing our approach to the integration of physical and transitional risks into our planning and decision-making processes. Our stakeholders expect us to act and report transparently.\n\nWe have prepared this section based on all the principles of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

On behalf of the Board, the HSECR Committee evaluates climate-related performance, risks and opportunities. Since 2020, climate change has been part of the agenda at all quarterly HSECR Committee meetings, and the share of renewables is among the ESG metrics discussed. In 2021, the HSECR Committee reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 The energy strategy, factoring in the expectations of our stakeholders on setting ambitious targets and the current regulatory risks associated with renewable electricity in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The technology strategy to explore opportunities to reduce the carbon and water footprint of mineral processing.\n- \u00b7 The Company's approach to identifying, evaluating and responding to the risks and opportunities of climate change in the business model.\n- \u00b7 The Company's approach to adopting and disclosing TCFD recommendations.\n- \u00b7 The approach to partnering with the scientific community in order to use climate models to better understand physical risks and socioeconomic scenarios for transition risks.\n\nThe HSECR Committee periodically briefed the Board on Climate Change performance and the Company's approach to adopting TCFD recommendations.\n\n## HSECR Committee knowledge and training\n\nThe Directors of the HSECR Committee have relevant experience and knowledge in relation to climate change. The Chairman of the Committee, Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez, has extensive expertise in Mexican public policy and a solid academic background in macroeconomics.\n\n## EXECUTIVE TEAM\n\n- \u00b7 CEO\n- \u00b7 CFO\n- \u00b7 COO\n- \u00b7 VP Exploration\n\nMs Georgina Kessel has significant experience on matters relating to energy and climate change, having served as Minister of Energy from 2006 to 2011. Dame Judith Macgregor has wide-ranging diplomatic experience and contributes valuable international perspectives on climate change. Mr Fernando Ruiz brings his considerable experience on Mexican taxation to the Committee, as well as a valuable perspective on the landscape of carbon pricing legislation.\n\nDuring 2020, the HSECR Committee was briefed on the basic principles of science-based targets, which has been useful in discussing target-setting and evaluating decarbonisation pathways. In 2021, the Committee was trained on the principles of TCFD with a special focus on the approach to identify, evaluate and prioritise the CROs. Capacity building also covered the physical risks of climate change, notably on the use of climate models and the challenges to assess the physical impact at geographic scale meaningful to mining operations.\n\n## Management oversight on climate change\n\nOur CEO, COO, Sustainability Assistant VP, and Baluarte's CEO of Engineering Services report quarterly to the HSECR Committee on the Company performance and also provide insights on trends and stakeholder expectations to better understand the exposure to climate-related risks and the decarbonisation opportunities.\n\nThe strategic vision of our CEO is key to making the connection between business strategy and climate-related risks and opportunities. The CEO's words and actions have an enormous impact, and his personal leadership is essential for setting and communicating goals and holding the organisation to account. Our COO has responsibilities related to the energy efficiency of current operations and our objectives regarding future performance.

Baluarte's CEO of Engineering Services plays a key role in the technology strategy for mineral processing and design and operation of mine infrastructure such as Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) and water reservoirs. Our CFO and COO collaborate to identify energy efficiency opportunities, and the former also oversees compliance with climatechange regulatory obligations. The Sustainability Assistant VP supports the Executive Committee in assessing the carbon footprint of the Strategic Plan, measuring the quarterly performance and analysing scenarios to identify impacts, risks and opportunities. During 2021 and early 2022, the Executive Team was briefed on progress made on climate-related risks and opportunities identification, prioritisation and valuation.\n\nIn a key development of 2021, the Company updated its forecast of energy demand for the Strategic Plan. Additionally, during 2021, a Steering Group was formed by representatives of the Finance, Exploration, Projects, Operations, Industrial Safety and Environment, and Sustainability teams to engage in conversations about how climate change may affect our operations; this group designated representatives from different areas to form an Expert Team from administrative and operational areas across the Company to participate in a scoping workshop to leverage existing progress on TCFD and climate risk management practices. The team discussed the Fresnillo business model - its value creation mechanisms, operational control, influence across the value chain and the risks and opportunities of growth and innovation plans - its current processes, criteria and thresholds to identify risks and opportunities, and also explored additional exposure sources and consequences of climate change, setting the foundations for a comprehensive view on the matter.\n\n## EXPERT TEAM\n\n- \u00b7 Exploration\n- \u00b7 Mining\n- \u00b7 Mineral Processing\n- \u00b7 TSF Management and Infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Safety\n- \u00b7 Environment\n- \u00b7 Health\n- \u00b7 Finance\n- \u00b7 Energy\n- \u00b7 Legal\n- \u00b7 Technology\n- \u00b7 Communities\n- \u00b7 Sustainability\n- \u00b7 Procurement\n- \u00b7 Logistics and Sales",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability at the core of our Purpose continued\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n## BUILDING CAPACITIES: CLIMATE CHANGE SENSITISATION\n\nDuring the current and previous periods, we have implemented various sensitisation and training sessions on climate change aimed at different members of the organisation, based on their roles and responsibilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Briefings to the HSECR Committee on the basic principles of science-based targets.\n- \u00b7 Briefings to the Executive Team on progress made on climate-related risks and opportunities identifying, evaluating and prioritising.\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Steering Team periodic meetings to reinforce awareness, discuss challenges and build a shared understanding to foster actionable strategies.\n- \u00b7 Climate Change Expert Team scoping workshop on the principles of identifying climate-related risks and opportunities, to set a company-wide comprehensive view on the matter.\n- \u00b7 Dissemination sessions on TCFD recommendations for operational personnel in business units.\n\n## STRATEGY\n\nClimate Change has strategic implications for our business model. There is an investment trend towards favouring companies with resilient climate strategies and higher expectations of stakeholders and society at large regarding climate action. Minerals and metals are expected to contribute significantly to the transition to a net-zero economy, but mining operations will be expected to reduce their carbon footprint and regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions will be more stringent. Renewable energy has reached technological maturity and economic competitiveness, while facing worrying regulatory challenges in Mexico. Technologies to reduce the carbon footprint of mineral haulage and mineral processing are at the emergence phase but industry alliances represent opportunities to expand their development.\n\nWe focus on mitigating our impact on climate change by reducing our GHG emissions with renewable electricity, fuel substitution in our truck fleet and intelligent ventilation systems. We are developing our adaptation approach, working with climate modellers and environmental economists to better understand physical and transition risks. We collaborate with our peers in Mexico to constructively engage government and regulators. We have also joined other companies to launch Mexico's TCFD Consortium.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a comprehensive review of our business model to identify the risks and opportunities throughout the lifecycle of mining. Following a rigorous approach, we consolidated our CROs, identifying their root cause and value drivers. We redefined our scenarios to have a consistent source of parameters to evaluate and prioritise CROs. The strategic review of our CROs has informed our risk management approach and provided valuable insights to mature our climate strategy in the next years.\n\n## Impacts on and by the business\n\nThe impacts on our business arise from physical and transition risks. The change in climate patterns represents physical risks to our people, communities, mining infrastructure and value chain. The government regulations, changes in markets and social expectations represent transition risks to a low carbon economy. The impacts by our business are associated with the greenhouse gas emissions relating to our production of silver, gold, zinc and lead. Supplying metals has a positive impact on low carbon technologies such as solar panels.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nChronic risks result from long-term shifts in the climate pattern. The reduction in annual precipitation in Mexico is expected to increase water stress in the river basins where we operate. Water stress requires adaptation strategies based on water efficiency, technological innovations in mineral processing, nature-based solutions for replenishment and collaboration, among others. Acute physical risks are related to shifts in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as rainfall, droughts and heat waves. Adaptation strategies rely on preventive measures to protect our people and resilient infrastructure. Physical risks are not only associated with our operations but may influence our upstream activities such as procurement and downstream activities like smelting and refining. Physical risks also have indirect effects. Water stress may intensify the competition to access water resources and extreme events such as floods and droughts may have negative impacts on the livelihood\n\nof our communities. Indirect impacts demand enhanced collaboration with our stakeholders in the river basins where our operations are located.\n\n## Transition risks and opportunities\n\nSociety's responses to the transition to a low-carbon economy include more stringent regulations to reduce emissions, a transformation of the global energy system, changes in behaviour and consumption choices and emerging technologies. Policies include but are not limited to carbon taxes and tariffs, cap and trade systems, renewable energy portfolios and incentives for new technologies. Climate action is also motivated by the rising expectations of society and investment trends towards companies with resilient carbon strategies. A resilient energy strategy with a disciplined approach to technology adoption is necessary to reduce our carbon footprint and exposure to regulations. Metals and minerals are essential to the technologies required for this transition, and this opens up market opportunities.\n\n## Identifying risks and opportunities\n\nA robust climate strategy relies on a sound understanding of the CROs of our business model considering the lifecycle of mining and our value chain. To ensure a comprehensive identification of CROs, we formed a Steering Team that identified key people representing every aspect of the business who could form an Expert Team. The Steering and Expert teams were trained on the principles of climate change and CRO identification. To further understand CROs, we conducted in depth interviews with representatives from our Risk Management, Financial Planning, Infrastructure, Energy and Sustainability teams. Additionally, we introduced an external perspective based on an industryoriented benchmark of significant peers and industry climate change guidance documents. The outcome was a comprehensive CROs register with detailed information on each identified risk including its TCFD category, external root cause, value chain impact, and value driver affected. Out of an exploratory list of over 100 CROs, a longlist of 55 individual CROs was retained for evaluation and prioritisation.\n\n## CRO LONGLIST BY TCFD CATEGORY AND VALUE CHAIN STAGE\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Scenario analysis\n\nThe evaluation and prioritisation of CROs is fundamental in order to focus our strategy and risk management. This process begins with risk management and relies on the use of scenarios. We use scenarios to gain a sound understanding of the potential business impacts of an uncertain future with environmental, social, geopolitical, policy, market, investment and technology implications. Our scenarios are therefore used to generate insights, identify mitigation measures and set courses of action. Our scenarios should not be interpreted as forecasts.\n\nWe opted to use a climate scenario - focused on plausible representations of future climate conditions - and a socioeconomic scenario which was focused on plausible development pathways for society and the economy. For the former, we used the main Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), which are trajectories over time of greenhouse gases, aerosols and chemically active concentrations and emissions, as well as land use/cover. For the latter, we used the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), which are alternative socioeconomic futures over the course of the century. Both these scenarios - typically designed for research and policy purposes - are complementary, adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide an integral framework of climate impact and policy analysis.\n\n- \u00b7 Our first scenario is Business as Usual , an intermediate scenario where CO 2 emissions start to decrease until 2045 and reach roughly half of the levels of 2050 by 2100, more likely than not to result in a global temperature rise between 2 and 3\u00b0C. Additionally, the world follows a path in which social, economic, and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns; environmental systems experience degradation, global growth is moderate and income inequality persists, as does vulnerability to societal and environmental changes.\n\n- \u00b7 The second scenario is the decarbonisation pathway in line with Paris Agreements , which sets a rapid decarbonisation pathway that limits peak warming to below 2\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial times with a likelihood above 66%, achieving a net-zero global economy in the second half of the century, although to accomplish this, carbon removal will be necessary. Additionally, the world moves towards a more sustainable path that respects perceived environmental boundaries and where economic growth shifts towards a broader emphasis on human wellbeing; inequality is reduced, and consumption oriented toward low material growth and lower resource intensity.\n- \u00b7 The last scenario is Worst Case , where existing climate and energy policies are unsuccessful, resulting in a significant increase in global GHG emissions without constraint, intensifying physical risks. Additionally, competitive markets produce rapid technological progress and development, but coupled with abundant fossil fuel exploitation, and resource- and energy-intensive lifestyles. Management of social and ecological ecosystems is technology driven, by all necessary means.\n\nOur scenarios were complemented with additional parameters for rainfall, droughts, carbon and energy prices, fossil fuel subsidies, share of renewables and water scarcity among others. These parameters were gathered from reputable sources that include the IPCC Working Group I Interactive Atlas, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis' (IIASA) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), the World Development Indicators from the World Bank, the World Economic Forum (WEF), the World Resources Institute (WRI), KNMI climate change Atlas, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Mexico Energy Outlook 2016, the National Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI), National system of Water Information (SINA), among others. The gathering of parameters to assess CROs is challenging due to gaps in data availability at the country, regional, sectorial or company level. Scenario parameters should be used with caution and considering their viability or suitability limitations.\n\n## Implications to 2050\n\n## In our Business as Usual and Worst Case\n\nscenarios, we will be subject to severe impacts from physical risks, manifested mainly through water availability and extreme weather events demanding adaptation measures that are financially material. Transition risks, especially those regarding carbon pricing will be more uncertain as these scenarios imply failed international coordination on policies to curb carbon emissions. Conversely, on a Paris-aligned scenario physical risks will be contained, though not eliminated, and the transition risks certain and material resulting from policies, investment trends and social expectations to transition to a net-zero economy. Across all scenarios, adaptation technologies, resource efficiency and clean technologies are key success factors.\n\n## Business resilience to climate-related risks and opportunities\n\n## Mitigation of our impact on climate change\n\nOur approach to mitigate our impact on climate change relies on renewable electricity and substitution of diesel by natural gas in our haulage fleet at Herradura (see case study). In 2021, we supplied half of our electricity from renewable sources. From 2015 to 2021 we sourced 2.6 TWhe of wind energy that represents 1.35 million tonnes of CO 2 e of avoided emissions with respect to the carbon intensity of the Mexican Power Utility (CFE) and 2.65 million tonnes of CO 2 e with respect to thermoelectric power plants. We implement energy efficiency in our mining operations and processing plant to reduce the use of fuels and electricity respectively. New technologies for intelligent ventilation in underground mines reduce the carbon footprint and provide enhanced protection for our people. We have introduced a new strategy to evaluate and adopt emerging tailings technologies considering their impacts on increased safety and reduced climate and water footprint. To evaluate our resilience to transitional risks, we assess the flexibility of our energy strategy to provide decarbonisation opportunities in the 20212030 period. We have considered the energy requirements of our Strategic Plan which includes our mining operations and projects.\n\n## Scenarios and their key parameters\n\n| Scenarios   | Scenarios           | Scenarios              | Parameters                               | Parameters                    | Parameters                                   | Parameters                                   |\n|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| No.         | Name                | IPCC climate  scenario | Complementary  socioeconomic pathway     | Global GHG  emissions in 2050 | Average global temperature  increase by 2050 | Average global temperature  increase by 2010 |\n| 1           | Business as Usual   | RCP 4.5                | SSP 2 (middle of the   road development) | 56,000 Mt CO 2 e              | 2.0 +/- 0.3\u00b0C                                | 2.4 +/- 0.5\u00b0C                                |\n| 2           | Paris aligned (2\u00b0C) | RCP 2.6                | SSP 1 (sustainable  development)         | 25,000 Mt CO 2 e              | 1.6 +/- 0.3\u00b0C                                | 1.6 +/- 0.4\u00b0C                                |\n| 3           | Worst case          | RCP 8.5                | SSP 5 (fossil-fuelled  development)      | 103,000 Mt CO 2 e             | 2.6 +/- 0.4\u00b0C                                | 4.3 +/- 0.7\u00b0C                                |",

The 785C series consumes approximately a 40-60% diesel-LNG mix, while the 793D achieves a 65-35% ratio, thus achieving in 2021 a reduced energy factor of 20.97% and 18.68%, respectively. To date, we've recovered 35% of our investment through fuel savings, which considers both the LNG conversion kits and the bimodal supply station.\n\n## CUMULATIVE CONVERSIONS BY TRUCK/uni00A0SERIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net Zero Implications\n\n- \u00b7 2022-2030: Our most significant opportunities rely on increasing the supply of renewable energy, mitigating the impact of diesel in our open pit haulage fleet through the substitution of diesel and capitalising on energy efficiency opportunities in our mining and mineral processing operations. The technology strategy should currently focus on mature technologies but with a disciplined approach to work with partners on emerging technologies. Nature-based solutions may play a role as pilot opportunities to offset carbon emissions, increase water replenishment and community relations. Currently, the government policy is delaying the increase in the supply from renewable sources.\n- \u00b7 2030-2050: Most of the electricity supply is renewable. Electrification coupled with renewable supply plays a key role in underground operations. Hydrogen trucks for open pit operations become an alternative to reduce the reliance on diesel and natural gas. Advanced upstream and downstream technologies are available to reduce the carbon and footprint of mineral processing. Nature-based solutions play a relevant role as an offset mechanism. Carbon capture starts playing a key role in the second half of the period to offset hard to abate emissions.\n\n## Adaptation\n\nThe design of adaptation measures to protect our people and communities relies on modelling the long-term shifts in climate, such as annual precipitation or temperature, and the variability of extreme events such as floods, droughts and heatwaves. Global circulation models (GCMs) are used to understand the changes in climate under different Representative\n\nConcentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios. Aqueduct, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), is useful to model water stress under different climate change scenarios. These models are valuable in understanding global and regional trends. Most of the physical climate parameters of our scenarios come from reputable sources using global models.\n\nWhile GCMs are useful to identify and prioritise CROs, their spatial resolution is too coarse and hence not suitable to support engineering decision-making at the mining site level. We have collaborated with the scientific community to identify climate modelling approaches suitable to inform engineering decision-making based on regional climate models using statistical and selective dynamic downscaling for comparative purposes. The use of estimates from regional models will be a significant contribution in our journey to mature our approach to integrate the physical risks of climate change in our planning and operating decisions.\n\n## Engagement with stakeholders\n\nThrough the Silver Institute, we participate in an industry-wide initiative on silver and the lowcarbon economy. The objective is to produce more carbon footprint information for industry stakeholders, showcase carbon abatement best practices and further study silver's lifecycle and its role as a climate-smart metal. In addition, we collaborate with our peers in the Colorado Mining Cleantech Challenge to promote innovative solutions for energy efficiency and other environmental challenges.\n\nOur engagement initiatives also extend to companies and organisations in other industries. For example, we take part in the World\n\n## DECARBONISATION PATHWAYS",

In Mexico, we are part of CESPEDES (Mexican Chapter of the WBCSD) which shares best practices and engages with governments and society at large. During 2021, we also participated in the Carbon Trust's event 'Route to Net Zero' in Latin America to help organisations understand the steps needed to transition towards decarbonisation by learning from the region's climate leaders' initiatives. Finally, we joined the Mexico TCFD Consortium - following the success of the Japanese model - created to share lessons learnt and assist companies that are starting to adopt these recommendations to shorten their learning curve, build capacities, and improve the country's engagement levels.\n\nWe became a registered supporter of the TCFD in 2020 and we disclose our performance in the CDP and GEI Mexico, a voluntary disclosure programme with the Mexican regulators. We discuss our climate change strategy in interviews with investors.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOur risk management system is based on risk identification, assessment, prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring processes, which are continually evaluated, improved and enhanced in line with best practice. Considerations regarding climate change are fully integrated within our ERM system.\n\nThe pervasive and complex nature of climate change means that it can act as an amplifier of other risks such as environmental incidents, access to water, health and safety of our people, government regulations, and social licence to operate. Our approach to evaluate and prioritise CROs addresses this challenge.\n\n## Integration with current risk process\n\nIn the past, climate change was considered to be solely a sustainability issue. The allencompassing business implications of climate change led in 2020 to its inclusion as one of the emerging risks, as part of provision 28 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. In\n\n2021, climate change was fully integrated in the annual risk appraisal.\n\n## Risk identification, assessment and management\n\n## Climate-related risks and opportunities (CRO) evaluation method\n\nCross-cutting criteria were assigned to each CRO to enable effective comparisons. The CROs identified were then assessed through an evidence-based approach concerning materiality and certainty, drawing on climate scenarios and the Company's financial data. Each identified CRO in the longlist - consisting of 55 CROs in total - was assigned a specific parameter that could be used to indicate how factors beyond Fresnillo's control could change under different scenarios as a result of climate change. Then, each parameter was subsequently assessed for likelihood, velocity and financial materiality. By combining parameter data and the financial materiality assessment, it was possible to identify which risks were most certain and most material. Each CRO has been identified analysing its root cause and its business specific impact as shown in diagram.\n\n## CRO evaluation method\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For all risks and opportunities, we then calculated the time frame at which the relevant scenario projection increases above a set hurdle (+40%) or decreases below a set hurdle (-20%), thus enabling us to categorise each external factor into time horizons of significant change based on the first year in which these hurdles are breached. A score was then assigned based on the time frame in which it takes place:\n\n| Level   | Time Horizon   | Period             |\n|---------|----------------|--------------------|\n| High    | Short term     | Up to 3 years      |\n| Medium  | Medium term    | From 3 to 10 years |\n| Low     | Long term      | Over 10 years      |\n\n## b) Likelihood:\n\nTo indicate the probability of a CRO taking place, considering outcomes across all scenarios assessed. Each relevant scenario parameter's direction of evolution was also assessed (i.e. whether under each scenario, a parameter is projected to increase, decrease, or no change). Comparative thresholds were also included to consider the projected change when comparing different climate scenarios. For transition risks and opportunities, projections based on current commitments and trends were compared to the accelerated transition aligned to a 2-degree, Paris Agreement aligned scenario. For physical risks and opportunities, this projection based on current commitments and trends was compared to a scenario with failure of climate mitigation actions and correspondingly high emissions. The measured rate of change between relevant scenarios was evaluated and scored according to the table below.\n\n| Level                                                                                                                                                | Likelihood requirements   | Threshold   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Strong alignment between current policies and 2-degree  scenario (transition risks) or worst-case scenario pathways  (physical risks)                | 25%                       | Very high   |\n| Good alignment between current policies and 2-degree or  worst-case scenario pathways, but 2 degrees more ambitious  and worst-case more accelerated | 50%                       | High        |\n| Much greater change expected under 2-degree or worst-case  scenario, but trends are directionally the same                                           | 100%                      | Medium      |\n| Only expected under a 2-degree or worst-case scenario  pathway and not part of current trends/trajectories                                           | -                         | Low         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## c) Financial materiality:\n\nTo estimate the annual financial impact of each identified CRO. The analysis focused on determining the relationship between the scenario parameter assigned to each CRO and the impacted value driver from the CRO. In some instances, the relationship between the scenario parameter and impacted value driver was directly correlated. To understand and compare the relevant materiality of these financial impacts, thresholds shown in the table below were developed based on our financial materiality threshold and broken into smaller categories.\n\n| Financial thresholds   (US$ million)   | Level   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|\n| $ 0 - 7.9                              | Low     |\n| $ 8.0 - 16.4                           | Medium  |\n| > $ 16.5                               | High    |\n\n## CRO analysis and insights\n\nTransition risks - decarbonisation targets, carbon pricing, stringent regulations and investment trends - are the most likely to materialise under all scenarios followed by physical risks such as water availability, higher temperatures, and extreme events. Likewise, transition risks are expected to arise faster than physical risks, reflecting the expectation that climate action will prevent the worst consequences of climate change. Carbon pricing, extreme weather events and energy prices are the most material risks. On the opportunity side, the most imminent and material outcomes were an increased demand for silver from the solar PV industry followed by adaptation technologies. Finally, we gained insight into interactions, differentiating likelihood and velocity from financial impact to understand how fast we may be subject to a family of risks, as compared to the material impact they may have on our business. This allows us to pay more attention to those subjects where both scores are higher before considering others and streamlining our response in a timely fashion with strategic and financial planning.",

These sources fall within our operational control. We do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our Consolidated Statement. We have used the 'Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)', and a 100-year time horizon Global Warming Potential (GWP) for Methane (CH 4 ) and Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) equivalences. Updates to scope 1 and 2 data are twofold: the former due to rectifications of fuel inventories derived from the external audits for the National Emissions Registry (RENE) - but not material as they amount to an increase of less than 1.5% of GHG emissions - and the latter due to the Mexican National Grid emission factor for the period - usually published on a later date than this annual report. Scope 1: All direct GHG emissions.\n\n- Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity.\n- * The emissions and energy consumed in the United Kingdom and offshore area are insignificant.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nWe have taken the first steps to assess Scope 3 emissions, which are the emissions of our partners in the value chain that are outside our operating boundary. We are committed to collaborating with internal and external stakeholders to increase our visibility of additional Scope 3 categories and refine our understanding of the emissions related to downstream processing of our product.\n\n| Category                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | GHG emissions  (tonnes of CO 2 e)   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Purchased goods and services               | Our most relevant supplies are blasting agents (explosives), steel balls for milling,  lube oil, shell liners for mills, tyres, steel for drilling and sodium cyanide.

Recent tailings accidents in the industry have served as a reminder of the complex nature of these structures. We are working towards our goal of zero harm to the people and the environment, implementing the best\n\n## WHAT TAILINGS ARE AND HOW THEY ARE PRODUCED\n\nTailings are a by-product of mineral processing. The ore is reduced in size by crushing and milling to obtain sand and silt-sized particles. The milled rock is then mixed with water and moved as a slurry for further processing to separate the valuable minerals from the milled rock. The remaining slurry of milled rock is known as tailings. Tailings are transported and stored in engineered structures known as TSFs or combined with cement to be reused as paste backfilling in underground workings.\n\npractices in engineering and governance of Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs). The Company has made significant progress in maturing governance and adopting best practices, despite the challenges presented by Covid-19. There were no tailings-related failures at our operations in 2021.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur governance framework establishes the roles, responsibilities and accountability of the groups involved in the design, construction, operation, maintenance and surveillance of TSFs. In 2021, this framework was implemented in all our operations. The key components of our framework are:\n\n- \u00b7 Site management - Mine managers are the risk owners responsible for operating TSFs in accordance with our guidelines. The Regional Tailings Manager and a qualified Engineer of Record provide the technical expertise to ensure the facility is managed safely and complies with the appropriate governance and best practice. We are developing the implementation of a formal change management process to address changes in risk owners.\n- \u00b7 Tailings Management and Stewardship Team - This group of subject matter experts develops and administers the corporate governance and appropriate controls,\n\nincluding the implementation of verifications and external reviews. Baluarte's CEO of Engineering Services leads the team with the support of the Assistant VP of Infrastructure, corporate tailings specialists and managers.\n\n- \u00b7 External reviews - Our governance framework is supported by independent experts, inspectors, reviewers and auditors to confirm compliance with our governance and engineering best practice requirements. Our third-party review process includes an Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP), Dam Safety Inspections (DSIs) and Dam Safety Reviews (DSRs).\n- \u00b7 Group-level oversight - Oversight of the overall governance and operations is provided by the TSF Review Executive Committee. The Committee, comprising Senior Executives, relies on independent expert advice and assessment for the continuous review of operation, governance, inspection, review and audit reports. Fresnillo plc CEO is the Accountable Executive (AE) for operations and Baluarte Technical Services CEO is the AE for Governances matters.\n\nThe Board's HSECR Committee is informed of compliance status, as well as any relevant issues or risks and recommended appropriate actions.\n\n'WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING A ROBUST TSF STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMME BASED ON INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES. TO DATE, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF SITES IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE ATTENTION IN LINE WITH RECOGNISED BEST PRACTICES, WHILE ALSO ATTRACTING AND DEVELOPING A QUALIFIED TEAM AND DEPLOYING STATE-OF-ART MONITORING INSTRUMENTATION AND TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE COMPLETED A COMPREHENSIVE UPGRADE OF OUR APPROACH TO THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND CLOSURE OF OUR TSFS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMME IS AN AMBITIOUS UNDERTAKING THAT REQUIRES MANY YEARS OF DEDICATED EFFORT. OUR CONSULTANTS, INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS AND REINSURERS HAVE COMMENTED ON THE REMARKABLE SPEED AT WHICH WE ARE MOVING FORWARD, AND THEY ATTRIBUTE THIS ACHIEVEMENT TO THE VISIBLE AND UNEQUIVOCAL COMMITMENT DEMONSTRATED BY OUR BOARD AND SENIOR LEADERSHIP.'\n\n## Mr Herman Dittmar\n\nBaluarte's CEO of Engineering Services",

Findings are presented to senior management for follow-up. Focus is now moving from initial implementation to the documentation and institutionalisation of our governance framework in our Tailings Policy, which we expect to release in 2022.\n\n## Risk management\n\nMaintaining the high standards of safety and environmental protection of TSFs is an ongoing process that requires continuous evaluation through the lifecycle of each facility. Design, construction, surveillance, maintenance and external reviews follow the best practice guides of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA), the International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD) and the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM).\n\n## Design and construction\n\nWe design our new tailings dams in accordance with international best practices (i.e. ICMM. ICOLD, CDA and MAC) with the support of qualified engineering firms. We have formalised our approach to site options studies, construction methods and technology selection. At an early stage of a project, we identify opportunities for paste backfilling and filtered tailings.\n\nWe have conducted an extensive campaign of geotechnical investigation to update the geotechnical models of our TSFs. We implement quality assurance and controls for the construction or expansion (lifts) in the operating phase. The design and construction of TSFs are also managed by the Tailings Management organisation using dedicated internal and external resources.\n\n## Operation\n\nMine managers operate the facility in accordance with our guidelines through a\n\n## EXTERNAL REVIEWS\n\n## GROUP-LEVEL OVERSIGHT\n\n- \u00b7 Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP)\n- \u00b7 Dam Safety Inspections (DSI)\n- \u00b7 Dam Safety Reviews (DSR)\n\ncombination of shared services from the Tailings management and Stewardship Team, and internal resources organised to report directly to him/her, independently of other operating roles. Mine managers are supported by a qualified Regional Tailings Manager and a qualified Engineer of Record (EoR). Master Services Agreements have been signed with several recognised consultancies and, through them, named EORs.\n\n## Surveillance and maintenance\n\nRoutine surveillance is conducted by trained operators and expert technical staff from the Tailings Management and Stewardship Team. Condition and critical control monitoring have been enhanced by the installation of improved instrumentation and monitoring equipment. With the support of our consultants, we are currently formalising and implementing the Operation, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) Manuals following the guidelines of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). Our routine surveillance practices have improved as an outcome of the OMS initiative. We have increased the use of InSar Satellite monitoring, improved telemetry and data analytics to facilitate near real-time management of critical controls, improved condition reporting and response times.\n\n## External reviews\n\nThe ITRP comprises subject matter specialists of international renown who meet several times per year to conduct an independent review of the design, operation and integrity of our TSFs. Due to travel restrictions necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the ITRP reviewed operating sites virtually.\n\nWe conduct Dam Safety Inspections (DSIs) and Dam Safety Reviews (DSRs) to evaluate our compliance with international best practices and applicable regulatory requirements. Our Tailings Management and Stewardship Team appoints qualified consultants to conduct formal safety inspections and periodic reviews of TSFs.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur Strategy for responsible tailings management aims to adopt the best practices of engineering and management principles of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA), the International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD) and the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM). We are maturing our implementation of Tailings Management Systems, a centre of excellence that provides shared services, formal planning and resourcing, training and a disciplined approach to investment in tailings technologies.\n\nWe recognise the importance and relevance of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) and have followed its development and progress. As a company we support this standard and we will review and assess the impact and challenges of its implementation. We feel confident that the compliance with these international guidelines is a strong baseline that will lead the GISTM compliance.\n\n## Tailings management system\n\nOur focus is now moving from initial implementation of our governance framework to the formal documentation and implementation of our enhanced OMS Manuals and Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (EPRPs). A training workshop was held to prepare the documents following the Tailings guide of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC).\n\n## Tailings management and Stewardship/uni00A0team\n\nThis group comprises subject matter experts and implements the governance framework and controls and provides shared services. In our journey to become a centre of excellence, we presented our first paper at the Tailings and Mine Waste 2021 event in Banff, Canada where we shared our best practices on the design and construction of TSFs.\n\n- \u00b7 TSF Review Executive Committee",

Most of the Company's mineral waste is generated by the open pit operations at Penmont and deposited in waste rock piles.\n\n## Heaps\n\nPart of the disseminated ore deposits of Penmont are processed using heap leaching. Channels surrounding the heaps and contingency ponds are hydraulically designed to handle flood flows caused by extreme rainfall events. We proactively monitor conditions both up and downstream to detect changes in water quality. Once extraction of ore from the mine is complete, the piles are rinsed and allowed to drain down to protect the environment.",

Uncontrolled AMD represents a risk to surface and groundwater resources during mine operation as well as a legacy issue after closure. We analyse minerals and conduct geochemical tests to identify the AMD potential of ore mineral and waste rock. In our operations with AMD risk, notably the San Ram\u00f3n satellite mine, we implement site-specific management strategies such as capping waste rock piles with a dry cover (to reduce the ingress of oxygen and water) and collecting and treating acid water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the first year of the pandemic, we adapted our engagement and social investment strategy to raise awareness, support the most vulnerable and collaborate with authorities through strategic donations of equipment and supplies to the health authorities in the communities where our people and their families live and work. In the second year of the pandemic, we remained flexible and adaptable to support the issues that matter to our communities. For example, we collaborated with the Mexican public health authorities to support vaccination in the regions where we operate, significantly increasing the vaccination rate. We also partnered with our communities to support the safe return to school, sharing preventive measures, donating sanitising products, rehabilitating infrastructure and donating masks for children. Larousse Foundation worked with us for the second consecutive year, donating books in our communities. INNOVEC was another key partner, producing videos for children that raised awareness of preventive measures and strategies to manage the emotional challenges of Covid-19. In 2021, we were able to reinstate a number of our flagship programmes, notably the Health Week in Penmont with the support of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Foundation, local health authorities and a new partner, the Sonora Centre's Teleton Foundation.\n\n## Engaging communities effectively in the lifecycle of mining\n\nOur community strategy, which embraces all phases of the mining lifecycle, aims to build mutual understanding between our operations and local communities, ensuring that we engage, develop and grow together.\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Exploration: Our exploration teams are the first to establish contact with a local community. We identify the relevant stakeholders and focus our engagement efforts on obtaining temporary access to explore land. We develop early local employment and procurement opportunities related to our exploration activities. Social investment is channelled through donations.\n- \u00b7 Project development: Our stakeholder relationships deepen in this phase of the cycle, as we build trust through activities including local hiring, and contracts for project-related activities. Social investment takes the form of programmes to support capacity building as well as donations. For our advanced feasibility and development projects, we conduct social baseline and impact assessments, manage impacts responsibly and identify development opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Operation: We regularly engage with the community via formal and informal meetings in order to manage expectations and detect risks and opportunities. Local employment and procurement are related to operation and support activities. We carry out comprehensive social studies to evaluate our social performance and reputation, as well as community concerns and development opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Closure: We prepare for closure through social studies and community engagement to identify impacts, mitigation measures and opportunities.\n\n## Avoid or mitigate negative impacts on the communities where we operate\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Design our projects to avoid impacts and when not possible mitigate these impacts and address community concerns responsibly.\n- \u00b7 Monitor and address the social impacts and concerns of communities:\n- -During the operation of a mine.\n- -During the mine closure phase.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our grievance mechanism is intended to provide a fair way to respond to concerns and resolve disputes.\n\nReception\n\nEvaluation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe do not measure the performance of our grievance mechanism by the number of grievances received, because an increase or decrease may have a counterintuitive cause. For example, an increase in grievances could in fact mean that the communication channels, the degree of two-way trust or the openness of the Company towards communities' concerns have improved over time, and vice-versa. Instead, we track progress in our consistent understanding of communities' needs and demands, to learn lessons across our operations, improve performance and ensure that the incident is not repeated. The real value of the grievance mechanism lies in the development of longlasting relationships based on mutual trust, and a procedure that allows us to address concerns fairly and successfully.\n\n## Grievances statistics\n\n| Category                                          | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Outstanding grievances   from previous periods    | 14     |\n| New grievances received   in the period           | 22     |\n| Total grievances                                  | 36     |\n| Closed grievances in the period                   | (25)   |\n| Outstanding grievances   at the end of the period | 11     |\n\nTo properly address stakeholder concerns, we have Community Relations (CR) teams in all operating units and current projects. Grievances are documented, followed up and handled, with the aid of a specialised system designed for this purpose. Our teams act as mediators between\n\nthe communities and the operating areas responsible for the perceived grievance, with the purpose of investigating them thoroughly and resolving them as soon as possible. The typical process is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestigation and recommendations\n\n## Human rights\n\nOur due diligence approach is based on social assessments in the communities where we operate and develop projects. These assessments enable us to identify the social, environmental, labour and human rights risks and impacts of our activities. The findings are used to continually improve our stakeholder engagement strategy and social management plans. We also implement an additional process at our concessions to support the early identification of the presence of indigenous peoples and inform our subsequent engagement approach.\n\nWe do not tolerate any form of threats or mechanisms to intimidate or obtain corporate benefits. We do not condone attacks on anyone, including those who may oppose our activities.\n\n## Interactions with private security\n\nBased on our risk assessment, we decided that our private security forces would be unarmed to avoid:\n\n- \u00b7 Clashes with criminal groups that could put the lives of workers or communities in danger.\n- \u00b7 Violent confrontations with artisanal miners accessing our facilities illegally.\n\nWe expect our private security contractors to conduct themselves ethically, based on honest, respectful, transparent, equitable and fair relations, in strict accordance with the law and guidelines in relation to human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Private security providers are required to implement a background screening process based on the national criminal database.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResponse\n\nConclusion\n\nThe deterrent function of our private security forces is supported by technology and by collaboration with security authorities at the municipal, state and federal level.\n\n## Interactions with public security\n\nAt present the Herradura mine is the only facility protected by the Federal Mining Police. In 2020, Mexico's Federal Protection Service (Secretariat for Citizen Safety and Protection) formed a new police force specialising in mining operations security. The Mining Police is the result of collaboration between the Secretariat for Citizen Safety and Protection, the Secretariat of Economy and Mexico's Mining Chamber. The Mining Police have been trained on the protection of mining facilities and Human Rights. Our Herradura mine is the first mining operation in Mexico to benefit from the deployment of the Mining Police, which was accompanied by a public commitment from Senior Government Security Officials, our CEO and the President of the Mexican Mining Chamber. All members of the Mining Police undertake a 15-hour Human Rights training course which includes the following learning objectives: identification of the core concepts of human rights and police action; and how to protect, respect, promote and guarantee human rights in their work activities and also in their daily lives.\n\nCriminal background checks of all Fresnillo plc employees are conducted during the hiring process with enhanced confidence controls for members of our own Security Department.",

We recognise that consultation is a fundamental right of indigenous communities and a mechanism to build trust. Good faith, transparency and accountability are the key values that guide our consultative approach.\n\nConsultation allows us to understand their perspectives on our projects and address their concerns. Before the consultation phase, we assess the potential impacts and benefits of our projects and develop the capacities of the communities to fully exercise their right to consultation. During consultation, we consider their preferred method of engagement, present information in a culturally appropriate manner and reach agreements on shared benefits. In 2018, our commitment to constructive dialogue and inclusive participation was fundamental to obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of the Raramuri indigenous people to build and operate a water reservoir for our San Juli\u00e1n mine. In 2021, we engaged the indigenous peoples' Committee to collaborate on roads and collective water monitoring. We have since\n\nprovided guidance to Indigenous Consultations in Mexico based on our experience at San Juli\u00e1n, the Mexican regulatory framework and international best practices.

This fund was intended to support communities close to mining operations. However, Congress has reallocated the Mining Fund to national public spending. We partner with the communities where we operate to engage the authorities and aim to encourage them to fund infrastructure projects that benefit mining communities.\n\nThe Fresnillo plc contribution to the Fund for Sustainable Development of Mining States and Municipalities was US$64.10 million in 2021.\n\n|   2021 US$ million |   2020 US$ million |\n|--------------------|--------------------|\n|               64.1 |              33.64 |\n\n- *  Current mining fund taxes are used in our sustainability review as a social performance measure.\n\n## Local employment and procurement\n\nLocal employment is a key driver of social acceptability and community development. We promote local employment from the early days of the exploration phase onwards. In the development and operational phases, for example, we offer employment opportunities directly or through our mining contractors. Our local and regional labour as a percentage of the total workforce is 70.98%. Our Centre for Technical Studies (CETEF) and Pe\u00f1oles Centre for Technical Studies in Laguna del Rey (CETLAR) train mining, instrumentation and maintenance technicians to meet our specific needs. Candidates are chosen from the communities surrounding our operations, thus securing talent and engaging the community for the long-term. We participate in the mining clusters of Zacatecas, Sonora and Chihuahua. These clusters contribute to the development of regional suppliers, strengthening their participation in the value chain of mining companies.\n\n## LOCAL EMPLOYMENT\n\n|   2021 | 70.98%   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2020 | 72.29%   |\n|   2019 | 68.41%   |\n|   2018 | 68.27%   |\n\n0\n\n2017",

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on education in Mexico. In 2020, our response was to migrate our education programmes to digital platforms. In 2021, we partnered with our communities to support the safe return to schools.\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Collaboration with our communities to support the safe return to school.\n- \u00b7 Our STEM education activities continued, and we followed-up our 'How to protect yourself and others from Covid-19?' training module with a new set of short videos. Produced with the assistance of INNOVEC and Director David Revilla, these films educate school students on issues including the science behind the prevention of Covid-19, awareness of Covid-19, caring for others and managing our emotions.\n- \u00b7 We launched an education-based internet pilot project in remote communities neighbouring our San Juli\u00e1n and Penmont units. The project aims to engage teachers and provides educational content that can be accessed through Wi-Fi.\n- \u00b7 In alliance with Larousse, we donated books for the second year in row through the 'Imagine, create and transform' and 'Reading is growing, so let's grow together' campaigns, which were supported by all our operations.\n- \u00b7 All students with scholarships at LaSalle University continued their classes digitally and then in hybrid mode.\n- \u00b7 Our First Robotics teams enrolled in the 2022 competition.\n- \u00b7 We transmitted a live Christmas Concert via YouTube as part of the 'Flute without borders' programme provided by Elena Dur\u00e1n, a globally renowned flute player.\n- \u00b7 We supplied equipment including playground furniture and sports equipment to schools. We also worked with the Federal Government's 'The School is Ours' programme to help provide infrastructure such as restrooms, a pedagogical classroom and multipurpose sports court.\n- \u00b7 With support from INNOVEC, we launched two pilot projects to enhance the wellbeing of children living near our Penmont mine (see case study).\n\n## HELPING CHILDREN DEVELOP SELF-ESTEEM AND RESILIENCE\n\nOur support has enabled 80 children from local communities close to our Penmont facility to develop greater self-esteem and resilience. Developed by UNESCO, the 'Explore my World and Take Care of my Body' programme takes girls and boys aged three to eight on a journey to discover the human body, the five senses and the recognition, expression and regulation of emotions. The programme adopts a gender perspective to achieve equity and inclusion,\n\nand promotes self-knowledge, emotional awareness, empathy and community involvement. Adapted to our requirements with the assistance of INNOVEC and deployed with the support of Semilla Teatro, the programme has so far been piloted in the communities of Desemboque and Ejido Juan \u00c1lvarez. Two adults from the neighbourhood have been trained so that the programme can continue in the local school.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'I AM HAPPY BECAUSE MY GRANDDAUGHTER SHARED WITH ME HER LEARNINGS.

The Covid-19 pandemic has continued to be challenging for our communities. In 2020, our response was to collaborate by donating personal protection equipment, ventilators and raising awareness on the use of masks. In 2021, we partnered with health authorities to support vaccination logistics in our communities.\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 We supported municipal vaccination logistics to encourage higher vaccination rates among our workers, families and communities (see case study).\n- \u00b7 We supported rapid testing in remote communities, donating masks and raising awareness.\n- \u00b7 We shared our knowledge, measures and advice to help reduce the spread of Covid-19 in our communities.\n- \u00b7 We supported a safe return to school by donating masks and supplies of hygiene equipment.\n- \u00b7 We organised campaigns to donate 550,000 N95, surgical and artisanal masks to communities near our operations, and also raised awareness about their usage.\n- \u00b7 We donated food to vulnerable people in local communities and also through the Food Bank in the Municipality of Fresnillo.\n- \u00b7 We provided first aid training to volunteers in community health centres and donated an ambulance to the Red Cross Caborca, in collaboration with civil society and authorities, to improve emergency response in neighbouring communities (see case study).\n- \u00b7 We collaborated with civil society and health authorities to organise our sixth Health Week in Penmont (see case study).\n\n## PROVIDING FREE HEALTHCARE TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES\n\nIn 2020, Covid-19 forced us to cancel some of our community programmes because large gatherings could increase the risk of contagion. As vaccination progressed and cases of infection fell, we took the opportunity to relaunch our annual Health Week, which has proved popular and successful among communities close to Penmont. Working with our partners, we formed a 60-strong team to offer 13,000 practical support interventions to people living in 26 communities in the Coastal Corridor district. Among the services on offer, members of the National\n\nAutonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Foundation provided 20 modules for free dental and eye care, while general medicine, vaccination, height and weight measurement, reproductive health and blood group detection was offered by local and national public health institutions. We joined efforts with the Teleton Foundation to offer physiotherapy, occupational therapy, pulmonary and language therapy, as well as nutrition and paediatric medical consultation, while our health team offered Covid-19 tests and general medical care.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY IN MY COMMUNITY!

In the Caborca district, which is close to Penmont, first responder support is provided by 'Auxiliares de las casas de salud' (community health volunteers). We partnered with the Red Cross to train 16 volunteers from six Caborca communities to build the Auxiliares' capacity to provide first aid and promote healthy habits. The training is carried out over five months and\n\nincludes basic anatomy, patient evaluation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and emergency response (cardiovascular, respiratory, poisoning, diabetic and paediatric, among others). The result is a stronger connection between the volunteers, the Red Cross and local health authorities and an improved emergency response service for local people. In addition, we also donated an ambulance to Red Cross in Caborca.\n\n'IT'S A GREAT LEARNING OPPORTUNITY THAT WILL BE OF GREAT HELP TO MY COMMUNITY, SINCE MANY PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES.

During the year, the project benefitted over 250 people.\n\nFamilies were given materials to construct greenhouses, as well as seeds and technical support about growing vegetables. In addition, they received materials to build chicken pens and feeders, and were supplied with feed, 60 chickens\n\nand training to prevent diseases. Together with our partners, we regularly engage the participating families and provide training and technical assistance. In the short term, the project seeks to improve nutrition, and to develop the community's capacity to generate their own food, such as eggs, meat, pumpkins, radishes, coriander, cucumbers, lettuces, onions and chard. Looking further ahead, our aim is to inspire more sustainable models where the community, authorities and Fresnillo work more closely in partnership.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'WE ARE PART OF THE VEGETABLE GARDENS PROJECT, THEY TRAINED US TO FERTILISE OUR GARDENS AND WE HAVE HARVESTED RADISHES, ZUCCHINI, CILANTRO, PEAS AND CUCUMBERS.

Taking and managing risk responsibly is essential to running our business safely, effectively and in a way that creates value for all our stakeholders. Risk management is one of our management team's core responsibilities and is central to our decision-making process.\n\n## Our approach\n\nEffective risk management enables us to manage both the threats and the opportunities associated with our strategy and operations. Our risk management process helps us identify, evaluate, plan, communicate, and manage material risks that have the potential to impact our business objectives. While risk management is a key accountability and performance criterion for our leaders, all employees have responsibility for identifying and managing risks. Our risk management framework reflects the importance of risk awareness across Fresnillo plc. It enables us to identify, assess, prioritise and manage risks in order to deliver the value creation objectives defined in our business model.\n\nOur Board oversees our principal risks and associated management responses, while the Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls. Our risk management system comprises six core elements (see page 121) - one of which is our risk management framework, which sets out clear roles and responsibilities, standards and procedures. We also have three lines of defence to verify that risks are being effectively managed in line with our policy, standards and procedures, including across core business processes such as finance, health and safety, social performance, environment and major hazards.\n\nRisk governance basis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## THE BOARD\n\n- \u00b7  Reviews and approves risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Identifies strategic risks.\n- \u00b7  Oversees execution and implementation of controls into strategic and operating plans.\n- \u00b7  Assesses level of risk related to achieving strategic objectives.\n\n## OPERATIONAL LEVEL\n\n- \u00b7  Risk identification and assessment across mining operations, projects and exploration sites.\n- \u00b7  Risk mitigation and internal controls monitoring embedded across functional areas and business/uni00A0units.\n\nThe Company's risk profile has been developed based on the most significant risks in our business profiles. All of our principal risks were reviewed at least twice during the year, including through Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), which were developed to help embed the risk appetite framework in the business and enhance the monitoring and mitigation of risks.\n\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic posed new challenges for the risk department and the Executive Committee in 2020 and 2021. Due to the uncertainty around the pandemic, all strategic decisions of the Company were analysed using risk scenarios modelling their potential impacts. In addition five new processes were implemented: (i) a monthly procedure for evaluating and mitigating principal risks; (ii) a process to identify and analyse the impact of the pandemic in all the Company's risks including projects, with a main focus on the health and safety of employees and identification of new risks; (iii) dashboards were constructed for each business unit to monitor mitigation actions and risk level; (iv) impact and probability scenarios were conducted for risks related to the supply chain of critical inputs for operations, cost increase and projects, and v) collaboration with government, the sector, health experts and communities to ensure that we followed best practice.\n\n- \u00b7  Monitors exposures to ensure their nature and extent are aligned with overall goals and strategic objectives.\n- \u00b7  Determines the nature and extent of principal risks.\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Supports the Board in monitoring risk exposures against risk appetite.\n- \u00b7  Reviews the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems.\n- \u00b7  Sets tone on risk management culture.\n\n## INTERNAL AUDIT\n\n- \u00b7  Supports the Audit Committee in evaluating the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies, and internal controls implemented by management.\n- \u00b7  Risk awareness, and safety culture embedded in day-to-day operations.\n\nAll risk governance, including principal, individual and emerging risks. Including personnel at mine sites, development projects, exploration sites and support areas.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for everybody, worldwide. We have implemented risk techniques and processes to identify new risks associated with the pandemic, while also analysing its impact on all our risks. The changes to working practices that we have introduced in response to Covid-19 have created opportunities to accelerate digital transformation and enhance safety and productivity.\n\nEvery aspect of our risk management framework exists to challenge and evaluate the status of our risk profile in the pursuit of our business objectives. We challenge this status through three lines of defence that support leaders in critically reviewing and validating their own operating assumptions.\n\n## Risk management system\n\nOur risk management system is based on risk identification, assessment, prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring processes, which are continually evaluated, improved and enhanced in line with best practice.\n\nIn addition to our established risk management activities, our executives - including operations and projects managers, the controllership group, HSECR and exploration managers - regularly engage in strengthening the effectiveness of our current controls. These actions support the executives and the Board in each of their responsibilities.",

        "page_content": "## Managing our risks and opportunities continued\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nThe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code covers emerging risks and requires the Board to carry out a robust assessment of the Company's emerging risks, disclose procedures to identify them and also explain how these are being managed.\n\nThis requirement has been adopted and embedded within the Company's risk management reporting process and, in parallel with the day-to-day management of risk, within each business unit and project. The risk control and assessment processes in mines, exploration offices and projects were adapted to pay particular attention to emerging risks. At each location, health, safety, security, environment and community relations (HSECR) risk-responsible staff monitor local information and analyses related to Fresnillo plc's emerging risks. This monitoring process involves building scenarios for three, five and ten years for each emerging risk and quarterly performance indicators that assess probability and impact.\n\nFresnillo plc defines an emerging risk as a new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, a risk that is known to some degree but is not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid or long-term future, have significant implications for the achievement of the organisation's strategic plan. Furthermore, Fresnillo plc considers emerging risks in the context of longer-term impact and shorterterm risk velocity. The Company has therefore defined emerging risks as those risks captured on a risk register that: i) are likely to be of significant scale beyond a five-year timeframe; or ii) have the velocity to significantly increase in severity within the three-year period.\n\nTo strengthen our emerging risks management framework, during 2021 we carried out activities to: i) identify new emerging risks in light of Covid-19 and climate change; ii) reassess the emerging risks identified in 2020; iii) deploy effective monitoring mechanisms; iv) carry\n\nout horizon scanning to consider disruptive scenarios, and; v) implement mitigating control actions and enhance our risk awareness culture. This process involved workshops, surveys and meetings with the Executive Committee, business unit leaders, support and corporate areas, as well as suppliers, contractors and customers. We also consulted third-party information from global risk reports, academic publications, risk consulting experts and industry benchmarks.\n\nOur risk management standards promote communication of up-to-date information on the Company and industry risks, trends and emerging risks. This year's emerging risk assessment determined the two most exposed emerging risks to be: 'Water crisis' and 'Technological disruption' and identified two new emerging risks: 'Transition to a lowcarbon future' and 'Increasing societal and investor expectations'.\n\nRelevant emerging risks are discussed below:\n\n| Emerging risk                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Mitigating actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Time scale   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| 1 Water crisis (linked to   climate change  principal risk)                       | Lack of sufficient water resources   to meet water consumption   demands in a region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Water is critical to mining   processes.

Threats of theft of dor\u00e9, minerals, concentrates and assets from mines and projects have also increased.\n- \u00b7 While gold and silver prices have remained strong despite the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economic crisis in the world, and especially in Mexico, is a high risk that has a negative impact on the supply chain of critical operating inputs, operating costs and contractor availability. For this reason, the risk of 'Impact of metal prices and global macroeconomic developments' remains within the main risks.\n- \u00b7 The risk of 'Access to land ' has increased in recent years as it has become increasingly difficult to negotiate the price of land. Landowners demand more money and benefits for access to land. At the same time, the Federal Government continues its policy of not granting new mining\n\n## Our risk matrix\n\nA consistent assessment of the probability and impact of risk occurrence is fundamental to establishing, prioritising and managing the risk profile of the Company.

In addition, the prevailing insecurity in the regions where our mining interests are located may not allow the necessary work to be carried out to demonstrate the minimum investments required by law, which could lead to the cancellation of the concession.\n- \u00b7 The 'Licence to operate' risk is one of the main risks that have increased in probability of occurrence and impact, as communities near mines and projects increasingly demand more benefits. The environmental impact of mines is an issue of concern to communities near our operations and they are increasingly demanding more information and mitigating actions. Activism by mining advocacy groups and other organisations increases the risk of social conflict, fuelling public perception against mining. Finally, insecurity and access to water are the issues that most concern people and community leaders in the regions where we operate.",

Such actions could include stricter environmental regulations, forms of procurement or explosives, more challenging permit processes, more onerous tax compliance obligations for us and our contractors, as well as more frequent reviews by tax authorities.\n\nThe right of indigenous communities to be consulted regarding mining concessions could potentially affect the granting of new concessions in Mexico.\n\nThe Federal Government wants to discourage the generation of energy based on clean sources and encourage that from fuel oil and coal.\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 The Federal Government reported that the delivery of concessions to mining companies would be reviewed and that no more concessions would be granted during this six-year term (ending in 2024).\n- \u00b7 Labour reform prohibiting outsourcing, mainly leading to complications in the relationship with contractors.\n- \u00b7 New taxes and discrepancies in the criteria used in audits carried out by the tax authority.\n- \u00b7 Increase in the frequency of the reviews by the tax authorities with special focus on the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Potential adverse actions resulting from a change in government in the states of Zacatecas, Sonora and Chihuahua.\n- \u00b7 The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or TMEC) with its new labour provisions.\n- \u00b7 Given that the population does not systematically follow Covid-19 prevention measures; that health authorities may not effectively implement the Covid-19 vaccination programme; that there are people who do not want to be vaccinated; that there are new variants of the virus such as Delta and Omicron, we could experience a reduction in the number of people available to work in the mines, which would materially affect our productivity.\n\nWe paid special attention to the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Government actions that negatively impact the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory changes to mining rights and adverse fiscal changes.\n- \u00b7 Change in tax regulations.\n- \u00b7 Increase in the frequency of the reviews by the tax authorities with special focus on the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Inability to obtain necessary water concessions because of government control or private interests.\n- \u00b7 Failures/delays in obtaining the required environmental permits.\n- \u00b7 The Federal Government promotes investment in coal rather than renewable or clean energy. This has led to increased difficulty in operating on clean energy.\n- \u00b7 The Federal Government implementation of policies that support the use of coal will lead to more greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energies.\n- \u00b7 The Federal Government recently purchased a refinery to produce gasoline and diesel in Houston, USA. This acquisition reinforces the strategy of encouraging the consumption of fossil fuels derived from coal and fails to promote the use of clean or green energies.\n- \u00b7 The Federal Government is promoting a reform of the energy law to limit access to private investment and strengthen the governmentowned Federal Electricity Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad). If this reform is approved, there is a risk that there will not be enough electricity to operate the mines.\n- \u00b7 A Federal Government initiative aims to discontinue the Mining Fund (Financial support that the government provides to communities near the mine for social development). This would have an impact on mining development in the country.\n- \u00b7 In addition, Mexico's corruption perception remains high. The country's score in the International Transparency 2021 Corruption Perception Index was relatively unchanged, despite a higher ranking. As a result, delay in obtaining permits for certain operations and/or projects remains a risk.",

These thefts can take place inside the mines or during transportation.\n\nOur employees, contractors and suppliers face the risk of theft, kidnapping, extortion or damage due to insecurity in some of the regions where we operate.\n\nThe influence and dispute of territories by drug cartels, other criminal elements and general anarchy in some of the regions where we operate, combined with our exploration activities and projects in certain areas of drug deposit, transfer or cultivation, makes working in these areas a particular risk to us.\n\nThe Federal Government created the Secretariat of Citizen Security and Protection as part of the comprehensive strategy to reduce insecurity. It also created the National Guard, mostly comprising military personnel, with the aim of combating organised crime and drug cartels. Unfortunately, state or local police in most states are unprepared and ill-equipped to combat organised crime, have low wages and are sometimes infiltrated by crime.\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 A severe increase in the presence of organised crime in the vicinity of the mining units particularly in Fresnillo, Saucito and Juanicipio.\n- \u00b7 A severe increase in the number of high impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping, extortion) in the regions where our mining units are located.\n- \u00b7 Increased consumption and sale of drugs at the mining units, particularly Saucito.\n- \u00b7 Theft of concentrates and assets in mining units and/or during transfer.\n- \u00b7 Theft of material, equipment, tools and spare parts from mines and projects.\n- \u00b7 Roadblocks or blockages on the roads and/or highways near the mining units.\n\nAccording to information from the Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection, the National Guard and the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, the presence of organised crime and high-impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping and extortion) increased in 2021, in the states where our business units and projects are located, such as Zacatecas, Guanajuato, and Sonora.\n\nThe main risks we face are:\n\n- \u00b7 High-impact robberies.\n- \u00b7 Theft of assets such as minerals, equipment, instruments, inputs, etc.\n- \u00b7 Consumption and sale of toxic substances in our mining units.\n- \u00b7 Homicide.\n- \u00b7 Kidnappings.\n- \u00b7 Extortions.\n- \u00b7 Vandalism.\n- \u00b7 The Mexican state of Zacatecas is notorious for high levels of perceived insecurity and high rates of high-impact crime in 2021. There are records of several vehicle thefts from company employees and organised crime checkpoints on the roads near Fresnillo and Saucito mines.\n- \u00b7 The Mexican State of Sonora is notorious for being under constant attack from organised crime gangs. Several attacks have taken place recently jeopardising the continuity of mining operations and the physical integrity of workers employed by Herradura and Noche Buena mines.",

In the Saucito and Fresnillo mines, in addition to the remote monitoring service, we have also built new local operating and command centres for each business unit. At the Juanicipio development project, we have the necessary infrastructure to provide security services during the mine construction process. Juanicipio also benefits from a local command and operation centre, as well as the remote monitoring service.\n- -Increase in logistical controls in order to reduce the potential for theft of mineral concentrate. These controls include the use of real-time tracking technology; surveillance cameras to identify alterations in the transported material; protection and support services on distribution routes; reduction in the number of authorised stops in order to optimise delivery times and minimise exposure of trucks transporting ore concentrates or dor\u00e9.\n\n## COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACT\n\n## KEY RISK INDICATORS\n\n## LINK TO STRATEGY\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the security risk.

However, this could be mitigated by carefully negotiating concessions with mining geological interest already granted.\n- \u00b7 It is becoming increasingly difficult to negotiate land prices, with landowners demanding more money and benefits for access to land.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nSuccessful access to land plays a key role in managing our mining rights, focusing on areas of strategic interest or value.\n\nAt the end of 2021, after disinvesting certain areas of mining interest, we maintained 1.439 million hectares of mining concessions granted. A further 238,090 hectares is in the process of being granted. In total, we have 1.678 million hectares, representing a year-on-year decrease of 2,000 hectares.\n\nOther initiatives include:\n\n- \u00b7 Meticulous analysis of exploration objectives and construction project designs to minimise land requirements.\n- \u00b7 Judicious use of lease or occupation contracts with purchase options, in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.\n- \u00b7 Early participation of our community relations teams during the negotiation and acquisition of socially challenging objectives.\n\n## COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACT\n\n## KEY RISK INDICATORS\n\n## LINK TO STRATEGY\n\nDuring 2021, insecurity problems in our exploration and operations areas have increased.

These expectations go beyond the responsible management of negative impacts to include continuous engagement and contribution to stakeholder development.\n\nFailure to adequately address these expectations increases the risk of opposition to mining projects and operations. Negative sentiment towards mining or specifically towards Fresnillo plc could have an impact on our reputation and acceptability in the regions where we have a presence.\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 Higher expectations and scrutiny of social and environmental performance.\n- \u00b7 Rising expectations on shared benefits regarding land agreements.\n- \u00b7 Perceived competition on access to natural resources, notably water.\n- \u00b7 Significant reduction in government spending on community infrastructure, development programmes and services.\n- \u00b7 Anti-mining activism fuelling opposition to mining.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nCovid-19 response: Collaboration with health authorities to support the logistics of vaccination centres in the regions where we operate. Campaigns to raise awareness of preventive measures such as the use of masks. Rapid testing support for remote communities. Collaboration with parents and school authorities on the safe return to classes.\n\nCommunity engagement: Our strategy, which embraces all phases of the mining lifecycle, is based on purposeful engagement to address concerns and expectations. Key activities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Organising formal and informal meetings to enable stakeholder identification and engagement planning.\n- \u00b7 Carrying out social baseline studies that include human rights and due diligence regarding indigenous peoples, and perception studies that support our social management plans and help us manage impacts, risks and opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Operating a grievance mechanism to address stakeholder concerns.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring public opinion within local and international media.\n- \u00b7 Collaborating with peers to adopt best practices in social performance.\n- \u00b7 Communicating our best practices regarding social and environmental responsibility.\n\nEnvironmental performance: Optimising our use of resources, curbing any negative impact of our activities and being transparent and accountable regarding our environmental footprint are crucial elements of sustainable mining and help us to be positively perceived by communities and regulators.\n\n## COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACT\n\n## KEY RISK INDICATORS\n\n## LINK TO STRATEGY\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic increased the risk to our social licence to operate in some regions, mainly as a result of nearby communities being worried about contracting the virus from contractors and suppliers visiting the area.\n\nCovid-19 has increased social expectations regarding corporate citizenship.

Our approach to health aims to pre-emptively identify and manage the risks to which our workforce is exposed.\n\nSharing the benefits of mining: In addition to effective stakeholder engagement, sharing the benefits of mining also plays an important role in supporting our social acceptability. Employment, procurement, talent development and the payment of our fair share of taxes contribute to regional development. Our social investment portfolio focuses on education, water, health & sports, and capacity building to support our communities, in collaboration with non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For our education focus, we work with IBBY, INNOVEC and First Robotics; for water, with Captar AC; and for health with the National University Foundation.\n\nResponsible approach to managing the impacts of the reform to regulate subcontracting: Our response to the New labour legislation in Mexico has ensured compliance with the reform and enabled us to retain the qualified contractors' workers essential to our business model and the delivery of our strategy. Extending job offers to the qualified workforce has also mitigated the negative impacts of the reform on local people and communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see Communities\n\non pages 109-112",

The way that mining works (especially underground), where there are several workers in one place, further increases the possibility of contagion. Due to the complex nature of mining operations and the remote locations in which they are often located, it is difficult to implement health measures and carry medical prevention equipment.\n\nClose working conditions at mine sites are placing workers on the frontline in terms of health and safety risks, prompting us to quarantine workers when national lockdown regulations did not force us to do so.\n\nFaced with the risk of contagion from the Covid-19 pandemic threat, we implemented several strategies to protect and preserve the health of employees and contractors in all business units. The close cooperation between our human resources function and our medical team has been fundamental to the application of timely tests and the care of infected personnel.\n\nHowever, the risk of contagion continues and increased in the months of September to December, mainly in the Fresnillo district, where the highest number of cases of contagion across the Company were detected. This situation may be exacerbated if and when new strains of the virus reach Mexico.\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 Unfortunately, not everyone follows measures to prevent Covid-19 and that increases the risk of contagion.\n- \u00b7 Workers in the mining sector have been particularly affected by the pandemic, given the employment architecture of the industry, which can feature remote fly in-fly out or drive in-drive out operations, congested underground working conditions, and workers residing in mine-site compounds or neighbouring communities. These conditions make some Covid-19 preventive measures difficult to implement, which makes mineworkers vulnerable to both acquiring and spreading the virus.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nOur employee performance management system is designed to attract and retain key employees by creating suitable reward and remuneration structures and providing personal development opportunities. We have a talent management system to identify and develop internal candidates for key management positions, as well as identify suitable external candidates where appropriate.\n\nWe aim for continuous improvement, driven by opportunities for training, development and personal growth; in short, we focus on fair recruitment, fair pay and benefits and gender equality. In the corporate function, 18% are women as are 34% of new joiners, while 18% of the female population were promoted during the year.\n\nRecruitment: We have evaluated our recruitment requirements for key positions, and our goal is to meet them through internal training and promotion, as well as by recruitment through:\n\n- \u00b7 Our close relationships with universities that offer earth science programmes. We have programmes dedicated to identifying potential performance-based candidates who can be hired as trainees and/or employees at graduation. During the year, we hosted 42 students from different Earth Science professions at our mining units to support their training, and 87 engineers took part in our training programme.\n- \u00b7 CETLAR (Centre for Technical Studies of Pe\u00f1oles), which trains mechanical and electrical technicians. Ten of the twelve 2021 graduates were hired as full-time employees.\n\nUntil such a time that the vaccine is broadly available, and the population becomes immune to Covid-19, this will remain a very high risk to the Fresnillo plc workforce and in general to all humanity.\n\nOur people are critical to meeting our goals. We face multiple risks in the processes of selection, recruitment, training and retention of talented people with technical skills and experience.\n\nObtaining qualified labour in the mining sector has become a major risk. More and more people trained and experienced in mining processes are required. Unfortunately, there are not enough candidates with the required profiles.\n\nDigital and technological innovation has the potential to generate substantial improvements in the productivity, safety and environmental management of the Company. However, to achieve this, in addition to demanding significant investment, different skillsets will be required in the workforce. There is a risk that our workforce will either be unable to transform as needed or will be resistant to change and unwilling to accept the impact of automation or to acquire new technological skills.\n\nThe lack of reliable contractors with sufficient infrastructure, machinery, performance history and trained people is also a risk that could affect our ability to develop and build mining works.\n\nIn addition, it is difficult to hire the employees of contractors working for the Company.\n\n- \u00b7 There was a significant increase in staff turnover during 2021.\n- \u00b7 Talent retention became more difficult this year.\n- \u00b7 At some mines we have a lack of specialised personnel to cover working hours.\n- \u00b7 In certain regions where we operate there are not enough candidates with the necessary skills to operate the mining equipment.\n- \u00b7 With the new labour law prohibiting outsourcing, we had to hire staff from contractors, and this caused added complications.\n\nRetention: Our goal is to be the employer of choice, and we recognise that to be a profitable and sustainable company, we need to generate value for our employees and their families. We do this by providing a healthy, safe, productive and team-oriented work environment that not only encourages our people to reach their potential, but also supports process improvements.\n\nIn partnership with the University of Arizona, we developed a fivehour online training module on diversity, equality and inclusion for our executives, managers and high potential talent. Management and leadership skills development programmes were conducted with 40 superintendents, 76 counsellors and 74 facilitators.\n\nIn order to keep our staff updated and trained, 83% of employees and 98% of unionised staff have received training this year. In 2021, 216 employees participated in institutional development programmes, which means that 59% of staff with more than two years of service have participated at least once. Of this 59%, 12% are women (18% of employees are female). 502 courses and studies were conducted through external training, benefiting 383 employees. 83% of our leaders have participated in institutional development programmes focused on leadership.",

This has led to a complex work environment at the Fresnillo mine, with violent clashes between the union and a group of workers seeking to register a new independent union.\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nIncreased communication with trade union leaders in mining units to monitor the working climate.\n\nMeetings have been held with groups of workers who want to introduce new unions to the Company.\n\nA specialist group in labour relations was formed to meet the demands of dissident workers.\n\nOur strategy is to integrate unionised personnel into each team in the business unit. We achieve this by clearly assigning responsibilities and through programmes aimed at maintaining close relations with trade unions in mines and at the national level.\n\nWe maintain close communication with trade union leaders at various levels of the organisation in order to: raise awareness of the economic situation facing the industry; share our production results; and encourage union participation in our security initiatives and other operational improvements.\n\nThese initiatives include the 'Security Guardians' programmes, certification partnerships, integration of high productivity equipment, and family activities.\n\n## COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACT\n\n## KEY RISK INDICATORS\n\n## LINK TO STRATEGY\n\nAlthough the pandemic did not severely affect this risk, it did slightly complicate the negotiations and delayed some agreements, but with no significant impact. Faced with the pandemic, the union requested the Company to take care of all the sanitary measures recommended by the health authority so that the workers could return to the mining units. Today, the union continues to support the safety measures that we adopted.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\n## CHANGE IN HEAT MAP\n\n## RISK RATING (RELATIVE POSITION)\n\nLow\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDecreasing\n\n2021: High (8)\n\n2020: High (5)\n\n- \u00b7 Union members' level of satisfaction.\n- \u00b7 Number of media mentions related to mining union developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe run the risk of an outside union seeking to destabilise the current union.\n\nNational union politics could adversely affect us, as could pressure from other mining unions seeking to take over Fresnillo's labour contracts.\n\n- \u00b7 The risk is that the fighting will continue and worsen and eventually the mine's workforce will be reduced. There is also a risk that this conflict could spread to other mines.\n- \u00b7 In addition, the TMEC (new trade agreement between Mexico, Canada and the United States replacing NAFTA) will result in new labour and trade union provisions.\n\nWe are proactive in our interactions with the union. When appropriate, we hire experienced legal advisers to support us on labour issues. We remain attentive to any developments in labour or trade union issues.\n\nWe started 2021 by conducting five regional labour update forums with company leaders and unions in Sonora, Coahuila and Zacatecas with 500 participants.\n\nFrom February to the end of the year, we carried out a job training programme for operational leaders of companies at the level of middle management, with the participation of 906 leaders.\n\nWe conducted a review of the contractual benefits for union members in our mines.\n\nOur executive leadership and the Executive Committee recognise the importance of trade union relations and follow any developments with interest.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see Our People on pages 78-81",

We fully recognise the importance of the confidentiality, continuity, integrity and security of our data and systems.\n\nAs a mining company, we can be under threat of cyber attacks from a broad set of groups, from 'hacktivists' and hostile regimes, to organised criminals. Their objectives range from taking advantage of mining's role in regional and global supply chains, to impacting national economies.\n\nSome threat actors also focus on finding unprotected, misconfigured and unpatched systems and exploit them, due to the industry's heavy reliance on technology and automated systems that supports operations.\n\nThe following are the top eight cybersecurity and privacy risks that have been identified through environment monitoring and workshops with business units, operations, and IT. These risks comprise Pe\u00f1oles/ Fresnillo overall cybersecurity and privacy risk profile:\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber risks have increased significantly in recent years owing in part to the Covid-19 pandemic and the proliferation of new digital technologies, the increasing degree of connectivity and a material increase in monetisation of cybercrime.\n- \u00b7 Theft of information through social engineering and 'phishing' campaigns (fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames or passwords, by appearing to be a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication).\n\n## CONTROLS, MITIGATING ACTIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nOur information security management model is designed with defensive structural controls to prevent and mitigate the effects of computer risks. It employs a set of rules and procedures, including a disaster recovery plan, to restore critical IT functions in the event of an attack.\n\nOur systems are continuously monitored by cybersecurity experts at a security operations center (SOC). Incident response plans are in place and tested periodically to ensure we can respond quickly and effectively.\n\nOur systems are regularly audited to identify any potential threats to the operations and additional systems have been put in place to protect our assets and data.\n\nWe have implemented a training and awareness programme, which is designed to increase awareness of cyber risk and ensure that employees take the appropriate actions.\n\nWe have invested in global IT security platforms and managed security services providers (MSSPs) in order to proactively monitor and manage our cyber risks. We conduct routine third-party penetration tests to independently confirm the security of our IT systems and we seek to enhance the monitoring of our operational technology platforms.\n\nSince 2020, a fully staffed cybersecurity office has been in place to improve our cybersecurity position. Its main objective is to identify and manage cybersecurity risks and align them with our business mission and strategy, as well as monitor the supporting processes. Aligned to best practices and standards, its approach is based on two key frameworks:\n\n## COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACT\n\n## KEY RISK INDICATORS\n\n## LINK TO STRATEGY\n\nWith the Covid-19 pandemic, this risk has increased mainly due to the accelerated digital transformation, increased 'phishing' attacks and a reduction in the robustness of IT defences due to remote working.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\n## CHANGE IN HEAT MAP\n\n## RISK RATING (RELATIVE POSITION)\n\n- \u00b7 Total number of cybersecurity incidents affecting our Company.\n- \u00b7 Number of media mentions related to cybersecurity issues affecting the mining industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.  Corruption of data - Critical data where any unauthorised modification can have adverse impacts.\n- 2.  Unauthorised access - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents due to incorrect access permissions or system abuse, exploit or misuse.\n- 3.  Breach and data theft - Disclosure of critical and sensitive company data by an internal or external source.\n- 4.  Business disruption - Disrupting key applications or systems for a period of time.\n- 5.  Lack of cybersecurity ownership - Failure to assign responsibility for implementing and adopting cybersecurity practices on a daily basis.\n- 6.  Non-compliance - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents resulting in non-compliance with applicable regulations, including privacy.\n- 7.  Health and safety incidents - Breach of availability, integrity or confidentiality of data which impacts health and safety.\n- 8.  Halt or loss of operations - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents which result in loss of operating licence or closure of operations.\n- \u00b7 An increased reliance on cloud systems and infrastructure can make IT defences less robust and may bypass security controls.\n- \u00b7 Access to hacking tools and training is readily available and heavily automated. Without proper punishment for perpetrators globally, attackers can easily launch sophisticated attacks with little risk.\n- \u00b7 There is a global lack of regulation regarding cybersecurity and e-crime that could deter criminals.\n- \u00b7 The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST CSF) Cybersecurity Framework that describes how companies can assess and improve their ability to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks.\n- \u00b7 Information Control Objectives and Technologies to Others (COBIT), which was created by ISACA, the international professional association for IT management and governance, to provide an implementable set of IT-related controls, processes and facilitators.\n\nOur approach is also based on the MITRE ATT&CK \u2122 which is used as the basis for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, government and in the cybersecurity products and services community.\n\nWe also monitor the environment for relevant alerts and act proactively to assess our readiness, reinforcing our capabilities as needed.\n\nA governance model, continuous risk monitoring, information security policies, awareness-raising campaigns and training forms the basis of our IT/OT operational guarantee.\n\nOur plan for 2022 is to focus our efforts on incorporating key indicators around cyber risk reduction in the cybersecurity dashboard, implementing and maturing controls in line with the threat landscape and emphasising the importance of individual responsibility to each employee, in order for them to stay vigilant and alert to cyber threats.",

We seek to achieve operational excellence to ensure that our employees and contractors go home safe and healthy, and that there are no adverse impacts on the communities and the environment where we operate.\n\nOur environmental management system ensures compliance with national and international regulations and best practices, provides transparency and supports initiatives that reduce our environmental footprint. We are a company responsible for its activities and the fulfilment of the environmental commitments made.\n\nOur environmental management system, together with our investment in preventive measures and training, are key factors that reduce the risk of large environmental incidents.\n\nBased on the level of perceived risk due to recent serious and catastrophic developments in the industry, the Board decided to increase the severity of this risk in 2018 and maintained the same level in 2021.\n\nHerradura, Saucito, Fresnillo, Noche Buena, San Juli\u00e1n and Ci\u00e9nega each have an integrated certificate of management. Fresnillo and Saucito have ISO 9001; Herradura and Noche Buena have GIS ISO 14001 and 45000.\n\nThe Executive Committee is well aware of the risks associated with tailings dams. Therefore, before we construct a reservoir, we carry out a series of studies to confirm the suitability of the area. These studies include geotechnical, geological, geophysical, hydrological and seismic analyses. Before construction begins, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), through the Federal Office for Environmental Protection (PROFEPA), conducts several assessment studies and then continues to periodically review deposits in relation to the works.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more details see Environment\n\non pages 86-108\n\n## COVID-19 PANDEMIC IMPACT\n\n## KEY RISK INDICATORS\n\n## LINK TO STRATEGY\n\nThe construction programmes for new tailings dams and the expansion of existing ones were adjusted, due to the increased complexity caused by the pandemic, such as the required health and safety protocols.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\n## CHANGE IN HEAT MAP\n\n## RISK RATING (RELATIVE POSITION)\n\n2021: Medium (11)\n\n2020: Medium (9)\n\n- \u00b7 Number of business units with ISO 14001:2004 certification.\n- \u00b7 Number of business units with Clean Industry certification.\n- \u00b7 Number of business units with International Cyanide Code certification.\n- \u00b7 Number of environmental permits for all advanced exploration projects (according to schedule).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nany of our TSFs could result in fatalities, damage to the environment, regulatory violations, reputational damage and the disruption of the quality of life of neighbouring communities as well as our operations.\n\n- \u00b7 Impact on the environment in the area of influence through erosion/ deforestation/forest loss or disturbance of biodiversity as a result of the operations of the business unit or project activities.\n- \u00b7 An event involving a leak or spill of cyanide or SO 2 , which due to its chemical properties could generate an event of major consequence on the premises of the business unit and/or in the nearby area.\n- \u00b7 Implications of future regulations for our tailings management.\n- \u00b7 Insufficient information regarding of the state of some tailings dams, both current and historical.\n- \u00b7 Some historical tailings dams located in rural areas are now surrounded by facilities or residential areas, increasing the consequences of failure.\n- \u00b7 Tailings dam failures that could cause landslides or collapses.\n\nEnvironmental protection and safety are critical for cyanide leaching systems.

It demands a long-term perspective to address both physical climate change and low-carbon transition risks and uncertainties.\n\nDue to climate change, our operations and projects are expected to face acute physical risks from extreme events such as high temperatures, droughts and extreme rainfall from more frequent and intense hurricanes in the Pacific.\n\nThese natural disasters may affect the health and safety of our people, damage access roads and a mine's infrastructure, disrupt operations and affect our neighbouring communities. In addition, the rise in temperatures may increase our water demand while the decrease in annual precipitation exacerbates water stress in the regions where we operate.\n\nThese chronic risks may intensify the competition to access water resources, increasing risks to the social licence to operate. The societal responses to transition to a low carbon economy include more stringent\n\n## FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO RISK\n\n- \u00b7 The Federal Government promotes investment in coal rather than in renewable or clean energy. This has led to operating on clean energy becoming more difficult.\n- \u00b7 The Federal Government's implementation of policies that support the use of coal will lead to more greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energies.\n- \u00b7 Current and emerging climate regulations have the potential to result in increased cost, to change supply and demand dynamics for our products and create legal compliance issues and litigation, all of which could impact the Group's financial performance and reputation. Our operations also face risk due to the physical impacts of climate change, including extreme weather.\n- \u00b7 Warming temperatures will increase water scarcity in some locations, inhibiting water-dependent operations, complicating site rehabilitation and bringing companies into direct competition with communities for water resources.\n\nregulations to reduce emissions, a transformation of the global energy system, changes in behaviour and consumption choices and emerging technologies.\n\nAdaptation measures are necessary to build the flexibility to respond to physical and transitional changes.\n\nThe most important risk we currently face is to comply with all the provisions and requirements of international agreements to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFailure to adapt to the transition and physical impacts of climate change, include:\n\n- \u00b7 Government legislation to limit mining activities.\n- \u00b7 Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Acute physical risks such as the increased likelihood of extreme weather events.\n- \u00b7 Chronic physical risks such as changing weather patterns including rising temperatures and sea levels.\n- \u00b7 The supply of critical inputs to mining processes, such as water and energy, is likely to face greater constraints.\n- \u00b7 Employee health and safety will be put at risk by increases in communicable diseases, exposure to heat-related illnesses and the likelihood of accidents related to rising temperatures.\n- \u00b7 Obtaining and maintaining a social licence to operate will become more difficult in communities where climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities and increases direct competition between the company and the community for resources.\n- \u00b7 Increased physical and non-physical risks will make project financing more difficult to secure.\n- \u00b7 Global warming and its effects such as droughts, hurricanes, winter storms, and heavy rains, can cause stoppages in unit operations.",

To ensure we remain resilient in the long term, our business model is continuously stress tested against the key uncertainties within the emerging risks, with recommended actions to mitigate potential downside.\n\nThe Directors reviewed the viability period and confirmed the suitability of a five-year period to December 2026. This period aligns with the mining industry's typical planning cycle and with the Company's five-year forecast period normally used to evaluate liquidity and contingency plans. It allows us to model capital expenditure and development programmes planned during the timeframe and reflects cash flows generated by the projects currently under development. Due to the long business cycles in our industry, the Directors considered that a shorter time period would be insufficient.\n\nReporting on the Company's viability requires the Directors to consider those principal risks that could impair the solvency and liquidity of the Company. In order to determine those risks, the Directors robustly assessed the Group-wide principal risks and operationspecific risks by undertaking consultations with\n\nexecutive management, mine managers and other personnel across our operations. These consultations also enabled the Directors to identify low probability, high loss scenarios 'singular events' - with the potential magnitude to severely impact the solvency and/or liquidity of Fresnillo.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing the Group's viability, the Directors identified that of our principal risks, the following are the most important:\n\n- i. 'Potential actions by the government', which could include a delay in obtaining permits and/or new restrictive regulations and the restriction on the granting of new mining concessions.\n- ii. 'Impact of metals prices and global macroeconomic developments', specifically volatility in the prices of gold and silver over a period of time and the inflation in the prices of critical inputs to the operation.\n- iii.  'Security', especially the theft of explosives in the most insecure region.\n- iv.  'Access to land', especially due to disputes with the owners of the land where we have operations.\n- v. 'Safety', especially in scenarios that consider fatalities.\n- vi.  'Tailing and environmental incidents', especially the failure or rupture of a tailings dam.\n\nThis year, we also considered the effects of climate change on the viability scenarios, especially the impact of heavy rains and incorporated climate-related factors in scenarios 2, 3, 4 and 7. Nevertheless, our conclusion was that the most important scenarios are not at this stage materially impacted.\n\nHaving determined that none of the individual risks would in isolation compromise the Group's viability, the Directors went on to group principal risks into the following severe but plausible scenarios, in each case determining the risk proximity (how soon the risk could occur) and velocity (the speed with which the impact of a risk could be felt):\n\nScenario 1: Impact of metals prices and global macroeconomic developments. Our model assumes that prices for gold and silver in 2022 fall to US$1,492 per oz and US$16.9 per oz respectively. We further assume that precious metals prices remain at a low level for the following four years of the viability period, varying between US$1,942 - 1,676 per gold oz. and US$23.4 - 21.9 per silver oz.\n\nTo create an impartial projection for a future low metals prices environment, the Directors used an average of the three lowest forecasts for each year of the assessment, based on consensus estimates published by institutional financial analysts. This environment was deemed to be the most significant risk, and pervasive across the Company. (Principal risk.)\n\n## Scenario 2: Bench collapse at an open pit\n\nmine. A landslide occurs covering the lower pit of one of our mines. Due to the unexpected nature of the event, fatalities occur. Production is gradually ramped back up and re-established to full capacity. (Singular event.)\n\n## Scenario 3: Tailings deposit breach at a mine.\n\nA tailings deposit collapses and tailings are released into the surrounding area, causing environmental damage. A fund is created by the Company to be used to remediate and compensate for any damage caused. The investigation into the causes of the event is drawn out and further time is required before all environmental permits are reinstated. As a result, the mine remains closed throughout the viability assessment period. (Principal risk.)\n\n## Scenario 4: Flooding at a mine. An\n\nunforeseen fault containing water is cut into, leading to water entering the mine in excess of pumping capacity, thereby halting production of one of the mine's main areas. The ramp-up to pre-event production levels commences once management determines that it is safe to do so. (Singular event.)",

        "page_content": "## 2021 Viability statement and going concern statement continued\n\n## Scenario 5: Action by the Government\n\nat a mine. Explosives are stolen on site causing the authorities to suspend the mine's explosives permit. Production is halted while an investigation into the matter is completed. Once permits have been restored, production ramps back up to pre-event levels. (Principal risk.)\n\n## Scenario 6: Access to land at a mine. Conflicts\n\nwith local communities arise and result in the Company having to cease operations until negotiations can be finalised and the land can be re-occupied. (Principal risk.)\n\n## Scenario 7: Total power failure at a mine.\n\nThere is an unexpected power outage at a mine caused by a severe winter storm, which freezes gas and diesel pipelines and supply facilities. (Singular event.)\n\nThe hypothetical scenarios above are extremely severe in order to create outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. However, multiple control measures are in place to prevent and mitigate any such occurrences. Should any of these scenarios take place, various options are available to the Company in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue in operation, including the deferral of capital and/ or exploration expenditure. When quantifying the expected financial impact and remediation time required for each of these risks, management performed benchmarking against the Group's own experience and against publicly available information on relevant, comparable incidents in the mining industry.\n\nThe successful restructuring of the Company's debt, buying back US$482.1 million from the US$800 million Senior Notes at 5.5% due in 2023 and issuing new US$850 million Senior Notes at 4.25% due in 2050, helped reduce liquidity risk and ensure that viability scenarios did not have serious consequences. It is important to note that all the scenarios assume that the outstanding portion of the 2023 Notes (US$317.8 million) are paid when they fall due.\n\nAll scenarios were first evaluated using metals prices based on average analyst consensus. As no mitigations were necessary, it was decided that there was no threat to the viability of the Company. To create a more stringent test and further challenge the resilience of the Group, all scenarios were then overlaid with scenario 1, (low metals prices) and then re-evaluated.\n\nWhen these scenarios were re-modelled, none led to an extremely low or negative cash balance because the strong cash and other liquid funds balance at the end of 2021 (US$1,235.3 million) positions Fresnillo plc in a healthy financial situation. In addition, metals prices contribute to the preservation of a positive cash balance position through the scenarios assessed. The lowest cash balance level was identified in scenario number two, in combination with the low metals prices scenario. However, with mitigation actions this scenario would maintain a positive cash balance throughout the viability period, with a minimum level of US$115 million during the third year (2024).\n\nRisk management and internal control systems are in place throughout the Group. The internal control systems enable the Directors to monitor key variables that have the ability to impact the liquidity and solvency of the Group. We are confident that management is able to sufficiently mitigate any situations as they might occur.\n\nOur risk mitigation and control measures include a Crisis Committee, while the Board would also be briefed and convened as necessary, in order to respond to events as they develop. At each level of our organisation, we have appointed dedicated personnel responsible for media management and engaging with authorities and other stakeholders, depending on the magnitude of the crisis.\n\nBased on the results of this robust analysis and having considered the established controls for the risks and the available mitigating actions, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five-year period of their detailed assessment. This longer-term assessment process supports the Directors' statements on both viability, as set out above, and going concern.",

        "page_content": "## Going concern\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out above in the Strategic Review on pages 1-155. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial Review on pages 58-69. In addition, note 30 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2023 (being the going concern assessment period). The Directors have also considered the cash position as at 31 December 2021 (US$1,235.6 million) and the restructuring of debt during the period, as described in the financial review. In addition, they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with reduced silver and gold prices of US$20.1 and US$1,553 respectively throughout this period, whilst maintaining current budgeted expenditure and only considering projects approved by the Executive Committee. This resulted in our\n\ncurrent cash and cash equivalents balances reducing over time but maintaining sufficient liquidity throughout the period.\n\nThe Directors have further calculated prices (US$17.4 and US$1,308 for silver and gold respectively), which should they prevail to the end of 2023 would result in cash balances decreasing to minimal levels by the end of 2023, without applying mitigations.\n\nShould metals prices remain below the stressed prices above for an extended period, management has identified specific elements of capital and exploration expenditures which could be deferred without adversely affecting production profiles throughout the period. Finally, management could amend the mining plans to concentrate on production with a higher margin in order to accelerate cash generation without affecting the integrity of the mine plans.\n\nIn the prior year, the Directors reviewed scenarios that incorporated an estimated potential impact of government-imposed stoppages due to Covid-19 restrictions. The Directors reassessed the situation in the current year, considering in particular the fact mining was declared an essential activity by the Federal Government and there have been no further stoppages at any of our mines.\n\nFurthermore, as previously reported, we have implemented additional health and safety measures at each of our mines coupled with extensive targeted and random testing. The Directors concluded that the risk of government-imposed stoppages was low and therefore disclosure of a specific Covid scenario is no longer relevant.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management has sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.",

We recognise that we can only achieve long-term success by considering how our operations affect stakeholders such as communities and the environment, supported by a strong ethics culture.\n\nOur Section 172 Statement identifies our stakeholders, explains how we consider their interests in our principal decision-making processes, and also reports on progress towards achieving our objective of long-term success.\n\nRecent stakeholder reporting regulations in the UK are aligned with the international trends that are shaping the growing interest of society and investors in environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. These factors - which continue to evolve rapidly are the subject of increasing focus, and our Board recognises that our business model and strategy must respond effectively to those that are relevant to our stakeholders. Our materiality assessment (pages 72-73 of the Strategic Report) identifies the ESG factors that are significant to our stakeholders and material to our operations.\n\n## Our stakeholders\n\nWe identified our relevant stakeholders by considering their influence on the success of our business model and strategy. Our 'Putting our stakeholders first' section (page 14 of the Strategic Report) introduces our stakeholders, why they are important and the engagement strategies we deploy to build and maintain strong relationships. Our 'Managing Our Risks and Opportunities' section (pages 120-142 of the Strategic Report) evaluates the risks associated with these relationships and the strategies we use to mitigate them.\n\nWe provide the following information on our stakeholders:\n\n- \u00b7 our relevant stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 how they are relevant to our business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 their interests, needs and concerns;\n- \u00b7 how engagement is being conducted;\n- \u00b7 management and governance activities;\n- \u00b7 the actions and outcomes from engagement;\n- \u00b7 the metrics used to monitor relationships; and\n- \u00b7 what risks could affect our relationships with stakeholders.\n\n## Our principal decisions\n\nWe consider 'principal decisions' to be those decisions linked with our strategy, or resulting from major regulatory changes, that entail significant implications for our stakeholders and the Company's future. We have developed a pro forma template identifying the relevant stakeholder considerations for inclusion in the Board papers which accompany Board discussions.\n\nDuring the year, we launched an initiative to transform our strategy, based on three pillars (i) enriching strategy; (ii) changing culture; and (iii) restructuring the organisation. This corporate transformation is aimed at: (a) better positioning the Company in the context of an ever-changing and more complex environment and (b) achieving the Company's goals, both on a business level and in terms of creating value for our stakeholders.\n\nThe Board makes principal decisions and delegates specific decisions to committees or management with the appropriate oversight of Non-Executive Directors. In July, the Board appointed a Special Committee to analyse management proposals and approve all matters relating to the corporate restructure to ensure compliance with the recent Mexican labour reform legislation, which regulates the subcontracting of personnel. The Special Committee validated the strategy and instructed management to take all necessary steps to meet the requirements of the new legislation, including but not limited to the incorporation of certain contractors' personnel as Company employees. Board oversight ensures that these decisions are conducive to the success of the Company and that stakeholders are being considered appropriately.\n\nThe Board monitors and provides oversight of previous years' principal decisions, including the decision in 2020 to 'Maintain operations as close to normal as possible, implementing preventive measures to prevent Covid-19'. The Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations Committee monitored the performance of the preventive measures necessary to operate as close to normal. Amid the challenges of Covid-19, this decision enabled us to avoid furloughs and redundancies, and to maintain our dividend policy. An interim dividend was declared considering the principle of balancing growth with shareholder returns, and following a comprehensive review of the current and expected near-term financial position as well as the Company's ability to adapt its operations and growth plans to adverse scenarios.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board's principal decisions with relevant implications for our stakeholders and the Company's future were:\n\n- (i) The approval of the Company's Business Plan and Budget; and\n- (ii)  Strategy to comply with the new labour legislation in Mexico regulating subcontracting\n\nWe provide the following information on our principal decisions:\n\n- \u00b7 The context of the decisions.\n- \u00b7 The decision-making process.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder considerations.\n- \u00b7 Impact on the communities and the environment.\n- \u00b7 Strategic actions supported by the Board.\n- \u00b7 The impact of these actions in the long term.\n- \u00b7 The outcomes of the decisions.\n\nThe Company, its Board of Directors and Company management are fully committed to effectively engaging with all key stakeholders.\n\nApproved by the Board of Directors on 7 March 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Dear Shareholder\n\nIt is with mixed feelings that I introduce this section of the Annual Report following my election as Chairman of Fresnillo plc. It has been a great honour for me to take on this role. Since Fresnillo plc listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2008, we have been proud of the steps that the Board has taken to continuously improve our corporate governance and meet our obligations as a responsible premium-listed company. Credit for this must go, above all, to my father and predecessor as Chairman, Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res. His firm commitment to good governance and outstanding leadership of the Board set an exceptionally high standard. We had continued to benefit from his immense wisdom in his capacity as Honorary Chairman during the brief period after he left the Board but, with his passing away on 2 February 2022, the scale of his achievements is even more evident to me now and the sense of loss is beyond words. His passionate dedication, human sensitivity and the values with which he conducted himself throughout his life are an inspiration to all of us and I will work with determination to maintain and build on his legacy.\n\nAs Chairman of the Company's majority shareholder and therefore not being an independent Director, my appointment as Chairman of Fresnillo should nevertheless be regarded as a sign of strong governance due to the full alignment of the majority shareholder's interests with other shareholders, considering that all related parties' transactions are approved by only our independent Directors.\n\nAt our AGM in 2021, we were delighted to welcome two new members to the Board - H\u00e9ctor Rangel and Eduardo Cepeda. In joining the Board, H\u00e9ctor brings a broad understanding of Mexican business founded upon his distinguished career in banking. H\u00e9ctor, who served the Board when Fresnillo plc was listed in 2008, will now bring his experience not just to the Board but also to the Audit Committee, of which he also became a member. Eduardo has considerable experience in finance, international markets and banking as well as wider perspectives gained from his involvement in several organisations related to culture, education and health, which will be of benefit the Board in its wider responsibilities to stakeholders.\n\nEarlier in the year, the Board agreed to appoint Ms Georgina Kessel as a member of the Audit Committee and Ms Guadalupe de la Vega as a member of the Remuneration Committee. Guadalupe brings valuable experience in Mexican business to the Remuneration Committee. Georgina's appointment to the Audit Committee not only brings valuable financial experience but insight into energy and climate related risks which will be increasingly important in the Audit Committee's thinking in the coming years. At the same time, we also announced that Charlie Jacobs, our Senior Independent Director, has become a member of the Nominations Committee, which brings additional insight into the expectations of UK investors to the work of that Committee. Charlie also stepped down as a member of the Audit Committee, as well as Chairman and a member of the Remuneration Committee and was replaced by Alberto Tiburcio who also became Chairman of that Committee at the same time. In addition, I was appointed as Chairman of the Nominations Committee following Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res's retirement from the Board\n\nand Alberto Tiburcio also stepped down as a member of that Committee. In 2021, the Board rightly spent a considerable amount of time focusing on the Company's activities on stakeholders such as communities, the environment and climate change. In this Annual Report, we set out details of the Company's responses to climate change through our TCFD reporting. The Audit and HSECR Committees both report on how their remits have developed during the year to enable them to provide more focus and oversight of climate-related risks and mitigation programmes. In addition, the Board has continued to monitor management's efforts to ensure that the working environment is a healthy and safe one; both through the ongoing Covid-19 related measures in place at our sites as well as continuing to reinforce the implementation of the 'I Care, We Care' safety programme through our operations. Furthermore, the Board dedicated attention to workforce engagement initiatives which have been implemented and are ongoing, in order to better gauge the comments, concerns and needs of the workforce.\n\nThe introduction of new, challenging and operationally disruptive labour reforms in Mexico made it necessary for the Board, the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee to devote time during the year to consider the implications of the new requirements and the changes in operational practices which have been needed. As a result of this, the Company has implemented several changes in order to meet the requirements of these reforms.\n\nIn September and October, we undertook our annual board effectiveness review which was run by Lintstock. While the key conclusions from the review were on the whole very encouraging, they have prompted some useful conversations about opportunities for further improvement to the way in which the Board works. In particular, we plan to introduce an additional working meeting in 2022 to enable the Board members to spend more dedicated time on strategy and risk management in addition to the regular reviews of these matters which take place at our regular meetings.\n\nWith the support of our Board, we were able to continue implementing sound decisions in an ever-changing and complex environment affected by Covid-19 amongst other factors. The support from our Board is invaluable in this regard, as these decisions will help to ensure the Company's operations going forward.\n\nIn concluding, I would like to thank my Board colleagues for their continued support and valuable contributions to the work of the Board and its committees during 2021. This support has been greatly welcomed during my first few months as Chairman. I look forward to leading the Board into 2022 and all the challenges and opportunities that it will bring.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n## Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman of the Board 7 March 2022",

        "page_content": "## UK Corporate Governance code compliance statement\n\nAs a company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, Fresnillo is required under the FCA Listing Rules to comply with the Code Provisions of the Code (a copy of which can be found on the website of the Financial Reporting Council (www.frc.org.uk) or otherwise explain its reasons for non-compliance. The following statement is therefore made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nCode Provisions 24 and 32 require that the Audit and Remuneration Committees consist of three or more independent Non-Executive Directors. Following the passing of Luis Robles, an independent Non-Executive Director on 19 November 2020, both the Audit and Remuneration Committees were technically not compliant. On 1 March 2021 Ms Georgina Kessel and Ms Guadalupe de la Vega, both independent Non-Executive Directors, were appointed to the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee, respectively. From 1 March 2021 to 31 December 2021 both Committees had three members.\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2021 other than as set out below, the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code, save in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 9 provides that 'the chair should be independent on appointment'. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, who was appointed as Chairman on 29 April 2021, following Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res stepping down from his position as Chairman on the same date, was appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement (see page 170); thus, at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. Having served as Deputy Chairman for more than three years and having received guidance from Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res for many years, the Board considers that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res possesses significant knowledge and experience of the Company to carry out the role of the Chairman. The Board considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles Group enhances the quality of its corporate governance rather than detracts from it (as explained further on pages 164-165). As a consequence, the Board values and endorses Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res's chairmanship of the Company. The size, composition and balance of skills on the Board, including the independence and diversity of the Board and the existence of a senior independent Director; and the adequacy of the succession plans were assessed as part of the Board effectiveness review during the year and were considered to be highly satisfactory.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 32 , which provides that the Board should establish a Remuneration Committee of at least three independent Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman of the Company, Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, who was not independent at the time of his appointment, is a member of the Remuneration Committee. The Board believes that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res's experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is not involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 36 , which provides that remuneration schemes should promote long-term holdings by Executive Directors that support alignment with long-term shareholder interests. The Company's approach to executive remuneration is explained in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 188-203. The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because historically it has not been a common form of remuneration in Mexico. The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of our business\n\nInformation about compliance with the Code's Provisions may be found in the following sections of this Report:\n\n## 1. BOARD LEADERSHIP AND PURPOSE:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPages 168-170\n\nPages 172-175\n\n## 3.

        "page_content": "## Fresnillo's approach to Governance\n\n## The Board's leadership role\n\nWhile Fresnillo's approach to governance reflects many of the usual characteristics of a FTSE 100 company, it is also particularly influenced by four key factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Geography: It primarily operates within Mexico.\n- \u00b7 Ownership: It benefits from the common umbrella and shared resources with other companies within the BAL Group of companies.\n- \u00b7 Board: Its fully Non-Executive Board of Directors supported by the executive team.\n- \u00b7 Investors: Its listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\n\n## The leadership role of Fresnillo plc Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result of these contextual factors, the leadership provided to Fresnillo plc by the Board is essentially strategic and supervisory in nature. The leadership and management of the Company's day-to-day operations is the responsibility of the Executive Committee (comprising the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Exploration and the Chief Operating Officer). The non-independent Non-Executive members of the Board (Pe\u00f1oles-appointed Directors) maintain regular contact with the Executive Committee to challenge and/or support as appropriate.\n\nThis creates two levels of oversight for the senior management team, initially from the Non-independent Non-Executive Directors, and then from the Board as a whole, including the independent Non-Executive Directors. Reports summarising the discussions which take place between the Non-independent Non-Executive Directors and the senior management team are regularly provided to the independent Non-Executive Directors to assist them in understanding the dialogue which takes place before formal Board proposals are submitted for their review.\n\nThe Board sets the corporate values underpinning the culture by which the Group will continue to operate. The Board also supervises the management of the Group's activities, including the implementation of both the Group's long-term plans and commercial strategy. It also provides the governance framework within which the Executive Committee operates. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval which includes major expenditure, investments, key policies and systems of internal control and risk management. Certain specific responsibilities are delegated to the Board Committees, being the Audit, Nominations, Health Safety Environment and Community Relations and Remuneration Committees, each chaired by a Board member, which operate within clearly defined terms of reference and report regularly to the Board.",

The Board was kept informed of these measures and progress continued to be monitored through the Chief Executive Officer's spoken updates at the regular Board meetings held during this year, as well as updates from members of the Executive Committee at Audit Committee and HSECR Committee meetings. The Board's usual programme of formal meetings remained unchanged during 2021 but all meetings were conducted via video-conferencing format.\n\n## New developments in the Board's approach to

Alejandro Baill\u00e8res and Charles Jacobs were appointed to the Committee on 29 April 2021. Barbara Garza Lag\u00fcera and Charles Jacobs are both independent Non-Executive Directors and therefore the majority of the members of the Nominations Committee are independent in compliance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about the work of the Nominations Committee during 2021 can be found in the Nominations Committee Report on/uni00A0pages 174-175.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe members of the Remuneration Committee are Alberto Tiburcio, Alejandro Baill\u00e8res and Guadalupe de la Vega. Guadalupe de la Vega was appointed as a member of the Committee on 1 March 2021 and Alberto Tiburcio and Alejandro Baill\u00e8res were appointed as members of the Committee on 29 April 2021.\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code states that the Remuneration Committee should be made up of independent Non-Executive Directors. The membership of the Committee is made up of Non-Executive Directors who are able to bring the following perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 An understanding of shareholder expectations.\n- \u00b7 An understanding of the evolving remuneration expectations of investors on the London Stock Exchange.\n- \u00b7 An understanding of the general approaches to remuneration within the Mexican market.\n\nDuring the year Alberto Baill\u00e8res stepped down as a member of the Committee and Alejandro Baill\u00e8res was appointed as a member. Alberto and Alejandro were both non-independent at the time of their appointments to the Board (and therefore their membership of the Remuneration Committee during the year did not comply with Code Provision 32 of the UK Corporate Governance Code). In respect of the appointment of Alejandro Baill\u00e8res in April 2021, the Board determined that his experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations justifies his membership of that Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about the work of the Remuneration Committee during 2021 can be found in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 188-203.\n\n## HSECR Committee\n\nThe members of the HSECR Committee are Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez, Judith Macgregor, Georgina Kessel and Fernando Ruiz.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA full report of the work of the HSECR Committee during 2021, can be found in the HSECR Committee Report on pages 70-71.\n\n## Terms of Reference\n\nThe terms of reference of all of the Board Committees were reviewed during the year. The terms of reference of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees were last updated in 2019 and early 2020 (to take account of the requirements of the new UK Corporate Governance Code). The terms of reference of the HSECR Committee were last updated in October 2020. No further changes were made to any of the Committee terms of reference during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCopies of all of the Committee terms of reference are available on the Company's website (http://www.fresnilloplc.com/who-we-are/corporategovernance/terms-of-reference/)",

        "page_content": "## Board leadership and Purpose\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Generation and preservation of company value\n\nFresnillo's business model and strategy is set out on pages 24-25 and 28-29 of the Strategic Report and describes the basis upon which the Company generates and preserves value over the long term. In February 2021, the Board reviewed the Company's strategy and proposed some adjustments based on three pillars: (i) enriching strategy; (ii) changing culture; and (iii) restructuring the organisation. This strategy review was aimed: (a) at better positioning the Company in the context of an everchanging and more complex environment and (b) to help the Company achieve its goals, both on a business level and in terms of the wellbeing of the Company's employees, their families and the communities in which they operate, thereby continuing to contribute to Mexico's development. More information on this can be found on pages 2-155 of the Strategic Report. The Executive Committee members report on the implementation of strategy at each Board meeting, with particular reference to performance against the published strategic targets.\n\n## Purpose\n\nOur Purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold. The Purpose statement was approved by the Board in October 2019. The Company has continued to contribute to the wellbeing of people including employees, local communities, customers and the end-users of our products during 2021 by maintaining levels of production and investing in local health care, employment and education programmes. Further information on the Purpose is set out on pages 10-13.\n\n## The Board and culture\n\nThe Corporate Code of Conduct was last reviewed and approved by the Board in February 2020. The Code of Conduct sets down its cultural expectations for the activities of all Directors, executives, employees and related third parties (including contractors, suppliers and the community) in the conduct of the Company's business. It also helps to ensure a foundation of values and sets standards for behaviour that encourage an environment of ethics and responsibility for the benefit of the Company's stakeholders.\n\nDuring the year, the Board has monitored workforce culture and behaviour in a number of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Regular reviews of whistleblowing reports and actions taken by management in response to issues raised via that medium (see pages 75-76 for a further summary of whistleblower hotline claims during the year).\n- \u00b7 Receiving an update on the Prevention of Harassment programme, in particular the workshops that were held during the year for employees and unionised personnel.\n- \u00b7 By monitoring progress with the diversity and inclusion programme and the development of an online training module on Diversity, equity and inclusion, with the support of the University of Arizona.\n- \u00b7 Updates on the 'I Care, We Care' safety strategy (including elements designed to change behaviours and create a more mature and resilient safety culture). The Board receives and considers updates on health and safety performance at every Board meeting, in particular information analysing serious injuries and fatalities, Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate and new cases of occupational disease. These metrics have been used to monitor the progress made in improving the health and safety culture.\n- \u00b7 By monitoring updates on the outsourcing reform and progress on the Company's implemented actions as a consequence of this reform and assessing the likely impacts on corporate culture which may result from these changes.\n\nFurther information on culture and workforce engagement is set out on pages 150-155.\n\n## Whistleblower hotline\n\nThe whistleblower hotline can be used by anyone who wishes to raise concerns, in confidence, about the Company's operations. The hotline is used by employees, contractors and, occasionally, other stakeholders such as suppliers and local communities. The use of the Company's whistleblower arrangements is monitored quarterly by the Audit Committee (see the Audit Committee Report on page 181). The Audit Committee reviews updates on management responses to calls made to the whistleblower line and reports to the Board twice a year on the operation of the whistleblower hotline. The Board received such reports at its meetings in April 2021 (in relation to H2, 2020) and July 2021 (in relation to H1, 2021). In 2021, the Audit Committee and Board have monitored the reporting of incidences of harassment following the commencement of the anti-harassment protocol.",

        "page_content": "## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nOur workforce is the foundation that supports our business model. The Board believes that the wellbeing of our people and an ethical and inclusive culture are the drivers of higher levels of employee engagement and are essential to attract and retain talent.\n\nThe Board and its Committees receive information related to the workforce through a range of channels (see workforce engagement diagram), including direct engagement. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has been designated as the Non-Executive Director to act as a representative of the workforce in the boardroom. This Board-level engagement arrangement enables the Board to understand the views of the workforce on their experiences of working for the Company as well as providing an additional mechanism to raise concerns.\n\nCovid-19 restrictions challenged the Company to reconsider its approach to workforce engagement. During 2021, the Company undertook two separate workforce engagement sessions led by Mr Fern\u00e1ndez. The sessions were held online and enabled Mr Fern\u00e1ndez to listen to the views of employees directly. These sessions involved representatives from all of our operations, functions and demography and included both unionised and nonunionised personnel. The meeting agendas considered relevant workforce issues while encouraging the raising of ideas and concerns. The topics covered included:\n\n- \u00b7 Health & Safety and Covid-19\n- \u00b7 Ethical culture, Inclusion and Gender Equality\n\nThe openness and candour expressed during these engagement sessions provided important insights such as: appreciation and recognition by the workforce of the Company's response to Covid-19; a sense of pride for working in the Company; the commitment of the workforce and the Company with regards to safety. Areas of concern discussed included diversity, equity and inclusion, security, infrastructure and simplification of administrative processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFeedback received from these workforce engagement sessions was discussed at the October 2021 Board meeting. The insights are hugely valuable for boardroom discussions and decision-making. Feedback was also very useful in informing management programmes and practices. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has shared with Company management the specific workforce concerns and is following these up to ensure that they are addressed appropriately. In the coming year, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez will continue to hold these workforce engagement sessions, providing feedback to the Board on comments and concerns received and therefore, permitting the workforce sentiment to inform the boardroom process.\n\nTHIS BOARD-LEVEL ENGAGEMENT DEMONSTRATES OUR COMMITMENT TO UNDERSTANDING HOW OUR WORKFORCE VIEWS WORKING FOR THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS BEING AN ADDITIONAL MECHANISM FOR RAISING CONCERNS.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Board leadership and Purpose continued\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day stewardship of all stakeholder relationships and its members report to the Board on the key metrics and initiatives. The Board, either directly or through its Committees, engages or oversees engagement with the Company's stakeholders through a number of governance activities (which are described in more detail, along with further information about the Company's engagement with key stakeholders in the Stakeholder Table on pages 150-155).\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the HSECR Committee continued to monitor the outcomes (efficiency) of the Company's Covid-19 prevention strategy: cases, rapid testing, contact tracing and isolation. The Company also engaged extensively with the communities in which it operates, including communications about Covid-19 preventive measures, donating and raising awareness of the use of masks and training parents and teachers from local communities on protection from Covid-19. More information on engagement with our communities can be found on pages 109-112.\n\n## Investment in the workforce\n\nThe Company invests in its employees through various training and development, healthcare and wellbeing programmes. The Company has continued to invest in state-of-the-art equipment to monitor employees' and contractors' health, including infrared thermometers, thermographic cameras and Covid-19 rapid tests. The Company has also monitored daily the progress of the workforce in self-quarantine as well as offering psychological care and emotional support to affected members of the workforce. All personnel continued to receive full salaries and benefits during 2021. Further details are provided on pages 82-85.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nThe Board monitors the views of the Company's minority shareholders through reports on investor and analyst communications prepared by the Chief Financial Officer, which are included in the papers for each Board meeting. Such reports identify issues raised by investors during meetings with management during the previous quarter.\n\nOrdinarily, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet with analysts, hold conference calls after quarterly production reports and engage with shareholders by participating in the major roadshows in London and other key financial centres, after preliminary and half-yearly results are announced. In 2021, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, such face-to-face meetings have not been possible and were replaced with video-conferencing calls. Due to the Covid-19 related restrictions in place at the time, a maximum of six individuals could attend the 2021 AGM. Shareholders were provided with an opportunity to submit questions to the Board via a dedicated email address ahead of the AGM. No questions were submitted. It is anticipated that the 2022 AGM will be held in the normal way and shareholders will be invited to attend.\n\nThe Head of Investor Relations in London is responsible for maintaining existing relations with analysts and major shareholders on a dayto-day basis, which is carried out by way of telephone calls and meetings in London. Contact with investors in Mexico is maintained through the Investor Relations office in Mexico City. The Senior Independent Director, who is based in London, is available to speak with shareholders concerning specific corporate governance questions as and when they arise.\n\n## The Board and climate\n\nIn relation to climate change and risk, the Board considers climate change during its discussions and when making decisions regarding the Group's strategy, risk management, investments, and stakeholders. On behalf of the Board, the HSECR Committee evaluates in greater detail, climaterelated performance, risks and opportunities. Since 2020, climate change has been part of the agenda at all HSECR Committee meetings.\n\nThe HSECR Committee reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 The energy strategy and ambition of the Company's plans, factoring in the expectations of our stakeholders on setting ambitious targets and the current regulatory risks associated with renewable electricity in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The technology strategy to explore opportunities to reduce the carbon and water footprint of mineral processing.\n- \u00b7 The approach of the Company to identify, evaluate and respond to the risks and opportunities of climate change in the business model.\n- \u00b7 The Company's approach to adopting the TCFD recommendations.\n- \u00b7 As a key development in 2021, the HSECR Committee reviewed the approach to partner with the scientific community to use climate models to better understand physical risks and socio-economic scenarios for transition risks.\n\nThe HSECR Committee periodically briefed the Board on climate change performance and the approach of the Company to adopting the TCFD recommendations. During the year the Board was also briefed by the Audit Committee on TCFD disclosure requirements and governance practices. More information on this can be found in the Sustainability Report on pages 88-100 and in the Audit Committee Report on page 181.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Group requires that Directors complete a 'Director's List' which sets out details of situations where each Director's interest may conflict with those of the Company (situational conflicts). Each Director has re-submitted their list as at 31 December 2021 for the Board to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the re-submitted lists. At the beginning of each Board meeting, the Company Secretary reminds the Directors of their duties under sections 175, 177 and 182 of the Companies Act which relate to the disclosure of any conflicts of interest prior to any matter that may be discussed by the Board. Further information about related party matters considered by the Board during the year are set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 186.\n\n## Relationship agreement\n\nPe\u00f1oles has entered into a relationship agreement with the Company (the 'Relationship Agreement') to ensure that relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group are conducted at arm's length and on normal commercial terms. Messrs Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, Juan Bordes and Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez have been appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled companies. The independent Non-Executive Directors annually review the good standing of the Relationship Agreement (with the most recent review being undertaken in February 2022) and they are satisfied that the Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during the financial year ended 31 December 2021. As far as the Company is aware, such provisions have been complied with during the financial year ended 31 December 2021 by Pe\u00f1oles and/or any of its associates.\n\nPe\u00f1oles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement. It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a 'related party transaction' (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Pe\u00f1oles Group.\n\n## Director concerns\n\nDirectors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings and can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board minutes. The Board has also established a procedure which enables Directors, in relevant circumstances, to obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.",

        "page_content": "## Division of responsibilities\n\n## Roles\n\nThe composition of the Board is structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate its decision-making processes. The Board is led by the Chairman. The Board as a whole currently consists of five Non-independent Non-Executive Directors and seven independent Non-Executive Directors. One of the independent Non-Executive Directors is designated as the Senior Independent Director. The Executive Committee provides operational leadership to the Group and is headed by the Chief Executive Officer. The respective responsibilities of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Independent Director are set down in a written statement which was last updated in October 2019.\n\n## Chairman's independence\n\nMr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res was appointed as the Chairman of the Company in April 2021, when his father Alberto Baill\u00e8res stepped down from that role. Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res was beneficially interested in more than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest in Industrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V., the Company's controlling shareholder. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is the Chairman of Pe\u00f1oles and other companies within the BAL Group and was appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement (see page 170), thus at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. With Pe\u00f1oles having a significant stake in the Company, the Board believes that the Chairman's non-independence is not a hindrance to his involvement on the Board but an asset to other shareholders especially as related party transactions are reviewed and approved by independent directors and the Audit Committee. The Board, therefore, believes that his involvement is a governance plus, since it assures the Chairman's alignment with all shareholders' interests. Having served as Deputy Chairman for more than three years and having received guidance from Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res for many years, the Board considers that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res possesses significant knowledge and experience of the Company which it believes underpins his effectiveness in carrying out the role of the Chairman. The Board also considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles Group enhances the quality of its corporate governance. Given Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res's experience and understanding of Mexican business and its regulatory context, this assessment gains further validity in the continuing political and social environment in Mexico. Notwithstanding the expectations of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board values and endorses Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res's chairmanship of the Company and does not expect to change this assessment for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement continues to provide a foundation for a transparent governance system, which ensures that the Company benefits from Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res's leadership and experience while being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of any companies with which he is connected. In particular, the Relationship Agreement ensures that transactions and relationships between the Fresnillo Group and its controlling shareholder are at arm's length and on competitive commercial terms. Further information regarding the Relationship Agreement can be found on pages 170 and 187.\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nThe Board considers the following Directors to be independent: Charles Jacobs, Barbara Garza Lag\u00fcera, Georgina Kessel, Dame Judith Macgregor, H\u00e9ctor Rangel, Alberto Tiburcio and Guadalupe de la Vega. The Board, through the Nominations Committee has assessed each of these Directors by reference to the criteria set out in Provision 10 of the Code and the Board remains satisfied that they are each independent in character and judgement. In making this assessment for Mr Alberto Tiburcio, the Board notes that he was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mancera S.C., the Mexican firm of EY, the Company's auditors, until June 2013 and that he was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to that date. Mr Tiburcio is an independent Non-Executive Director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B. and Grupo Palacio de Hierro, S.A.B. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL Group. He is not involved in executive duties in any of those\n\ncompanies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo. The Board does not consider that Mr Tiburcio's position as an independent Non-Executive Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments. The Board also considers that Mr Tiburcio's experience in Mexican and international business and his experience and knowledge of Mexican and international accounting and audit practice and corporate governance are particularly valuable to the Board and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nCharles Jacobs is the Senior Independent Director. In February 2021, Mr Jacobs convened a meeting of the independent Non-Executive Directors to evaluate the performance of the Chairman and to assess the good standing of the Relationship Agreement. The independent NonExecutive Directors were satisfied that there were no issues or concerns in respect of either matter. Mr Jacobs provided feedback to the Chairman on those discussions.\n\n## Time commitment and overboarding\n\nAll Directors pre-clear any proposed appointments to listed company boards with the Chairman, prior to committing to them, and such appointments are ratified by the Board at the next possible meeting. None of the Directors took on any significant new additional external appointments in the year.\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors are required, by their letters of appointment, to spend 14 days per annum on Company business. The Nominations Committee is satisfied that all of the Directors, but particularly the nonindependent Non-Executive Directors, spend considerably more than this amount of time on Board and Committee activity.\n\nThe Nominations Committee annually reviews the time commitments to ensure that all Board members continue to be able to devote sufficient time and attention to the Company's business. Its philosophy in doing so is to consider the total workload of each Non-Executive Director and the particular value that each Director brings to the Board. In making this assessment, the Nominations Committee takes into account the following factors:\n\n- 1. As a single-product company with operations primarily in just one country, and because of the relative commonality of the Company's activities, the Board does not consider that it needs more than four scheduled Board meetings a year, a factor which is reflected in the relatively low fees that the Company pays its Non-Executive Directors.\n- 2.   This relatively low number of meetings is further justified by the degree of governance oversight of the Company. This comes by virtue of it also being a member of the BAL Group. The calendar for Board and Committee meetings is scheduled to align with the other meetings of companies, including listed companies, within the BAL Group ownership structure. This ensures that Fresnillo plc Directors who are appointed to the boards of other companies within the BAL Group do not have any time conflicts with their other commitments on BAL Listed Entity boards.\n\nThe other listed company directorships of the Fresnillo plc Directors is set out on pages 158-161 of this report. The Board and Committee attendance record of each of the Directors during 2021 is set out on page 166 of this report.\n\nPrior to their appointment to the Board, the other interests of Eduardo Cepeda and H\u00e9ctor Rangel were considered, and it was noted by the Nominations Committee that they do not hold any other listed company directorships.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nThe advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose appointment and removal are matters reserved for the Board) are also available to the Directors. The Company also regularly receives advice on UK corporate governance and legal developments from its UK legal and corporate governance advisers.",

A combination of externally facilitated and internally run evaluations are carried out over a three-year cycle and form the Board Development Programme. The Board recognises that a continuous and constructive review of its performance is an important factor in achieving its objectives and realising its full potential.\n\nThe cycle of the Board's evaluations is summarised as follows:\n\n## YEAR 1\n\nExternally facilitated Board evaluation using questionnaires and/or interviews\n\n## YEAR 2\n\nFollow-up on action plan prepared in response to Year 1 evaluation using internally-facilitated questionnaires\n\n## BOARD EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW PROCESS IN 2021\n\n## MID-AUGUST\n\nSurveys prepared and circulated to Directors to/uni00A0complete\n\n## END AUGUST\n\nCompleted surveys received by Lintstock LLP and/uni00A0analysed\n\n## MID-LATE SEPTEMBER\n\nDraft reports prepared\n\n## EARLY OCTOBER\n\nDraft reports reviewed by Chairman and approved for distribution\n\n## YEAR 3\n\nFocus on outstanding and emerging issues arising from the action plan using internally-facilitated questionnaires\n\n## REPORT CIRCULATION AND REVIEWS\n\n## REPORTS\n\nBoard\n\nAudit Committee\n\nNominations Committee\n\nHSECR Committee\n\nRemuneration Committee\n\n## BOARD REPORT\n\nDiscussed at the Board meeting in October 2022\n\n## COMMITTEE REPORTS\n\nDiscussed at each Committee meeting following circulation of the respective Committee report\n\nIn 2021, Board members were invited to complete questionnaires, the results of which were collated by Lintstock LLP into a Board discussion document. At its meeting in October 2021, the Board discussed the results. The overall conclusion from the Board effectiveness reviews was that the performance of the Fresnillo Board of Directors is rated very highly and therefore the recommendations were characterised as points of potential further improvement rather than material changes of approach. Particular areas of Board governance which were commended in the report included: Board composition; stakeholder oversight; Board dynamics; Board support and Board committees; the management and focus of meetings; oversight of strategy and risk management and internal control.\n\nThere were five priorities for change that the Board was encouraged to focus on over the coming year:\n\n- \u00b7 Prioritisation of mine visits.\n- \u00b7 Focus on the importance of adapting to regulatory changes.\n- \u00b7 Set out a clear, advanced agenda on the areas of strategic risk to be presented to the Board ahead of the quarterly planning.\n- \u00b7 Provide brief monthly summaries on Company updates, keeping the Board informed and engaged.\n- \u00b7 Oversee the proper operation of Baluarte Minero and its relationship.",

These meetings were held in February 2021 and February 2022.\n\nNon-Executive Directors occasionally meet the Chairman without executives being present; the performance of the Executive Committee is discussed during such meetings.\n\n## Board development and induction\n\nSenior management present the Group's strategic initiatives to provide the Non-Executive Directors with more information about the broader context to the Company's activities. In addition, industry briefings on technical, market and sector issues are regularly distributed.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to visit the Company's mines to familiarise themselves with the Fresnillo Group's operations, to meet staff and visit community projects supported by the Group. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, it was not possible for the Non-Executive Directors to make such visits in person in 2021. Visits to mines will be resumed as soon as is advisable.\n\nBriefings by the Company's legal advisers are arranged for all new Directors. In September 2021, such a briefing was given to H\u00e9ctor Rangel and Eduardo Cepeda to familiarise them with the duties and responsibilities of a Director of a UK listed company and the UK Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Chairman discusses training or development needs with Board members from time to time.",

        "page_content": "## Nominations Committee report\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nI am pleased to introduce the Nominations Committee Report for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Board changes\n\nAt the 2021 Annual General Meeting, the appointments of H\u00e9ctor Rangel and Eduardo Cepeda, were approved by shareholders. H\u00e9ctor Rangel's appointment is a valuable addition to the Board, with his broad understanding of Mexican business and his extensive corporate and investment banking expertise, while Eduardo Cepeda's appointment enables us to benefit from his considerable experience in finance, international markets and banking. At the same time, Charlie Jacobs became a member of the Committee, bringing additional insight into the expectations of UK investors.\n\nEarlier in the year, the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of Ms Georgina Kessel as a member of the Audit Committee and Ms Guadalupe de la Vega as a member of the Remuneration Committee. Ms de la Vega brings valuable experience in Mexican business to the Remuneration Committee. Ms Kessel's appointment to the Audit Committee not only brings valuable financial experience but insight into energy and climate related risks which will be increasingly important in the Audit Committee's thinking in the coming years.\n\n## Board Diversity Policy progress\n\nWe continue to recognise and embrace the benefits of having a diverse Board; particularly the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the quality of Board debate and decision-making. We hold fast to the importance of making Board appointments on the basis of merit; but we also take seriously considerations such as background and experience, age, gender, and shareholder perspectives in our reviews of the composition of the Board. We believe that setting targets for the number of people from a particular background or gender is not an effective approach and therefore we have no specific quotas or targets. Nevertheless, our direction of travel, as far as diversity is concerned, has been a progressive one. Our Board composition meets the target set by the Hampton-Alexander Review. Since February 2020, the Board has included seven independent Non-Executive Directors, our largest ever number of independent Directors. This adds diversity of thought and input into our Board discussions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is pleasing to note also that in 2021 the Parker Review reported that Fresnillo plc has met its ethnicity target for FTSE 100 companies. Since our IPO in 2008, the Board has consisted of a mix of Mexican and British Directors which enables the Board to benefit from a sound understanding of both the UK and Mexican cultural contexts of the Company in its decision-making.\n\n## Company-wide gender diversity\n\nAs reported in last years' report, the Board approved the Company's adoption of the CLIMB framework in April 2020. The CLIMB framework (developed by McKinsey) has been a useful tool to categorise the Company's current or planned initiatives on diversity. In 2021, the Company conducted surveys and focus groups to better understand the challenges and opportunities of developing a diverse and inclusive culture and an implementation strategy is being developed in 2022. The strategy includes several initiatives designed to improve the leadership opportunities for women; develop a better human resources infrastructure; adopt and use metrics to improve management and monitor and promote the right culture and behaviours. Further information on the implementation of this programme is set out on pages 72-81 in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn 2021, the review of the effectiveness of the Board was carried out using a questionnaire-based approach. Board members were invited to complete the questionnaires, the results of which were collated by Lintstock LLP into a Board discussion document. A summary of the overall approach adopted and findings arising from this review is set out on pages 172-173 of the Corporate Governance Report. We were pleased that the overall conclusion from the reviews was that the performance of the Fresnillo Board of Directors and, indeed, the Nominations Committee, continues to be rated very highly.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n## Mr Alejando Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman of the Nominations Committee",

        "page_content": "## Nominations Committee\n\n## Role\n\nThe Nominations Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and its committees and succession planning for the Directors and other senior executives. Before making appointments of new Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Nominations Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates for approval by the Board. Prior to making such recommendations, the Nominations Committee considers the other time commitments and significant external interests of such candidates to ensure that they are able to contribute effectively to the Board.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has approved Board Appointments and Diversity Policies which provide the framework for the Nominations Committee and the Board's approach to Board appointments. The Board has also approved a Group Diversity Policy. (Full versions of these Policies may be found on the Company's website ( www.fresnilloplc.com )). A further explanation of the steps that the Company is taking to promote diversity across its businesses is set out in the Sustainability Report on pages 78-81.\n\n## Board Appointments Policy\n\nThe Nominations Committee and Board are strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when making new appointments to the Board while ensuring that appointments are based on merit. The Nominations Committee continues to consider the composition of the Board with this commitment in mind.\n\nThe criteria for determining the composition of the Board and future Board appointments continue to be based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Relationship Agreement requirements for appointments to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles.\n- \u00b7 The Company's leading position as a precious metals miner in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The Company's inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index.\n- \u00b7 The specific functions on Board committees which independent Directors will be required to fulfil.\n- \u00b7 The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the Nominations Committee and the Board Diversity Policy.\n\nThe Nominations Committee does not use open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments to the Board as it is not considered necessary considering the Company's contacts within Mexico and further afield.\n\n| Skill/experience

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nIt gives me great pleasure to introduce the Audit Committee Report for 2021. The last two years have been very difficult for humanity in general, and for governments and companies around the world because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fresnillo was not exempt from its effects and, as we reported last year, promptly had to implement important decisions to continue operating the mines while, at the same time, taking additional safety measures to protect our people. The health and wellbeing of all of our stakeholders which underpinned our efforts to protect the Company's operational capability and financial strength, was at the centre of the strategy and at the heart of all decisions taken during these difficult times. With rigorous safety measures, our mines continued operating during 2021, while most of our Company's office-based employees kept working from home.\n\nBecause of these challenging circumstances, the Committee put additional emphasis on the processes and internal control procedures that had to be adjusted to allow the Company to continue operating in a safe environment for its people. We also had to pay close attention to those key areas of judgement and estimation in our reporting, such as impairment of long-term assets, going concern and viability assessments (all of which are further disclosed in this Annual Report). With the support of the Internal Audit, Internal Control and Risk Management areas, we concluded that the internal controls and processes were functioning appropriately and no significant weaknesses were identified. Close coordination and interaction with the external auditor were also essential and a key part of the Committee's work this year.\n\nThe matters of particular focus for the Committee that merit specific reference in this year's report are summarised below:\n\n- \u00b7 Proposed changes to regulations: During the year, we continued to monitor the implications introduced by the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code in our activities and we closely followed the ongoing discussions for the changes that might arise from the Government consultation paper Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance released in March of 2021. We discussed the possible implications of the recommendations and issued our response letter to the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) on 7 July 2021 within the required time frame for responses. We also kept the Board informed of the impact the changes might have in the Company's governance and agreed a meeting with the Board members to present and discuss with them the more relevant changes once they are approved.\n- \u00b7 Labour law changes: In April 2021, the Mexican Government amended a number of different laws, including the Labour Law, the result of which, in summary, prohibits subcontracting of personnel, either from companies outside the Group or companies within the same group, with some exceptions. Additional information about these changes and the further implications for Fresnillo is provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on pages 17-19, 40-42.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result of these changes, it was necessary for the Company to hire approximately 677 people who previously provided services to the mines through subcontractor arrangements. In addition, the Company expects to hire other current subcontractors during 2022 to further reduce the reliance on outsourcing relationships. It was also necessary to transfer personnel within Fresnillo's subsidiaries and merge some companies within the Group to align the workforce with the core business of production companies. The Committee was kept informed of the different steps proposed by management to comply with the new regulation and challenged some of the assessments of the implications for the Company as a result of these new rules. This feedback along with that of other external advisers was taken into account in the final action plan which the Board approved in response to the new rules.\n\n- \u00b7 Tax contingencies: Over the past few years, the Committee has closely monitored the tax contingencies, in particular, the differences generated in prior years regarding the tax treatment of certain investments in mining assets and in the intra-Group sales of mining concessions. These items were not explicitly determined by the Mexican tax law and consequently were subject to interpretation. The Committee has received regular reports from management on their discussions with the Servicio de Administraci\u00f3n Tributaria ('SAT'), the Mexican tax authority, concerning these matters.\n- \u00b7 Fraud detection: To respond to expected future regulatory changes, the Company has widened the evaluation of its fraud risk assessment process to reinforce the controls to prevent and detect material fraud. Although the Company has always maintained a firm commitment to prevent and detect fraud through well established practices and procedures, the Company is undertaking a detailed review of its key processes during the first half of 2022 in order to identify where further improvements could be made. The Committee has been working closely with the Internal Control and the Internal Audit areas in the additional assessing and testing which is expected to be concluded in the near future. We discussed with the external auditors their procedures in respect of fraud.\n- \u00b7 Climate-related Financial Disclosures: This Annual Report includes additional disclosures consistent with the guidelines set out by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. These disclosure requirements were discussed by the Committee and particular attention was put on them in the review of the Annual Report and the financial statements. The Committee has also considered the role and work of the HSECR Committee in monitoring climate-related risks and the mitigating actions being taken to manage those risks. The Committee is comfortable that the current disclosures reflect the Company's progress to date.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Centralisation of services: As further explained on page 24, in December 2020, the Company and its Parent (Pe\u00f1oles) announced an organisational change programme to implement a new shared services and innovation function named 'Baluarte Minero'. For this reason, during the first half of the year, Fresnillo transferred some its personnel to Pe\u00f1oles (although the heads of these functions remained as executives within Fresnillo) and will from 2021 onwards pay Pe\u00f1oles for services that were, in the past, provided in-house. This reorganisation was undertaken to achieve efficiencies and cost reductions over a reasonably quick period of time. The Committee assessed the implications that this reorganisation is expected to have on Fresnillo, taking into consideration the importance related party transactions have on the Company and was satisfied that this would result in additional benefits for the Company.\n- \u00b7 Reserves and Resources: As we discussed last year, the Committee reviewed the observations raised by SRK Consulting UK Ltd (SRK) on process and procedures in relation to the preparation of the 2019 Reserves and Resources Statement. During 2020 and 2021, the Committee held timely and close discussions with management regarding the action plans and progress being made with the correction of the deficiencies observed by SRK and reported in person to the Audit Committee. In 2021, the audit of reserves and resources was split between SRK and AMC for reasons of efficiency and the timeliness of delivery of the Reserves and Resources Statement by SRK has continued to improve. Following the completion of AMC's audit, it has been possible to upgrade some of our probable reserves to proven reserves. In addition, the Company made significant progress in correcting the observations from prior years with the result that the Company is able to report its reserves and resources with greater accuracy and certainty.\n- \u00b7 Inventory: Since 2019, there have been opportunities to re-estimate the inventory quantities in the leaching pads at Herradura mine as a result of technological advances in recovery methodologies. As a result, management has regularly reassessed its estimates of ore in the deposits to determine whether there should be any further financial adjustments. These assessments have continued throughout 2021 and, after discussions with management and knowing the results of the external auditor's review, the Committee has agreed with the inventory valuation at the end of 2021.\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity: IT security and data protection were also subjects that the Committee analysed regularly during the year to ensure that the programmes of activity identified in previous years continue to be implemented on schedule. In 2021, the Committee continued to receive updates on the Group's IT strategy, its linkage to the Group's overall business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. It also monitored the progress of the Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo management teams in developing the cybersecurity framework for the Group. Further information about the Group's approach to IT is set out on page 137 of the Strategic Report. The Company continues to make progress in this important area, and this will be monitored further by the Committee during 2022.\n\nIn the second half of the year, Lintstock, an independent advisory firm, carried out an evaluation of the Board and its different committees, including the Audit Committee. The different evaluations are outlined elsewhere in this Annual Report (on page 172) and with respect to the Audit Committee, I am pleased to report that the results of the evaluation were very positive. Nevertheless, we continue to look for ways to improve the efficiency of our meetings and remain well-briefed on the subjects that we are required to consider as a Committee.\n\nAt the end of 2020 we reported with regret the passing of Luis Robles, who was an outstanding member of the Committee. Early in the year, we welcomed Georgina Kessel and more recently, H\u00e9ctor Rangel, both of whom have significant financial experience and are making substantial contributions to the Committee, drawing on their long and outstanding professional backgrounds.\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge with gratitude the effort and valuable contributions made by the members of the Committee and by the Company executives who work closely with it, and certainly, for the invaluable support and trust that we have always received from the Board.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nChairman of the Audit Committee",

The Committee met five times during 2021 with all the meetings being held by videoconference. Notwithstanding this, the Committee was able to operate in accordance with its terms of reference and it was able to follow its usual pattern of work which is reported under the following headings:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## REPORTING\n\n- \u00b7 Financial reporting: Overseeing the Company's financial and narrative reporting to shareholders (including considering whether it was fair, balanced, and understandable)\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder relationships and reporting: Overseeing the Company's reporting on certain stakeholder issues\n\n## RISK AND CONTROLS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ASSURANCE\n\n- \u00b7 External audit: Overseeing the work of and the Company's relationship with the External Auditor\n- \u00b7 Internal audit: Overseeing the work and findings of Internal Audit\n- \u00b7 Risk: Overseeing the operation of the Company's risk management framework\n- \u00b7 Internal control: Monitoring the Company's internal control environment\n- \u00b7 Related parties: Overseeing the financial aspects of the Company's commercial relationships with related parties\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing: Overseeing on behalf of the Board, the whistleblower line and the work of the Honour Commission\n\nDetails of the membership of the Committee and the Committee's effectiveness review are set out on pages 167 and 172-173 respectively of the Governance Section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## REPORTING\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Company reports to shareholders on its financial performance twice a year. During the 12 months prior to the date of this report, the Committee reviewed the interim financial statements for the six months to 30 June 2021 and the full-year financial statements and Annual Report for the year to 31 December 2021. To aid the Committee members' understanding of the reported financial results during the year, the Chief Financial Officer updated the Committee on the Group's quarterly financial performance at each of its meetings in February, April, July and October.\n\nThe principal steps taken by the Committee during the past 12 months in relation to its review of the published financial statements were:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the 2021 interim financial statements and 2021 Interim Announcement and consideration of EY's comments on the drafts of these documents.\n- \u00b7 Review of plan for preparing the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2021.\n- \u00b7 Review of the significant judgements and estimates that impact the financial statements (see below).\n- \u00b7 Review of the financial statements and Annual Report for the year ending 31 December 2021 and consideration of EY's comments on these documents.\n\nIn addition, the Committee reviewed and recommended for approval, drafts of parent company interim accounts prepared for the periods ended 31 March 2021.\n\nDuring 2021, with the exception of the interim review, EY did not provide any assurance work in relation to non-audit matters. The EY team provided a thematic briefing on audit matters for Georgina Kessel and H\u00e9ctor Rangel as part of their induction on appointment to the Committee during the year.\n\n## Significant judgement areas\n\nThe Committee considered the principal areas of financial statement risk and judgements made in relation to both the interim and full year financial statements, prior to recommending those financial statements to the Board for approval. In many cases, these significant judgement areas were the same as those considered in previous years; however, as the mining cycle progresses these areas of judgement or estimation evolve, and new ones may need to be considered while others may become less important.\n\n## Process for the review of significant judgements\n\nThe Significant Judgement process may be summarised in the following way:\n\nANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF KEY FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISKS\n\nIDENTIFICATION OF KEY VARIABLES TO CONSIDER\n\nREVIEW OF SOURCES OF ASSURANCE\n\nDISCUSSIONS WITH MANAGEMENT AND EY\n\nCOMMITTEE'S CONCLUSION ON ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE",

There is a risk that related party relationships could be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings, otherwise  distort the Company's financial position and/or transfer value to Pe\u00f1oles or another BAL company inappropriately.  Furthermore, related party transaction disclosure requirements allow investors to understand the nature and extent  of the Company's transactions with related parties and there is a risk that disclosures in the financial statements  could be inaccurate or incomplete.   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variables considered                                             | Every year, the Committee scrutinises the probity of all major related party transactions to ensure that they are  entered into transparently and fairly to all shareholders (see the section of this report headed 'Transactions with  Related Parties').

        "page_content": "## Ensuring that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee supports the Board in ensuring that the Annual Report is fair, balanced, and understandable. The approach taken by the Board in relation to the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 is described on page 187 of the Corporate Governance Report. Different sections of the Report were circulated to Board members during early February 2022 to provide time for comments to be passed back to management. In addition, Internal Audit undertook a review of the non-financial reporting (which is extracted from the Company's operational records). In support of this process, prior to deciding whether to recommend them to the Board for approval, the Committee also:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and comments discussed with management;\n- \u00b7 reviewed with management the different disclosures relating to climate change throughout the Annual Report and, in particular, the TCFD reporting, including the statement of compliance;\n- \u00b7 discussed the Annual Report and financial reporting with the Company's CFO; and\n- \u00b7 discussed with Internal Audit points arising from their review of the principal non-financial numbers in the Annual Report.\n\n## Stakeholder reporting\n\nThe Committee plays a role in overseeing, on behalf of the Board, some key aspects of the Company's reporting concerning its relationships with key stakeholder groups.\n\nEmployees: The Committee reviewed the work of the Honour Commission in relation to matters raised via the whistleblower line (see following section).\n\nGovernment/tax authorities: In particular, it closely monitors the Company's relationship with the SAT, with the status of any outstanding tax audits reviewed at most meetings. The Committee receives regular reports from the Head of Tax on her interactions with the SAT concerning current tax audits.\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee reviewed the Company's Payments to Governments data, published in June; and the Company's UK Tax Strategy Statement, published in November.\n\nEnvironment/Climate: During the year, the Committee began to evaluate the role that it should play in overseeing the governance of climate change and environmental risks. In particular, it was agreed that the Committee should work closely with the HSECR Committee to ensure that the governance of climate-related risks and monitoring of KPIs associated with climate-related risks is aligned between Fresnillo's operations and financial reporting.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nThe 'Fresnillo Plays Fair' whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders to anonymously report (via an independent third party) violations of the Group's Code of Conduct. The hotline is available to all stakeholders, including employees and third parties, so that any concerns about misconduct or impropriety may be raised and dealt with appropriately. All matters raised via the hotline are processed by an independent third party for review by the Honour Commission (which comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the Compliance Officer, the Vice President of Exploration and the Head of Legal). A summary of the whistleblowing cases, which also includes the decisions of the Honour Commission in relation to each case, is reviewed by the Committee each quarter and the Chairman of the Committee gives a report to the Board every six months on the key trends and steps taken as a result of these reviews. Changes to the format of reporting to the Committee and the Board during the year has enabled the Board and Committee to evaluate better the reasons for the incidents reported, although the trends remain consistent year-on-year.\n\nIn 2021, there were a total of 157 reports (compared to 110 in 2020). In 2021, 153 (97%) of the reports were concluded in the year with the remainder, having been raised in the latter part of the year, still under investigation. Further details about the whistleblowing reports in 2021 are set out in the Sustainability Report on pages 74-76. During the year, the Committee was satisfied that all matters had been or continue to be properly investigated with appropriate action taken.",

EY was originally appointed in 2008 and their appointment was re-confirmed in 2016 following a rigorous external audit tender process in 2015/2016. The next tender process is expected to be held no later than 2025. The current lead partner, Steve Dobson, has been in place since 2020. During 2021, the members of the Committee met twice with representatives from EY without management present and once with management without representatives of EY present, to ensure that there are no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor which it should address. There were none.\n\nThe Company was in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 during the year.\n\n## External audit process\n\nThe key steps in the Committee's interactions with EY during the past 12 months were:\n\n- \u00b7 The review of a report from EY providing their observations and opportunities arising from the 2020 audit process and management responses to those observations in April 2021.\n- \u00b7 Discussion with EY of the findings from their review of the interim results for the period ended 30 June 2021.\n- \u00b7 The review of the 2021 half-year representation letter given to EY.\n- \u00b7 The review and approval of the external audit plan, fees and terms of audit engagement.\n- \u00b7 The review of the results of the 'hard close audit' for the ten months to 31 October 2021.\n- \u00b7 The review of the representation letter given to EY for the 2021 full-year audit.\n- \u00b7 The review of EY's report following completion of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nCovid-19: In 2021, EY's review of the half-year financial statements and the external audit of the full-year financial statements and 2021 Annual Report continued to be restricted by the Covid-19 pandemic which prevented travel from the UK to Mexico and significantly reduced physical access to the Company's facilities. EY revised their approach to the audit to take account of these physical restrictions.\n\nQuality, objectiveness and independence of the external auditor: The Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources and expertise to fulfil the role. The Committee specifically reviewed, and is satisfied with, the independence of EY as the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in accordance with UK Ethical Standards for the audit profession. The Committee discussed the quality, objectiveness, and independence of the EY team with the management team and was satisfied that there were no concerns in this regard.\n\nNon-audit services policy: The Committee has adopted a policy for the provision of non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor (the 'Policy'). The Committee has maintained an ongoing dialogue with EY during the year concerning the services that it provides to the Company and the wider Pe\u00f1oles Group to ensure that where such services are provided, they are in line with the Policy or discussed with the Committee on a timely basis.\n\nThe current policy permits the engagement of the external auditor to provide a narrow range of permitted services which are closely related to the audit and/or required by law or regulation. Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services above US$5,000 is subject to the specific approval of the Committee. During 2021, EY provided audit-related assurance services in connection with the review of the interim financial statements (US$497,000). The ratio of fees paid for non-audit work in relation to audit work during the year was 0.28:1.00 (2020: 0.49:1.00)\n\nDetails of the fees paid to EY during the year are shown in note 27 to the financial statements.\n\n## Evaluation of the effectiveness of the external audit and the auditor\n\nThe Committee assesses the effectiveness of EY as its external auditor from two perspectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of the work of EY's UK practice, as a firm, undertaken by the Financial Reporting Council's Audit Quality Review Team.\n- \u00b7 Its own assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process and the role played by both EY's UK and Mexican teams in the performance of the annual audit.\n\nAudit Quality Review: The Committee reviewed the report of the FRC on its Audit Quality Review on EY as a firm and discussed with the EY Audit Partner whether any of the FRC's findings were relevant to the firm's audit of the Fresnillo financial statements. EY also shared the findings from their own internal quality review with the Chairman of the Committee. The conclusion from these reviews was that there were no major matters of concern to consider.\n\nAudit Committee assessment of EY: Following the completion of the 2020 Annual Report, the Committee undertook a review of the performance and effectiveness of EY at its April meeting. As part of this process, the Chief Financial Officer and finance team were invited to provide their insights into their interaction with the EY teams during that process. The Committee concluded that EY was generally performing well with an overall consensus being that the working relationship was good.\n\nThe Committee regularly monitors the steps taken by EY to ensure that the balance of work between the UK and Mexico is efficient and effective. The implementation of commitments made by EY for improving audit efficiency at the time of their successful tender in 2016 continued to be monitored by the Committee during 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Reappointment of the external auditor\n\nIn February 2022, taking account of the reviews of the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Committee recommended to the Board the reappointment of the external auditor, EY at the Company's 2022 Annual General Meeting. The reappointment of the auditor will be subject to a review of proposed fees for the 2022 audit in October 2022.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe 2021 Internal Audit Annual Plan was approved by the Audit Committee in October 2020, incorporating audits across all of Fresnillo's business units with a focus on strategic priorities and key risks. In 2021, due to the continuation of Covid-19 restrictions, the Internal Audit programme was executed through a combination of site visits and remote audit procedures. Internal audit continued to deploy technology and apply data analytics to achieve depth of audit coverage and gain deeper insights into Fresnillo's risk and control profile. Internal Audit completed a number of risk reviews along with process and controls assessments focusing on efficiency, productivity, cost management and regulatory compliance. Internal Audit verified the validity, accuracy and completeness of the non-financial information included in the 2020 Annual Report and reported the results to the Audit Committee.\n\nDue to the continued importance of cybersecurity and the evolving technology landscape, Internal Audit carried out assessments aimed at validating the design and effectiveness of Fresnillo's cybersecurity processes and controls. In addition, due to the emergence of new regulations such as the Mexican Labour Law Reform, Internal Audit carried out a follow-up of Fresnillo's compliance risk management processes. The Audit Committee continues to review progress made in raising the level of cybersecurity maturity and actions taken by Management to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Towards the end of each year, Internal Audit presents the proposed Internal Audit Annual Plan and resourcing requirements for the following year. The 2022 Internal Audit Plan was presented to the Committee and approved in October 2021. The plan was developed according to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and included the following steps: shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_411624148 shutterstock\\_736197394 shutterstock\\_1025305825 shutterstock\\_1635254404 shutterstock\\_1705437412 shutterstock\\_439569301\n\nFresnillo's Strategic Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnterprise Risk Assessment (including emerging risks)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement's concerns and previous Internal Audit results\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUniverse of processes, Business Units and projects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternal Audit annual plan 2022\n\nThe Internal Audit plan for 2022 includes planned audits relating to strategic priorities and higher risk areas such as ESG, ongoing capital projects, compliance with community relations plans, compliance with laws and regulations (e.g. environmental laws, labour law, permitting requirements), reserves and resources, tailings dam management, health and safety, taxes, digital effectiveness, cybersecurity and IT-OT processes and multi-risk operational compliance processes at mines.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit attended all Audit Committee meetings throughout the year. Members of the Audit Committee meet with the Head of Internal Audit twice a year without management present.\n\nAt each meeting during the year, the Audit Committee also monitored the progress made by management in addressing 'red flag' items (i.e. most serious control weaknesses) identified through Internal Audit work. The Audit Committee's focus is to ensure that the management responses to remediation are appropriate and that timely progress is made in reducing the number of red flags over time.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee monitored the quality of the dialogue between Internal Audit and the Executive Committee in reviewing Internal Audit findings and agreeing action plans with appropriate levels of operational buy-in to address the points raised. The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer several times during the year to review the outstanding Internal Audit points and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshutterstock\\_411624148",

Operational responsibility for risk lies with line management (details of the risk management system are set out on pages 120-125). The Audit Committee discusses potential changes to the Group's risk profile through its regular reviews of the Risk Matrix and its consideration of any associated recommendations from management proposing changes to the Risk Matrix to take account of changing and emerging risk. The Company defines emerging risk as: 'a new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, risks that are known to some degree but are not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid or long term future, have significant implications to achieve the organisation's strategic plan.'\n\nThe Emerging Risks were evaluated and reviewed by the Committee during the year. While the assessment of most of the emerging risks remained unchanged during the year, two new emerging risks are now being monitored (both connected to the Climate Change Principal Risk): (i) Transition to a low-carbon future and (ii) Increasing societal and investor expectations in relation to climate change .\n\nThe Principal Risks and Uncertainties are reviewed every six months prior to the publication of both the interim and full-year reports. During the year the Committee assessed movements in the profiles of the following risks prior to recommending the Principal Risks and Uncertainties reports to the Board for approval:\n\n- \u00b7 Potential Government actions: Changes resulting from the labour reforms and complications in the relationship with contractors, among other developments;\n- \u00b7 Impact of metals prices and global macroeconomic developments: The impact on the supply chain of critical inputs for operation resulting from macroeconomic developments during the year;\n- \u00b7 Security: Increased high-impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping and extortion) in the regions where we have operations, mainly Zacatecas and Sonora; and\n- \u00b7 Projects: Increasing delays and complications in obtaining permits and the lack of operating equipment due to supply chain disruptions.\n\n## Ethical risk\n\nThe Committee monitors ethical risk through regular reviews of progress with the Group's anti-bribery and corruption programme (including regular updates on the completion rates for the online training programmes). This demonstrates that the Group's corporate values and elements of the control culture in relation to ethics remain embedded throughout the organisation. To this end, during the year, the Committee received reports on the roll-out of training in relation to the disclosure of conflicts of interest; the annual assessment of the Code of Conduct; Step-up Culture; and Harassment.\n\nThe Company widened the evaluation of its fraud risk assessment process to reinforce the controls to prevent and detect material fraud. Although the Company has always maintained a firm commitment to prevent and detect fraud through well established practices and procedures, the Committee has been working closely with the Internal Control and the Internal Audit areas to identify opportunities for further assessment and testing. This is expected to be concluded in the first half of 2022. The external auditors are also expanding their procedures in this area.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nThe Company's objectives and policies on financial risk management including information on the Company's exposures to market risk, such as foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks; credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in note 13 to the financial statements. During the year, the Committee reviewed the Company's Treasury Policy and concluded that no further changes were required.\n\n## Non-financial risk areas\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews and receives management updates on current issues and developments that could have potential to give rise to specific risks. In this, the Committee is guided by regular updates received from management on specific issues that it considers should be kept under review. Thus, during 2021, regular reports were received on legal matters (including land titles and litigation) and a review of the Group's compliance with mining licence conditions at each of its Business Units. Internal Audit's findings in relation to water consumption reports were also considered by the Committee. Where new potential areas of risk are considered by management as part of their regular reviews of the Risk Matrix, the Committee may request further bespoke updates from management to supplement its general review of risk and internal controls. No new areas of non-financial risk were identified during 2021.\n\n## Information technology\n\nIn 2021, the Committee continued to receive updates on the Group's IT strategy, its linkage to the Group's overall business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. It also monitored the progress of the Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo management teams in developing the cybersecurity framework for the Group. Further information about the Group's approach to IT is set out on page 137 of the Strategic Report.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months from the approval of the financial statements. The Committee supported the Board in this assessment by considering whether the Company has adequate liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. In February 2022, the Committee reviewed the Group's budget and cash flow forecasts for the period to December 2023, taking into account the Company's anticipated production profiles at each mine, budgeted capital and exploration expenditure and the sensitivity of the cash flow forecasts to movements in metals prices, including stress testing those forecasts to identify the levels to which metals prices must fall to put pressure on working capital levels.\n\nThe Committee also considered EY's report on this assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein, including their consistency with assumptions and estimates used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements. The Committee also challenged management on the feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed of their implementation. Following this assessment, the Committee satisfied itself that",

        "page_content": "the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern. The Going Concern Statement is set out in the Strategic Report on page 145.\n\n## Viability assessment\n\nThe executive team has developed a comprehensive approach to the viability assessment which is then reported in the Viability Statement. The key steps of this approach are explained within the Viability Statement, which is set out in the Strategic Report on pages 143-144. In December 2021 the Committee received an update on the methodology that the executive team adopted in preparing the Viability Statement. In February 2022, it reviewed the output from that process, including consideration of observations reported by EY, and the proposed Viability Statement itself. It also considered the potential steps that could be taken to mitigate the cash flow impacts arising from the most negative scenarios (including delaying project capex or reducing exploration expenditure).\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Committee assists the Board in monitoring the effectiveness of the Company's internal control environment. This monitoring includes oversight of all material controls including financial, operational, regulatory and compliance. To accomplish this, there is a governance and organisational structure in place where internal control is secured by three lines of defence: process owners (1st line); committees, controllers, risk management and other oversight bodies (second line); and, Internal Audit (third line). During the year, the Committee reviewed each of the quarterly internal control reports which were then circulated to the full Board for its review. At the end of the financial year, the Committee oversaw the annual process for monitoring the Group's system of internal controls. In this task, the Committee is directly supported by the work of the Internal Audit team.\n\nThe pandemic impacted the way in which the internal control reviews were carried out, making it impossible to conduct physical reviews of the operating processes at all the mines and main projects due to travel restrictions. However, it was possible to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control by using technology, evaluating electronic information and analysing data from the operations. Accordingly, as a result of these reviews, it was concluded that there were no material control weaknesses as a consequence of the pandemic.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, numerous controls were implemented to address new risk factors. Where certain controls had to be suspended temporarily due to health and safety requirements, for example fingerprint entry controls, mitigating controls were implemented as appropriate.\n\nDespite these operational restrictions and complexities caused by the pandemic, Fresnillo plc continued with the implementation of vitally important organisational programmes such as health, safety and initiatives for the monitoring and management of tailings dams.\n\n## Quarterly internal control reports\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee continued to review each of the quarterly internal controls reports which were prepared and submitted to the Board at each of its regular meetings. This document specifically reports on developments in the Key Risk Indicators and the key internal control issues arising from the quarterly Internal Audit reports. From time to time, the Committee has proposed changes to those reports based on its own discussion of Internal Audit's findings.\n\n## Annual review of the system of internal controls\n\nThe Committee undertakes an annual review of the Group's system of internal controls in accordance with Provision 29 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. This review aims to improve the understanding of how the various sources of assurance (through the three lines of defence) interact in the review and execution of material controls by identifying and addressing any gaps in the control framework. Consequently, once a year, the Committee oversees the review of the Group's system of internal controls through an assessment, conducted by Internal Audit, of the various sources of assurance (over the execution of material internal controls). This is a comprehensive review incorporating operational management, financial management and executive management; along with the independent assessment of material risks and internal controls by Internal Audit within the third line of defence. This approach underpins assessment of the ongoing effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls and the Committee provides oversight of this process.\n\nNotable remediation actions arising from the control exceptions identified throughout the year were those related to: (i) improving the reporting system on water consumption, enhancing training for permitting, water usage controls and other operational activities, (ii) strengthening controls, training and oversight within mining processes to achieve operational efficiency and to optimise key inputs for operations; and, (iii) implementing a group level emerging technology adoption framework including cross-functional an d multidisciplinary pre-investment reviews.\n\nAs a follow-up to prior year deviations, some benefits have been achieved during 2021 for the system of internal controls from company-wide programmes. Progress has been made in embedding the corporate safety programme 'Me Cuido, Nos Cuidamos' (I Care, We Care) in alignment with International Council on Mining and Metals standards. The company made important improvements over the recommendations made by SRK relating to improving the governance of the reserves a resources estimation process as well.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and other senior managers were invited to meet with the Audit Committee to discuss their action plans and progress for remediating the issues identified.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board agreed that the following statement be made about the review of the system of internal control in the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe Board has, through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee (at its February 2022 meeting), reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls. Following this review, the Board considers that the measures that have been or are planned to be implemented, particularly those specifically highlighted in this report, complement Fresnillo's risk management framework and are appropriate to the Group's circumstances. The Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and maintaining best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.",

Being part of the same Group provides an opportunity to achieve synergistic operational, financial, and administrative improvements by combining the resourcing of common services that can be shared between Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo. Although these arrangements are beneficial to Fresnillo, the Committee performs a role in overseeing these arrangements to ensure that they continue to operate impartially.\n\nThe principal arrangements entered into between the Company and related parties and reviewed by the Committee during the year were:\n\n| The Met-Mex agreement   | As it does every year, the Audit Committee considered the reasonableness of proposed treatment and  refining charges in respect of the Met-Mex arrangements for 2021. Management circulated a paper setting  out the methodology to determine the charges, which takes industry benchmark charges and adjusts to  reflect ore composition and transport costs. The same methodology used in 2021 was used as in 2019 and  2020. The Committee reviewed this paper and recommended approval of the proposed charges by the  independent Directors at the Board meeting in October 2021. As part of its review of the Met-Mex arrangements, the Committee also confirmed with management that   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Other agreements        | There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business (e.g. insurance brokerage)  which, although not requiring approval by independent Directors, will from time-to-time be reviewed by  the Committee to ensure that the arrangements are on a reasonable arm's-length basis. During the year,  the Audit Committee reviewed the annual insurance renewal for which GNP, a related party, acted as  broker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\nThe Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles under which 24 categories of services are provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles. The Shared Services Agreement was renewed for five years with effect from 1 January 2018. Internal Audit conducts reviews of approximately one third of the services provided each year to ensure that these services are provided in accordance with the agreed KPIs. As a result, all services are reviewed by Internal Audit over a three-year cycle. Internal Audit reports to the Committee on its review of the Shared Services Agreement.\n\nAs further explained elsewhere in this Annual Report (on page 24), during the first half of the year, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles decided to centralise certain specialised services into a single unit within Pe\u00f1oles, known as 'Baluarte Minero'. As part of this reorganisation, Fresnillo transferred some personnel to Baluarte and will pay Pe\u00f1oles for their services. This reorganisation was undertaken to achieve efficiencies and cost reductions over a reasonably quick period of time. The Committee discussed the implications that this reorganisation is expected to have on Fresnillo, taking into consideration the importance that related party transactions have in this Company and the importance of ensuring that they are in the interests of Fresnillo. This is not expected to generate additional costs in Fresnillo.",

An explanation of the process adopted in preparing the Annual Report and analysis of the basis upon which each requirement for it to be 'Fair', 'Balanced' and 'Understandable' had been met was summarised in a paper which the Board discussed at its meeting on 1 March 2022. The key features of this process were:\n\n- \u00b7 The narrative sections of the Annual Report were drafted by the members of the team with specific responsibility for the areas referred to in the sections that they prepare. The individuals involved included the Head of Investor Relations, the Head of Risk, the Head of Sustainability, the Compliance Officer and Head of Legal, Company Secretary and Mine Managers.\n- \u00b7 As narrative sections of the Annual Report were prepared, copies were circulated to Board members for review and comment. Such comments were incorporated into updated versions of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 About a month prior to the Annual Report being approved by the Board, members of the Audit Committee and other Directors reviewed a current draft enabling them to assess whether the information was consistent with their understanding of the Company's business and the nature and content of discussions at the Board during the year. Comments were received from the Directors on most areas of the Annual Report, and these were incorporated into subsequent drafts of the Annual Report. The sections of the Annual Report which were particularly commented on included: the Operations reporting, the Sustainability Report and climate disclosures in particular, the presentation of information on diversity and inclusion and the presentation of health and safety information.\n- \u00b7 Suggested changes put forward by the Directors, based on knowledge obtained through Board and Audit Committee papers and discussion and other interactions with management were taken into account by management in preparing the final version of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 The disclosures relating to climate change, in particular the TCFD statements, were reviewed by members of the Board to ensure that they were consistent with the approach and discussions relating to climate-related change at Board and Committee (particularly the Audit Committee and HSECR Committee) levels.\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Internal Audit undertook a review exercise of the principal non-financial numbers in the Annual Report which are extracted from the Company's operational records and their findings were appropriately reflected.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee also reviewed the Annual Report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and decided to recommend them to the Board for approval.\n\nAs a result of the above procedures, the Board considers that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Report which is set out on pages 156-187 has been approved by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director 7 March 2022",

The  Company does not operate   a long-term incentive plan. | The Company does not  use share-based forms of  remuneration because they   have not been a common form  of remuneration in Mexico. | Rationale In the absence of share-based  incentive schemes, the Company  does not adopt shareholding  guidelines for executives. | The absence of long-term  incentives and the operation of  Mexican law makes it difficult  to adopt clawback and malus  arrangements. There is however  scope within the bonus scheme  for bonus awards to be adjusted  downward at the discretion of  the Remuneration Committee. |\n\n## Objective of the annual bonus\n\n## What does the annual bonus seek to achieve?\n\nThe annual bonus is set for and based on performance over a single-year period but the KPIs and targets are also designed to ensure that both short-term objectives and the long-term development of the Fresnillo Group are given broadly equal priority within variable remuneration.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration report\n\n## Chairman's Annual Statement\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nI am delighted to introduce the first Directors' Remuneration Report since my appointment as Chair of the Remuneration Committee at the AGM. I would like to begin by thanking my predecessor Charlie Jacobs for his excellent contribution to the work of the Committee as Chairman over the past few years. I am grateful to Charlie for the support he has provided to me as I have taken over this role.\n\nOur primary objective this year has been to ensure that our approach to executive remuneration has been proportionate given the performance of the Company as it has emerged from the consequences of the Covid pandemic.\n\n## Our application of the Remuneration Policy in 2021\n\nDuring the year, we have applied the Remuneration Policy to executive remuneration without needing to exercise any form of discretion other than those elements of the executive bonus plan which require an element of judgement in determining outcomes for the year. Our focus has turned to the renewal of the Directors Remuneration Policy at the 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Salaries and bonus\n\nUsing the benchmark information provided by our advisers, we agreed that the level of salary increase for our Executive Directors and other senior executives should be aligned to the level of increase for all employees. This year was no exception and the CEO's pay was increased in line with the rest of the workforce.\n\nThe Committee decided that the Chief Executive Officer should not receive a bonus under the Annual Bonus Plan because his points total did not meet the minimum level at which bonuses are paid.\n\n## Shareholder approval and new Policy\n\nThe Committee was pleased to note that shareholders continued to support the Company's approach to executive remuneration with over 96% of the independent shareholders who voted, endorsing our 2020 Annual Remuneration Report.\n\nGiven this level of support, we have not been inclined to make any substantial changes to the Directors' Remuneration Policy when it is proposed to shareholders for approval at the 2022 AGM. Nevertheless, we discussed the current policy with our advisers and considered its appropriateness given our Company's context. We have concluded that some minor amendments would be beneficial but, structurally, the policy that we will put to shareholders for approval at the AGM will be substantially the same as the current one.\n\nThus, we propose to make some minor changes to the policy - the rationale for the main changes is explained below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRemuneration Element\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                          | Proposed changes to the Policy                     | Rationale for change    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Where an annual bonus payment  is not, in the opinion of the  Remuneration Committee,  commensurate with the   wider stakeholder experience   a downward adjustment may   be considered. | To take account  of stakeholder  experiences.      | Annual Bonus            |\n| Pension contributions paid to  Executives will be aligned with   the majority of the workforce.                                                                                          | To comply with  the UK Corporate  Governance Code. | Pension   Contributions |\n| Our policy on recruitment will  allow payment of discretionary  buy-out payments in exceptional  circumstances.                                                                          | To future proof   our policy.                      | Recruitment             |\n\n## Use of discretion by the Remuneration Committee\n\nDuring the year, the Remuneration Committee was satisfied that the financial and operational outcomes for the year resulted in a bonus outcome which was a fair reflection of the performance of the business during the year. Consequently, the Committee did not consider it necessary to exercise any discretion to amend the basis on which bonus payments were made during the year.\n\n## Committee discussions during 2021\n\nDuring the year, the Remuneration Committee met three times and its discussions and decisions included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee compared to the KPIs set for 2021 and approval of annual bonus awards for 2021 based on achievement of KPI targets.\n- \u00b7 Review of KPI targets for the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Executive Committee for 2021.\n- \u00b7 Review of the Non-Executive Directors' fees.\n- \u00b7 Discussion of the review of the Committee undertaken by Lintstock.\n- \u00b7 Review and revision of the terms of reference of the Committee in response to UK regulatory developments.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee continues to believe that its approach to executive remuneration incentivises the right priorities for our executive team. I am always happy to discuss our approach to remuneration with shareholders and I hope that I will be able to attend the 2022 AGM to answer questions on this report.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee",

        "page_content": "## Salary\n\n## Factors considered in setting salary and workforce engagement on remuneration\n\n## Policy on the consideration of wider employment conditions and remuneration\n\nWhen setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated each year with employee representatives as its starting point taking account of inflation and other information supporting the annual pay award for employees.\n\nBenchmarking information on pay and employment conditions provided by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation was used across the Group in determining salaries for all employee grades including senior management. These reports benchmarked salaries by reference to peer groups in mining, large companies in Mexico and internationally.\n\nThe Company negotiates salary increases with the unions annually, to take effect from 1 April each year. The agreed rates may also use as the point of reference in setting the annual salary review for the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Executive Committee and non-unionised employees. In 2021, it was agreed that the Chief Executive Officer would receive a salary increase of 4% in 2021 in line with other employees. Consequently, the salary payable under Mr Alv\u00eddrez' service agreement is MX$1,061,436 per month, which excludes payments for holidays, Company-paid savings contributions and other cash benefits.\n\n## Policy on the alignment of executive remuneration and the market\n\nA formal review of the Executive Director and Executive Committee members' remuneration is conducted by Willis Towers Watson and will be undertaken at least once every three years. This enables the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company's policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director's and any Executive Committee member's remuneration (the 'Peer Group') to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in the policy.\n\nThe Peer Group will be reviewed at least every three years, and updated where necessary, to ensure that it remains an appropriate comparator group of companies.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has agreed that the Chief Executive's salary should be set within a range of 25-75% of the Peer Group for base salary. The Peer Group currently consists of the following companies.\n\n## Policy benchmarking Peer Group\n\n| Region     | Peer Group Companies                                  |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mexico     | Grupo Mexico Leagold Mining                           |\n| USA/Canada | Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd Centerra Gold Hecla Mining Co. |\n|            | IAM Gold                                              |\n|            | Newmont Goldcorp                                      |\n|            | Pan American Silver Corp.                             |\n|            | Yamana Gold Inc.                                      |\n| Europe     | Hochschild Mining                                     |\n|            | Antofagasta                                           |\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\n## Policy on annual bonus plan and variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Company's policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company's core strategy is one of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group's operations through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is therefore made between short and long-term incentives.\n\n## Factors considered in setting the bonus\n\nThe Annual Bonus Plan includes metrics and targets which are aligned to at least one of the four main themes of the Group's strategy (see Remuneration-at-a-glance section on pages 188-189).\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has set a cap on each of the KPIs (other than the Safety KPI) such that the points awarded on any KPI (other than Safety) cannot exceed 135% of the target set for that KPI at the beginning of the year.",

The 2022 targets, performance against those targets and the basis of calculation of bonus points awarded will be disclosed in next year's report.\n\n## Pension entitlement\n\n## Policy on pensions\n\nThe Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.\n\nOn behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5 to 8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5% to 8% of salary. Executive Directors may participate in the Group's pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.\n\nMr Alv\u00eddrez is a member of the defined benefit scheme in relation to services with the Company prior to 1 July 2007. He is also a member of the defined contribution scheme. He is expected to retire at his normal retirement age of 60 years.\n\n## Chairman and Non-Executive Directors\n\n## Policy on Chairman and Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-Executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. The Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-Executive Director.\n\nThe fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 A base fee of \u00a335,000 per annum is paid to each non-UK-based Non-Executive Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a whole.\n- \u00b7 There are no set fees for membership of any Board committees or for the chairmanship of the Board, other than as follows.\n- -The UK-based Non-Executive Directors receive a higher fee, currently \u00a390,000 per annum, to reflect the additional time commitment that they make in order to travel to Board meetings in Mexico and for responsibilities as Committee members and, where appropriate, as Senior Independent Director and/or Chairman of any Committee.\n- -The Chairman of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a315,000 per annum.\n- -Members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a35,000 per annum.",

The current term expires\n- on 17 May 2022, being the date of the next Annual General Meeting but the appointment will continue after that date provided that each Director is re-elected at the AGM.\n- 2 Copies of the Directors' letters of appointment and service agreements are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.\n\n## Shareholders and remuneration\n\n## Policy on engagement with shareholders on remuneration\n\nThe composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders (through the membership of a UK-based Director on the Committee) can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services ('ISS') and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application.\n\n## AGM voting on the Remuneration Report\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's approach to executive remuneration has received strong support from shareholders at every Annual General Meeting since the Company's listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2008. More than 95% of independent share votes cast on the advisory vote at each AGM have been in favour of the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n|                           | All shares voted   | All shares voted   | Independent shares voted   | Independent shares voted   | No. of votes withheld   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Year                      | For                | Against            | For                        | Against                    |                         |\n| 2011                      | 99.98%             | 0.02%              | 99.88%                     | 0.12%                      | 5,125                   |\n| 2012                      | 99.91%             | 0.09%              | 99.54%                     | 0.46%                      | 1,814,818               |\n| 2013                      | 99.97%             | 0.03%              | 99.82%                     | 0.18%                      | 115,987                 |\n| 2014: Remuneration Policy | 99.72%             | 0.28%              | 98.69%                     | 1.31%                      | 532,589                 |\n| 2014: Remuneration Report | 100.00%            | 0.00%              | 99.99%                     | 0.01%                      | 531,072                 |\n| 2015: Remuneration Report | 99.91%             | 0.09%              | 99.55%                     | 0.45%                      | 814,989                 |\n| 2016: Remuneration Report | 99.89%             | 0.11%              | 99.48%                     | 0.52%                      | 44,391                  |\n| 2017: Remuneration Policy | 99.87%             | 0.13%              | 99.42%                     | 0.58%                      | 43,901                  |\n| 2017: Remuneration Report | 99.86%             | 0.14%              | 99.34%                     | 0.66%                      | 43,901                  |\n| 2018 Remuneration Policy  | 99.45%             | 0.55%              | 97.32%                     | 2.68%                      | 9,907                   |\n| 2018: Remuneration Report | 99.79%             | 0.21%              | 98.99%                     | 1.01%                      | 12,203                  |\n| 2019: Remuneration Policy | 99.45%             | 0.55%              | 95.72%                     | 4.28%                      | 269,961                 |\n| 2019: Remuneration Report | 99.41%             | 0.59%              | 96.99%                     | 3.01%                      | 15,761                  |\n| 2020: Remuneration Report | 99.56%             | 0.44%              | 97.75%                     | 2.25%                      | 11,231                  |\n| 2021: Remuneration Report | 99.33%             | 0.67%              | 96.08%                     | 3.92%                      | 1,369,347               |\n\nNote: Prior to 2014, there was only one vote on the Directors Remuneration Report at each Annual General Meeting.",

Such information is taken into account when considering Executive Committee remuneration. Willis Towers Watson advises the Remuneration Committee on executive remuneration matters from time to time. During 2021 the Group paid Willis Towers Watson US$ nil (2020: US$nil). All of the consultants that the Group uses are independent of the Company and each of the Directors. No remuneration consultants are directly engaged by the Remuneration Committee itself.\n\nThe Company Secretary ensures that the Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference and arranges regular updates to the Remuneration Committee on relevant regulatory developments in the UK. The Group Human Resources Department provides information on Mexican market trends and compensation structures for the broader employee population in the Fresnillo Group.\n\n## Additional information on remuneration\n\n## Share price performance\n\nAs required by the Regulations, the following graph sets out the performance of the Company's share price since its listing compared to the FTSE 100 Index. As the Company was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index for most of the year, this is deemed to be the most appropriate index for comparative purposes for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chief Executive Officer's service agreement\n\nDuring the year, Mr Alv\u00eddrez served as Chief Executive Officer but was not a member of the Board. Mr Alv\u00eddrez is employed under a contract of employment with Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of Fresnillo plc. Mr Alv\u00eddrez's contract commenced on 15 August 2012 and is governed by Mexican federal labour law. Mr Alv\u00eddrez' service agreement does not have a fixed term and may be terminated in writing by either party. There is no provision in Mr Alv\u00eddrez's service agreement entitling him to additional compensation for termination other than those required by Mexican labour laws for termination without cause. No benefits are payable on termination.\n\nUnder his service agreement, Mr Alv\u00eddrez is entitled to 26 working days' paid holiday per year. He is not entitled to profit-sharing ('PTU'). Mr Alv\u00eddrez is also entitled to life insurance, the use of a chauffeur and company car, the payment of medical insurance premiums covering limited expenses and check-ups, meals and subsistence payments and club subscriptions.\n\n## Total Remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for the past nine years, in US dollars, has been as follows:\n\n| Year ending 31 December                         | 2013    | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018    | 2019   | 2020    | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Total remuneration US$ thousands                |         |        |        |        |        |         |        |         |        |\n| Octavio Alv\u00eddrez                                | 1,116   | 1,217  | 1,166  | 1, 111 | 1,072  | 886     | 1,164  | 939     | 975    |\n| Percentage change on previous year              | (41.5%) | 9.1%   | (4.2%) | (4.7%) | (3.5%) | (10.7%) | 31.4%  | (19.3%) | 3.8%   |\n| Proportion of maximum bonus paid to CEO in year |         |        |        |        |        |         |        |         |        |\n| Octavio Alv\u00eddrez                                | 33.33%  | 33.33% | 33.33% | 66.66% | 33.33% | Nil%    | Nil%   | 20.83%  | Nil%   |",

Average Employee Remuneration is calculated by dividing the relevant Personnel Costs (as disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 241-242 by the average number of employees (as disclosed in note 7(b)) to the consolidated financial statements on page 242). PTU is excluded in order to make a like-for-like comparison with the Chief Executive Officer who does not receive PTU.\n- 2. The Chief Executive Officer's salary, bonus and benefit amounts are excluded from the calculation of Average Employee Remuneration. No bonus was paid to the Chief Executive Officer for 2019 but a bonus of 2.5 months was paid for 2020, and no bonus was paid to the Chief Executive Officer for 2021, thus it is not possible to present the change as a meaningful percentage.\n- 3. Guadalupe de la Vega was appointed to the Board on 29 May 2022. Eduardo Cepeda and H\u00e9ctor Rangel were both appointed to the Board on 24 June 2021.\n- 4.

        "page_content": "## Proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis part of the Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the proposed new remuneration policy of the Company and has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 ('the Regulations'). The policy has been developed taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code ('the Code'), the guidelines published by institutional advisory bodies and the views of our major shareholders. The Remuneration Committee has assessed the criteria recommended by Code Provision 40 of the Code. It believes that the Company's remuneration policy has always been inherently clear, simple, designed to avoid excessive rewards, predictable, proportionate and aligned with the Company's culture. No material changes to the existing remuneration policy are being proposed. The subtle changes to the existing remuneration policy highlighted in the letter from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, seek to create even closer alignment between remuneration and the Company's Purpose, values and strategy. The new policy will be applied for the financial years ending 31 December 2022 onwards. It will be put to a vote at the 2022 Annual General Meeting and if approved, the effective date of the policy will be the date of the 2022 Annual General Meeting of the Company, 17 May 2022. A copy of our existing remuneration policy (approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM) can be found here: http://www.fresnilloplc.com/media/483494/Fresnillo-plc-Directors-Remuneration-Policy-Approved-May-2019.pdf.\n\nAs required by UK law, the Company's approved remuneration policy is binding in relation to Directors. The Company currently has no Executive Directors who would be bound by the remuneration policy. However, the Company will (as it has previously done) treat the Chief Executive Officer as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the remuneration policy and for reporting on his remuneration.\n\nDetails of the remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer for the year ended 31 December 2021 can be found in this year's Annual Report on Remuneration at page 191:\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nThe Group's remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives and the creation of shareholder value are key objectives of this policy.\n\nSetting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to managerial retention in Mexico. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies. Total compensation is set within a range around the median level for the Company's peer group within Mexico and internationally, total remuneration is benchmarked triennially to ensure that the whole remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long term. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and service.\n\nThe table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors' pay set out in the remuneration policy (the 'Policy Table'):\n\n## Base salary\n\n| Provides the core reward for the role   | Provides the core reward for the role                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operation                               | Normally reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year. Each review will take into account: \u00b7 Role, experience and performance. \u00b7 Average workforce salary adjustments. \u00b7 Mexican economic factors. \u00b7 Comparison with the Company's peer group in Mexico and internationally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Maximum value                           | Subject to the review process described above, the maximum value of an Executive Director's base salary will be determined  by the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion and ordinarily it will be increased in line with increases applied  across the whole workforce. In exceptional circumstances, an Executive Director's salary may be increased by up to, but never  more than, 10% above the average pay increase for the whole workforce of the Company in any financial year. The rationale for  any such increase will be fully explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration. |\n| Performance metric                      | The Remuneration Committee considers individual salaries at the appropriate review meeting each year by reference to the  factors noted under the 'Operation' heading in this Policy Table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Discretion                              | The Remuneration Committee will establish the Company's comparator peer group in Mexico and internationally as part of a  triennial review which it will undertake in April 2022. The peer group will be reviewed again in April 2025. The Committee will  report on the outcome of these reviews within the relevant Annual Report on Remuneration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |",

Information relating to the Mexican economic metrics is collated by management for the Remuneration Committee to consider.\n\nReviews of the Executive Director and Executive Committee members' remuneration is conducted by Willis Towers Watson from time to time at the request of the Remuneration Committee. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company's policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director's and any Executive Committee member's remuneration (the 'Peer Group') to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in this policy (see page 193 of the Annual Report on Remuneration). The Peer Group will be updated where necessary, to ensure that it remains an appropriate comparator group of companies.\n\n## The consideration of wider employment conditions and remuneration\n\nWhen setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated each year, with employee representatives as its starting point taking account of inflation and other information supporting the annual pay award for employees. Subject to the 10% limit in the Policy Table, the Remuneration Committee may agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in exceptional circumstances, where in its discretion it considers such variance to the norm to be justified. Other than the Willis Towers Watson report specifically commissioned by the Remuneration Committee, the same benchmark reports are used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration, thus providing a common approach to both.\n\nBelow Board level, a statutory profit-sharing arrangement ('PTU') is operated which in some years has enabled employees to receive significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability of the relevant employing company. The Chief Executive Officer does not participate in a PTU scheme within the Fresnillo Group. Members of the senior management group below Board level are employed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V. or Operaciones Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which pay annual PTU payments. However, such payments are modest.\n\nThe Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.\n\nOn behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5-8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5% to 8% of salary.\n\nExecutive Directors may participate the Group's pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees in setting Directors' remuneration. Engagement with employees as a stakeholder group is primarily the responsibility of the Board; however, where appropriate, the Remuneration Committee will consider any relevant feedback from employees to the Board in relation to remuneration matters when discharging its responsibilities under this Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration report continued\n\n## Proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022 continued\n\n## Engagement with shareholders on remuneration\n\nThe composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders (through the membership of a UK-based Director on the Committee) can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services ('ISS') and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application. Following the Company's AGM in 2022, details of votes cast for and against the resolutions to approve the new remuneration policy and Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2021, will be announced to the market.\n\n## Policy on recruitment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration of new Executive Directors by reference to the Policy Table set out above. The Remuneration Committee will not, as a matter of standard practice, pay sign-on payments, or compensate new Directors for any variable remuneration forfeited from any employment prior to joining the Board. However, it may choose to do so in exceptional circumstances, when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders), in which case any buy-out payments will not exceed the remuneration relinquished and will mirror (as far as possible) the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration. Where possible this will be facilitated through the Company's existing Annual Bonus Plan, as set out in the Policy Table above, but if not, the Remuneration Committee may use the provisions of 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the value of any 'sign-on' and/or 'buy-out' payments will not count towards the limits on Annual Bonus in the Policy Table above. Any such payments will be fully explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration both as to the reason for payment and the rationale for the quantum.\n\nSalary will be set so as to be market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies and taking account of the experience and seniority of the appointee coming into the new role. The Remuneration Committee is likely to set base salaries below median on appointment while retaining discretion to award increases during the first and, possibly, subsequent years to bring salaries into the normal range expected for Executive Directors, in line with the Company's stated policy. Such increases will not exceed the maximum level set out in the Policy Table. New Executive Directors will receive benefits and pensions in line with the Company's existing policy and will be able to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan on a pro rata basis for the portion of the financial year for which they are in post. The maximum level of variable pay for new recruits will be the same as that set out in the Policy Table for existing employees (pro rata as necessary).\n\nIn the case of an internal appointment or promotion, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out according to its original terms stipulated on grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.\n\nWhere it is appropriate to recruit, promote or transfer individuals to a different location of residence, the Remuneration Committee may also, to the extent it considers reasonable, approve the payment of one-off relocation and repatriation related expenses. It may also pay or make a contribution towards any legal fees appropriately incurred by the individual in connection with their employment by the Group.\n\n## Policy on loss of office\n\nOther than in circumstances of gross misconduct, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, leaving employment from the Group, will be entitled to receive salary and pro rata annual bonus based on performance to the date of leaving. Statutory entitlements are payable according to Mexican labour law, based on length of service. Employee and Company pension contributions are payable in accordance with the applicable pension plan rules. Mexican labour law does not make any provision for employers and employees to give or receive notice of termination of employment. Therefore, the Committee will not generally make payments in lieu of notice to departing executives. However, the Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation), or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director's office or employment or by way of contribution to legal fees appropriately incurred by the individual in connection with the termination of their employment by the Group. No contractual commitments concerning loss of office were entered into with any Director prior to 27 June 2012.\n\n## Annual bonus plan and policy on variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Company's policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company's core strategy is one of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group's operations through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is therefore made between short and long-term incentives.\n\nThe Company operates a single cash-based Annual Bonus Plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer as described in the Policy Table above. In the event of a change of control, the Remuneration Committee shall, in accordance with the Annual Bonus Plan rules, as amended from time to time and in its absolute discretion, determine whether and to what extent the annual bonus will vest and be paid early. The Committee may also decide that the bonus award will vest to a greater or lesser extent having regard to the Director's or the Group's performance or such other factors it may consider appropriate. The Remuneration Committee may decide that bonus awards will vest pro-rata to take account of early vesting or in full.\n\n## Recovery of bonus\n\nThe absence of long-term incentives and the operation of Mexican law makes it difficult to adopt clawback arrangements in order to recover bonuses that have already been paid. The Remuneration Committee has considered whether clawback provisions should be incorporated into the service agreement for the Chief Executive Officer. Given that the Company does not operate any remuneration plans with a timeframe of more than one year, the Remuneration Committee does not consider that there is much value in introducing clawback provisions into the contractual arrangements with the Chief Executive Officer at this stage. However, within this remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to apply malus to bonuses before they are paid where the KPI outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Company's financial performance or the Executive Director's personal performance during the year (or previous years). In this case a downward adjustment to the bonus payment would be applied.",

Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board.\n\n## Chairman and Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-Executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract with the Company; however, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' Letters of Appointment\n\nOn their initial appointment, each of the Non-Executive Directors sign a letter of appointment with the Company, for an initial period of three years. The letters of appointment of serving Non-Executive Directors are drafted in accordance with provision 18 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, thus obliging them to retire at each Annual General Meeting and be subject to annual re-election by shareholders to serve for a further term of one year. The amendments have been drafted such that renewed appointment will not necessitate a new letter of appointment.\n\nThe Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-Executive Director.\n\nEach Non-Executive Director is expected to commit a minimum of 14 days per year in fulfilling their duties as a Director of the Company. The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 A base fee of \u00a335,000 per annum is paid to each non-UK-based Non-Executive Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a whole.\n- \u00b7 There are no set fees for membership of any Board committees or for the chairmanship of the Board, other than as follows.\n- \u00b7 The UK-based Non-Executive Directors receive a higher fee, currently \u00a390,000 per annum, to reflect the additional time commitment that they make in order to travel to Board meetings in Mexico and for responsibilities as Committee members and, where appropriate, as Senior Independent Director and/or Chairman of any Committee.\n- \u00b7 When the Chairman of the Audit Committee is resident in Mexico, he/she will receive an additional fee of \u00a315,000 per annum.\n- \u00b7 Members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a35,000 per annum.\n\n## Shareholding guidelines\n\nFresnillo has not introduced share ownership guidelines. The Company does not operate share-based incentive arrangements given that the culture for incentives in the Mexican market does not favour share-based incentives. Consequently, there would be neither opportunity nor appetite for executives to build a shareholding in the Company and therefore the Remuneration Committee has not adopted any shareholding guidelines.\n\n## Payments under previous policies\n\nAny remuneration payment or benefit, or any payment for loss of office which a Director received or became entitled to under a previous remuneration policy or before the person became a Director (unless the payment was in consideration of becoming a Director) shall lawfully be paid out under this policy, even though it may not be consistent with, or otherwise provided for under, the Policy Table set out above.",

The Directors have elected to prepare the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with the UK-adopted International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') in conformity with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- \u00b7 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;\n- \u00b7 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Company and of the Group's financial position and financial performance;\n- \u00b7 state whether UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Company and the Group to continue as a going concern unless it is appropriate to presume that the Company and/or the Group will not continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's and Group's transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable UK law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and regulations. In addition, the Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nNeither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any person in relation to the annual financial report except to the extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.\n\n## Directors' Responsibility Statement under the UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nIn accordance with Provision 27 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary to enable shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Responsibility Statement of the Directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts\n\nEach of the Directors whose names are listed on pages 158-161 confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- a)  the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- b)  the annual report (including the Strategic Report encompassed within the 'Overview', 'Strategic Report', 'Performance' and 'Governance' sections) includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business, and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director 7 March 2022",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We confirmed our understanding of management's going concern assessment process and confirmed that the Group is not subject to financial covenants on its borrowings;\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's forecasting accuracy as reliable by comparing forecasts for the period ended 31 December 2021 to/uni00A0actuals and assessing the reasons for differences, including the effect of market-driven factors;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the completeness of the factors included in the going concern assessment by reference to our understanding of the business and the environment within which it operates;\n- \u00b7 We obtained management's going concern assessment, including the cash forecast for the going concern period which extends to December 2023. The Group has modelled plausible adverse changes and applied reverse stress testing in respect of prices to the forecast liquidity of the Group;\n- \u00b7 We have tested the factors and assumptions included in the base case and most severe adverse scenario for the cash forecast, in particular comparing forecast metals prices to analyst forecasts and comparing production forecasts to 2021 production, plant capacity and our understanding of the business and its future plans;\n- \u00b7 We considered the mitigating actions available to management, although these were not modelled due to the level of headroom in the plausible, adverse cases;\n- \u00b7 We have reviewed management's reverse stress testing in order to identify what reduction in metal prices, as the key variable input, would lead to the Group utilising all liquidity during the going concern period noting that these are well below the minimum analyst price forecast for the going concern period; and,\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in the annual report in order to assess that the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.",

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n| Audit scope       | \u00b7  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of seven components being the five operating mining units, the  Parent Company and the entity which holds the Silverstream contract. These components represented 100% of revenues,  100% of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 91% of profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects (Adjusted  Profit) and 89% of total assets. \u00b7  We performed specified procedures on certain balances at a further four components. These components represented 9%  of Adjusted Profit and 10% of total assets. \u00b7  \u00b7   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit matters | Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition Valuation of the Silverstream contract \u00b7  Recoverable amount of mining assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Materiality       | \u00b7  Overall Group materiality was set at US$24.0 million which represents 5% of average of profit before tax prior to Silverstream  revaluation effects and material non-recurring items over the last five years (Adjusted Normalised Profit).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## An overview of the scope of the Parent Company and Group audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each Company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group, changes in the business environment and other factors when assessing the level of work to be performed at each Company.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 16 reporting components of the Group, we selected 11 components covering entities within Mexico and Chile, which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nOf the 11 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of seven components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining four components ('specified procedures scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2020: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2020: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 100% (2020: 99%) of the Group's Adjusted Profit, and 99% (2020: 99%) of the Group's total assets.\n\nFor the current year, the full scope components contributed 100% (2020: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2020: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects, 91% (2020: 95%) of the Group's Adjusted Profit, and 89% (2020: 84%) of the Group's Total assets.\n\nThe specified procedures scope components contributed 9% (2020: 4%) of the Group's Adjusted Profit, and 10% (2020: 15%) of the Group's Total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.\n\nOf the remaining four components that together represent less than 1% (2020: 1%) of the Group's Adjusted Profit and less than 1% (2020: 1%) of the group's total assets, none are individually greater than 1% of the Group's profit before tax excluding Silverstream revaluation effects. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review and testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\n\nIn the current year we have updated our profit metric for coverage to align with the basis for determining materiality and we have restated comparatives.",

The component team performs certain supporting procedures regarding cash receipts, and the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles provides support in respect of procedures on the estimation of reserve and resource quantities and the related mine plan at the Sabinas mine.\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the seven full scope components, audit procedures were performed on two of these directly by the primary audit team. Of the four specified procedures scope components, the primary team performed audit procedures directly on one and for the other three specific scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nSenior members of the component team and the Pe\u00f1oles audit team attended our virtual global planning meetings during the planning phase of the audit, and we discussed the results of interim procedures and interacted regularly with the local team in Mexico. The primary engagement team is predominantly composed of Spanish speakers to further enhance our interactions with both the component team and management.\n\nBefore Covid-19 restrictions, the primary engagement team, including the Senior Statutory Auditor, visited Mexico at least four times during the audit, during both the planning and execution phases, with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico for a number of weeks over several visits. These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach, consideration of significant accounting and auditing issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers, meeting with management and attending closing meetings.\n\n## Effect of Covid-19\n\nAs in the prior year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, interactions with our component team and meetings with management continued to be held virtually through the use of video or teleconferencing facilities. We held weekly status calls with the component team throughout the duration of the execution phase of the audit which allowed for the provision of timely feedback and observations as well as effective oversight. The review of relevant audit work papers was facilitated by the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or the provision of copies of work papers direct to the Group audit team.\n\nThe primary team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. For certain procedures, in particular areas involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the component team. In other cases, we reviewed key working papers and discussed these with the component team.\n\nBased upon the above approach we are satisfied that we have been able to perform sufficient and appropriate oversight of our component team and the work performed by the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles relevant to our audit. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact Fresnillo plc. The Group has determined that the most significant adverse future impacts from climate change on its operations are likely to be from decarbonisation targets, carbon pricing, stringent regulations and investment trends, water availability, higher temperatures, and extreme events. These are explained on pages 88-98 in the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 140-141 in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part of the 'Other information' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nAs explained in note 2(a) to the Group and Parent Company financial statements, governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change have been described in note 2(c).\n\nOur audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 140-141 have been appropriately considered in the assessment of indicators of impairment of long-term non-financial assets and the timing and quantum of future cash flows underpinning the provision of mine closure costs and associated disclosures. We also considered whether other assets and liabilities were susceptible to material changes in measurement as a result of climate risks and opportunities. Details of our procedures and findings on the assessment of impairment indicators are included in our key audit matters below where relevant. We also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter: Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition \uf0a2\n\n- \u00b7 All of the Group's current year revenue from the sale of goods, being concentrates, dor\u00e9, activated carbon, slag and precipitates, excluding hedging, (US$2,704.4 million; 2020: US$2,427.7 million), and a significant amount of its expenses incurred (US$166.8 million; 2020: US$144.6 million), arise from transactions with related parties. The Silverstream contract is also with a related party. These related parties are principally subsidiaries of the group's direct parent, Industrias Pe\u00f1oles (Pe\u00f1oles).\n- \u00b7 Principal transactions include the sale of goods to the Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles refinery, administrative services received and the Silverstream contract.\n- \u00b7 There is a risk that, if not at arm's length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period, such transactions could be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Group's parent.\n- \u00b7 There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cut-off or inappropriate measurement of product sold.\n- \u00b7 There is an ongoing focus by the Mexican tax authorities on transfer pricing as reflected by recently concluded and on-going tax inspections. There is therefore the potential risk of tax exposures arising from related party transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\nRelated party transactions are disclosed in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues in Note 4 and relevant accounting policies in Note 2.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These assumptions require management judgement and estimation.\n- \u00b7 The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in future silver prices and the discount rate applied which may result in material revaluation effects in the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\nThe nature of the Silverstream contract and related valuation considerations are disclosed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in Note 2.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over the valuation of the Silverstream contract at 31 December 2021 and related income statement revaluation effects. Consistent with 2020, these procedures covered 100% of the risk amount.\n\nValuation model\n\nReserves and resources and production profile of the Sabinas mine\n\nKey economic assumptions in the valuation\n\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with our valuation specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation approach and related model used by the Company to determine the fair value of the Silverstream contract under accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 We considered whether the valuation model required changes related to climate-related risks.\n- \u00b7 We interviewed the Sabinas mine geologist in order to understand the assumptions used in the estimation of reserves and resources and movements in the estimation in the year.\n- \u00b7 We interviewed management in financial and operational areas in respect of their review of the Sabinas mine plan prepared by Pe\u00f1oles, focusing on the comparisons between the current year plan and the 2020 plan.\n- \u00b7 We confirmed that the appropriate members of the Sabinas mine planning team were involved in the preparation of the mine plan underpinning the Silverstream valuation.\n- \u00b7 Controls over the development of the mine plan are our primary source of assurance in this respect. We therefore issued instructions to the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles to perform procedures and report to us in respect of the reserves and resources estimate and the mine plan of the Sabinas mine. These procedures detailed in the instructions included:\n\n-\n\nconducting walkthroughs to confirm our understanding of Pe\u00f1oles management's processes to estimate quantities of\n\nreserves and resources and to develop the Sabinas mine plan;\n\n- -testing of certain key Pe\u00f1oles controls which address the risks associated with the estimation of reserves and resources quantities and the accuracy of the resulting mine plan;\n- -gaining an understanding of reasons for changes in estimates of reserves and resources in the year;\n- -assessing the professional competence, capabilities and objectivity of the Sabinas mine geologist involved in the estimation of reserves and resources quantities; and\n- -evaluating the reasonableness and appropriateness of inputs to the reserves and resources estimates and Sabinas mine plan used at 31 December 2021, by reference to external market and internal operational benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 We discussed the results of the above procedures with the auditor of Pe\u00f1oles and reviewed their key working papers.\n- \u00b7 With assistance from our valuation specialists, we challenged key economic assumptions in the valuation, including future silver prices and the discount rate applied.\n- \u00b7 This included comparison to market data to consider the appropriateness of silver price and discount rate assumptions when considered together in the valuation model and analysis of the consistency of assumptions to other accounting estimates, such as recoverable amounts of mining assets.\n- \u00b7 We performed sensitivity analysis on the combination of silver price assumptions and discount rate.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 We noted that the valuation model is consistent in its methodology with that used in prior periods and we consider this appropriate for the nature of this long-term derivative contract.\n- \u00b7 Our procedures confirmed that the mine plan underpinning the valuation was estimated in an appropriate way.\n- \u00b7 We highlighted the sensitivity of the valuation to economic input assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that the overall valuation of the contract is appropriate.",

We specifically discussed how the Covid-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions impacted their audit procedures. We also discussed the potential impact of climate related matters on the estimates.\n- \u00b7 We read the reports prepared by the Reserves and Resources Specialists, gained an understanding of the changes in reserves and resources estimates in the year and considered their observations on the Group's reserve and resource estimation process insofar as they affect the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 We engaged our own specialist (geologist) to evaluate the information provided by the Reserves and Resources specialists.\n- \u00b7 We discussed directly with the Reserves and Resources specialists the results of their reports.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the Reserves and Resources Specialists as appropriate specialists engaged by management for the purposes of auditing the reserves and resources of the group.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that there are no indicators of impairment and therefore the carrying values of mining assets are recoverable at 31 December 2021.\n- \u00b7 We concluded that the sensitivity disclosures in the financial statements are appropriate given the limited headroom for certain assets.",

Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be US$24.0 million (2020: US$22.0 million), which is 5% (2020: 5%) of the five-year average profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects, adjusted for any material one-off transactions ('adjusted normalised profit'). At planning, we use forecast profit figures to estimate 2021. We believe this measure of profit represents one of the main considerations for members of the Group, particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects are principally non-cash in nature and one-off transactions are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the business.\n\nAlthough there can be no certainty over future levels of profitability, we have concluded that, solely for the purposes of determining materiality, there are sufficient indicators to normalise the basis for determining materiality using the average of that for the last five years, which is in line with the Directors' viability assessment period. An illustration of our approach to normalising basis profit is set out below, with profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects as the starting point.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Adjusted profit used in materiality calculation\n\nExcluded one-off expense\n\n- Excluded one-off income\n\nFive-year average\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US$65.4 million (2020: US$53.6 million) which is 1% (2020: 1%) of equity. The materiality of the Parent Company is higher than that of the Group, reflective of the Parent Company's primary role being that of a holding company.",

It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2020: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$18 million (2020: US$16.5 million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to the level of past history of misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control environment.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.\n\nAssigned performance materiality increased in respect of the majority of components, reflecting the overall performance of the Group. Where assigned performance materiality decreased, this represents the changes in the relative contribution of profit of that component.\n\nReflecting the fact that dividends are a key focus for shareholders and that the dividends are derived from the operating results of the Group, we apply Group materiality to our procedures around dividends, including distributable reserves.\n\nKey audit matters:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of US$1.2 million (2020: US$1.1 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements and those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n- \u00b7 the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA Rules), is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and\n- \u00b7 information about the company's corporate governance statement and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the FCA Rules.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those related to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards and Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), regulations impacting mining operations including mining laws, environmental and labour regulations and tax and employee profit-sharing requirements in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 We understood how Fresnillo plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries to management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included using data analytics to test manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error. In the current year, forensic specialists reviewed our fraud risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved enquiries of Group management and those charged with governance, legal counsel, internal audit, and the risk and compliance departments; journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and those indicating large or unusual journals based on our understanding of the business; and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management in respect of significant accounting estimates. Where observations are raised about management's process or controls surrounding compliance with laws and regulations by us or others, we consider the potential effect of those observations.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the Company on 4 May 2016 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 14 years, covering the years ending 2008 to 2021.\n- \u00b7 The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Steven Dobson\n\n(Senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London 8 March 2022",

('the Company') is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5 of the Parent Company accounts ('the Group').\n\nIndustrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. ('Pe\u00f1oles') currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baill\u00e8res family, whose beneficial interest is held through Pe\u00f1oles. The registered address of Pe\u00f1oles is Calzada Legaria 549, Mexico City 11250. Copies of Pe\u00f1oles' accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related party balances and transactions with Pe\u00f1oles group companies is disclosed in note 26.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 7 March 2022.\n\nThe Group's principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related production. The primary contents of/uni00A0 this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in note 3.\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a) Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance\n\n## Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for trade receivables, derivative financial instruments, equity securities, investment in funds and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to/uni00A0the/uni00A0nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements set out the Group's financial position as of 31 December 2021 and 2020, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended.\n\nEntities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\nAll intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to/uni00A0 the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. The interest of noncontrolling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any/uni00A0losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions - that is, a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interest are also recorded in equity.\n\n## (b) Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Group\n\nA number of new or amended standards (the Standards) became applicable for the current reporting period. The adoption of these Standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective\n\nThe IASB has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the, financial position or performance of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and/uni00A0assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in/uni00A0the/uni00A0consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to/uni00A0the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Judgements\n\nAreas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 are:\n\nRecognition and classification of assets at Soledad-Dipolos mine:\n\nIn 2009, five members of the El Bajio agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont ('Penmont'), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, with which Penmont complied by vacating 1,824 hectares of land, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. Whilst the claim and the definitive court order did not affect the group's legal title over the mining concession or the ore currently held in leaching pads near the mine site, land access at the mine site is required to further exploit the concession at Soledad-Dipolos.\n\nPenmont is the legal and registered owner of the land where the leaching pads are located but has not yet been able to gain physical access to these pads due to opposition by certain local individuals. The Group has a reasonable expectation that Penmont will eventually regain access to the SoledadDipolos assets and process the ore content in the Soledad-Dipolos leaching pads. This expectation considers different scenarios, including but not limited to the different legal proceedings that Minera Penmont has presented in order to regain access to the lands, which proceedings are pending final resolution. Therefore, the Group continues to recognise property, plant and equipment and inventory related to Soledad-Dipolos, as disclosed in note 12 and note 14, respectively. Due to the fact that it is not yet certain when access may be granted so that the inventory can be processed, this inventory is classified as a non-current asset.\n\nAs previously reported by the Group, claimants from the El Baj\u00edo community also presented claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels other than the surface land where Soledad-Dipolos is located. Penmont has had no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. The Agrarian Court has issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont's occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to final conclusion. However, given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or had specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingencies relating to such land parcels are not considered material by the Group. There are no material assets recognised in respect of these land parcels at 31 December 2021 or 31 December 2020.\n\n## Layback Agreement:\n\nIn December 2020, the Group entered into multiple contracts with Orla Mining Ltd. and its Mexican Subsidiary, Minera Camino Rojo, S.A. de C.V. (together herein referred to as 'Orla'), granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo oxide pit onto Fresnillo's 'Guachichil D1' mineral concession. Based on the terms of the contracts, the Group will transfer the legal rights to access and mine the mineral concession to Orla.\n\nDue to the fact that the contracts were negotiated together, the Group has considered the layback contracts as a single agreement (Layback Agreement) for the purpose of determining the accounting implications of the transaction. The Group determined that the transaction should be accounted for as the sale of a single intangible asset. As such, it is relevant to consider the point at which control transfers in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 regarding when a performance obligation is satisfied and in light of the continuing performance obligations on the part of the Group.\n\nThe effectiveness of the agreement was subject to the approval of the Mexican Federal Competition Commission (COFECE), which was granted in February 2021. The consideration includes three payments: US$25.0 million that was paid upon the approval of COFECE, US$15.0 million that will be paid no later than 1 December 2022, US$22.8 million no later than 1 December 2023. The future amounts due bear interest at an annual rate of 5%. Upon notification of approval by COFECE, the Group recognised the fair value of consideration set out in the contract (US$67.2 million, being the cash flows set out above discounted at the risk-free rate).\n\nAs set out in the Layback Agreement, as at 31 December 2021 the Group continues to provide support to Orla in respect of other negotiations relevant to their acquisition of the rights to access from the local ejido, thus the Company has recognised the total value of the agreement as deferred income. Based on the expected time of complete the transfer of control of the asset, the Company the deferred income is classified as current.\n\nThe ongoing support does not affect the Group's contractual right to the future payments set out above. The amount receivable as at 31 December 2021 amounts to US$40.6 million, of which US$16.7 million is current and US$23.9 million is non-current.",

        "page_content": "## Juanicipio project:\n\nDuring 2021 Juanicipio has turned from construction to commissioning activities and continues processing mineralised material from development through plants at Fresnillo and Saucito Juanicipio has extended its commissioning period mainly derived from delays in key services such as the power to the plant facilities. As of 31 December 2021, the Group has evaluated the status of Juanicipio for accounting implications and has concluded that it continues in a development stage.\n\n## Climate change:\n\nIn the climate disclosure in the Strategic Report, the Group's set out its assessment of climate risks and opportunities (CROs). The Group recognises that there may be potential financial statement implications in the future in respect of the mitigation and adaptation measures to the physical and transition risks. The potential effect of climate change would be in respect of assets and liabilities that are measured based on an estimate of future cash flows. The group specifically considered the effect of climate change on the valuation of property, plant and equipment, deferred tax assets, the Silverstream contract, and the provision for mine closure cost. The Group does not have any assets or liabilities for which measurement is directly linked to climate change performance (for example: Sustainability-Linked Bonds).\n\nThe main ways in which climate has affected the preparation of the financial statements are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has already made certain climate-related strategic decisions, such as to focus on decarbonisation and to increase wind energy. Where decisions have been approved by the Board, the effects were considered in the preparation of these financial statements by way of inclusion in future cash flow projections underpinning the estimation of the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and deferred tax assets, as relevant.\n- \u00b7 As described in Note 13, the costs inherent in the Silverstream contract are determined based on the provisions of that contract. This reduces the exposure of the valuation of the asset to the effect of any cost implications related to CROs.\n- \u00b7 Further information about the potential effect of CROs on the provision for mine closure cost is set out in Note 20.\n\nThe Group's strategy consists of mitigation and adaptation measures. To mitigate the impacts by and on climate change the company relies on renewable electricity, fuel replacement and efficiency opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint. The approach to adaptation measures is based on climate models to produce actionable information for the design, construction, operation and closure of its mining assets, considering climate change. Future changes to the Group's climate change strategy or global decarbonisation signposts may impact the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in future reporting periods. However, as at the balance sheet date the Group believes there is no material impact on balance sheet carrying values of assets or liabilities. Although this is an estimate, it is not considered a critical estimate.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions\n\nSignificant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include:\n\nEstimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2(e):\n\nOre reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group's mining properties; mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body, estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs.\n\nAs additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, the economic assumptions used and the estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group's reported balance sheet and income statement including:\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in the recoverable amount, which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources;\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the unit-of-production method based on ore reserves;\n- \u00b7 Stripping costs capitalised in the balance sheet, either as part of mine properties or inventory, or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios;\n- \u00b7 Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur;\n- \u00b7 The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Estimate of recoverable ore on leaching pads\n\nIn the Group's open pit mines, certain mined ore is placed on leaching pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold and enable extraction. The determination of the amount of recoverable gold requires estimation with consideration of the quantities of ore placed on the pads, the grade of the ore (based on assay data) and the estimated recovery percentage (based on metallurgical studies and current technology).\n\nThe grades of ore placed on pads are regularly compared to the quantities of metal recovered through the leaching process to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimated recovery (metallurgical balancing). The Group monitors the results of the metallurgical balancing process and recovery estimates are refined based on actual results over time and when new information becomes available. Any potential future adjustment would be applicable from the point of re-estimation and would not by itself change the value of inventory and as such no sensitivity included.\n\n## \u00b7 Silverstream, note 13:\n\nThe valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires estimation by management. The term of the derivative is based on the Sabinas life of mine and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources and future production profile of the Sabinas mine on the same basis a market participant would consider, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. For further detail on the/uni00A0inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 30. The impact of changes in silver price assumptions and the discount rate is included in note 30. Management considers that an appropriate sensitivity for volumes produced and sold is on the total recoverable reserve and resource quantities over the contract term rather than annual production volumes over the mine life. A reasonably possible change in total recoverable resources and reserves quantities would not result in a significant change in the value of the contract.\n\n## \u00b7 Income tax, notes 2 (q) and 10:\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, requires management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to/uni00A0utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of/uni00A0existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the balance sheet date could be impacted.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak developed rapidly in 2020, with a significant number of infections around the world. The development and fluidity of the situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact of Covid-19; however, the Group seeks to obtain the best possible information to enable the assessment of the risks involved and implement appropriate measures to respond.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group continues to apply measures to safeguard the health of its employees and their local communities while continuing to operate safely and responsibly. During 2021 operations have not been suspended, all mines have operated at normal production capacity. The Group incurred in other production costs of US$4.7 million (2020: US$4.5 million) resulting from Covid-19 which include community support, the acquisition of additional personal protective equipment and other safety measures and are presented in cost of sales.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, attempts at containment of Covid-19 have resulted in decreased economic activity, which has adversely affected the broader global economy. In the current environment, assumptions about future commodity prices, exchange rates, and interest rates are subject to greater variability than normal, which could in the future affect the valuation of the Group's assets and liabilities, both financial and non-financial. As at 31 December 2021 and 2020, there were no material changes to the valuation of the Group's asset and liabilities due to Covid-19.\n\n## (d) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Parent Company's functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the/uni00A0transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.\n\nFor entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.",

Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.\n\nThe cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item's estimated useful life has/uni00A0been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process (except mobile equipment) or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset that are not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect UOP calculations, are accounted for/uni00A0prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe average expected useful lives are as follows:\n\n|                                           |   Years |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Buildings                                 |       8 |\n| Plant and equipment                       |      10 |\n| Mining properties and development costs 1 |       8 |\n| Other assets                              |       4 |\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising at derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of/uni00A0the/uni00A0asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is derecognised.\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale.\n\n## Disposal of assets\n\nGains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.\n\n## Mining properties and development costs\n\nPayments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when/uni00A0incurred.\n\nPurchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of/uni00A0a/uni00A0business combination.\n\nMining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession.\n\nMine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has/uni00A0been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost.\n\nThe initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The Group cease the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for its intended use.\n\nOre generated as part of the development stage may be processed and sold, giving rise to revenue before the commencement of commercial production. Where such processing is necessary to bring mining assets into the condition required for their intended use (for example, in testing the plants at the mining unit in development), revenues from metals recovered from such activities are credited to mining properties and development costs. When the processing does not contribute to bringing the mining assets into the condition required for their intended use (for example, when the processing of the ore extracted is supported by assets outside of the development project), the revenue is considered as incidental and it is recognised in profit or loss. In the latter case, cost of sales is measured based on expected operating cost once commercial production has been initiated.\n\nUpon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the UOP method based on the estimated economically proven and probable reserves to which they relate.\n\nMining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any.",

The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated.\n\n## Subsequent expenditures\n\nAll subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts/uni00A0that are replaced, is derecognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement/uni00A0as/uni00A0incurred.\n\n## Stripping costs\n\nIn a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine's units of production once commercial operations begin.\n\nRemoval of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. At the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping.\n\nProduction stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 It is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group;\n- \u00b7 The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved; and\n- \u00b7 The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nIf not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nStripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as 'component stripping ratio', which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the units of production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated as new information of reserves and resources is available. Depreciation is recognised as cost of sales in the income statement.\n\nThe capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment, if any. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset.\n\n## (f) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. If there are indicators of/uni00A0impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of/uni00A0assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## The recoverable amount of an asset\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The cash flows used to determine the recoverable amount of mining assets are based on the mine plan for each mine. The mine plan is determined based on the estimated and economically proven and probable reserves, as well as certain other resources that are assessed as highly likely to be converted into reserves. Fair value less cost of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group's cash generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\n\n## Reversal of impairment\n\nAn assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement.",

For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the/uni00A0asset.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in one of the following categories.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at fair value through profit and loss).\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss. As at 31 December 2021 and 2020 there were no such instruments.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Group elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables and derivative financial instruments, including the Silverstream contract, are classified as fair value through profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at FVPL), the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n- \u00b7 All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings.\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as financial liabilities as amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories\n\nFinished goods, work in progress and ore stockpile inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs.\n\nFor this purpose, the costs of production include:\n\n- \u00b7 personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing;\n- \u00b7 materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore;\n- \u00b7 the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and\n- \u00b7 related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity).\n\nWork in progress inventory comprises ore in leaching pads as processing is required to extract benefit from the ore. The recovery of gold is achieved through the heap leaching process. The leaching process may take months to obtain the expected metal recovery and mainly depends on the continuity of the leaching process. When the ore in leaching pads is in active leaching, it is classified as current. When the leaching process has stopped and not expected to restart within twelve months, ore in the leaching pads affected is classified as non-current.\n\nOperating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.\n\n## (i) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.",

        "page_content": "## (j) Provisions\n\n## Mine closure cost\n\nA provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## (k) Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates the following plans for its employees based in Mexico:\n\n## Defined benefit pension plan\n\nThis funded plan is based on each employee's earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).\n\nThe present value of defined benefit obligations under the plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by/uni00A0an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\nPast service costs are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs and when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.\n\nThe defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the/uni00A0obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of/uni00A0refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.\n\nNet interest cost is recognised in finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\n## Defined contribution pension plan\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee's salary.\n\nThis plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.\n\n## Seniority premium for voluntary separation\n\nThis unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for/uni00A0those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to/uni00A0a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or/uni00A0expense in the period in which they occur.\n\n## Other\n\nBenefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.\n\nTermination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred.\n\n## (l) Employee profit sharing\n\nIn accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing ('PTU') equivalent to 10% of the taxable income of each fiscal year capped to three months of salary or average of the profit sharing paid the last three years.\n\nPTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is deductible for income tax purposes.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (m) Leases\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 restoration costs.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment.\n\n## (n) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of goods or services transfers to the customer based on the performance obligations settle in the contracts with customers.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue associated with the sale of concentrates, precipitates, dor\u00e9 bars and activated carbon (the products) is recognised when control of the asset sold is transferred to the customer. Indicators of control transferring include an unconditional obligation to pay, legal title, physical possession, transfer of risk and rewards and customer acceptance. This generally occurs when the goods are delivered to the customer's smelter or refinery agreed with the buyer; at which point the buyer controls the goods. Inventory in transit to the smelter or refinery does not represent a significant proportion of total revenue at the end of the reporting period given the distance to the mine units.\n\nThe revenue is measured at the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled, being the estimate of the price expected to be received in the expected month of settlement and the Group's estimate of metal quantities based on assay data, and a corresponding trade receivable is recognised. Any future changes that occur before settlement are embedded within the provisionally priced trade receivables and are, therefore, within the scope of IFRS 9 and not within the scope of IFRS 15.\n\nGiven the exposure to the commodity price, these provisionally priced trade receivables will fail the cash flow characteristics test within IFRS 9 and will be required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss up from initial recognition and until the date of settlement. These subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in revenue but separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nRefining and treatment charges under the sales contracts are deducted from revenue from sales of concentrates as these are not related to a distinct good or service.",

        "page_content": "## (o) Exploration expenses\n\nExploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of/uni00A0an identified resource.\n\nExploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions:\n\n- \u00b7 Cost of sales: costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life, and\n- \u00b7 Exploration expenses:\n- -Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves, and\n- -Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits in Mexico and Latin America and which are identified by/uni00A0project. Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project from which time further expenses are capitalised as exploration costs on balance sheet as Property, plant and equipment.\n\n## (p) Selling expenses\n\nThe Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are recognised. The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax.\n\nThe Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted and sold during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) in the San Juli\u00e1n mine. The premium is settled to SGM on a quarterly basis.\n\n## (q) Taxation\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and/uni00A0liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing/uni00A0of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the/uni00A0extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and/uni00A0taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that/uni00A0sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Mining rights\n\nThe Special Mining Right is considered an income tax under IFRS and states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities (see note 10 (e)). The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (see note 10).\n\n## Sales tax\n\nExpenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except:\n\n- \u00b7 When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable;\n- \u00b7 When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n## (r) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions.\n\nSuch derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months.\n\nAny gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the/uni00A0income statement as finance income or finance cost respectively.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black-Scholes and net present value) applicable to the specific type of/uni00A0derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for/uni00A0contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange options are valued using the Black-Scholes model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a net present value valuation approach.\n\nThe documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 There is an 'economic relationship' between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n- \u00b7 The effect of credit risk does not 'dominate the value changes' that result from that economic relationship.\n- \u00b7 The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nHedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as/uni00A0when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a/uni00A0non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nWhen hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. In such cases, changes in the time value of options are initially recognised in OCI as a cost of hedging. Where the hedged item is transaction related, amounts initially recognised in OCI related to the change in the time value of options are reclassified to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedged item that realises over time, the amounts initially recognised in OCI are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\nWhen hedging with forward contracts, the forward element is included in the designation of the financial instrument. Therefore, there is no cost of hedging in relation to forward contracts.",

        "page_content": "## (s) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n\nWhere funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## (t) Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 29 and 30.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 29.\n\n## (u) Dividend distribution\n\nDividends payable to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company's shareholders or Board as/uni00A0appropriate. Dividends payable to minority shareholders are recognised as a liability when these are approved by the Company's subsidiaries.",

Segment reporting\n\nFor management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group has seven reportable operating segments as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Fresnillo mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 The Saucito mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 The Ci\u00e9nega mine, located in the state of Durango, an underground gold mine;\n- \u00b7 The Herradura mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;\n- \u00b7 The Noche Buena mine, located in state of Sonora, a surface gold mine; and\n- \u00b7 The San Juli\u00e1n mine, located on the border of Chihuahua/Durango states, an underground silver-gold mine.\n\nThe operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group's chief operating decision maker does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information.\n\nManagement monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in Revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within Cost of sales and Gross profit which are considered to be outside of the control of/uni00A0the operating management of the mines. The table below provides a reconciliation from segment profit to Gross profit as per the consolidated income statement. Other income and expenses included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm's length basis similar to transactions with third parties.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico.\n\n## Operating segments\n\nThe following tables present revenue and profit information regarding the Group's operating segments for the year ended 31 December 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenues for the year ended 31 December 2021 and 2020 include those derived from contracts with costumers and other revenues, as showed in note 4.\n\n|                                          | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021   | Year ended 31 December 2021    | Year ended 31 December 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| US$ thousands                            | Fresnillo                     | Herradura                     | Ci\u00e9nega                       | Saucito                       | Noche Buena                   | San Juli\u00e1n                    | Other 4                       | Adjustments  and  eliminations | Total                         |\n| Revenues:                                |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                                |                               |\n| Third party 1                            | 493,582                       | 769,896                       | 215,623                       | 547,294                       | 168,849                       | 509,247                       |                               |                                | (1,396) 2,703,095             |\n| Inter-Segment                            |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               | 147,727                       | (147,727)                      | -                             |\n| Segment revenues                         | 493,582                       | 769,896                       | 215,623                       | 547,294                       | 168,849                       | 509,247                       | 147,727                       |                                | (149,123) 2,703,095           |\n| Segment profit 2                         | 224,558                       | 285,354                       | 106,498                       | 321,349                       | 77,158                        | 322,734                       | 144,006                       |                                | (4,800) 1,476,857             |\n| Foreign exchange hedging losses          |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                                | 3,827                         |\n| Depreciation and amortisation 3          |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                                | (528,206)                     |\n| Employee profit sharing                  |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                                | (15,553)                      |\n| Gross profit as per the income statement |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                               |                                | 936,925                       |\n| Capital expenditure 3                    | 108,335                       | 54,371                        | 45,392                        | 101,160                       | 381                           | 40,922                        | 241,491                       | -                              | 592,052                       |\n\n- 4 Other inter-segment revenue corresponds to leasing services provided by Minera Bermejal, S.A. de C.V and incidental ore sales from Juanicipio development project to Fresnillo; capital expenditure mainly corresponds to Minera Juanicipio S.A de C.V. and Minera Bermejal, S. de R.L. de C.V.",

If not utilised, US$30.6 million (2020: US$12.7 million) will expire within five years and US$279.9 million (2020: US$235.7 million) will expire between six and ten years. Of the total deferred tax asset related to losses, US$35.7 million is covered by the existence of taxable temporary differences, the remaining US$49.9 million corresponds to Fresnillo plc which maintained a deferred net asset position. The Group has conducted a feasible tax planning that will allow applied the tax losses before its expiration.\n\nThe Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$72.6 million (2020: US$64.6 million) on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. Based on the applicable tax legislation the tax losses are not subject to expire.\n\n## (d) Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences is expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,056 million (2020: US$1,797 million).",

Income tax expense continued\n\n## (e) Corporate Income Tax ('Impuesto Sobre la Renta' or 'ISR') and Special Mining Right ('SMR')\n\nThe Group's principal operating subsidiaries are Mexican residents for taxation purposes. The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%.\n\nOn 30 December 2018, the Decree of tax incentives for the northern border region of Mexico was published in the Official Gazette, which provided a reduction of income tax by a third and also a reduction of 50% of the value added tax rate, for taxpayers that produce income from business activities carried out within the northern border region. The tax incentives were applicable since 1 January 2019 and remain in force until 31 December 2020. On 30 December 2020 and extension of the Decree was published in the Official Gazette which remain in force until 31 December 2024. Some of the Group companies which produce income from business activities carried out within Caborca, Sonora, which is considered for purposes of the Decree as northern border region, applied for this Decree tax incentives before the Mexican tax authorities, and were granted authorisation for income tax and value added tax purposes.\n\nThe special mining right 'SMR' states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities and is considered as income tax under IFRS. For the fiscal year 2021 the SMR allows as a credit the 50% of payment of mining concessions rights up to the amount of SMR payable within the same legal entity. The 7.5% tax applies to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended 31 December 2021, the Group credited US$11.5 million (2020: US$21.3 million) of mining concession rights against the SMR. Total mining concessions rights paid during the year were US$22.9 million (2020: US$21.3 million) and have been recognised in the income statement within cost of sales and exploration expenses. Mining concessions rights paid in excess of the SMR cannot be credited to SMR in future fiscal periods, and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in relation to the excess. Without regards to credits permitted under the SMR/uni00A0regime, the current special mining right charge would have been US$64.6 million (2020: US$46.1 million).\n\n## 11. Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share ('EPS') is calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period.\n\nThe Company has no dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021 and 2020, earnings per share have been calculated as follows:\n\n|                                                                                          | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                                          | 2021  US$ thousands      | 2020  US$ thousands      |\n| Earnings:                                                                                |                          |                          |\n| Profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company          | 421,473                  | 374,124                  |\n| Adjusted profit from continuing operations attributable to equity holders of the Company | 421,764                  | 324,451                  |\n\nAdjusted profit is profit as disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement adjusted to exclude revaluation effects of the Silverstream contract of US$0.04 million loss (US$0.03 million net of tax) (2020: US$71.0 million gain (US$49.7 million net of tax)).\n\nAdjusted earnings per share have been provided in order to provide a measure of the underlying performance of the Group, prior to the revaluation effects of the Silverstream contract, a derivative financial instrument.\n\n|                                                                                   | 2021  thousands   | 2020  thousands   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Number of shares:                                                                 |                   |                   |\n| Weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue                               | 736,894           | 736,894           |\n|                                                                                   | 2021  US$         | 2020  US$         |\n| Earnings per share:                                                               |                   |                   |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share                                              | 0.572             | 0.507             |\n| Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per Ordinary Share from continuing operations | 0.572             | 0.440             |",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nManagement considers that the models supporting the carrying amounts of mining assets are most sensitive to commodity price assumptions. Management has considered whether a reasonably possible change in prices could lead to impairment and concluded that it would not.\n\n## 13. Silverstream contract\n\nOn 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Pe\u00f1oles through which it is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Pe\u00f1oles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine ('Sabinas'), a base metals mine owned and operated by the Pe\u00f1oles Group, for an upfront payment of US$350 million. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of $2.00 in years one to five and $5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment that commenced from 31 December 2013) is payable to Pe\u00f1oles. The cash payment per ounce for the year ended 31 December 2021 was $ 5.43 per ounce (2020: $5.37 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Pe\u00f1oles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Pe\u00f1oles of US$1 per ounce of shortfall. At 31 December 2021 the weighted average discount rate applied for the purposes of the valuation model was 7.92% (2020: 7.43%).\n\nThe Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at FVPL and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas life of mine which is currently 28 years. Changes in the contract's fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2021 total proceeds received in cash were US$49.0 million (2020: US$33.7 million) of which, US$4.8/uni00A0million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2020 (2020: US$7.6 million). Cash received in respect of the year of US$41.3 million (2020:/uni00A0US$28.4 million) corresponds to 2.4 million ounces of payable silver (2020: 2.3 million ounces). As at 31 December 2021, a further US$4.8 million (2020: US$7.6 million) of cash receivable corresponding to 274,237 ounces of silver is due (2020: 362,295 ounces).\n\nThe US$0.4 million unrealised loss recorded in the income statement (31 Dec 2020: US$71.0 million gain) resulted mainly from the decrease in the forward silver price curve, increase in the LIBOR reference rate and an update in a new production mine plan. These effects were compensated by the amortisation effects and higher inflation forecasts.\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance is shown below:\n\n|                                                          | 2021  US$ thousands   | 2020  US$ thousands   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                                     | 576,140               | 541,254               |\n| Cash received in respect of the year                     | (41,338)              | (28,427)              |\n| Cash receivable                                          | (4,842)               | (7,648)               |\n| Remeasurement (loss)/gains recognised in profit and loss | (416)                 | 70,961                |\n| Balance at 31 December                                   | 529,544               | 576,140               |\n| Less - Current portion                                   | 35,152                | 41,443                |\n| Non-current portion                                      | 494,392               | 534,697               |\n\nSee note 29 for further information on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, see note 30 for further information relating to market and credit risks associated with the Silverstream asset.\n\n## 14.

There are no restrictions on the transfer of the Ordinary Shares.\n\nThe Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares only entitle the shareholder on winding up or on a return of capital to payment of the amount paid up after repayment to Ordinary Shareholders. The Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares at/uni00A0a price of \u00a31.00 or, as custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares. Except at the option of the Company, the Sterling Deferred Ordinary Shares are not transferable.\n\n## Reserves\n\n## Share premium\n\nThis reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value.\n\n## Capital reserve\n\nThe capital reserve arose as a consequence of the Pre-IPO Reorganisation as a result of using the pooling of interest method.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThis reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge, net of tax. When the hedged transaction occurs, the gain or the loss is transferred out of equity to the income statement or the value of other assets.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe changes in the time value of option contracts are accumulated in the costs of hedging reserve. These deferred costs of hedging are either reclassified to profit or loss or recognised as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedge item that realises over time, amortised on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\n## Fair value reserve of financial assets at FVOCI\n\nThe Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in OCI, as explained in note 2(g). These changes are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. The Group transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of entities with a functional currency different to that of the presentational currency of the Group.\n\n## Retained earnings/accumulated losses\n\nThis reserve records the accumulated results of the Group, less any distributions and dividends paid.",

Dividends paid from the profits generated from 1 January 2014 to residents in Mexico and to non-resident shareholders may be subject to an additional tax of up to 10%, which will be withheld by the Group.\n\nIn late 2019, the Directors became aware of a technical breach of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) whereby certain dividends paid between 2011 and 2019 (the 'Historic Dividends') had been made without having filed interim accounts in accordance with the Act. The relevant interim accounts have now been filed with the Registrar of Companies and these show that the Company had sufficient distributable reserves at the point at which each of the Historic Dividends was paid. It is the intention of the Directors, as a matter of prudency, to put forward a resolution to shareholders in due course to regularise the position. This decision will have no effect on the monies received pursuant to these dividends and will not adversely impact shareholders or the Company. Nevertheless, the Directors will keep the matter under review.\n\n## 19. Interest-bearing loans\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nOn 29 September 2020, the Group repurchased certain of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023 that had a carrying value of US$482.1 million for consideration of US$543.0 million. Additional accrued interest at the date of the repurchase included in the settlement amounted US$10.8 million. The premium paid on purchase of these notes of US$60.9 million was recognised in financial expenses. The settlement occurred on 2 October 2020.\n\nOn 2 October 2020, the Group completed its offering of US$850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\n|                                                | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                | 2021  US$ thousands | 2020 US$ thousands  |\n| Opening balance                                | 1,156,670           | 801,239             |\n| Issuance of 4.250% senior notes due 2050 1     | -                   | 828,325             |\n| Repayments of 5.500% senior notes due 2023     | -                   | (482,121)           |\n| Accrued interest                               | 56,384              | 48,873              |\n| Interest paid 2                                | (56,370)            | (43,144)            |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 861                 | 3,498               |\n| Closing balance                                | 1,157,545           | 1,156,670           |\n\n- 1 Balance is net of unamortised discounts and capitalised transaction costs of $21.7 million.\n- 2 Accrued interest is payable semi-annually on 13 May and 13 November for 5.500 senior notes and 2 April and 2 October for 4.250% senior notes.",

Interest-bearing loans continued\n\nThe Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the senior notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.\n\n## 20. Provision for mine closure cost\n\nThe provision represents the discounted values of the risk-adjusted estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements;, decommissioning, dismantling and reclamation alternatives;, timing; the effects of climate change, and the discount, foreign exchange and inflation rates applied. Closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every three years. As these studies are renewed, they incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.\n\nThe Group has performed separate calculations of the provision by currency, discounting at corresponding rates. As at 31 December 2021, the discount rates used in the calculation of the parts of the provision that relate to Mexican pesos range from 6.39% to 8.33% (2020: range from 4.35% to 8.12%). The range for the current year parts that relate to US dollars range from 0.57% to 1.40% (2020: range from 0.07% to 1.16%).\n\nMexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group's intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the lives of the mines.\n\nThe provision is expected to become payable at the end of the production life of each mine, based on the reserves and resources, which ranges from 3/uni00A0to 24 years from 31 December 2021 (3 to 24 years from 31 December 2020). As at 31 December 2021 the weighted average term of the provision is 12 years (2020: 12 years).\n\n|                                    | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                    | 2021  US$ thousands | 2020  US$ thousands |\n| Opening balance                    | 245,688             | 231,056             |\n| Increase to existing provision     | 17,078              | 8,351               |\n| Effect of changes in discount rate | (7,821)             | 3,896               |\n| Unwinding of discount rate         | 11,622              | 10,801              |\n| Payments                           | (879)               | (817)               |\n| Foreign exchange                   | (5,381)             | (7,599)             |\n| Closing balance                    | 260,307             | 245,688             |\n| Less - Current portion (note 22)   | 3,351               | 880                 |\n| Non-current portion                | 256,956             | 244,808             |\n\nThe provision is sensitive to changes in discount rates. Changes in market rates and risks not considered in the risk-adjusted cost estimates could change the discount rate. To illustrate the sensitivity of the provision to discounting, if the discount rate at 31 December 2021 decreased by 50 basis points then the provision would be US$43.4 million higher, of which approximately US$43.3 million would be capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment' at operating sites and US$0.1 million would be charged to the income statement for non-operating sites. If the discount rate increased by 50 basis points then the provision would be US$27.2 million lower, of which approximately US$27.1 million would result in a decrease within 'Property, plant and equipment' at operating sites and US$0.1 million would be credited to the income statement for non-operating sites.",

Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans\n\nThe Group has a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan.\n\nThe defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each Mexican non-unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers' contributions, capped at 8% of the employee's annual salary.\n\nThe defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker's earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired up to 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers.\n\nThe overall investment policy and strategy for the Group's defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nDeath and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies.\n\nThe following tables provide information relating to changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets:\n\n|                             |                                | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   | Pension cost charge to income statement   |                                                                          |                                                                        |                                                                      |                         |                   |                             |                            |                                                         |                                |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                             | Balance at  1 January  2021    | Service  cost                             | Net  Interest                             | Foreign  Exchange                         | Sub-total  recognised in the year         | Benefits  paid                            | Return  on plan  assets  (excluding  amounts  included  in net  interest | Actuarial  changes  arising from  changes in  demographic  assumptions | Actuarial  changes  arising from  changes in  financial  assumptions | Experience  adjustments | Foreign  exchange | Sub-total  included  in OCI | Contributions  by employer | Defined  benefit  increase  due to  personnel  transfer | Balance at  31  December  2021 |\n|                             |                                |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                                                          |                                                                        |                                                                      |                         |                   |                             |                            | US$ thousands                                           | US$ thousands                  |\n| Defined benefit  obligation | (31,358) (1,249) (1,906) 1,572 |                                           |                                           |                                           | (1,583)                                   | 841                                       | -

All operating lease contracts contain market review clauses in the event that the lessee exercises its option to renew. The lessee does not have an option to purchase the equipment at the expiry of the lease period. The Group's leases as a lessor are not material.",

Contingencies\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Group has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- \u00b7 Certain of the Group's income tax returns are currently being reviewed by the SAT. The status of the material on-going inspections is as follows:\n- -On 13 February 2020, SAT initiated an audit of the income tax and mining rights computations of Desarrollos Mineros Fresne, S de R.L. de C.V. for the year 2014. On 3 February 2021, the SAT delivered its findings to which the company responded. The findings relate to the tax treatments of capitalised stripping cost and exploration expenditure. The company responded to the SAT and initiated a procedure with the Mexican Taxpayer Ombudsman (PRODECON) to procure a Conclusive Agreement with SAT in respect of these findings. The process is ongoing.\n- -On 11 February 2021, SAT initiated an audit of the income tax and mining rights computations of Desarrollos Mineros Fresne, S de R.L. de C.V. for the year 2015. The findings are similar to the 2014 Tax Audit Findings, and relate to the tax treatments of capitalised stripping cost, exploration expenditure, and in-period deduction of certain ore extraction services as an expense. On 8 February 2022, the SAT delivered its findings to which the company responded. It is expected that the company will initiate a procedure with PRODECON to procure a Conclusive Agreement with SAT in respect of these findings.\n\nDue to the current stage of the Conclusive Agreement regarding 2014 and the audit procedures for 2015, it is not possible to anticipate whether the tax authorities are going to assess a deficiency to Desarrollos Mineros Fresne, S de R.L. de C.V. It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.\n\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.\n- \u00b7 In 2011, flooding occurred in the Saucito mine, following which the Group filed an insurance claim in respect of the damage caused (and in respect of business interruption). This insurance claim was rejected by the insurance provider. In early 2018, after the matter had been taken to mutually agreed arbitration, the insurance claim was declared valid; however, there is disagreement about the appropriate amount to be paid. In October 2018 the Group received US$13.6 million in respect of the insurance claim, however this does not constitute a final settlement and management continues to pursue a higher insurance payment. Due to the fact that negotiations are on-going and there is uncertainty regarding the timing and amount involved in reaching a final settlement with the insurer, it is currently not practicable to determine the total amount expected to be recovered.\n- \u00b7 It is probable that interest income will be earned on the Group's outstanding income and value added tax receivable balances; however, there is no certainty that this interest will be realised until the underlying balance is recovered. Due to that uncertainty, it is also not practicable to estimate the amount of interest income earned but not recovered to date.\n\n## 26. Related party balances and transactions\n\nThe Group had the following related party transactions during the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020 and balances as at 31 December 2021 and/uni00A02020.\n\nRelated parties are those entities owned or controlled by the ultimate controlling party, as well as those who have a minority participation in Group companies and key management personnel of the Group.\n\n## (a) Related party balances\n\n|                                                 | Accounts receivable As at 31 December   | Accounts receivable As at 31 December   | Accounts payable As at 31 December   | Accounts payable As at 31 December   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                                 | 2021  US$ thousands                     | 2020  US$ thousands                     | 2021  US$ thousands                  | 2020  US$ thousands                  |\n| Trade:                                          |                                         |                                         |                                      |                                      |\n| Metal\u00fargica Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles, S.A. de C.V.       | 265,473                                 | 326,833                                 | 298                                  | 170                                  |\n| Other:                                          |                                         |                                         |                                      |                                      |\n| Industrias Pe\u00f1oles, S.A.B. de C.V.              | 4,842                                   | 7,648                                   | -                                    | -                                    |\n| Metal\u00fargica Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles, S.A. de C.V.       | 6                                       | 397                                     | -                                    | -                                    |\n| Servicios Administrativos Pe\u00f1oles, S.A. de C.V. | -                                       | -                                       | 4,519                                | 3,156                                |\n| Servicios Especializados Pe\u00f1oles, S.A. de C.V.  | -                                       | -                                       | 179                                  | 2,652                                |\n| Fuentes de Energ\u00eda Pe\u00f1oles, S.A. de C.V.        | -                                       | -                                       | 5,220                                | 568                                  |\n| Termoel\u00e9ctrica Pe\u00f1oles, S. de R.L. de C.V.      | -                                       | -                                       | 2,154                                | 2,662                                |\n| E\u00f3lica de Coahuila S.A. de C.V.                 | -                                       | -                                       | 13,589                               | 7,342                                |\n| Minera Capela, S.A. de C.V.                     | -                                       | -                                       | 714                                  | -                                    |\n| Other                                           | 38                                      | 131                                     | 4,257                                | 3,079                                |\n| Sub-total                                       | 270,359                                 | 335,009                                 | 30,930                               | 19,629                               |\n| Less-current portion                            | 270,359                                 | 335,009                                 | 30,930                               | 19,629                               |\n| Non-current portion                             | -                                       | -                                       | -                                    | -                                    |",

The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies.

        "page_content": "## Option commodity contracts\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.\n\n## Silverstream contract\n\nThe fair value of the Silverstream contract is determined using a valuation model including unobservable inputs (Level 3). This derivative has a term of over 20 years and the valuation model utilises several inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of/uni00A0silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future foreign exchange rates between the Mexican peso and US dollar, future inflation, and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.\n\nThe estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Pe\u00f1oles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the operational mine plan, with certain amendments to reflect a basis that a market participant would consider, that is provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.\n\nManagement regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above and determines their impact on the total fair value. The significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The fair value of the Silverstream is not significantly sensitive to a reasonable change in future exchange rates, however, it is to a reasonable change in future silver price, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows.\n\nFor further information relating to the Silverstream contract see note 13. The sensitivity of the valuation to the inputs relating to market risks, being the price of silver, foreign exchange rates, inflation and the discount rate is, disclosed in note 30.\n\n## Equity investments:\n\nThe fair value of equity investments is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature. As of 31 December 2021, approximately 89.8% of the investments correspond to 9,314,877 shares (2020: 9,314,877 shares) of Mag Silver, Corp. for an amount of US$146.1 million (2020: US$199.5 million) and 7.3% of Endeavor, Inc. represented by 2,800,000 (2020: 2,800,000 shares) shares for an amount of US$11.9 million (2020: US$14.1 million). These equity investments are listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange. The prices per share as 31 December 2021 were US$15.69 (2020: US$20.47) and US$4.23 (2020: US$5.05), respectively.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans:\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\n## Trade receivables:\n\nSales of concentrates, precipitates dor\u00e9 bars and activated carbon are 'provisionally priced' and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group's best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (n)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and therefore the entire related trade receivable is measured at fair value.\n\nAt each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation.\n\n## 30. Financial risk management Overview\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, cash, equity instruments at FVOCI, interestbearing loans and/uni00A0trade/uni00A0payables.\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks and the Group's objectives, policies and processes for/uni00A0assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.",

Financial risk management continued\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group's income or the value of its financial instruments.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on/uni00A0risk.\n\nIn the following tables, the effect on equity excludes the changes in retained earnings as a direct result of changes in profit before tax.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso and other foreign currencies which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, fixed assets, spare parts and/uni00A0the payment of dividends. As a result,/uni00A0the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.\n\nIn order to manage the Group's exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivatives financial instruments (excluding Silverstream) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group's profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant.

Financial risk management continued\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nExposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Group's ordinary course of business and is applicable to trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, the Silverstream contract and derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe Group's policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of counterparties' failure to honour their obligations. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Group's financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 26, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due, other than 'Other receivables' as disclosed in note 15. The Group's policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.\n\nThe Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles, the Group's sole customer throughout 2021 and 2020. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Pe\u00f1oles group which currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of/uni00A0appropriate credit rating.\n\nThe Group's surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments investing in several financial institutions. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody's) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor's) and above.

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and Equity instruments at FVOCI. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders' capital invested in the Group management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group's dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream.\n\nOne of the Group's metrics of capital is cash and other liquid assets, which in 2021 and 2020 consisted of only cash and cash equivalents.",

Corporate information\n\nFresnillo plc ('the Company') is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in Mexico City. For further information see note 4.\n\nIndustrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. ('Pe\u00f1oles') currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baill\u00e8res family, whose beneficial interest is held through Pe\u00f1oles. The country of incorporation of Pe\u00f1oles is Mexico. Copies of/uni00A0Pe\u00f1oles' accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx.\n\nThe primary activity of the Company is as a holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies. See note 5.\n\nThe financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2021 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 7 March 2022.\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a) Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Company's separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and equity securities which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the/uni00A0nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\nThe basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (b) Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the separated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Group\n\nA number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective\n\nThe IASB has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## (c) Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management's knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Judgements\n\nThe area of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is:\n\n## Deferred tax asset (note 4):\n\nThe Company has recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses amounting to US$67.1 million. In accordance with the tax legislation tax losses amounting US$22.3 million will expire in a period of five years and US$201.5 million in a period between nine and ten years. The Company has conducted a feasible tax planning and concluded it will generate future taxable income that allow apply the tax losses before its expiration.\n\n## Climate change:\n\nWe describe how climate-related risks and opportunities (CROs) may affect and was considered in the preparation of the financial statements in note 2(c) of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the cash flows underpinning the recoverable amount of mining assets also underpin the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries holding those mining assets, the considerations set out in that note also apply to the Parent Company financial statements. Other assets and liabilities discussed in note 2(c) of the Consolidated Financial Statements do not apply to the Parent Company and there are no other assets or liabilities that the group considers may be subject to CROs.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Parent Company financial statements continued\n\n## 2. Significant accounting policies continued\n\nEstimates and assumptions\n\nThe significant area of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial statements is:\n\n- \u00b7 Recoverable value of investments in subsidiaries (notes 2(e) and 5):\n\nThe Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of/uni00A0disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, reserves and resources and the associated production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements, exploration potential and operating performance. These cash flows are discounted using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The determination of that rate requires certain judgements.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2021 the Company recognised a net impairment of US$107.6 million (2020: net impairment reversal of US$234.0 million) to recognise a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US$1,985.7 million (2020: US$1,878.1 million).\n\n## (d) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Company's financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of/uni00A0the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a/uni00A0foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.\n\n## (e) Investments in subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to, or having the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the merger reserve, are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger/uni00A0reserve.\n\nWhen the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established.\n\nAt each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company usually determines fair value based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n## (f) Financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Those to be measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 Those to be measured subsequently at fair value through OCI; and\n- \u00b7 Those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe classification depends on the Company's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\nThe Company reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\nRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the/uni00A0asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in one of the following categories.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nThe Company's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables from loans granted to related parties.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Company can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment/uni00A0assessment.\n\nThe Company elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\nThe Company's derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor loans granted to subsidiaries the Company evaluate the expecting credit loss using a one-year probability of default corresponding to the mining industry determined by a specialised financial institution and considering an appropriate severity based on the cost of capital of the Group.\n\nFor other trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction/uni00A0costs.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables and loans and borrowings.",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## (g) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at/uni00A0the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.\n\n## (h) Share capital\n\nOrdinary Shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.\n\n## (i) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes.\n\n## Trademark royalties\n\nTrademark royalty income is recognised only at the time when it is probable that the amounts related to certain rights will be received.\n\n## (j) Income tax\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the/uni00A0taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and/uni00A0liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the/uni00A0timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the/uni00A0foreseeable/uni00A0future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the/uni00A0extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.",

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a/uni00A0derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nIn the Group's consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company's standalone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.\n\nAny gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to/uni00A0the/uni00A0income statement.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black-Scholes and net present value) applicable to the specific type of/uni00A0derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.\n\n## (l) Fair value measurement\n\nThe Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 15 and 16.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place/uni00A0either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 15.\n\n## (m) Dividend distribution\n\nDividends payable to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.\n\nMexican income tax law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign residents and Mexican/uni00A0individuals.\n\nDividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%. The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years. Dividends paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.",

Management has considered a decrease in gold and silver of 10% and 15% respectively (2020: 20% gold, 45% silver). The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. of US$592.9 million (2020: US$1,657.2/uni00A0million), Minera Mexicana la Ci\u00e9nega, S.A. de C.V. US$149.5 million (2020; US$240.0 million) and Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V. US$205.3/uni00A0million (2020: US$83.8 million).",

Movements in this reserve during 2021 and 2020 represent the impairment losses and reversals of the carrying value of Fresnillo's investments in subsidiaries transferred from retained earnings.\n\n## Fair value reserve of financial assets at FVOCI\n\nThe Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in OCI, as explained in note 2(f). These changes are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. The Company transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThis reserve records the accumulated results of the Company, less any distributions and dividends paid.",

Dividends paid from the profits generated from 1 January 2014 to residents in Mexico and to non-resident shareholders may be subject to an additional tax of up to 10%, which will be withheld by the Group.\n\nIn late 2019, the Directors became aware of a technical breach of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) whereby certain dividends paid between 2011 and 2019 (the 'Historic Dividends') had been made without having filed interim accounts in accordance with the Act. The relevant interim accounts have now been filed with the Registrar of Companies and these show that the Company had sufficient distributable reserves at the point at which each of the Historic Dividends was paid. It is the intention of the Directors, as a matter of prudency, to put forward a resolution to shareholders in due course to regularise the position. This decision will have no effect on the monies received pursuant to these dividends and will not adversely impact shareholders or the Company. Nevertheless, the Directors will keep the matter under review.\n\n## 10. Interest-bearing loans\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nOn 29 September 2020, the Group repurchased certain of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023 that had a carrying value of US$482.1 million for consideration of US$543.0 million. Additional accrued interest at the date of the repurchase included in the settlement amounted US$10.8 million. The premium paid on purchase of these notes of US$60.9 million was recognised in financial expenses. The settlement occurred on 2 October 2020.\n\nOn 2 October 2020, the Group completed its offering of US$850,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\n|                                                | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                | 2021 US$ thousands  | 2020 US$ thousands  |\n| Opening balance                                | 1,156,670           | 801,239             |\n| Issuance of 4.250% senior notes due 2050 1     | -                   | 828,325             |\n| Repayments of 5.500% senior notes due 2023     | -                   | (482,121)           |\n| Accrued interest 2                             | 56,385              | 48,873              |\n| Interest paid 1                                | (56,370)            | (43,144)            |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 860                 | 3,498               |\n| Closing balance                                | 1,157,545           | 1,156,670           |\n\n- 2 Accrued interest is payable semi-annually on 13 May and 13 November for 5.500 senior notes and 2 April and 2 October for 4.250% senior notes.",

        "page_content": "The Company has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the senior notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Company is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Company shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Company may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.\n\n## 11. Contingencies\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Company has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 The Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- \u00b7 It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the/uni00A0separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.\n\n## 12. Related party balances and transactions\n\nRelated parties are those entities owned or controlled by the ultimate controlling party and include the Company's subsidiaries disclosed in note 5, as well as those entities who have a minority participation in Fresnillo Group companies. Related party balances will be settled in cash. All the balances as at 31 December 2021 and 2020 and the transactions carried-out with related parties for the years then ended correspond to subsidiaries.\n\n## (a) Related party accounts receivable and payable\n\n|         | Accounts receivable   US$ thousands   | Accounts receivable   US$ thousands   | Accounts payable   US$ thousands   | Accounts payable   US$ thousands   |\n|---------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|         | 31 December   2021                    | 31 December   2020                    | 31 December   2021                 | 31 December   2020                 |\n| Loans 1 | 895,980                               | 1,315,578                             | -                                  | 575,500                            |\n| Other   | 873                                   | -                                     | 1,049                              | 1,954                              |\n| Total   | 896,853                               | 1,315,578                             | 1,049                              | 577,454                            |\n\nEffective interest rates on loans granted to related parties in US dollar range between 2.14% to 2.21% (2020: 2.15% to 3.91%); in Mexican peso range from 7.71% to 7.72% (2020: 6.47% to 9.73%).\n\n## (b) Principal transactions with related parties (apart from dividends, additional investments and returns of capital) are as follows:\n\n|                   | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                   | 2021  US$ thousands      | 2020  US$ thousands      |\n| Income:           |                          |                          |\n| Interest on loans | 51,242                   | 81,361                   |\n| Total income      | 51,242                   | 81,361                   |\n\n|                         | Year ended 31 December   | Year ended 31 December   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                         | 2021  US$ thousands      | 2020  US$ thousands      |\n| Expenses:               |                          |                          |\n| Administrative services | 4,489                    | 5,947                    |\n| Interest                | 3,030                    | 39,347                   |\n| Total expenses          | 7,519                    | 45,294                   |",

Financial instruments continued\n\nThe following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:\n\n## Option and forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.\n\n## Option commodity contracts\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black-Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.\n\n## Equity investments:\n\nThe fair value of equity investments is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature. As of 31 December 2021, approximately 89.8% of the investments correspond to 9,314,877 shares (2020: 9,314,877 shares) of Mag Silver, Corp. for an amount of US$146.1 million (2020: US$199.5 million) and 7.3% of Endeavor, Inc. represented by 2,800,000 (2020: 2,800,000 shares) shares for an amount of US$11.9 million (2020: US$14.1 million). These equity investments are listed on the Canadian Stock Exchange. The prices per share as 31 December 2021 were US$15.69 (2020: US$20.47) and US$4.23 (2020: US$5.05), respectively.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans\n\nFair value of the Company's interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\n## Loans with related parties\n\nFair value of the Company's loan to related party is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting/uni00A0date.\n\n## 16. Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Company's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of trade receivables, cash, available-for-sale financial assets, loans to and from related parties, interest-bearing loans and/uni00A0trade payables.\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Company's exposure to each of the above risks and the Company's objectives, policies and processes for/uni00A0assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.\n\nThe Company's risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is/uni00A0assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the/uni00A0results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, or interest rates will affect the Company income or the value of/uni00A0its financial instruments.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on/uni00A0risk.",

The Company's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties are excluded from the table below.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to/uni00A0a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Basis point  increase/ (decrease)  in interest rate   | Effect on  profit before  tax: increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2021                     | 25                                                    | 1,911                                                                |\n|                          | (0)                                                   | -                                                                    |\n| 2020                     | 25                                                    | 12                                                                   |\n|                          | (20)                                                  | (9)                                                                  |",

Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company's exposure to/uni00A0credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Company's financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 12, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due. The Company's policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.\n\nThe Company's surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in/uni00A0several financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 (Moody's) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poors) and above, and only for periods of less than four months.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See/uni00A0note 15 (b) for the maximum credit exposure for other financial assets, note 7 for cash and cash equivalents and note 12 for related party/uni00A0balances.\n\n## (c) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n|                                                 | Within 1 year   | 2-3 years   | 3-5 years   | > 5 years   | US$ thousands Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021                          |                 |             |             |             |                       |\n| Interest-bearing loans                          | 56,370          | 410,374     | 75,973      | 1,761,672   | 2,306,251             |\n| Derivatives financial instruments - liabilities | 3,885           | -           | -           | -           | 3,885                 |\n| Trade and other payables                        | 1,049           | -           | -           | -           | 1,049                 |\n\n|                                                 | Within 1 year   | 2-3 years   | 3-5 years   | > 5 years   | US$ thousands Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2020                          |                 |             |             |             |                       |\n| Interest-bearing loans                          | 56,370          | 430,620     | 75,973      | 1,799,658   | 2,362,621             |\n| Derivatives financial instruments - liabilities | -               | -           | -           | -           | -                     |\n| Trade and other payables                        | 1,954           | -           | -           | -           | 1,954                 |",

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interest-bearing loans, as disclosed in the balance sheet, excluding net unrealised gains and losses on revaluation of cash flow hedges and equity investments at FVOCI. In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders' capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company's dividend policy aims to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. The Company aim is to maintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.",

Mineral Resources are not Ore Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. Gold assays were capped where appropriate; all figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates.\n- 2 All open pit Mineral Resources are reported within pit shells run at a US$1,600/oz Au price constructed with inter ramp angles similar to the Ore Reserves pit designs.\n- 3 Mega Centauro open pit Mineral Resources are reported at various cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.20 g/t Au and below 0.72 g/t Au reports to the heap leach; transitional and sulfide material above 0.20 g/t and below 0.40 g/t Au reports to the heap leach; oxide material above 0.72 g/t Au reports to the mill; transitional and sulfide material above 0.40 g/t Au reports to the mill.\n- 4 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal actions regarding surface access; it is assumed these actions will eventually be settled favourably and mining operations resumed.\n- 5 Centauro Profundo underground Mineral Resources estimated using an assumed underground mining scenario beyond the current Mega Centauro Mineral Resources open pit, with appropriate cutoff grade considered at US$1,450/oz Au price, 93% metallurgical recovery.\n- \u00b7 The Mineral Resources were estimated by Fresnillo.

Ore Reserves are reported at NSR cut-off value based on metal price assumptions, metallurgical recovery assumptions, mining costs, processing costs, G&A costs, sustaining capital costs, and variable smelting and transportation costs.\n- \u00b7 JORC Code was used for reporting of Ore Reserves.\n- \u00b7 NSR values are calculated as:\n- \u00b7 NSR = 28.61*Au+0.42*Ag+15.98*Pb+15.88*Zn. Units gold (g/t), silver (g/t), lead (%), zinc (%).\n- \u00b7 NSR factors are based on metal prices of $18.50/oz Ag, $1,450/oz Au, $0.90/lb Pb, and $1.20/lb Zn and estimated recoveries of 77.20% Au, 93.40% Ag, 94.00% Pb, and 97.40% Zn.\n- \u00b7 Payable metal assumptions for Au are 95% for lead concentrates, 98% for precipitate, and 65% for zinc concentrate; for Ag: 95% for lead concentrates, 97% for precipitate, and 70% for zinc concentrate. Lead 95% payable and zinc 85% payable.\n- \u00b7 The all-inclusive stope operating cost for longhole stope and cut-and-fill stope is $110/tonne and $118/tonne respectively. The marginal stope cut-off value is $80/tonne.\n- \u00b7 Ore Reserve estimates are based on a variable cut-off considering mining, milling and general and administration costs with a variable trucking cost for each stope.\n- \u00b7 The stope hangingwall and footwall dilution (ELOS) was included in the stope optimization process. The dilution thickness for longhole slope hangingwall and footwall is 0.8 m and 0.3 m respectively. The dilution thickness for cut-and-fill slope hangingwall and footwall is 0.5m and 0.2m.\n- \u00b7 An additional operational dilution ranging from 1% for longhole stope to 5% for cut-and-fill stope is applied to the reserve calculation based on the mining methods.\n- \u00b7 Mining recovery factors range from 95% for longhole stopes to 98% for cut-and-fill stopes. Mining recovery factors for sill pillars and rib pillars are 10% and 0%, respectively.\n- \u00b7 Exchange rate of 20.0 MXP to US$1.",

These calls come from fraudsters operating in 'boiler rooms', mostly based abroad. While high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money. Most victims are experienced investors, losing on average \u00a320,000.\n\n## Protect yourself\n\nIf you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, inflated prices for shares you own, or free company or research reports, take these steps before handing over any money:\n\n- 1. Get the name of the person and organisation.\n- 2.  Check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk/register to ensure they are authorised.\n- 3.  Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact the firm.\n- 4.  Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are no contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.\n- 5.  Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing business with.\n- 6. REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\n\nIf you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.\n\n## Report a scam\n\nIf you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA using the form at www.fca.org.uk/scams (where you can also review the latest scams) or call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\nIf you have already paid money to share fraudsters then contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\n\n## For further information, please visit our website:\n\nwww.fresnilloplc.com or contact:\n\nFresnillo plc Tel: +44(0)20 7399 2470 Gabriela Mayor, Head of Investor Relations",

These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms 'believes', 'estimates', 'plans', 'projects', 'anticipates', 'expects', 'intends', 'may', 'will', or 'should' or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans, objectives, goals, future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this document and include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Group's intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, the Group's results of operations, financial position, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the silver and gold industries. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances.\n\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results of the Group's operations, financial position and liquidity, and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Group operates, may differ materially from those described in, or suggested by, the forward-looking statements contained in this document. In addition, even if the results of operations, financial position and liquidity, and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Group operates are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this document, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of factors could cause results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, general economic and business conditions, industry trends, competition, commodity prices, changes in regulation, currency fluctuations (including the US dollar and Mexican peso exchange rates), the Group's ability to recover its reserves or develop new reserves, including its ability to convert its resources into reserves and its mineral potential into resources or reserves, changes in its business strategy, political and economic uncertainty.\n\nForward-looking statements may, and often do, differ materially from actual results. Any forward-looking statements in this document speak only as of the date of this document, reflect the Group's current view with respect to future events and are subject to risks relating to future events and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to the Group's operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity. Investors should specifically consider the factors identified in this document which could cause actual results to differ before making an investment decision. Subject to the requirements of the Prospectus Rules, the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules or applicable law, the Group explicitly disclaims any obligation or undertaking publicly to release the result of any revisions to any forward-looking statements in this document that may occur due to any change in the Group's expectations or to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.",
