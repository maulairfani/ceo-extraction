Appendix\n\n## Foreword by our CEO\n\nIn 2021, we shifted into an even higher gear ensuring increased speed and growth, while  defining  clear  ambitions  for  the  coming  years.  With  a  strong  solvency  ratio and balance sheet, where Defined Contribution pensions now make up most of the pension assets, we could spend less time on older products in run-off and devote more attention to Storebrand's future business.\n\n## Odd Arild Grefstad Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nThroughout the year, more and more customers signed up for our market-leading digital products within pensions, savings, insurance, banking, and asset management. The group delivered both strong returns and long-term value to both customers and shareholders. The group result before amortisation and tax reached NOK 4.5 billion, supported by the sale of V\u00e6rdalsbruket as well as good returns for customers in funds with performance fees. Excluding positive one-off effects, earnings grew substantially in 2021, and we are well on track to achieve our ambition of delivering a Group profit before amortisation and tax of more than NOK 4 billion in 2023.\n\nSince  the  winter  of  2019/2020,  the  pandemic  has  changed  the professional and personal lives for most people. Throughout this period, Storebrand's employees have shown an impressive ability to make the best of the situation. We quickly found new ways of working that contributed to both customer and employee satisfaction, and\n\nsolid results. Storebrand has been present for our customers during the pandemic. Throughout 2021, many customers confirmed that Storebrand plays an important role as a contributor to their financial security and freedom. We handled volatile markets throughout the pandemic and provided secure and good returns to our customers while strengthening our solvency.\n\nThe  Norwegian  and  Swedish  economies  developed  positively throughout  the  year.  The  share  of  companies  with  payment difficulties  or  at  risk  of  going  bankrupt  fell  sharply,  and  a  record number of employees were employed. In fact, at the beginning of 2022, labour shortage was one of the biggest challenges in the Nordic countries. Interest rates rose through 2021. This was a sign of a healthier economy after a period of record-low interest rates, and an advantage for Storebrand as a life insurance company and manager  of  people's  pension  money.  Unfortunately,  the  spread of  Covid-19  increased  towards  the  fall  of  2021,  resulting  in  new restrictions  that  created  challenges  for  both  companies  and individuals. Although the uncertainty increased in the short term, we saw clear signs that everyday life was returning to normal.\n\nWithin  Defined  Contribution  pensions,  we  delivered  record-high returns  within  the  most  used  pension  profiles  in  Norway,  both in  2021  and  on  a  three-  and  five-year  basis.  This  means  that Storebrand's customers have received the best return in the market. We are proud to deliver market-leading returns through a distinctly sustainable asset management, providing better pension for our customers and contributing to a better world to retire in. In total, Unit Linked products achieved 15 per cent growth. At the turn of the year these products accounted for 51 per cent of the managed pension assets. Among corporate customers in Norway, we had both the highest customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n\n5",

The scheme makes pensions simpler and clearer, and it allows employees in the private sector to choose which company will manage their pension funds. Storebrand met the change with competitive solutions. Customers shall be confident that Storebrand provides  the  best  offer,  whether  they  follow  their  employer's collective scheme, or choose a pension provider themselves.\n\nAt the end of the year, we entered into an agreement to buy Danica in Norway. We look forward to combining our expertise and good technical solutions with Danica's strong and professional distribution partners.  We  will  take  pride  in  serving  Danica's  customers  and helping even more people gain access to market-leading products and services.\n\nIn the public sector, which is one of our new focus areas, it was a  very  exciting  year.  First,  we  could  welcome  Vestland  County Municipality.  Then  we  won  the  trust  of  both  \u00d8ygarden  and Bj\u00f8rnafjorden municipalities, as well as several public organisations. We demonstrated that there is money to be saved for municipalities that put their pension schemes out to public tender, while at the same time giving employees access to pension schemes that are at least as good the ones they had before. The results will inspire further efforts within the public sector in the time to come.\n\nIn  Sweden,  SPP  continued  to  change  the  pension  market  by delivering  strong  digital  solutions  and  sustainable  products  and services. This led to many new customers moving to SPP towards the end of the year. SPP was recognised as the most digital pension company in the Swedish market and delivered record-high results in 2021.\n\nOur investment in the Norwegian retail market resulted in significant earnings growth and an increase in the number of customers and employees. We gained market shares within savings, banking and insurance. Storebrand was the fastest growing insurance company in the Norwegian retail market, with an increase in market share from 4.5 per cent to 6.0 per cent. The bank's lending, primarily for mortgages, grew by as much as 15 per cent. Continuously improving digital services - including the app 'Mine Penger' ('My money') contributed to good experiences for our savings customers. Profit in the retail market increased by 48 per cent in 2021, and we have high growth ambitions going forward.\n\nStorebrand is both one of the largest, and the fastest growing, asset managers in the Nordic region. We are the gateway to investments in the Nordic region for international customers. At the same time, we offer a wide range of products to customers in the Nordic countries, and  we  have  cutting-edge  sustainable  investment  solutions  for everyone. In 2021, we increased our total assets by more than NOK 130 billion  and  exceeded  NOK  1,000  billion  in  total  assets  under management. Our funds delivered solid returns in 2021. In a market characterised by low interest rates, customers want to invest more and more into private equity, real estate, and infrastructure. These are asset classes we have a lot of experience with, and which will\n\n6\n\nbe important for Storebrand's growth and profitability in the future. I  am  therefore  pleased  that  in  the  autumn  of  2021,  the  Danish property manager Capital Investment became a part of Storebrand.\n\nSustainability has become  increasingly important for both businesses and organisations, and for private individuals. With larger investments improves our ability to make an impact. Storebrand is an increasingly active driving force for sustainable business and societal development. Through active ownership, we contribute to important decisions in the companies we invest in. We also actively engage in global networks, with suppliers we buy from, and through products and services that we offer to our customers. Our goal is to  achieve  net  zero  emissions  in  all  our  investments  by  2050.  By 2025, our intermediate goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from  our  investments  by  32  per  cent  and  increase  the  share  of investments in solution companies to 15 per cent.\n\nSustainability is about more than climate. Going forward, we will emphasise our focus on nature, biodiversity and social challenges. As inequality in the world deepens, it is important to strengthen our commitment to issues such as equal pay, equal rights, and the protection of social groups particularly vulnerable to climate change.  Storebrand was widely recognised for our sustainability work in 2021. For the second year in a row, Storebrand was ranked by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as one of the world's 10 per cent most sustainable listed companies. In addition, we were again named one of the world's most sustainable insurance companies by Corporate Knights Global 100. Institutional customers in Norway and Sweden rated us as the best on sustainable investments.\n\nIn  2021,  we  further  developed  our  workplaces  to  adapt  everyday work to hybrid models, with flexible schemes and a combination of work and home offices. Our goal is for Storebrand to be a leading and  future-oriented  workplace.  Employee  satisfaction  surveys showed that employees thrived even better in 2021 than before. We continued to attract skilled employees and recruited as many as 250 new colleagues throughout the year.\n\nThe use of data and insights is becoming increasingly important in the development of strategy, work processes, customer solutions, products and services. We are at the forefront of moving our IT infrastructure to cloud-based solutions. Digital sales also continued to increase in 2021.\n\nI  look  forward  to  an  exciting  new  year,  where  our  employees, products and services will create a future to look forward to for customers  and  shareholders,  and  with  positive  ripple  effects  for the societies in which we operate.  I would like to thank customers, shareholders and employees who all contributed to Storebrand's progress in 2021.\n\nOdd Arild Grefstad",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIn recent years, Storebrand has carried out a successful strategic turnaround operation. While Storebrand previously was a manager of capital-intensive guaranteed pensions primarily, the company is now transformed into a leading manager of savings for both companies and individuals. In addition, we are a steadily growing insurance player. We will build on this position going forward.\n\nStorebrand achieved historically strong growth and very satisfactory results  in  2021.  Thus,  we  are  able  to  confirm  the  ambitious growth  targets  for  the  years  2021-2023  that  were  announced  at Storebrand's Capital Markets Day in 2020.\n\nOur ambition is to deliver a group profit (before amortisation and tax) of more than NOK 4 billion in 2023. Self-financed growth within what we call 'Future Storebrand', will be a main contributor to increased profitability. At the same time, Storebrand will manage the balance sheet with guaranteed pensions in run-off in an efficient and safe manner that both secures customers' pension payments and frees up capital for shareholders over time. With skilled employees, a high degree of digitalisation, market-leading products and a solid financial position, the group is well positioned to meet market developments.\n\nStorebrand ensures good solutions and accessibility for customers through cost-effective operations, innovation and digital solutions. Value-adding self-service solutions provide flexibility for customers and contribute to healthy margins in a pension market characterised by strong competition. Our ambition is to maintain Storebrand's position as a leading provider of occupational pensions in both Norway and Sweden.\n\nThe  market  for  pension  savings  is  becoming  increasingly individualised. Retail customers expect us to meet their individual needs at various stages of their lives. Therefore, it was satisfying to note an increase in the number of customers who chose us as their savings and insurance provider in 2021. We aim to help our customers make good choices that provide both good returns for them as well as a positive societal development. While our offering to the retail market used to be a supplement to other activities, retail savings and insurance products have become part of Storebrand's core business. We will continue to challenge the established players in these markets.\n\nStorebrand has grown to become one of the Nordic region's largest\n\n8\n\nasset  managers,  with  sustainable  investments  as  a  foundation. We have set ambitious goals and are committed to adapting our investment portfolio to the 1.5-degree target in line with the Paris Agreement.  This  means  that  the  investment  portfolio  must  be carbon  neutral  by  2050  at  the  latest.  By  2025,  Storebrand  must reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our investments by 32 per cent, and at least 15 per cent of the portfolio must be invested in solution companies that are particularly well positioned to help achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This requires a close dialogue with the companies we invest in to help them reduce emissions.\n\nStorebrand's investments will provide good returns and long-term value for both customers and shareholders. We are well on our way to realising our ambition of becoming a Nordic powerhouse for asset management. Storebrand offers a wide range of management solutions. We  have  strengthened  our  focus  on  alternative investments and further developed our offering within sustainable investments. The goal is both to be a preferred partner for Nordic investors,  and  a  gateway  to  the  Nordic  region  for  international investors.\n\nThe  board  is  very  pleased  with  Storebrand's  results  in  2021  and believes the company is well positioned for the years to come. Storebrand's shareholders achieved a total return of 43 per cent in 2021, which was higher than the returns reported both by the Oslo Stock Exchange and by European peers.\n\nStorebrand faces exciting challenges. Competition is tough in both the corporate and retail markets. Customers have increasingly high expectations, and we must deliver on ambitious goals for profitable growth  and  sustainable  development.  Time  and  time  again, Storebrand has demonstrated an ability to adapt to market and societal developments. The group's balance sheet is solid, and our financial flexibility is good. Storebrand has paid increasing dividends, made  acquisitions  to  strengthen  our  customer  offerings,  and secured long-term financing through debt issuances in international markets. All this strengthens the basis for creating future growth and shareholder value, while also contributing positively to a sustainable development in the years to come.",

Appendix\n\n## Sustainability as a core business\n\nIn 2019, the UN released the results of the most thorough planetary health check ever undertaken, the IPBES-report on biodiversity and ecosystem services. 5 The report is clear in its conclusion: Loss of biodiversity and ecosystems occurs to an extent that must be limited urgently so as not to entail irreversible consequences. The backdrop for the report is the 2018 UN Special Report on global warming of 1.5\u00b0C, which concluded that the transition to a low-emission society requires swift action. 6 The transition represents both financial risks and opportunities for Storebrand as an investor and asset manager. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced the Code Red for Humanity in its latest report on climate change. 7 The report states that climate change is intensifying continuously, and that some changes are already irreversible.\n\nThe financial sector plays a key role in helping to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through good management, our pensions, savings, and investments can be powerful tools to address key challenges and to realise the Sustainability goals. As a significant asset owner, insurer, and asset manager, we also see great economic opportunities in the alignment of investment portfolios to a sustainable agenda, in line with international obligations. In the long term, we believe this will also result in higher returns for our customers.\n\nCompanies with sustainability as a key part of their business strategy have a stronger position for managing climate and sustainability risks and capitalising on the opportunities they represent. There is growing consensus that companies that have a strategy in line with the SDGs and the Paris Agreement have better conditions than others to create long-term returns and may be better positioned to succeed in future markets.\n\n## Sustainability in Storebrand\n\nSustainability is integrated in our business strategy and implemented across the entire business, including investments, products and product  development,  procurement,  employment  policies  and business management.\n\nOur  main  objective  is  to  leverage  sustainability  as  a  competitive advantage.  Members  of  the  executive  management  group  are responsible for achieving our main strategic goals on sustainability within  their  respective  business  areas.  Business  unit  goals  and targets are reviewed three times a year by the executive management group and every six months by the Board of Directors.\n\nAt an operational level, our work on sustainability is divided into three areas: Keeping our house in order, products and services, and communication and stakeholder engagement.\n\nKeeping our house in order\n\nIn our work, we rely on these sustainability principles:\n\n- \u00b7 We  base  our  business  activities  on  the  UN  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n- \u00b7 We help our customers to live more sustainably through the products and services we offer.\n- \u00b7 We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7 Our  processes  and  decisions  are  based  on  sustainability outcomes  -  from  the  Board  and  management,  who  have the ultimate responsibility, to each employee who promotes sustainability in their respective business area.\n- \u00b7 We  work  with  our  customers,  suppliers,  authorities  and partners to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n- \u00b7 We are transparent about our work on sustainability and the results we achieve.\n\nWe have identified three SDGs that may be significantly impacted by how we manage the Group's business and human resource processes. At the end of relevant chapters of this report, figures are provided that show how far we have come in this work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in our operations and in our investments (target 13.1).\n\nWe integrate climate change measures into our policies, strategies and planning (target 13.2).\n\nWe  aim  to  achieve  decent  work  for  all  our employees, and equal pay for work of equal value (target 8.5).\n\nWe  aim  to  protect  labour  rights  and  promote safe and secure working environments for all our workers, contractors, and suppliers (target 8.8). We continuously work towards encouraging and expanding access to banking, insurance and Financial services for all (target 8.10).\n\nWe work actively towards equal opportunities and gender balance in work and economic life (target 5.5).",

Appendix\n\n## Products and Services\n\nStorebrand is a leading financial player in the Nordic market and will continue to be a pioneer in sustainable investments. We started with sustainable investments already in the mid-1990s. In 2005, we introduced minimum standards for all our investments through the Storebrand standard, and in 2010 we integrated sustainability into all our funds through a separate ranking methodology. 8 In  2021, Prospera  ranked  Storebrand  first  in  the  sustainable  investment category in both Norway and Sweden. We also scored best among the  major  financial  institutions  in  the  Ethical  Banking  Guide  in Norway, and we were included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index's list of the world's 10 per cent most sustainable companies for the second year in a row. These were important recognitions of Storebrand's efforts to operationalise sustainability and integrate sustainability in our investment products.\n\nAll our funds are managed according to the Storebrand standard. By the end of 2021, 11.2 per cent of our capital was invested in what we call solutions - companies that contribute to the SDGs, investments in green bonds, green infrastructure, and certified green real estate investments.  In  addition,  almost  44  per  cent  (NOK  483  billion)  of assets under management were invested in fossil-free funds. All assets under management in our Swedish branch SPP Funds were invested in funds consisting of companies that had no connections to the fossil fuel sector.\n\nWe have identified eight SDGs (below) where Storebrand can have the greatest impact through our investment activities. The goals are used actively, for example when applying Storbrand's sustainability rating. The protection of peace, justice and strong institutions (SDG 16) are key considerations when making investment decisions (see page  68).  For  Specific  measures  and  objectives  related  to  these sustainability goals in our asset management are described in the chapter Driving force for sustainable investments .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 8)  The Storebrand Standard applies to all self-managed funds and pension funds, and shall contribute to ensuring our customer's long-term returns.\n- Read more about the criterias here: https://www.storebrand.no/asset-management/barekraftige-investeringer/storebrandstandarden\n- 9)  Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance has developed a second edition of the Target Setting Protocol:\n- https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-alliance/resources/target-setting-protocol-second-edition/\n\n## Communication and stakeholder dialogue\n\nStrategic ambitions, target setting, reporting, and communication about  sustainability  are  important  success  criteria  in  our  work. We are transparent about our sustainability  efforts  and  report  in accordance  with  several  leading  reporting  standards,  including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), in line with the expectations of several key stakeholders. In addition, we engage in international sustainability initiatives such as The Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance and Climate Action 100+ to support the development of international metrics and targets, and to positively influence investee companies. As one of the founding members of Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, we have supported the development of  a  Target  Setting  Protocol  that  has  received  recognition  from Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN Secretary General. 9\n\nThis  illustrates  our  strong  commitment  to  SDG  17:  collaboration and  partnerships  to  achieve  the  goals.  In  addition,  through stakeholder  dialogue  and  communication,  we  want  to  influence these sustainability goals:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  encourage  companies  to  adopt  sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle (target 12.6).\n\nWe  strengthen  resilience  and  adaptive  capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in our operations and in our investments (target 13.1).\n\nWe integrate climate change measures into our policies, strategies and planning (target 13.2).",

This ensures alignment between our goals and prioritised areas, and our stakeholders' expectations. Our operating environment will be adjusted and shaped in line with societal developments. The materiality analysis will therefore be continuously updated through ongoing dialogue with our most important stakeholders: Shareholders, customers, employees, authorities, and NGOs. In 2022, we will develop an updated materiality analysis to incorporate the double materiality concept proposed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) in its work for the elaboration of EU non-financial reporting standards under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\n## Leader\n\nKarin Bing Orgland\n\n## Members\n\nMartin Skancke Hanne Seim Grave\n\n## The Compensation Committee\n\n## Leader\n\nMartin Skancke\n\n## Members\n\nFredrik \u00c5tting Bodil Catherine Valvik\n\nThe analysis defines the challenges and opportunities that both Storebrand and our stakeholders perceive as most crucial to reaching\n\nour long-term strategic goals, and where we have the greatest impact on society and the environment. The analysis is publicly available. 10\n\nThe dialogue with stakeholders is conducted through interviews, surveys, and direct dialogue. We also extract information collected through interaction with stakeholders, such as general meetings, customer surveys and meetings, as well as participation in committees and initiatives aimed at solving a wide range of sustainability issues.\n\nBased on the materiality analysis, we identified four focus areas and related material topics in 2020, and how we will work on these going forward.",

The materiality analysis forms the structure of this annual report and includes input from our stakeholders. The financial capital and investment universe, and the three underlying material topics, are consistently ranked by our stakeholders as very significant. They are also very relevant to the Group's strategy and risk management and therefore are included in the Director's Report. Topic A: Competitive long-term returns to shareholders and customers are covered through other chapters in the report such as Customer relations, the Director's report, and the accounts. Topic B and C have been merged into one chapter; Driving force for sustainable investment .\n\nOther material themes are also ranked with high importance, including topic E: Engaging, relevant and responsible advice, G: Simple and seamless customer experiences, and K: Governance and compliance:\n\nprivacy, information security, anti-corruption, and combating financial crime. These are discussed in relevant chapters in the main part of the annual report. Common for all chapters is that they are divided into four parts; why it is important for Storebrand and for our stakeholders, goals and ambitions, our approach, and results. The key figures for each focus area are reported to Executive management on an ongoing basis, and to the Board of Directors annually.\n\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI standards (Core option). Our GRI index can be viewed on page 220. The guidelines of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) are also used as a basis for the report.\n\nThis year's report covers Storebrand's operations in Norway and Sweden. The environmental data presented in the chapter Keeping our house in order includes the head offices of Norway and Sweden as well as Skagen's head office, representing the office premises of 93 per cent of the group's employees. The figures do not include smaller, local offices or Cubera, as these are not considered material due to their size. See page 214 for more information about companies in the Storebrand Group.",

Appendix\n\n## Greater security and financial wellness\n\nWe shall help our customers achieve security and financial wellness by  offering  long-term  savings,  banking,  and  insurance  solutions. We will motivate our customers to make good decisions in savings, banking,  and  insurance  by  delivering  customer  experiences  that meet  their  needs  at  different  stages  of  life.  Through  good  asset management and robust structures for risk management, we ensure that our customers get good returns in a sustainable manner on their investments. Dialogue with our customers takes place through both digital and serviced channels. Our goal is to be closest to the customer, in a simple and sustainable way.\n\n## Why\n\nRecent reforms to the Norwegian and Swedish pension systems entail  greater  individual  flexibility  and  responsibility  for  their  own long-term  financial  situation,  including  pensions.  With  increased life expectancy in general, Norwegians in the future can expect less support from the government to meet living costs throughout retirement. Taking an active responsibility for your personal finances is important to lead the life you want, both throughout working life and as a pensioner.\n\nNorwegian  residents  received  their  Individual  Pension  Account ('Egen pensjonskonto') in February 2021. It is intended to provide better oversight and control over your own pension and increase payouts. In December 2021, the Swedish government proposed to extend the transfer right for Unit-linked insurance and custodian insurance covered before 1 July 2007. It will be easier and cheaper for  employees  in  Sweden  to  move  pension  funds  saved  from 1 July  2007 to today. The rules on fees (maximum SEK 600) shall also  include  insurance  policies  covered  prior  to  1  July  2007.  The regulatory amendments are proposed to enter into force on 1 July 2022.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nStorebrand aims to offer customers a range of services designed to meet the breadth of their financial needs at all stages of life. In Norway, we offer relevant products and services in savings, banking, and insurance. In Sweden, our offer is limited to savings.\n\nOur  customers  should  be  confident  that  we  offer  relevant  and attractive products, and that we manage their savings so that they get the best possible returns. We provide information and advice to our corporate customer so that they, in turn, may assist their employees in making better financial decisions. We work to build strong relationships with corporate customers and their employees\n\nthrough  holistic  and  customised  follow-ups.  Through  digital solutions, customer seminars, and advisory services, we make it easier for companies to understand their pension schemes, and for their employees to gain oversight and control of their own pension. We value the use of qualified advisors and coherent communication. Overall, Storebrand is a preferred provider of pension services.\n\nThe Storebrand brand in Norway is communicated to the market through  the  communication  concept  'Good  Money'  ('Gode Penger'). Storebrand shall be known for its ability to create value for customers through sustainable investments. In 2021, we developed several new products and services that support this strategy.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP aims to be the occupational pension company known for being passionate about making occupational pensions easy for the  employees  of  our  corporate  customers.  We  offer  extensive expertise, digital services, tailored advice, and a complete product offering.  We  develop  attractive  benefit  packages  for  employees and focus on sustainable investments, in line with the widespread demand for these types of pension and savings products in the Swedish market.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe  provide  information  in  a  coherent  manner  and  make  good advice readily available to help our customers gain an overview of  their  personal  finances.  Development  of  digital  tools  and  the improvement of digital communication are important instruments, both in the Norwegian and Swedish markets.\n\nThe  'My  Money'  ('Mine  Penger')  app  helps  our  customers  get an overview and take control of their pension and other savings. Based  on  figures  from  the  Norwegian  public  pension  scheme (Folketrygdfondet), private pension savings and employers, customers can calculate their future pensions. We also use the app to encourage our own employees to become private customers at Storebrand. The service 'Smart Pension' ('Smart Pensjon') enables customers approaching retirement age to plan their transition to a new phase in their lives. During this phase, we see a higher demand from our customers for advisory services.\n\nIn  2021,  SPP  further  developed  digital  services  that  make  it  even easier for companies to manage their occupational pensions. An example is the development of a new interface for calculating and updating pension contributions. SPP also developed a fully digital service for employees to choose when and how they want their pension payouts.",

Appendix\n\n## 'Storebrand shall be known for our ability to create value through sustainable investments.'\n\nSPP also continued to develop the digital tool called 'Your climate footprint' ('Ditt klimatavtrykk'). The tool shows the carbon footprint of the investments associated with an employee's pensions and savings, compared to the carbon footprint if the investments had been made in funds without a sustainability profile. Companies use the information in communication with employees, in their own sustainability  reporting,  and  to  strengthen  their  own  profiling  on sustainability. In 2021 our financial advisors received training in the usage and communication of this tool. In Norway, a pilot project was\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe  are  continuously  working  to stimulate,  and  expand  access,  to banking and insurance services, and financial services for all (target 8.10).\n\nlaunched to further develop a similar tool entitled the 'Sustainability Dashboard'  ('B\u00e6rekraftsdashboard').  Corporate  customers  in Sweden gave feedback that the tool is useful for communication with their own employees. Several companies also want to use the tool in recruitment campaigns and in their corporate sustainability reporting.\n\n## Results\n\nStorebrand works to increase customers' awareness related to their pensions and savings. We contribute to this through communication about products and services, both on our own website, in direct customer dialogue, in the app 'My Money', and in social media.\n\nMore than 700,000 people checked their pension on Storebrand' s website in Norway in 2021. Throughout the year, more than 200,000 customers downloaded the 'My Money' app, which was launched in a new version in 2021.\n\nIn Sweden, more than 428,000 customers logged into SPP's website to attain information about their pension, while over 4,000 corporate customers logged in to review and manage the company's pension solutions. A significant number of corporate customers also chose to  enter  into  an  agreement  on  digital  payment  of  occupational pensions.  More  than  72.9  per  cent  of  all  private  customers  who retired in 2021 chose a fully digital pension payment solution. 11",

Appendix\n\n## Engaging, relevant and responsible advice\n\n## Why\n\nCustomers  often  find  it  complicated  to  get  a  complete  overview of  their  own  finances,  pension  and  insurance  policies,  rights,  and payments through the different stages of life. We work continuously to improve and simplify information for the benefit of our customers. Relevant and responsible advisory services are prerequisites for good customer satisfaction. We help customers select products and services that are relevant and appropriate for their current life situation.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe aim to provide products and services that contribute to security and financial wellness for our customers. We deliver pension and savings capital growth through professional management tailored to fit individual risk profiles and time horizon preferences.\n\nIn Norway, our ambition is for 70 per cent of our advisors across savings, banking, and insurance to be authorised. 12 In Sweden, all our advisors are certified in line with requirements from the authorities.\n\n## Approach\n\nThe starting point for all customer contact is the principle of putting the customer first. This is reflected in our service standards:\n\n- \u00b7 Trustworthy - I keep what I promise, and I am a professional.\n- \u00b7 Caring -  I  treat  everyone  individually,  help  them,  and  give advice.\n- \u00b7 Enthusiastic - I am positive and exceed expectations.\n- \u00b7 Efficient - I make the customer journey easy and improve your organisation.\n\nOur  advisors  in  Norway  are  authorised  through  the  financial advisors  authorisation  scheme  (AFR),  the  non-life  insurance  and personal  insurance  authorisation  scheme  (AIS  and  AIP)  and/or the authorisation scheme for credit and personal insurance, all under  the  auspices  of  the  financial  industry.  Information  about our  authorisation  and  competency  requirements  is  available  to customers across our digital platforms.\n\n- 12)  The figures will be affected by turnover in the organisation\n- 13)  Securities funds consist of an equity savings account and an investor account.\n- 14)  Figures for retail customers. Source: https://vff.no/siste-m%C3%A5ned.\n- 15)  Market share for banking is measured in loans.\n\nThe interaction between digital and physical customer service will become increasingly important. Storebrand's, teams work closely together to deliver first-class  customer  services  and  develop  new initiatives.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2021,  Storebrand  was  ranked  1st  in  the  Norwegian  Customer Barometer's annual measurement of customer satisfaction in the corporate market, with a satisfaction score of 74 points (out of 100). Storebrand  received  the  highest  loyalty  score  among  corporate customers. Sustainability was an important driver of loyalty and trust. This confirmed that our commitment to profitable sustainability will become an important differentiator in both the corporate and retail markets.\n\nIn the market for mutual funds, we had a market share of 4.4 per cent at the end of 2021. 13 In the market for Unit-linked savings, we had a market share of 16.9 per cent at the end of 2021. 14\n\nIn the non-life insurance market, we had a market share of 5.9 per cent.\n\nIn the market for banking, we had a market share of 1.8 per cent per Q3 in 2021. 15\n\nSPP has grown significantly in the Swedish market. SPP has positioned itself well, offering sustainable management of employees' pension funds and efficient digital services.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n\n## Digital innovator in financial services\n\nWhy\n\nA well-maintained and advanced technology platform is required to adopt emerging technologies, create innovative digital services, and meet our customers' digital expectations. Storebrand's platform is  continuously  improved  to  offer  strong  financial  products  and services to our customers.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe work to increase the number of satisfied and loyal customers through good, digital customer experiences. The interaction between digital services and automated processes is key for both distribution and operations, as well as for our ability to ensure profitable growth and a future-oriented Storebrand in the years to come.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe  work  systematically  to  develop  excellent  digital  customer experiences  through  automated  processes  based  on  a  solid technological  platform  and  infrastructure.  Increasingly  advanced use of  data  and  artificial  intelligence,  in  combination  with  leading expertise,  are  critical  success  factors  to  creating  good  digital customer  experiences.  In  2021,  digital  service  development, technology and data resources were merged into one, common business unit called 'Storebrand Digital'.\n\nIntegrated machine learning models were incorporated into key business  processes  across  the  Group.  In  addition,  several  core systems were modernised. Migrating Storebrand's IT solutions to a cloud-based infrastructure continued at full speed in 2021.\n\n## Results\n\nDuring 2021, we had more than 4.4 million visits on www.storebrand. no. The number of page views increased by approximately 11 per cent from the previous year. The 'Mine Penger' ('My Money') app was used by 30,000 customers every month and served as a digital hub  for  Storebrand's  savings  services.  Additionally,  the  number of digital sales of insurance and savings increased by 32 per cent and  38  per  cent,  respectively,  compared  to  2020.  The  share  of digital sales in our sales channels for both insurance and savings accounted for 40 per cent of the total volume.\n\nStorebrand  Forsikring  launched  an  automated  electronic  health declaration that both streamlined and improved the experience for  our  customers  when  buying  products.  Storebrand  Forsikring also launched a digital sales advisory solution for property damage, in addition to new innovative solutions for digital sales tailored to product packages for the SME market segment.\n\nStorebrand  Bank  launched  several  new  digital  solutions.  The Bank's  partnership  with  Huseierne,  a  homeowner's  membership organisation,  and  Nordvik,  a  real  estate  broker,  was  further strengthened. Huseiernes' service for security deposit accounts was improved, in addition to a new integration to Nordvik's real estate agent system that generates potential leads to Storebrand.\n\nIn  2021,  customers'  defined  contribution  pension  schemes  were transferred to their Individual Pension Account. This arrangement entailed that customers' pension funds gained from previous and current employers were collected in one pension account. More than 700,000 pension agreements were managed and 99 per cent of these processes were automated.\n\nSPP has nearly completed the implementation of a new core system that enables further digitalisation and innovation of products and services. By the end of 2021, 97 per cent of all pension agreements were  converted  to  the  new  solution.  The  share  of  people  who received pension funds digitally increased from 15 per cent to 80 per cent in 2021. The number of manual cases processed by SPP was reduced by 30 per cent in 2021 following the introduction of digital services such as self-service solutions for corporate customers.\n\nThrough artificial intelligence and machine learning, we were able to improve the accuracy of risk-based pricing for group disability pensions by 15 per cent in the period 2019 - 2021. The basis for value creation through smart use of data was further strengthened in  2021.  Among  other  things,  Storebrand  exposed  10  per  cent more  insurance  fraud  than  previous  years.  Storebrand's  use  of machine learning to detect insurance fraud took second place in the 'Dataforeningens' Innsiktspris' (Data Association's Insight Award) for 2021.\n\nDuring 2021, the system portfolio of Storebrand Asset Management AS was moved from two local data centers to Microsoft Azure cloud.",

Appendix\n\n## Simple and seamless customer experiences\n\n## Why\n\nIn  line  with  technological  development,  demands  for  improved customer  experiences  have  increased  significantly.  Customers expect  a  seamless  interaction  between  advisory  service  and customer service across digital and serviced channels.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur aim and ambition are to offer personalised experiences to each of our customers, across digital and serviced channels.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand invests in technology, services and concepts that ensure relevance for our customers in the channels they prefer.\n\nIn 2020, we introduced Salesforce as an IT platform for customer dialogue  and  follow-up  across  channels.  The  system  allows  for customer dialogue logged in one channel to be identified, retrieved and followed up in another. Increasingly, customers will experience that we recognise them, regardless of which channel they use to communicate with us. Going forward, we will continue to develop Salesforce to strengthen our customer offering in line with customer and market expectations.\n\nOur  core  deliveries  were  also  strengthened  in  2021.  New  loan customers were assigned an individual contact person at the bank. Insurance  claims  settlement  processes  were  improved,  and  we established a separate advisory system to service customers across banking and savings.\n\nSurveys  showed  that  customers  wanted  a  trusted  partner at  important  life  events,  and  that  good  advice  and  customer experiences were considered more important than (actual) product properties. Increased use of digital meetings and webinars were important tools to improve customer dialogue in 2021.\n\nThrough  dialogue  with  existing  and  potential  customers,  we continued to develop product offerings aimed at affluent persons and people approaching retirement age ('Smart Pensjon'). Customer needs in connection with home purchases will have priority in 2022.\n\n## Results\n\nOur  digital  platform  for  customer  dialogue,  Salesforce,  gained traction throughout 2021. The platform was integrated with several digital sales and advisory services within savings and insurance. External partners also gained access to the platform.\n\nThe  product  concept  for  affluent  persons  performed  well  due to  distinct  value  propositions,  efficient  presentations  and  sales activities, as well as close dialogue with customers.\n\nThe  digital  service  'Smart  Pensjon'  ('Smart  Pension')  was  further developed with, among other things, a new solution for simulating withdrawal of pensions and start-up of private savings schemes. Customer satisfaction increased by 15 per cent, to 7.0 (scale from 1 - 10) from 2020 to 2021. The share of digital sales through this service increased by 400 per cent from 2020 to 2021.",

Appendix\n\n## A culture for learning\n\n\u00abPeople  first,  digital  always\u00bb  is  the  title  of  Storebrand's  People strategy.  The  strategy  enables  our  organisation  to  adapt  to continuous changes in an increasingly digitalised society and deliver on ambitious business targets.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the pandemic affected our ways of working. We continued to facilitate flexible working arrangements and hybrid working models. Storebrand will build on this experience to  develop the workplace of the future to benefit employees, the company,  and  society.  Through  our  Future  Storebrand  initiative, we  invited  managers  and  employees  to  define  and  share  their thoughts.  Although  digital  solutions  and  flexible  work  patterns provide both efficiency and freedom, we see that physical meetings and gatherings strengthen the diversity of opinion, interpersonal relations, and a sense of belonging.\n\nNew ways of working contributed to an increase in the Group's employee  engagement  score,  to  a  record  8.4  out  of  10,  in  our bi-monthly  employee  survey.  This  progress,  combined  with  the company's  solid  financial  results,  gives  motivation  and  energy  to further  develop  Storebrand  as  a  future-oriented  employer  and workplace.\n\n## Why\n\nStorebrand believes that all employees should have the opportunity to  develop  their  skills  continuously.  Building  competencies  to ensure personal development and skills refinement is essential, and it contributes to Storebrand delivering value to our customers. Our goal is that employees should learn throughout their time with us and thereby strengthen their opportunities in the job market should they decide to seek employment elsewhere.\n\nStorebrand  offers  courses  and  training  programs  and  stimulates learning experiences  through  daily  assignments.  We  strive to  facilitate  exciting  tasks,  new  challenges,  and  collaboration across business units. Managers and employees have a shared responsibility to provide continuous feedback to ensure continuous improvement. Employees are encouraged to acquire new insights and experiences.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  build  a  learning  culture  characterised  by psychological  safety.  We  strive  towards  having  a  culture  where you  can  experiment,  make  mistakes,  be  open  about  what  you master,  and  create  a  safe  space  to  provide  input,  express different  perspectives  and  receive  feedback.  Phychological  safety is a prerequisite for innovation in a hybrid work model. We urge employees to contribute to the learning of their colleagues, and we aspire to achieve a genuine team spirit that exceeds the desire for individual success.\n\n## Approach\n\nIn  2021,  we  selected  a  group  of  employees  from  different  parts of the Group to share their views on psychological safety on our internal social media channels. Group members published weekly posts about what psychological safety meant to them and how each employee could contribute to cultural improvements. The program was well received and evolved into a workshop titled 'Psychological safety - what, why and how?', and more than 30 management teams and business units have later completed this workshop. The content was further converted into an e-learning course for new employees as part of their digital onboarding program.\n\nIn 2021, we also had a fully digital event, titled 'Our new working day' for all our employees. The purpose was to strengthen internal unity and customer-centricity. The main topics include how to balance the needs of individuals, and society, and to raise awareness of challenges  and  opportunities  in  our  new  hybrid  working  day. Storebrand  engaged  with  the  entire  organisation  through  live broadcasts from our new digital TV studios in our offices in Lysaker and Stockholm. In addition, participants completed digital teamwork activities, and employees were divided into small teams and played a new interactive game about challenges and interactions in a hybrid work model.\n\nAs we put lifelong learning and development on the agenda, we also conducted in-depth interviews with employees to understand their experiences about learning. We focused primarily on learning and development experiences during change and digital transformation. We interviewed more than 100 employees and 20 managers across more than 20 teams and conducted follow-up conversations with managers to discuss how to meet employees' expectations and needs.\n\nWe  continued  our  work  to  further  develop  digital  competence among our employees, and we see that successful hybrid working models  depend  on  efficient  use  of  digital  tools  for  knowledge sharing and collaboration. Storebrand expects managers to take responsibility for self-development and continuous development of leadership skills. Managers can choose between a range of courses and  programs  tailored  to  support  different  roles  and  needs.  In 2021, we offered a digital leadership development program called Storebrand Leadership Weekly, which focused on trust and change management.\n\nWe also  implemented  the  Storebrand  Future  Impact  programme for young talents with one to three years' work experience. The program  aims  to  train  future  leaders  and  change  agents  and primarily  develops  three  skills:  self-management,  relationships and collaboration, and complex problem-solving.

They were encouraged to apply what they had learned through the development programme.\n\nIn 2021, we launched Storebrand Inclusive Leadership, a programme designed to raise awareness of how leaders can foster and develop teams with employees of diverse backgrounds and competencies.\n\nStorebrand also facilitated informal arenas where leaders could come together to reflect and share experiences. Examples included a  practical  leadership  lunch,  an  onboarding  program  for  new managers, and a buddy program. In addition, Storebrand hosted management meetings within the various business units and all\n\nIn  2021,  we  carried  out  our  annual  summer  internship  program, Storebrand Sandbox. Sandbox is a leading fintech program in Norway and Sweden, where students with different study backgrounds solve real  challenges  facing  Storebrand  and  our  customers.  Sandbox invites young talents to get to know Storebrand and broadens our network among potential employees. The program also contributes to Storebrand's learning culture, demonstrating the importance of learning, failing, collaborating, and innovating.\n\nOur digital learning platform, Campus Storebrand, provides access to various inspiration and professional development, including digital internal courses and links to various external course providers.\n\n## Results\n\nThe  social  media  posts  about  psychological  safety  were  read by  between  1,000  and  1,200  employees  every  week  during  the campaign period from January to May 2021. The series increased the demand for more information and knowledge about the topic. Following the series, People facilitated more than 20 workshops on psychological safety in various management groups, business units, and teams across the company. The focus on psychological safety will continue in 2022.\n\nMore than 1,200 employees participated in our annual employee day. The day included an interactive digital group game about hybrid working  models.  More  than  1,000  employees  responded  to  an evaluation survey about the game, which scored 4.6 out of 5.\n\nMore than 120 employees celebrated of The International Day for Failure, which became the most visited StorebrandTalks in 2021. 17\n\nIn-depth interviews with managers and employees conducted in 2021 gave us valuable  knowledge  and  reassurance  that  we  have the right approach to developing a learning culture. Development courses  and  training  were  considered  significant,  but  everyday learning  was  valued  higher  -  especially  when  presented  with challenging  tasks  and  working  together  with  skilled  colleagues. Feedback  and  recognition  when  developing  new  skills  and competencies also were appreciated.\n\nIn  2021,  we  recruited  30  digital  enthusiasts,  strengthening  our already numerous pool of digital change agents in Norway and Sweden. These employees play an important role in improving our use of digital solutions for collaboration.\n\nIn 2021, more than 24 middle managers participated in the digital leadership program, Storebrand Leadership Weekly. Approximately 90  managers  participated  in  the  program  Storebrand  Inclusive Leadership. We arranged four leadership guilds and five practical leadership lunches where all managers in Norway could attend or watch the recording.\n\nThe war for talent continued in 2021, and we took steps to position Storebrand as an attractive employer among students and young employees.  Universum's  ranking  of  Norway's  most  attractive employers named Storebrand as one of the increasingly attractive companies among IT graduates in 2021.\n\nOur graduate program Storebrand Future Impact had 26 participants in 2021. Our goal was to develop effective ambassadors for change, both in Storebrand and society at large. The program began with two digital introductory sessions during the autumn of 2021, and we have planned three physical gatherings and a project assignment in 2022.\n\nFor the summer program, Storebrand Sandbox, we received close to 1000 applications for the program. A total of 20 students were accepted,  of  whom  15  work  in  Norway  and  five  in  Sweden.  The students  were  majoring  in  economics,  technology,  psychology,  IT, entrepreneurship, and design. Once again, the program was an essential catalyst for innovation. Through interdisciplinary teams, students solved current challenges that Storebrand was facing.\n\nIn  2021,  we  offered  more  than  200  courses  through  Campus Storebrand, our digital learning platform. More than 2,000 employees participated in one or more of them. Employees completed 7,185 hours of e-learning, averaging 3.63 hours of learning per person. In addition, employees completed digital courses via external webbased platforms. These courses do not show up in the statistics above. Employees also learn from sharing insights and experiences on our internal sharing platforms such as Yammer, Teams, and Sharepoint, for which we do not keep statistics.\n\nWe use the employee survey provider Peakon to distribute regular employee surveys to ensure frequent and continuous feedback on employee satisfaction. In 2021, the score for development increased from 7.8 to 8.0 out of 10. The score for guidance increased from 8.0 to 8.1 out of 10, while the score for career development increased from 7.5 to 7.7, and the score for learning increased from 8.1 to 8.3.",

Employees who are brave pioneers who dare to innovate and challenge prevailing norms are essential for Storebrand to secure a bright future for our customers and society.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur  ambition  is to strengthen employee  satisfaction, job satisfaction, and employee engagement through meaningful work, strong leadership, a motivating work environment, development opportunities, and confidence in management. Our managers must define  clear  objectives  and  encourage  employees  to  collaborate with peers to achieve collective and individual goals.\n\nTransparency is a prerequisite for employee motivation, trust, and safety.  All  employees  shall  feel  confident  to  raise  issues  with  the management and others in the Group. Storebrand also has its own ethical guidelines.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand relies on trust from customers, partners, authorities, shareholders, and society. The organisation should be known for high ethical standards to gain trust. All employees shall act with diligence,  accountability  and  legality.  Storebrand  uses  e-learning for training in ethics, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and terrorist  financing,  as  well  privacy  issues  and  digital  trust.  Annual completion  of  the  courses  is  mandatory  to  ensure  responsible business practices in line with our Code of Conduct.\n\nStorebrand  has  established  an  external  third-party  notification channel  through  an  auditor  company,  and  the  whistle-blower channel  is  communicated  in  our  onboarding  program  for  new starters  and  via  the  Storebrand  intranet. 18 We  also  have  wellestablished procedures for dealing with complaints, harassment, and other inappropriate behavior. In 2021, we received no alerts or complaints about harassment or other inappropriate behavior through the third- party notification channel.\n\nOur driving force is to be close to our customers and to help them achieve  financial  safety  and  freedom,  ensuring  a  brighter  future. Our driving force requires us to act as brave pathfinders. Every year, an  employee  receives  the  Storebrand  Brave  Pioneer  Award.  The nomination  process  in  2021  was  transparent,  and  all  candidates were nominated via our internal social media platform, leading to a record turnout and number of nominations.\n\nEmployees answer employee surveys regularly (every two weeks or monthly via Peakon) to measure workplace engagement and satisfaction with work, management, collaboration, sustainability, perceived self-determination, and freedom of opinion. Executive management  follows  up  these  strategically  anchored  objectives.\n\n30\n\nOur goal of being a smart and agile organisation is supported by Peakon, which allows us to follow the data in real time for continuous improvement.\n\nAt  Storebrand,  we  encourage  a  good  work-life  balance  for  all employees.  After  the  pandemic  outbreak  in  2020,  we  facilitated increased flexibility  in  work  hours  and  choice  of  workplace.  What employees  delivered  was  more  important  than  where  they performed their work, but we continued to value physical meetings and  collaboration.  Throughout  2021,  we  worked  continuously  to develop a hybrid working model. To support the teams' autonomy, flexibility, ability to adapt and learn, we developed conversation tools to facilitate discussions about succeeding in our new workday. The office premises were upgraded with different zones for interaction and concentration to make it more attractive to return to the office when pandemic restrictions were removed. From now on, we will design our future workplace to ensure and maintain a good balance between efficiency, interaction, creativity, competence development, and engagement.\n\n## Results\n\nIn  2021,  an  average  of  85  per  cent  of  employees  completed e-learning courses in ethics, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, anti-terror financing, privacy, and digital trust.\n\nAll  members  of  the  Board  and  senior  management  completed annual courses in ethics, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, terror  financing,  privacy,  and  digital  trust,  as  part  of  the  Group's risk management. Find more information about this in the chapter Corporate governance .\n\nIn 2021, our employees signed off on our privacy and information security  guidelines  through  'Workday',  our  People  system.  All employees must review and confirm the guidelines annually to show that they have read and understood the content.\n\nAn  average  of  80  per  cent  of  employees  responded  to  the employee engagement survey at least once in the last three months throughout 2021. The score for engagement rose from 8.3 to 8.4 out of 10 throughout 2021.\n\nIn 2021, our employee engagement surveys showed an improved score on organisational adaptation (including core values, sustainability, and equality), self-determination, freedom of opinion, relationship with colleagues, support from the leader, and meaningful work tasks. The results showed room for improvement within the physical working environment to meet post-pandemic demands. We conducted several experiments to strengthen agile collaboration and work processes in the organisation. In the latter half of 2021, the scores for workplace environment increased from 7.7 to 8.0 out of 10.",

Appendix\n\n## Diversity and equal opportunities\n\nWhy\n\nStorebrand's  organisation  and  business  should  reflect  our customers and the markets where we operate. Storebrand aims to be a good workplace for everyone, regardless of their background. We strongly believe in building an agile organisation and a culture of trust, inclusion, and belonging. External independent sustainability analyses also show that companies that focus on diversity are more innovative and profitable. We depend on attracting the best talent to create a brighter future for our customers, employees, and society.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe strive to be an organisation characterised by inclusion and a sense of belonging. All employees shall be treated on equal terms regardless of age, gender, disability, cultural background, religious belief, or sexual orientation, both in recruitment processes and throughout  their  employment.  We  practice  zero-tolerance  for harassment and discrimination.\n\nOur  goal  is  to  achieve  greater  diversity  and  equal  distribution of men and women in senior positions in all parts of the Group. Several initiatives have been implemented, including increasing the proportion of women assigned to development programmes and promoted to leadership positions. For the Board of Storebrand ASA, the requirement is that each gender should be represented by at least 40 per cent.\n\nWe contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goal number 5, gender equality, by promoting gender equality in the workplace. At Storebrand, we practice equal pay for equal work.\n\nWe work actively towards equal opportunities and gender balance in work and economic life (target 5.5). Our goal is a 50/50 distribution of men and women in leading positions, an equal distribution of men and women in our management development programmes, as well as recruitment processes for management positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe aim to achieve decent work for all our employees. We have a goal of equal pay for work of equal value (target 8.5). Our policy on discrimination and our active promotion of  good  health  and  well-being  at  work support these objectives.\n\nThe proportion of female managers as of 31 December 2020 was 38 per cent at management levels 1 to 4, i.e. below the target of at least 40 per cent female managers at these levels. In 2021, we initiated a number of measures to become a more inclusive and equal organisation. At the end of 2021, the proportion of female leaders at levels 1 to 4 was 39 per cent.\n\n## Approach\n\nStorebrand works systematically to ensure diversity and equality through clearly defined processes in recruitment, reorganisations, salary  adjustments,  leadership  training,  and  other  development initiatives.  Storebrand's  CEO  reports  to  the  Board  on  several sustainability indicators. In 2021, one goal was to strengthen gender equality  in  the  company,  aiming  to  achieve  at  least  40  per  cent women  at  management  levels  1-4.  A  Group  diversity  committee worked on several initiatives dedicated to diversity, inclusion, and belonging in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, we started the Storebrand Inclusive Leadership Program, delivered by Skillhus AS, an external partner.\n\nOn the International Women's Day 8 March, we launched a new mentoring programme for women.\n\nWe work actively to achieve a gender balance through targeted recruitment initiatives and by nominating an equal number of women and  men  for  leadership  positions  and  leadership  development programmes.  Candidates  and  employees  should  experience  a transparent and inclusive recruitment process.\n\nIn  June  2021,  we  committed  to  putting  gender  equality  on  the agenda by signing the manifest Women in Finance Charter Norway. Signatory companies are committed to setting internal goals for gender balance at management levels and in specialist positions, having a dedicated manager, publishing gender balance status and following up commitments regularly, and linking this to remuneration when achieving targets.\n\nStorebrand has participated in the (tripartite) programme Inclusive Working  Life  (IA)  since  2002.  The  programme  assumes  that work promotes good health and well-being and that early, active intervention  can  prevent  absence.  The  Group's  managers  have established procedures for follow-up of employees in the event of illness.\n\nAs psychological safety is a prerequisite for diversity and inclusion, we increased our focus on raising knowledge about psychological safety through sharing content on our internal social media channels last year.

Appendix\n\ninclusion was also a theme in more than 20 management groups, business units, and teams across the organisation.\n\nThroughout  2021,  we  improved  our  recruitment  and  interview process  to  make  it  as  digitally  inclusive  and  gender-neutral  as possible at every stage. The interview team shall consist of women and men, and there must be at least one female and one male candidate in the final round for leadership positions. In addition, in 2021 we entered into a collaboration with the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) to employ people with reduced working capacity or persons who, for various reasons, had been outside the labour market for a prolonged period. The objective was to offer the best and most inclusive journey for potential candidates and help Storebrand become an attractive and inclusive workplace. We  offer  permanent  employees  paid  parental  leave  beyond  the statutory  requirements  of  Norway  and  Sweden  and  pay  100  per cent salary during parental leave for all employees, regardless of gender.\n\n## Results\n\nTen  women  from  different  parts  of  the  Group  were  selected to  participate  in  FiftyFifty,  a  talent  and  leadership  development programme  for  women,  in  2021.  Storebrand  initiated  the programme in cooperation with external partners as part of our 250th  anniversary  in  2017.  AFF,  a  leadership  and  organisational development  consultancy  in  Norway,  is  now  in  charge  of  the programme.  The  75  participants  from  nine  different  companies in the programme collaborate to develop initiatives that promote equality for themselves, their companies, and society.\n\nFor  the  mentoring  programme  for  women,  we  received  over  50 applications. We established 35 mentor pairs across the Group with participants from Norway and Sweden.\n\nAs many as 90 leaders completed the course Storebrand Inclusive Management in 2021, where leaders in groups of 15 participants attended  six  digital  gatherings  addressing  how  leaders  can contribute to building an inclusive organisation. The course was developed based on a successful pilot in the spring of 2021. The programme continues in 2022.\n\nThe goal is to ensure at least 40 per cent female participation in our  leadership  and  talent  development  programmes.  Among the  participants  in  the  Storebrand  Academy,  40  per  cent  were women and 60 per cent men. In the Storebrand Leadership Weekly Programme, 60 per cent were women and 40 per cent men. An equal number of women and men attended our summer internship programme,  Sandbox.  In  the  graduate  programme  Storebrand Future Impact, the female share of participants were 75 per cent and the remaining 25 per cent were men.\n\nAt the end of 2021, we had four employees recruited through our cooperation with the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV). The arrangement contributes to an increased understanding of diversity and creates a more inclusive work environment.\n\nIn 2021, the Board received regular reports on the share of female managers at management levels 1-4. At the end of 2021, 39 per cent of managers at these levels were women.\n\nAt the end of the year, the share of women among all Storebrand managers (management levels 1-6) was 37 per cent. Three out of nine members (33 per cent) of the Group Executive Management were women. Among the managers who reported directly to the Group Executive  management, 37 per cent  were  women.  50  per cent of the Board directors of Storebrand ASA were women.\n\nWhen  recruiting  for  management  positions  in  2021,  we  invited at least one female and one male candidate in the final round of interviews.\n\nWe reviewed the Group's salary levels in connection with the wage adjustment  process  in  2021.  The  review  showed  slightly  lower average earnings among female employees than male employees. The  finding  led  to  several  measures,  including  an  annual  salary revision involving business unit leaders and executive managers. In addition, we introduced changes to our recruitment, development, and succession planning processes to make them more inclusive. We will continue with these measures in 2022.\n\nIn our employee surveys in Peakon, questions related to gender equality  and  inclusion  achieved  a  steady  score  of  8.7  out  of  10 throughout 2021.\n\nThe average age of Storebrand Group employees was 43 years at the end of the year. The average tenure was ten years in Norway and nine years in Sweden.\n\nPer 31 December 2021, the Storebrand Group had a total of 1,914 employees. There was a good gender balance among permanent employees in both Norway and Sweden, as shown in the table below.\n\nSick leave has been low and stable for several years. In 2021, the absence rate  was  2.5  per  cent  in  our  Norwegian  operations  and 1.6 per cent in our Swedish operations. No physical injuries were reported in the Storebrand Group in 2021.\n\n## Gender distribution *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * All figures are permanent employees only as of 31.12.21.

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance and compliance: Privacy and digital trust\n\nEthical guidelines and ethical practices at all levels of the organisation are  prerequisites  for  gaining  trust  from  customers,  authorities, shareholders, and society in general. Our guidelines and routines apply to all levels of our organisation and aim to guide the behaviour and decisions of our employees.\n\n## Why\n\nWe live in a digital world with an increasing risk that personal data may go astray, be stolen or be shared without our consent. Our customers must feel certain that their personal data are in safe hands and handled in a responsible manner. Therefore, we rely on proper security measures, established procedures and processes for privacy security. Moreover, our employees receive training in how to handle of personal and sensitive information in a prudent manner.\n\nNew  technology,  combined  with  smart  use  of  information  and personal data, enables us to better understand our customers and their needs. So long as our customers continue to trust us with their data, we can use this technology to develop better, more relevant and more customer-oriented products and services.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nOur  ambition  is  to  engage  our  customers  and  build  long-term relationships  by  delivering  first-class  customer  experience  across all channels. This requires us to safeguard our customers' rights in accordance with the Personal Data Act. 19\n\n## Approach\n\nIn our privacy guidelines, you will find purpose limitation, a description of roles and responsibilities and requirements for data processing. We work systematically with information security. Through an internal control system, we set requirements for, monitor, and continuously improve privacy security in our own operations, customer solutions and in cooperation with our partners.\n\nIf a personal data breach occurs, and the risk to our customers is  considered  high,  those  affected  will  be  contacted  directly  by phone or email. In such cases, we inform customers about what has happened, what actions we have taken, and, if necessary, what measures the customer should take to protect their personal data.\n\nThe CEO of each of the legal entities in the Group is responsible for the processing of personal data, including ensuring that internal control procedures are implemented and reviewed regularly. All\n\nmanagers are responsible for ensuring that employees with access to personal data have the necessary expertise and are qualified to protect our customers' privacy, as well as to follow our procedures and information security policies.\n\nTraining in information security and privacy is mandatory for all employees and is carried out by e-learning and in thematic groups for each department.\n\nThe protection of personal data and information security is well integrated into our internal control systems and risk management processes. We continuously assess the ongoing privacy risks that our customers are exposed to.\n\nWe update our Privacy Policy when changes are made to the use of personal data, and our online customer portal gives the individual customer a better overview of his/her privacy settings. 20 In addition, on our website we provide advice and recommendations on how our  customers  can  reduce  their  risk  of  online  fraud.  Fraudulent activities online often aim to steal personal information from the victims that may be misused by the fraudsters.\n\nOur approach to securing personal information and other types of information against illegal and unwanted activity, is described further in the chapter Information security .\n\nResults\n\nE-learning courses on privacy issues is mandatory for all employees to complete each year. In addition, departmental training is carried out as needed. 89 per cent of the Group's employees completed a mandatory privacy course in privacy in 2021.\n\nIn  2021, 125 incidents related to the processing of personal data were  reported.  We  reported  31  of  these  as  discrepancies  to  the Data Protection Authority, in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This is an increase in incidents from 2020. The increase is due to both the transition of incidents to a joint technical platform which includes SPP as well as an increased internal awareness of the fact that incidents should be reported.\n\nAll  incidents  from  2021  have  been  handled  properly  and  closed. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority did not issue any fines, warnings, or other actions for Storebrand to take, in order to meet GDPR discrepancies in 2021.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance and compliance: Countering corruption\n\n## Why\n\nCorruption is one of the major causes of poverty in many parts of the world. It is prohibited in all countries where Storebrand operates. Corruption can result in reduced trust in Storebrand as a company, and in the financial and insurance industry in general. Corruption is detrimental to healthy competition in all industries. Therefore, we must work systematically to prevent this form of crime.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nAt Storebrand, we have a zero tolerance for corruption and other economic misconduct. We work methodically to identify areas with increased risk and have taken measures to prevent exploitation. Furthermore, we work systematically with our suppliers and partners to ensure that there is no corruption in our relationship with them, and that they are aware and conscious about how to fight against corruption within their own business.\n\nAll  employees  and  board  members  shall  complete  the  Group's anticorruption programme. Exceptions are made for employees on leave or long-term sick leave.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur  ethical  guidelines  establish  our  expectations  to  how  our employees, temporary staff and consultants should contribute to uncover, reject  and  report  any  attempts  of  corruption  or  corrupt behaviour.  Our  ethical  guidelines  are  approved  by  the  Board of  Storebrand  ASA  and  the  Boards  of  all  subsidiaries.  In  addition to  these  guidelines,  we  have  other  internal  regulations  aimed at  countering  corruption.  The  Group's  compliance  function  is responsible for informing all employees on the Groups work to counter corruption.\n\nThe Group's compliance functions are responsible for information and  training  related  to  anti-corruption  work.  Each  employee  is responsible  for  understanding  and  acting  in  accordance  with our  anti-corruption  guidelines.  Employees  must  also  complete mandatory training each year, and compliance with this procedures is  followed  up  by  management.  New  employees  complete  the\n\nmandatory training as part of their onboarding programme. Employees shall act with integrity and fully disclose any private business agreements or business-related services they provide to companies, individuals, friends or family members.\n\nWe expect that both employees and hired consultants behave in ways suited to build and maintain trust, both in them as individuals, and in the Group as a whole. As a general rule, no one is allowed to receive favours, gifts or invitations from Storebrand's suppliers or business partners. In cases where it may still be accepted, our guidelines  specify  acceptable  threshold  values  in  the  relevant currency for each country.\n\nGifts given on behalf of Storebrand are subject to the same threshold value. No one must give or receive gifts with an expectation of reciprocity, nor achieve any form of advantage, personally or for the benefit of Storebrand's subsidiaries.\n\nAll events held on behalf of Storebrand shall be consistent with our role in society. All content shall be business appropriate and relevant and otherwise adhere to our guidelines for events.\n\nStorebrand has established both an internal and external notification channel.  Employees  who  suspect  corruption  or  other  financial misconduct shall report this using one of our reporting channels. If the report is delivered through our external channel, the one who reports (whistleblower) can choose to remain anonymous.\n\n## Results\n\n89  per  cent  of  the  Group's  employees  completed  a  mandatory course on countering corruption in 2021. 21\n\nNo cases related to corruption were uncovered or reported to the Group in 2021. One case of internal misconduct involving and external partner was uncovered. There were two cases of breaches to  Storebrand's  Code  of  Conduct  and  one  breach  of  internal misconduct.  These  three  matters  were  handled  as  personnel matters with written or oral warnings as a result.\n\n## Breaches to Storebrands Code of Conduct: 22\n\n| Category                            |   Number in 2021 |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Bribery/Corruption                  |                0 |\n| Internal misconduct                 |                1 |\n| Internal misconduct with agents  23 |                1 |\n| Other violations of ethical rules   |                2 |\n| Discrimination                      |                0 |\n\n- 21)  Figures do not include Cubera Private Equity, as this company has its own Anti-corruption Programme.\n\n- 23)  It was registered one internal misconduct at an insurance broker in 2021.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance and compliance: Information security\n\nWhy\n\nAs a financial institution, the Group's digital infrastructure is critical. We are an attractive target for a variety of threat actors, in large due to the nature of our work and the value of our customers, partners, employees,  and  our  position  in  the  market.  Digital  attacks  are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and in combination with hybrid work patterns, this increases the risk of not detecting unwanted activity.  This  challenge  applies  to  Storebrand,  our  partners  and suppliers. If we become a victim of a cyber-attack, the potential consequences may include a temporary loss of services, decline in our customers' trust in us, and high financial costs for restoring our systems and data.\n\nInformation security is about ensuring that information is correct, and  available  only  for  the  people  who  need  to  access  to  the information, when they need it. The Group's approach to ensuring good  information  security  is  through  people,  processes,  and technology. Our business operations largely evolve around the use, communication, and storage of different types of information - both electronically and physically. Therefore, it is highly important for Storebrand to work systematically and continuously with information security. Good information security is a prerequisite for maintaining our customer's trust, the reputation of the Group, and our ability to be competitive and deliver services.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nIn order to engage our customers, whilst developing and building long-term relationships with them, the Group work continuously to deliver  first-class  customer  experiences.  This  requires  us  to  have stable and secure IT-solutions. It is therefore a prerequisite for Storebrand to be able to conduct financial activities, and to increase our  ability  to  innovate,  to  have  and  maintain  good  information security. Our continuous work with information security help us to manage cyber risk, maintain an acceptable threat level, and thus our ability to take care of the information we possess.\n\n## Approach\n\nOne of Storebrand's most important tasks is to maintain and ensure good  solutions  for  an  increasingly  hybrid  workday.  This  means that all employees, no matter where they work from, have access\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto  secure  and  stable  IT  solutions,  that  adhere  to  Storebrand's information security policies and requirements. Additionally, the IT solutions must be able to deal with the dynamic threat landscape that Storebrand, and the financial services industry, is facing. When the  pandemic  hit  in  2020,  Storebrand  put  considerable  effort  in to adapting to new ways of working, new technical solutions and a  distributed  workforce  working  in  several  physical  locations.  It was therefore, and still is, a priority for Storebrand to ensure good information security at home, as well as in the office. In 2021, we were therefore very well equipped to handle a lasting hybrid working life - and 2022 is no different.\n\nThe Group's Security department sets the premise for all security activities in the Group. In the autumn of 2021, we split the security department into two lines of defense. The first  line  of  defense  is an operational unit (Security Operations) in the Storebrand Digital business unit. This unit is responsible for security monitoring, and for detecting and handling incidents. The second line of defense, also called the CISO-function (the Chief Information Security Officerfunction)  is  an  independent  control  function  integrated  in  the Group's Governance, Risk & Compliance-function. This means that the CISO-function is at the same level as other independent control functions  in  the  Group.  The  responsibility  of  the  CISO-function includes security governance, offensive security, and resilience and continuity management. The CISO reports directly to the Board and the CEO's of the Group's subsidiaries, on topics such as changes to the threat landscape and cyber risk. The Group's board and executive management has defined cyber risk as the highest operational risk in the Group. Information security and the management of cyber risk is by this given high priority in the Group.\n\nThe  Group  has  an  Information  Security  Management  System (ISMS),  which  is  based  upon  specifications  and  requirements  set out in ISO/IEC27001/2, an internationally recognised standard for information security. 24 The ISMS is an internal control system that ensures that Storebrand has a systematic and verifiable approach to information security. The ISMS makes it possible for the Group to  adjust  the  requirements  we  set  for  information  security  when needed. The management system is a fundamental part of the Group's risk-based approach to business operations. All business\n\n16.4 We are committed to combating financial crime.\n\n16.5 We are committed to combating corruption and bribery in all their forms.\n\n16.6 We are committed to developing effective, accountable and transparent companies.",

Appendix\n\nareas  in  Storebrand  are  required  to  follow  best  practices  for information security as described in the management system. The system  sets  requirements,  verifies,  and  continuously  improves information security in our daily routines, customer solutions and in collaboration with our partners. Additionally, information security is well integrated into our risk management processes.\n\nThe Group faces a complex and dynamic threat landscape where we  experience  daily  attempts  of  cyber-attacks.  The  techniques used for cyber-attacks vary from attempts of social engineering to threat actors attempting to break into our IT systems. A common denominator is that the attacks are becoming increasingly advanced and hard to detect. Cooperation with external parties, partners and authorities has been, and continue to be, a crucial factor of success in managing cyber risk and potential threats.\n\nDuring  2021,  the  Group  has  implemented  several  measures  to identify, protect, detect, respond to- and recover from potential cyber-attacks. One such effort, has been the strengthening of the Group's efforts in the area of resilience and business continuity. A new Head of Resilience & Business continuity has been employed, and dedicated resources for resilience and business continuity has been appointed in each of the business units within the Group. In  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  the  Group  also  conducted  a  crisis management exercise, based on a complex cyber-attack-scenario, targeting critical parts of the Group's infrastructure.\n\nStorebrand has established a separate first line of defense function for handling security incidents, CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team). The team is actively searching for potential threats to, and vulnerabilities within, our systems, and responds to all tips regarding incidents, breaches and/or attacks. In addition, Storebrand\n\nis a member of the Nordic Financial CERT, a joint Nordic operations center that shares information regarding threats, attacks, and other activities among Nordic financial institutions. Storebrand contributes with information sharing in the network. In this way, we help to map and understand developments within the threat landscape, both internally and externally.\n\nKnowledgeable, motivated, and aware employees are an important part of Storebrand's preventive security work, thus we updated our security culture program strategy in 2021. For eight years in a row, the Group spent October focusing our efforts on our annual Security Awareness Month. The theme for 2021 was 'Security outside the office,'  addressing risks and security challenges with a distributed workforce and hybrid working model.\n\n## Results\n\nThe ever-changing threat landscape the Group is facing, requires a well-established risk management system for information security. Storebrand  therefore  works  continuously  with  areas  such  as awareness and training, management and control, resilience and continuity, threat intelligence, and incident management, amongst others.\n\nWe  will  continue  this  work  in  2022.  In  particular,  the  Group  will focus on improving our Business Continuity Management System (BCMS), which is based on requirements set out in the standard ISO 22301 25 . This is a mutually compatible management system with our ISMS. Whilst the ISMS works to manage risk ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information, the BCMS manages risks of major deviations and disasters that may lead to significant loss, disruption or re-organisation of key business processes.",

Therefore, we have a clear responsibility to avoid being used in connection with the financing of terrorism, money laundering or other forms of financial crime. Our stakeholders expect us to handle this in a serious  manner  in  accordance  with  our  responsibilities.  Good routines and management focus on anti-money laundering (AML) are important for maintaining our reputation.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nStorebrand shall act consistently and in compliance with all relevant legislation  related  to  money  laundering,  terror  financing  and financial crime in general.\n\nWe work systematically to ensure that our companies are not used for money laundering, terror financing or other forms of financial crime. All employees must carry out mandatory training each year.\n\n## Approach\n\nWe have established policies to avoid money laundering and terror financing. The guidelines have been reviewed and approved by the Board of Storebrand ASA and are based on our Code of Conduct and relevant legislation. These guidelines and additional measures have been implemented throughout the Group.\n\nEach company in the Group conducts an annual assessment of risks related to the possibility of money laundering, financial crime, and  terror  financing.  We  have  established  clear  frameworks  and procedures  for  managing  such  risks.  These  include  procedures related  to  the  establishment  of  new  customer  relationships  as well as ongoing reviews of customers who are believed to pose a risk. We conduct internal audits and regular reports to identify and report suspicious transactions or behaviour.\n\nAny activity that we suspect is in breach of the Norwegian AntiMoney Laundering Act of 2018 is reported to the police.\n\nAll  employees  are  required  to  familiarise  themselves  with  our guidelines  for  preventing  financial  crime  and  shall  complete  our mandatory training program on AML and terror financing. All new employees complete mandatory training as part of their onboarding process.\n\nThe training also provides employees with a basic understanding of the regulatory framework concerning financial crime and terror financing, as well as our requirements to employees and managers. Senior managers and board members for the Group, and for each subsidiary also receive mandatory training in AML, financial crime, and terror financing.\n\nMeasures to prevent money laundering, financial crime and terror financing are described on the Group intranet, along with information on what we expect from our employees in terms of responsible business conduct. The information applies to all companies in the Group.\n\nStorebrand  is  a  member  of  Finance  Norway's  economic  crime committee. The committee cooperates closely with the authorities in Norway and provides guidance to all member companies.\n\nResults\n\nIn 2021, 15 cases related to suspected financial crime were reported to the police's Norwegian National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime, while 28 cases related to suspected fraud were reported directly to the police. The severity of the cases varied, from suspicion of money laundering, terror  financing  and  tax  evasion  to  falsifying  documents  and attempted insurance fraud.\n\nIn 2021, 90 per cent of our employees completed the mandatory training course in anti-money laundering, financial crime, and terror financing.",

Appendix\n\n## Responsible use of resources\n\n## Why\n\nAt  Storebrand,  sustainability  is  an  integral  part  of  our  business strategy. We express clear expectations to the companies we invest in, our suppliers and partners. At the same time, we want to act as an example to follow. That is why we work to ensure that our own operations are as sustainable as possible.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe are committed to setting science-based targets for our emissions, in line with the Paris Agreement. The plan is to set science-based targets  in  line  with  the  1.5-degree  target  for  the  entire  business, including our own operations, by 2022. 26 For our own operations, we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7.6 per cent per annum with 2019 as a baseline year, in line with the 1.5-degree target and the findings of the UN Emissions Gap Report 2019. 27\n\nWe  continuously  work  to  become  more  energy  efficient,  reduce waste production, increase the proportion of waste sorted, and reduce our carbon footprint in connection with business travel and commuting.\n\n## Approach\n\nAs early as 2008, Storebrand became Norway's first 'climate neutral' financial  group,  through  reducing  emissions  and  purchasing carbon quotas to compensate for emissions related to our own operations. 28 In 2020, we took this work further and decided on a new climate policy that applies to the whole group. We will impose strict requirements on ourselves and our suppliers and set specific targets to minimise our carbon footprint.\n\nWe use the precautionary principle when it comes to environmental management.  Since  2009,  Storebrand  has  been  eco-lighthouse certified, and we report publicly on our environmental impact every year.\n\nA dedicated department oversees energy and water consumption, waste production and levels of waste sorting in the office premises to  ensure  that  we  reach  the  lowest  possible  footprint.  We  buy electricity  from  renewable  energy  sources  through  purchasing guarantees of origin.\n\nWe encourage employees to use video conferencing for meeting activities to reduce the scope of business travel. We introduced an internal carbon tax on flights of NOK 1,000 per tonne of CO2 in 2020. The cost is charged to the employee's business department and is followed up by management in a newly established system, which ensures increased insight into our travel habits. The funds from the carbon tax are used to buy climate quotas and for other climate-\n\n12.5 We aim to significantly reduce the amount of waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. 12.6  We  encourage  companies  to  implement sustainability in their practices.\n\n13.1 We strengthen our ability to withstand and adapt to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in our business and in our investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13.2 We incorporate action on climate change into our policies, strategies and plans.\n\nrelated projects. Due to Covid-19, the number of flights carried out by employees at Storebrand were reduced to a minimum in 2020, but  increased  somewhat  towards  the  end  of  2021.  However,  we updated our policies to encourage employees to assess the need for travel, and to use public transport in the event of necessary travel. In addition, we expanded our electric car and electric bike fleet. In 2021, employees were given the opportunity to buy private electric bikes at a discounted price with an interest-free loan from Storebrand. During the year, all meeting rooms in our headquarter in Lysaker were equipped with video equipment. The refurbishment of the headquarter in Stockholm will be completed in 2022, including updated video equipment in the meeting rooms.\n\nIn order to reduce unnecessary waste, we have decided to remove all  disposable  cups  from  our  offices.  Employees  who  bring  their own cup receive a discount in the coffee shop at our main office. In addition, we introduced environmental labelling of the food in the cafeteria in order to raise awareness among employees on emissions associated with different types of foods.\n\nEmissions that we are unable to reduce through our own operations are compensated by purchasing emission quotas and investing in carbon-positive projects.\n\n## Results\n\nDue  to  Covid-19,  emissions  from  operations  and  the  number  of business trips were significantly reduced in 2021. Internal carbon pricing  and new travel guidelines were introduced. 27 employees used the offer to buy electric bikes for personal use at a discounted rate, financed with an interest-free loan from Storebrand.\n\nIn 2021, Storebrand ordered the planting of 42,500 mangrove trees. Since 2020, we have planted 73,750 trees through the Worldview Foundation. We have also purchased climate quotas from a forest conservation project in Kenya through Wildlife Works and ordered negative emission quotas from Climeworks through direct carbon capture and storage.\n\n40",

Appendix\n\n## Sustainable practices through our value chain\n\nWhy\n\nProcurement is an area where we can have a major impact by influencing our suppliers towards more sustainable practices. We have increased the use of outsourcing in order to focus internal resources  on  core  business  activities  and  to  ensure  efficient operations. This requires proper procedures for the monitoring of working conditions, safeguarding human rights, and managing environmental issues throughout the value chain.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nA key objective is to avoid the use of suppliers whose production processes or products violate international agreements, national legislation, or Storebrand's internal guidelines. Through our own activities and procurement activities, we aim to contribute to sustainable development, and to ensure that human rights and workers' rights are not infringed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur ambition for 2021 was to maintain the share of environmentally certified  purchasing  volume  of  at  least  60  per  cent,  following  our achievement of this target in 2020. 29 Even though we achieved the target of purchasing volume from environmentally certified suppliers in  2021,  the  dynamics  of  our  supply  chain  and  market  conditions still  make the 60 per cent target challenging. Therefore, our aim is to work on maintaining a share of purchases from environmentally certified suppliers of over 60 per cent.\n\nWe  have  defined  three  specific  climate  targets  for  suppliers  and partners:\n\n- \u00b7 By  2025,  the  goal  is  that  all  suppliers  have  set  short-  and medium-term verifiable emission reduction targets.\n- \u00b7 By 2025, the goal is that all suppliers will be climate neutral. 30\n- \u00b7 By 2030, the goal is that the entire value chain for our deliveries will be climate neutral\n\n## Approach\n\nWe set clear requirements to our suppliers and business partners in Storebrand's Standard Annex for Sustainability. This is an annex to all tender requests and supplier contracts. In addition to following our internal procurement guidelines, a key principle is that goods and  services  purchased  shall  support  our  key  objective  of  cost effective,  sustainable  business  operations.  Storebrand  shall  not purchase goods or services from companies listed on Storebrand Asset Management's exclusion list. 31 Our purchasing policy is based on the Group's governing documents and related procedures, which are revised annually. 32\n\nWe have developed a framework for follow-up and evaluation of suppliers. Our approach focuses on collaboration for continuous improvement  when  it  comes  to  sustainability,  defined  by  the questions  we  ask  suppliers  and  partners.  Our  approach  to sustainable procurement follows the same three-folded strategy as our work with active ownership towards companies we are invested in.\n\nWe select - Sustainability is weighted at least at least 20 per cent in our tender processes. Through the supplier mapping and evaluation, we give an advantage to suppliers that perform well on sustainability.\n\nWe work actively to influence -  We  use  our  position  as  a  major buyer to influence suppliers and business partners for improvement. We do this both when we consider entering into new agreements and evaluating existing ones.\n\n8.7 Through our procurement practices, we strive to contribute to effective efforts to end modern slavery and eliminate child labour in our value chain. 8.8 We aim to protect workers' rights and promote a safe and secure working environment for all employees, contractors, and suppliers.\n\n12.5 We aim to significantly reduce the amount of waste through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse in the supply chain.\n\n12.6 We encourage companies to introduce sustainable working methods and integrate information about sustainability into their reporting routines. 12.7 We promote sustainable procurement practices.\n\n13.2 We incorporate action on climate change into our policies, strategies and plans.\n\n- 29)  Eco-Lighthouse, EMAS, ISO14001 and Swan Mark",

Appendix\n\nWe exclude - Storebrand shall not choose vendors, products or services that are in violation of international agreements, national regulations or internal policies. This is described in our sourcing principles.\n\nWe map all suppliers with annual sales volume to Storebrand of more than 1 million NOK, through a questionnaire divided into the following main areas related to sustainability:\n\n- \u00b7 How sustainability is integrated into suppliers' strategies\n- \u00b7 Environmental performance over time and targets\n- \u00b7 Diversity performance over time and targets\n- \u00b7 Environmental, quality and management systems\n\nTo  measure  progress,  annual  reporting  on  sustainability  will  be monitored each year. An extended set of questions is also used to evaluate suppliers in purchasing processes.\n\nOur most important and largest purchases include contracting IT and business processes, healthcare, damage settlement in insurance and  management  of  direct  real  estate  investments.  The  areas considered to entail the greatest risk and impact on sustainability are outsourcing (including offshoring), damage settlement (car and property), and property management in general.\n\n## Results\n\nIn 2021, contracts worth more than NOK 1 million totaled around NOK 3.34 billion. This accounts for more than 91 per cent of our total  purchasing  volume  and  includes  the  management  and development of direct real estate investments. Of this volume, 60.3 per  cent  comprise  suppliers  that  are  environmentally  certified  in accordance with our purchasing policy. This volume is divided into 339 suppliers, of which 68 (20 per cent) are certified according to a recognised environmental management standard.\n\nIn  2021,  we  worked actively with larger and strategic suppliers to promote our goal of achieving a carbon-neutral purchasing portfolio. Through  these  dialogues,  we  experienced  a  large  commitment among suppliers to be carbon neutral by 2025. We also conducted a survey among suppliers with more than NOK 1 million in turnover. Many suppliers found that it was demanding to answer the survey. We therefore see a need to standardise reporting. In collaboration with suppliers, we will in 2022 continue to look for more appropriate ways to collect information and standardise reporting.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate social responsibility\n\nWhy\n\nAs a leading financial institution in Norway and Sweden, we have an important social responsibility. The sustainability work means that we are actively engaged in the society we operate in through our primary business as a provider of financial services to over 2 million customers in Norway and Sweden, as a responsible employer, and by engaging in socially beneficial activities beyond this.\n\n## Goals and ambitions\n\nWe  will  take  social  responsibility  by  providing  financial  support and knowledge about sustainability. We also want to enable more employees to spend time on activities related to corporate social responsibility.\n\n## Approach\n\nUngt  Entrepren\u00f8rskap  ('Young  Entrepreneurship')  is  a  non-profit organisation that encourages young students to establish and run their own businesses. We have helped create a sustainability award to stimulate young students' engagement to continue to want to learn how to run a sustainable business. In 2021, we introduced a two-day program for youth companies where the students had the  opportunity  to  discuss  their  ideas  with  a  jury  consisting  of employees in Storebrand. The jury gave advice and feedback on how sustainable and feasible the young students' ideas were. Financial support and mentorship were given to the youth companies that had the best ideas.\n\nEvery  six  months,  Storebrand  organises  the  'We  cheer  on'competition.  This  is  a  social  responsibility  initiative  where  we provide financial support for various social projects that contributes to  making  a  future  to  look  forward  to.  Financial  support  can  be given  to  projects  both  in  Norway  and  abroad.  Volunteering  is  an important part of Norwegian culture, and a great deal of volunteer work is done annually, including in sports and leisure activities. This is something we want to support.\n\nIn 2021,  Storebrand  collaborated  with  Goodify  to  motivate employees to participate more actively in volunteering and carry out good deeds in society.\n\n## Results\n\nAs  many as 318 youth companies competed in the sustainability category through Ungt Entrepren\u00f8rskap ('Young Entrepreneurship'), in 2021. Cycle UB won the award for the development of a solution for  collecting  and  utilising  sludge  from  fish  farms.  The  prototype managed to collect as much as 42 per cent of the sludge that comes from fish farms. Additionally, they had thought about how to make the process circular, by reusing the sluge for fish feed as well as for\n\nbiogas used to operate the solution. Cycle UB's product solution can help to solve a global problem in the aquaculture industry, that has major environmental consequences.\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  two-day  program  for  'youth  companies',  we selected 10 winners that received a total of NOK 50 000 stipend for their ideas. In addition to the stipend, the youth companies were offered a few hours of mentorship with a Storebrand employee to further develop their ideas, service design, upscaling, and strategy.\n\nIn 2021, NOK 500 000 was awarded to 23 'We cheer on' projects around Norway, and 400 000 SEK were awarded to similar projects in Sweden. All the projects contributed to a future to look forward to.\n\nIn cooperation with Goodify we launched an internal competition over four weeks around Christmas that we called 'GoodieChallenge'. Employees who perfomed good deeds in this period earned points and could win small gifts. 44 unique deeds were performed and a total of 86 employees downloaded the Goodify app.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our  goal  is  to  deliver  sustainable  solutions  tailored  to the customer's individual needs. This is how we create value for customers, shareholders, and society.\n\nStorebrand follows a two-fold strategy that provides an attractive combination  of  self-funded  growth  within  what  we  call  Future Storebrand,  and  capital  release  from  the  guaranteed  pensions business which is in run-off.\n\n## Storebrand aims to:\n\n(A) be the leading provider of occupational pensions in both Norway and Sweden\n\n(B)  continue  a  strategy  of  building  a  Nordic  powerhouse  in  asset management\n\n(C) ensure rapid growth as a challenger in the Norwegian retail market for financial services\n\nThe interaction between our business areas provides synergies in the form of capital, economies of scale, and value creation based on\n\ncustomer insight. We are well on the way to achieve our ambition to deliver a group profit (before amortisation and tax) of more than NOK 4 billion in 2023.\n\nWe believe the only way to secure a better future is to take part in creating it. We seek to actively use our position to lead the way in  sustainable  value  creation  and  to  differentiate  ourselves  from competitors. Read more about our work with social responsibility in the chapters Customer relations, People, and Keeping our house in order.\n\nStorebrand  offers  financial  products,  services,  and  customer experiences.  Based  on  an  increasingly  advanced  technology platform, we offer a fully digital business and distribution model. Our position as a digital frontrunner will be a critical success factor in strengthening our competitiveness in the years to come.\n\nWe aim to both grow the ordinary dividend from our earnings and to ensure capital-efficient management of products with interest rate guarantees. Our goal is to release an estimated NOK 10 billion of capital by 2030, while maintaining a strong solvency position and a balance sheet adapted to our risk and business.",

Appendix\n\n## Strategic highlights 2021\n\nIn 2021, we shifted into an even higher gear ensuring increased speed and growth. With a strong solvency ratio, a stable financial market that developed positively, and a balance sheet where the share of Defined Contribution pensions in growth exceeded the share of guaranteed pensions in run-off, we were able to strengthen our focus and deliveries in our growth strategy. Strong growth in the core business contributed to a larger customer base, an increased operating profit for the Group, as well as higher dividends to our shareholders.\n\nThe  summer  of  2021  marked  a  positive  reopening  of  the  economy after a prolonged period of restrictive measures due to the Covid19 pandemic. However, by the end of the year, the outbreak of the Omicron variant contributed to renewed insecurity in the society and a need for new infection control measures. Storebrand has maintained operations fully and we have continued to follow our strategy throughout the period. The main impact of Covid-19 on Storebrand's business is the increased risk of lower employment and more disability in society, which can lead to higher claims. In response to this, Storebrand has made the necessary adjustments in provisions and prices. Throughout the pandemic, we have managed volatile markets and adapted our portfolios to ensure a good return on both our customers' funds and our own financial investments.\n\n## Growth in capital-light business areas in the front book\n\nThe core of Storebrand's strategy is to gather and manage savings from pension and institutional customers in Norway and Sweden, as well as retail customers in Norway. By the end of 2021, we reached a milestone by managing more than NOK 1,000 million of assets, managing a total of  NOK  1,097  million  of  assets.  This  is  our  main  revenue  driver.  In addition, we will build on existing savings and pension relationships with individuals by offering related products and solutions within retail insurance and banking in Norway.\n\n## Leading provider of occupational pensions in Norway and Sweden\n\nIn  2021,  we  once  again  delivered  the  market's  best  return  to  our Defined  Contribution  pension  customers,  compared  to  comparable investment profiles. This applies to both our largest and most common investment  profiles  with  high  and  moderate  equity  content,  which achieved  a  return  of  20.6  per  cent  and  13.4  per  cent,  respectively. The return on the profiles is also the market's best over the last three and  five  years.  Norwegian  customers  also  received  their  Individual Pension Accounts in 2021. Employees' funds from previous pension capital  certificates  were  combined  into  the  same  account  as  their active Defined Contribution account they have with current employers.\n\nThe vast majority of employees at Storebrand's corporate customers chose to continue pension savings through employers' agreements with us. Only 2.5 per cent chose to move pension management to an alternative provider. For Storebrand, the total one-off effect from the automatic transfer of pension capital certificates was NOK -6 billion in net transferred capital.\n\nAfter consolidation in the market and intense competition ahead of the introduction of the Individual Pension Account, Storebrand was the second largest provider of Defined Contribution pensions at the end of 2021, with a market share of 27 per cent (by the end of Q3). In December, Storebrand entered into an agreement to buy Danica, Norway's  sixth  largest  provider  of  Defined  Contribution  pensions with a 5 per cent market share. Approval of the transaction from the authorities  is  expected  in  the  first  half  of  2022.  Through  Danica,  we will strengthen our presence in the market for small and mediumsized companies and increase distribution power. In total, Storebrand managed NOK 158 billion within Unit Linked products in Norway at the end of the year.\n\nAt the same time, we strengthened our position in the market for public sector occupational pensions, where we won tenders that will give us a total of NOK 5.5 billion in transferred reserves at the beginning of 2022. We also took over the management of closed pension funds that contribute to earnings growth in the area Guaranteed pension.\n\nSPP continued to grow in the Swedish pension market, supported by being the most sustainable and digitally innovative provider. The 'H\u00e5llbarhetskartan' ('Sustainability Map') was launched in early 2021. The service provides companies and their employees with information about  the  sustainability  profile  in  their  pension  savings.  We  also continued to attract customers in the transfer market, but intense competition resulted in a net transfer of funds of NOK -4 billion. Despite this, SPP delivered its strongest result ever and total funds in Unit Linked insurance grew to NOK 150 billion. The ongoing capital release from guaranteed products in run-off resulted in a dividend corresponding to 137 per cent of the result for 2021.\n\nStorebrand also provided insurance coverage to corporate customers equivalent to NOK 2 billion in insurance premiums in 2021. At the same time, we launched our P&C insurance offering for small and mediumsized companies. Together with contracts taken over from Insr through the year, these amounted to NOK 217 million in written premiums at the end of 2021.",

We also entered into Nordic partnerships in infrastructure investments and continued our focus on Private Equity through Cubera.  In  total,  we  raised  NOK  9  billion  in  customer  funds within  alternative  investments.  Among  our  active  funds,  several funds  achieved  significant  excess  returns  for  our  customers,  and contributed to earnings growth from performance-based fees. The main contributor was SKAGEN Global which had an excess return of about 12 per cent compared with the benchmark index.\n\nTo strengthen the distribution of funds in the international market, we launched several of our most sustainable funds on The Asset Management Exchange (AMX) in Ireland. This opened for several British pension funds to consider Storebrand as an asset manager. At  the  end  of  2021,  new  platforms  in  Ireland  and  Luxembourg accounted for NOK 11 billion of total assets.\n\nWe also took further steps to consolidate our position as a world leader in sustainable investment. At the end of the year, we managed NOK 483 billion in fossil-free investments, and NOK 123 billion in solutions. Solutions are defined as either investments in companies that Storebrand's investment team believes contribute to sustainable development and help us achieve the UN's sustainability goals, or through investments in green bonds, environmentally certified real estate and green infrastructure. By 2025, we aim to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions from investments in equities, bonds and real estate by 32 per cent. In the same period, we will increase the proportion of investments in solutions to 15 per cent.",

Appendix\n\n## Growing challenger in the Norwegian retail market\n\nThrough our corporate pensions and asset management offering, we  leverage  both  systems  and  solutions  to  deliver  savings  and insurance products in the retail market. Together with our retail bank,  Storebrand  offers  a  digital  one-stop-shop  with  integrated value propositions and cross-selling opportunities.\n\nWith  250  years  of  history,  the  Storebrand  brand  name  stands strong  in  society.  In  Norway,  1.3  million  people  are  customers  of Storebrand through their pension savings. They are our main target group for additional financial services that enable them to achieve greater security and financial wellness.\n\nThe combination of an increased distribution power, acquisition of customer portfolios and strong demand in the retail market contributed to an exceptionally strong growth in 2021. The profit from  the  retail  market  increased  by  as  much  as  42  per  cent compared with the previous year, mainly driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 72 per cent growth in net sales of fund-based savings to NOK 4.2 billion, and 24 per cent growth in assets under management, which amounted to NOK 52 billion at the end of the year.\n- \u00b7 Growth in the bank's mortgage loan balance for by 15 per cent, to NOK 57 billion.\n- \u00b7 Premium  growth  of  more  than  NOK  1  billion  within  P&C insurance and private risk coverage. This corresponds to a growth of 54 per cent, of which approximately 28 per cent of the growth came from the Insr portfolio and organic growth amounted to 26 per cent.\n\n## Leadership in sustainability\n\nFor  the  past  25  years,  Storebrand  has  pioneered  sustainable investments to increase value creation. We strive to create value beyond  financial  returns.  Our  sustainable  investments  and enhanced sustainability funds grew substantially in 2021. We believe that our leading position in sustainable value creation will increase value for our customers and create positive ripple effects for society. We are committed to the Paris Agreement throughout our value chain. We are also constantly developing our work to assess climate as a financial risk. We have incorporated climate risk assessments into our ongoing risk monitoring, management and reporting to supervisory  authorities.  Storebrand  is  determined  to  lead  and develop the sustainability agenda within the financial industry in the years to come.\n\nOur  sustainability  position  has  been  highly  recognised  in  2021. Storebrand was once again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index,  recognised  among  the  top  10  per  cent  most  sustainable companies in the world. Corporate Knights also rated Storebrand as the world's most sustainable insurance company in its Global 100 ranking for a third consecutive year. Our employee satisfaction surveys show that Storebrand employees are proud to be a part of the company, and that our work on sustainability makes their job more meaningful. Our position on sustainability also attracts an increasing number of international talents.\n\nMore information about our sustainability work is discussed in the chapters Driving Force for Sustainable Investments , Climate risks and opportunities , and in the chapter Keeping our house in order .\n\n## Digital frontrunner\n\nThe use of technology makes it possible to combine growth initiatives and measures for increased competitiveness, while at the same time realising cost reductions and efficiency gains. Smart use of data paves the way for new business opportunities and efficiency gains, both through digitalisation and automation. Storebrand is adopting modern cloud solutions, enabling faster time-to-market and better access to new digital capabilities.\n\nDigital sales of insurance and savings have increased by 32 and 38 per cent, respectively, over the past year. The digital sales share in our own channels accounted for 40 per cent of the total volume for both insurance and savings.\n\nThe degree of automation when establishing an Individual Pension Account and merging customers' pension funds was over 99 per cent. In SPP, the proportion of individuals who retire digitally has increased from 15 per cent to 80 per cent in 2021. Through the use of machine learning, we have improved the price model for pension  related  disability  insurance  by  15  per  cent  and  artificial intelligence means that we now detect 10 per cent more insurance fraud compared to through traditional techniques. The work with machine learning  and  insurance  fraud  achieved  2nd  place  in  the Dataforeningens Innsiktspris (Data Association's Insight Award) for 2021.\n\nMore information about our digital initiatives is described in the chapter on Customer relations under the section Digital innovator in financial services.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGood corporate governance is important for us to achieve our goals. Storebrand works continuously to improve both the overall decisionmaking processes and the day-to-day management of the company. Read more about our work in the chapter Corporate Governance .\n\n## Management of capital and balance sheet\n\nFor the past ten years, Storebrand has succeeded in transforming its business from capital-intensive products with guaranteed returns, to fast-growing and self-financing capital-light products. Total assets have  more  than  doubled  since  2012.  At  the  end  of  the  year,  73 per cent of the total assets under management were related to the capital-light business, and less than 49 per cent of the pension assets on the balance sheet were guaranteed reserves.",

Appendix\n\nStorebrand is a blend of fast-growing capital-light business that deliver high returns on equity, and capital-intensive run-off business with  low  returns  on  equity.  The  run-off  business  of  guaranteed pensions ties up more than three-quarters of the group's equity and yielded a return on equity of 5 per cent in 2021. The growth business, on the other hand, yielded a return on equity of 33 per cent. 38 The Group's overall return on equity was 10.7 per cent for 2021.\n\nThe solvency ratio was 175 per cent at the end of 2021 - a decrease of  3  percentage  points  from  last  year's  solvency  ratio  including transitional rules at the end of 2020. Without transitional rules, we strengthened the solvency ratio by 9 percentage points from 166 per cent in 2020. Regulatory input factors in the solvency calculation, modelling changes and growth in the business weakened solvency, while a higher interest rate level combined with a good excess return from positive financial markets contributed to increases in the  solvency.  In  total,  new  subordinated  loans  also  contributed 6 percentage points, and we sold AS V\u00e6rdalsbruket, which had a  positive  effect  on  profit  of  NOK  546  million  and  strengthened\n\nsolvency  by  2  percentage  points.  The  result  in  2021  helped  to strengthen the solvency margin by about 12 percentage points.\n\nStorebrand wants to contribute to a growing market for sustainable bonds and stimulate the market for sustainable investments and financing.  As  the  first  Nordic  insurance  company,  Storebrand Livsforsikring  AS  issued  a  green  subordinated  bond  in  the  first quarter of 2021. The bond issue is a non-perpetual subordinated bond of EUR 300 million. The green bond qualifies as Tier 2 capital under the solvency regulations for insurance companies. 39\n\n## Financial targets\n\nStorebrand has the following financial targets:\n\n|                                           | Goal    | Status 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------------|\n| Return on equity  40                      | > 10 %  | 10.7 %        |\n| Future Storebrand (Savings and Insurance) |         | 33 %          |\n| Run-off business (Guaranteed and Other)   |         | 5 %           |\n| Dividend pay-out ratio   41               | > 50 %  | 52 %          |\n| Solvency ratio (Storebrand Group)         | > 150 % | 175 %         |\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  accordance  with  Norwegian  accounting  legislation,  the board of Storebrand ASA confirms that the annual accounts have been prepared on the assumption of continued operations. No significant incidents have occurred after the balance sheet date.\n\nOur financial result is reported by the following business segment: Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pension and Other, as well as on a consolidated Group level.\n\n| NOK million                          | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income        | 6,607  | 5,676  |\n| Insurance result                     | 1,201  | 825    |\n| Operational cost                     | -4,678 | -4,068 |\n| Operating profit                     | 3,130  | 2,433  |\n| Financial items and risk result life | 1,372  | 278    |\n| Profit before amortisation           | 4,503  | 2,711  |\n| Amortisation                         | -527   | -492   |\n| Profit before tax                    | 3,976  | 2,219  |\n| Tax                                  | -846   | 136    |\n| Profit after tax                     | 3,130  | 2,355  |\n\nStorebrand achieved a Group profit (before amortisation) of NOK 4,503 million (NOK 2,711 million). The figures in parentheses show the corresponding figures for last year.\n\nFee and administration income increased by 16 per cent to NOK 6,607 million (NOK 5,676 million), driven mainly by strong underlying growth in assets under management. Excess returns in funds with performance fees contributed NOK 550 million (NOK 234 million). Adjusted for this, the growth was 11 per cent compared to last year.\n\nThe insurance result was NOK 1,201 million (NOK 825 million) and resulted in a combined ratio of 94 per cent (97 per cent). This is somewhat  weaker  than  the  targeted  combined  ratio  of  90-92 per cent. This year's improvement is due to weak results in 2020 in  products  with  disability  coverage  as  a  result  of  the  covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating  expenses  amounted  to  NOK  -4,678  million  (NOK -4,068  million).  Adjusted  for  costs  related  to  acquired  business, performance-related results and currency movements, operating expenses were NOK -4,410 million - in line with the target of keeping costs nominally flat at NOK 4.4 billion for 2021.\n\nTotal operating profit was NOK 3,130 million (NOK 2,433 million).\n\nFinancial items and risk result life was NOK 1,372 million (NOK 278 million). This year's result includes a positive effect on profit of NOK 546 million from the sale of AS V\u00e6rdalsbruket. In addition, increased net  profit  sharing  for  guaranteed  products  and  an  improved  risk result, after a period of weak results during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributed positively.\n\nAmortisation  of  intangible  assets  amounted  to  NOK  -527  million (NOK -492 million). The increase is mainly due to the acquisition of new businesses as well as customer portfolios from Insr.\n\nProfit before tax was NOK 3,976 million (NOK 2,219 million).\n\nThe Group ended the year with a tax income of NOK -846 million (NOK 136 million). The tax income in 2020 was the result of new information  and  interpretation  of  the  transitional  rules  for  2018. The  estimated  normal  tax  rate  for  the  Group  is  19-22  per  cent, depending on each legal entity's contribution to the Group result. For  more  information  on  tax  and  uncertain  tax  positions,  see note 26.

Higher  net interest margin and good volume growth led to a significant increase in the bank's contribution.",

The cost increase is largely due to excess returns in funds with performance fees where costs increased to NOK -255 million (NOK -79  million).  Adjusted  for  costs  related  to  excess  returns  in funds with performance fees, the cost increase was 5.5 per cent in 2021. Growth and digital investments, as well as the acquisition of the Danish property manager Capital Investment, contributed to increased costs.\n\nFinancial and risk result life was NOK 67 million (NOK -51 million). The loss in 2020 is mainly due to model-based provisions for loan losses in the bank.\n\nProfit  before  amortisation  increased  to  NOK  2,355  million  (NOK 1,730 million) - an increase of 36 per cent in 2021.\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nAssets under management grew significantly in 2021.\n\nUnit Linked reserves grew by 15 per cent to NOK 308 billion. Positive market development and growth in paid-in premiums contributed positively, while net transfers of total assets contributed negatively with  NOK  -13.6  billion  (NOK  5.4  billion).  The  reason  for  negative net  transfers  of  capital  is  mainly  a  one-off  effect  in  2021  related to the automatic transfer of pension capital with the introduction of Individual Pension Accounts in the Norwegian market. Intense competition in the Swedish market also led to negative transfers in the Swedish business.\n\nTotal growth in assets under management for Storebrand Asset Management was NOK 134 billion (14 per cent) to NOK 1,097 billion. Good returns during the year, in addition to NOK 43 billion in net capital  inflows  and  NOK  21  billion  from  the  acquisition  of  Capital Investment, contributed to the growth.\n\nThe bank's retail lending balance grew by NOK 7.5 billion (15 per cent) to NOK 57.0 billion.\n\n## Key figures Savings\n\n| NOK million          | 2021      | 2020    |\n|----------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Unit Linked Reserves | 308,351   | 268,331 |\n| Unit Linked Premiums | 21,212    | 20,185  |\n| AuM Asset Management | 1,096,556 | 962,472 |\n| Retail Lending       | 57,015    | 49,474  |\n\n## Insurance\n\n| NOK million                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Insurance pemiums f.o.a.   | 5,175  | 4,331  |\n| Claims f.o.a.              | -3,974 | -3,506 |\n| Operational cost           | -875   | -712   |\n| Operating profit           | 326    | 113    |\n| Financial result           | 97     | 91     |\n| Profit before amortisation | 423    | 204    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n\n## Financial results\n\nInsurance premiums for own account (f.o.a.) grew by 19 per cent to NOK 5,175 million in 2021 (NOK 4,331 million), driven mainly by strong volume growth.\n\nInsurance claims increased to NOK -3,974 million (-3,506 million), but the claims ratio ended at 77 per cent, which is slightly better than  81  per  cent  the  year  before.  The  high  claims  ratio  in  2020 was mainly a result of the Covid-19 pandemic which led to reserve strengthening for all products with disability coverage. The claims ratio in 2021 was more normalised, but still characterised by high levels of claims related to disability coverage within the group life product.\n\nTotal operating costs for the year were NOK -875 million (NOK -712 million) and resulted in a marginal increase in the cost ratio from 16 per cent to 17 per cent in 2021. The cost increase is related to increased  staffing  and  sales  commissions  in  external  distribution channels, as well as the acquisition of Insr's customer portfolios.\n\nThe total combined ratio was 94 per cent (97 per cent) and the total operating profit was NOK 326 million (NOK 113 million) for the year. It is somewhat weaker than the target combined ratio of 90-92 per cent. The growth products P&C and Individual Life achieved a strong combined ratio of 88 per cent (89 per cent), while Group Life and Pension  related  disability  insurance  achieved  weaker  combined ratios of 110 per cent (123 per cent) and 96 per cent (91 per cent), respectively.\n\nThe  financial  result  was  NOK  97  million  (NOK  91  million).  The investment  portfolio  for  insurance  amounted  to  NOK  9.6  billion at the end of 2021 (NOK 8.8 billion) and achieved a return of 3.3 per cent. The investments are primarily in fixed income securities booked at amortised cost or with a short maturity.\n\nProfit before amortisation was NOK 423 million (NOK 204 million).\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nThe total growth in written portfolio premiums amounted to 22 per cent in  2021.  Most  of  the  growth  was  in  P&C  and  Individual  Life, which grew by NOK 1.2 billion, equivalent to 54 per cent. Of this, transfers from Insr amounted to NOK 610 million in 2021 (NOK 740 million in total). Pension related disability grew by 7 per cent while Health and Group Life decreased by 5 per cent. Written premiums at the end of the year was NOK 6.4 billion, of which NOK 3.3 billion is in the retail market and NOK 3.1 billion in the corporate market.\n\n## Key figures Insurance\n\n|                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Claims ratio   | 77 %   | 81 %   |\n| Cost ratio     | 17 %   | 16 %   |\n| Combined ratio | 94 %   | 97 %   |\n\n| Written premium NOK million          | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| P&C & Individual life                | 3,301  | 2,144  |\n| Health & Group life *                | 1,775  | 1,870  |\n| Pension related disability insurance | 1,369  | 1,274  |\n| Nordic                               |        |        |\n| Total written premium                | 6,445  | 5,288  |\n\n* Includes the entire written premium for Storebrand Helseforsikring AS (50/50 joint venture with Munich Health)\n\n## Guaranteed pension\n\n| NOK million                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income | 1,631  | 1,511  |\n| Operational cost              | -890   | -861   |\n| Operating profit              | 741    | 650    |\n| Risk result life & pensions   | 187    | 19     |\n| Net profit sharing            | 504    | 136    |\n| Profit before amortisation    | 1,432  | 805    |\n\n## Financial results\n\nThe  fee  and  administration  income  amounted  to  NOK  1,631  million (NOK 1,511 million). Growth in public sector occupational pensions and the takeover of closed pension funds contributed to increased income. Over time, fee income is expected to gradually decline because the products are mainly in long-term run-off.\n\nOperating expenses amounted to NOK -890 million (NOK -861 million).\n\nRisk  result  life  &  pension  was  NOK  187  million  (NOK  19  million). The improvement in earnings is due to an improvement in the risk result  related  to  Defined  Benefit  pensions,  partly  explained  by  price adjustments that were introduced after weak results in 2020.\n\nNet  profit  sharing,  after  further  strengthening  of  the  buffer  capital, was NOK 504 million (NOK 136 million), driven by good returns in both Norwegian and Swedish products. The booked return was on average 4.5 per cent in Norway against an average customer guarantee of 3.1 per cent. In Sweden, the average return was 3.7 per cent against an average guarantee of 2.8 per cent.\n\nProfit before amortisation was NOK 1,432 million (NOK 805 million).\n\n## Balance sheet and market development\n\nAt the end of the year, guaranteed reserves amounted to NOK 291 billion. This is an increase of NOK 3 billion in 2021, but NOK 10 billion adjusted for currency effects. The increase is due to growth in public sector occupational pensions, takeover of closed pension funds and good returns. Net outflows, excluding transfers, amounted to NOK -10.2 billion (NOK -10.1 billion) as a result of larger pension payments being paid out than premium payments being paid in. As a share of the total balance sheet, the reserves correspond to 48.5 per cent (51.7 per cent) at the end of the year, a reduction of 3.2 percentage points since last year.",

Buffer capital for guaranteed pensions increased to 11.2 per cent (11.0 per cent) of customer reserves in Norway and to 17.8 per cent (11.4 per cent) in Sweden. This corresponds to an overall increase of NOK 4.4 billion since last year.\n\n## Key figures Guaranteed Pension\n\n| NOK million                                         | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Guaranteed reserves                                 | 290,862 | 287,614 |\n| Guranteed reserves in % of total reserves           | 48.5 %  | 51.7 %  |\n| Net inflows and outflows, excluding  transfers      | -10,268 | -10,058 |\n| Average booked return in Norway                     | 4.5%    | 4.8%    |\n| Average guarantee in Norway                         | 3.1%    | 3.1%    |\n| Average value-adjusted return in Sweden             | 3.7%    | 4.4%    |\n| Average guarantee in Sweden                         | 2.8%    | 3.2%    |\n| Buffer capital in % of customer reserves in  Norway | 11.2 %  | 11.0 %  |\n| Buffer capital in % of customer reserves in  Sweden | 17.8 %  | 11.4 %  |\n\n## Other\n\n| NOK million                          |   2021 |   2020 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and administration income        |     21 |      9 |\n| Operational cost                     |   -246 |   -120 |\n| Operating profit                     |   -225 |   -111 |\n| Financial items and risk result life |    518 |     83 |\n| Profit before amortisation           |    293 |    -28 |\n\nThe table above excludes eliminations.

Transaction costs related to the acquisition  of  Capital  Investment  and  the  process  with  Danica\n\ncontribute  to  increased  costs  and  a  lower  operating  profit.  The Financial items and risk result life was NOK 518 million, an increase from last year's NOK 83 million. The strong financial result is mainly explained by a positive effect of NOK 546 million from the sale of AS V\u00e6rdalsbruket.\n\n## Dividend for 2021\n\nStorebrand has established a framework for capital management that links dividends to the solvency ratio. The dividend policy intends to reflect the strong growth in fee-based earnings, the more volatile financial  markets  related  earnings  and  the  future  capital  release from the guaranteed book. The Board's ambition is to pay a gradually growing ordinary dividend. When the solvency ratio reaches 180% without  material  use  of  transitional  capital,  the  Board  intends  to initiate  a  share  buyback  program.  The  purpose  of  the  buyback program is to return excess capital released from the guaranteed liabilities that are in long-term run-off.\n\nThe  Board  has  carefully  reviewed  the  solvency  position,  liquidity position and the result prognosis for the company, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting macroeconomic uncertainties. Based on the review, the Board's assessment is that Storebrand's financial position supports paying an ordinary dividend. The Board proposes  an  ordinary  dividend  of  NOK  3.50  per  share  for  2021, equal to NOK 1,645 million, to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nFor more information about historical dividends, Storebrand's share and other shareholder matters, see the chapter Shareholder matters.\n\n## Capital situation\n\nWe adapt the level of equity and debt in the Group continuously and  systematically.  The  level  is  adjusted  for  financial  risk  and capital  requirements.  The  growth  and  composition  of  business segments are important drivers behind the need for capital. Capital management  is  designed  to  ensure  an  efficient  capital  structure and maintain an appropriate balance between internal targets and regulatory requirements. The balance sheet must form a sound foundation and support the Group's growth strategy at the same time as released capital is repaid to the owners.\n\nWe target a solvency ratio in accordance with Solvency II of at least 150 per cent, including the use of transitional rules. At the end of 2021, the solvency ratio for the Group was 175 per cent. Storebrand uses the standard model for the calculation of Solvency II. Prudent risk  management  and  regulatory  adjustment  mechanisms  in the solvency regulation compensate for occasionally challenging financial market conditions.\n\n## Storebrand's dividend policy:\n\nStorebrand aims to pay an ordinary dividend of more than 50 per cent of Group profit after tax. The Board of Directors' ambition is to pay ordinary dividends per share of at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency ratio above 150 per cent. If the solvency ratio is above 180 per cent, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buy backs.",

Appendix\n\nStorebrand  Livsforsikring  Group's solidity capital consists of  equity,  subordinated  loan  capital,  market  value  adjustment reserves,  additional  statutory  reserves,  conditional  bonuses  and risk equalisation reserves. The solidity capital was strengthened by NOK 1.3 billion in 2021. Issuances of new loans and redemptions as well as exchange rate changes resulted in a net increase of NOK 2.0 billion  in  subordinated  loans  in  2021.  The  market  value adjustment reserve has been reduced by NOK 0.9 billion as a result of rising interest rates, and amounts to NOK 6.3 billion at year-end. Conditional  bonuses  have  been  strengthened  by  NOK  3.0  billion and amount to NOK 13.8 billion. Booked returns have contributed to increasing the additional statutory reserves. Additional statutory reserves amounted to NOK 13.6 billion at the end of the year, an increase of NOK 2.2 billion for the year. The excess values of bonds and loans valued at amortised cost has been reduced by NOK 5.5 billion this year due to rising interest rates, and amounts to NOK 3.4 billion at the end of the year. Excess values of bonds and loans at amortised cost is not recognised in the accounts.\n\nStorebrand ASA (holding) held liquid assets of NOK 4.8 billion at the end of the year. Liquid assets consist mainly of short-term fixed income securities with high credit ratings. Storebrand ASA's total interest-bearing  liabilities  were  NOK  1.0  billion  at  the  end  of  the year. The next maturity on debt for Storebrand ASA is in May 2022. In addition to the liquidity portfolio, the company has an unused credit facility of EUR 200 million, which expires in December 2025. Storebrand ASA recognised dividend and group contributions from subsidiaries of NOK 4,542 million in 2021. The dividend allocated to shareholders amounted to NOK 1,645 million.\n\nRating\n\nFour companies in the Storebrand Group issue debt securities. All four companies are rated by the credit rating agency S&P Global. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS, the main operating entity, aims for at least an A-rating. In July 2021, the A-rating of Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and Storebrand Bank ASA was affirmed with a stable outlook. Storebrand Boligkreditt AS is rated AAA and the holding company Storebrand ASA is rated BBB.\n\nStorebrand Bank Group had a pure core capital adequacy ratio of  15.4  per  cent  and  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  20.3  per  cent  at the  end  of  2021.

Shareholder matters\n- 7. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 8. Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Market development\n\nFinancial  market  developments  affect  both  the  Group's  solvency ratio  and  the  financial  results.  Higher  interest  rates  increase the solvency ratio and make it easier to achieve returns above the  guaranteed  rate.  Defined  Contribution  pensions  and  asset management  are  largely  exposed  to  the  stock  market.  Market movements will  therefore  affect  income  earned  on  assets  under management. Currency movements between the Norwegian and Swedish krone affect the reported balance sheet and results in SPP at a consolidated level.\n\nThere  is  still  uncertainty  about  the  consequences  of  Covid-19 and how it will affect financial markets going forward. With a solid solvency ratio of 175 per cent and more than 13 per cent buffer capital in guaranteed products, Storebrand is in a good position to navigate safely through demanding markets. The company also has a robust risk management framework, as described in a separate section below.\n\n## Financial Results\n\nIn  Norway,  the  market  for  Defined  Contribution  pensions  has experienced strong structural growth in recent years. Going forward, high single-digit growth in premiums and double-digit growth in total assets are still expected. With the introduction of Individual Pension Accounts, the fees were reduced throughout the market. This will have a negative effect on earnings in 2022, but the expected growth and own profitability measures will bring results back to previous levels in 2023.\n\nOur  ambition  is  that  Storebrand  remains  the  market  leader  in pensions in the private sector by offering attractive and competitive customer  solutions,  while  at  the  same  time  running  a  costeffective  business.  The  acquisition  of  Danica,  pending  regulatory approval,  strengthens  our  ambition  in  the  pension  market.  From July  2022,  there  will  be  increased  requirements for which income is  pensionable,  which  will  increase  the  premium  volume  in  the Norwegian  market  by  approx.  NOK  3  billion  annually.  We  also have  the  ambition  to  take  a  1  per  cent  market  share  annually, corresponding to NOK 5 billion in annual net inflow of assets, in the market for public sector occupational pensions. Storebrand aims to achieve further synergies across customers, products and capital by expanding our non-life insurance offering to corporate customers.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP has become a significant result contributor to the Storebrand Group, driven by earnings growth and ongoing capital release. Growth is expected to continue, driven by our competitive advantages in digital, sustainable solutions, and a strong market position.  The  market  is  expected  to  grow  by  about  8  per  cent annually,  supported  by  increasing  relocation  volumes.  SPP's ambition is to grow between 14 and 16 per cent annually, twice as much as the overall market growth, by being the leading player in the transfer market.\n\nOverall reserves for guaranteed pensions are expected to start decreasing in the coming years. Guaranteed reserves represent a  declining  share  of  the  group's  total  pension  reserves.  These amounted to 48.5 per cent at the end of 2021, 3 percentage points lower than last year. Storebrand's strategy is to secure customer returns and shield shareholder's equity under turbulent market conditions by building customer buffers. Customer buffers make up more than 13 per cent of customer reserves in both Norway and Sweden. The levels will grow with an expected positive spread over the guaranteed rate on the policies.\n\nStorebrand Asset Management is growing its external mandates from  institutional  and  retail  investors,  both  in  the  Nordics  and across  Europe,  in  addition  to  managing  internal  pension  funds. Storebrand has a full product range including index, factor, and active management. We are also one of the strongest providers of  alternative  assets  in  the  Nordic  region,  asset  classes  offering prospects of higher margins. In combination with a strong track record  with  ESG-enhanced  mutual  funds,  Storebrand  is  aiming to capitalise on these two trends. The overall ambition is to grow assets under management by NOK 250 billion by the end of 2023, compared to 2020, while maintaining a stable fee margin.\n\nThe retail market has evolved into and increasingly larger part of Storebrand and accounted for 25 per cent of the Group's profits in 2021. The individualisation of the pension and savings market is expected to increase further. Non-life insurance, particularly P&C insurance, is an important growth area. The ambition is to grow more than 10 per cent annually within savings, mortgage lending and insurance.\n\nStorebrand's ambition from the Capital Market Day in 2021 was to achieve a Group profit (before amortisation and tax) of NOK 4 billion in 2023. We managed this already in 2021 with help from the sale of AS V\u00e6rdalsbruket and significant performance fees from excess returns  in  active  funds.  The  full  effect  of  the  regulatory  change related to Individual Pension Accounts in 2021 will have a negative contribution in 2022 of approx. NOK 100 million. The full positive effect  of  the  Danica  acquisition  (given  government  approval)  will come in 2023. Strong growth in all focus areas will  contribute  to further earnings growth in the coming years.\n\nIn  the  period  2012-2020, Storebrand reported flat nominal costs, adjusted for acquisitions, currency, and performance related costs. In 2021, we delivered on our cost target of NOK 4.4 billion. We expect the cost base to increase to NOK 4.9 billion in 2022, due to growth initiatives  and  increased  wage  pressure.  The  growth  initiatives include investments in the public sector, non-life insurance in the market for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the recently acquired Capital Investment. Should revenue growth not materialise,",

Acquisitions, including Danica (given regulatory approval) and costs associated with future performance fees will come in addition.\n\n## Capital management\n\nStorebrand aims to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 150 per cent. At the end of 2021 it was 175 per cent. On an annual basis, a net capital generation of about 6-7 percentage points of solvency is expected over the next few years. Of this, approximately 10 percentage points are generated in the business, 3 additional percentage points are expected as a result of the guaranteed business being in run-off, and around 5-6 percentage points are expected to pe paid out as  dividend  from  the  annual  results.  Financial  market  volatility, especially the development in long interest rates, and regulatory changes, may lead to short term volatility in the solvency ratio.\n\nThe  Board's  ambition  is  to  pay  a  gradually  increasing  ordinary dividend.  When  the  solvency  ratio  exceeds  180  per  cent  without material use of transitional capital, the Board's intention is to begin a share buy-back programme. The purpose of the buy-back program will be to return excess capital from the guaranteed business which is in long-term run-off. We expect that approximately NOK 10 billion in capital will be released by 2030.\n\nRealisation of the Group's ambitions is expected to lead to a rising return on equity over time. We expect to deliver more than a 10 per cent return on equity by the end of 2023 and beyond.\n\n## Regulatory changes\n\nRegulations enacted by the authorities can be of great importance to Storebrand. We describe the most important changes and their significance for Storebrand below.\n\n## International regulations\n\nSolvency II revision\n\nThe European Commission presented proposals for changes in the Solvency II standard model in September 2021. The Commission's proposals differ significantly compared to earlier proposals from The European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA).\n\nThe  main  purpose  of  the  revision  is  to  ensure  that  insurance companies  continue  to  invest  in  accordance  with  the  political priorities of the EU, especially with regards to financing the post Covid19  recovery,  by  facilitating  long-term  investments  and  increasing the  capacity  to  invest  in  European  business.  The  Commission particularly emphasises the importance of the insurance sector's role in financing the green transition and helping society to adapt to climate change. The proposed new model also intends to correct regulatory deficiencies and make the insurance sector more robust.\n\nStorebrand  currently  applies  what  is  commonly  known  as  the standard model. Changes to the standard model could increase the  solvency  capital  for  Norwegian  and  Swedish  insurers.  The Commission's proposals appear to reflect Norwegian interest rates better than earlier proposals from EIOPA. The Commission also proposes changes that could have offsetting  effects  to  increased capital requirements, such as a reduced risk margin. Several changes are also proposed in the calculation of the volatility adjustment as well as an increased interval for the symmetric adjustment for equity risk. As they are currently outlined, the Commission's proposals are not expected to have a significant overall impact on Storebrand's solvency ratio.\n\nThe Commission has not outlined a timeline for the further process on  adapting  changes  in  the  standard  model.  We  expect  final conclusions to be drawn by the Commission, the Parliament, and the Council in 2022. This will be followed by work on delegated acts and guidelines. Changes are not expected to enter into force until 2024-2025. The Commission will also consider a phasing-in period of five years for new rules related to the calculation of interest rate risk and the new extrapolation method for interest rates will be phased in gradually until the end of 2031.\n\n## Sustainable finance\n\nThe EU's goal of a carbon neutral Europe by 2050 requires significant investments.  The  EU's  Action  Plan  on  Sustainable  Finance  is expected to increase the share of sustainable investments, promote long-termism, and define which financial products may be defined as sustainable.\n\n## EU taxonomy for sustainable finance activities\n\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  is  a  main  part  of  the  EU's  Action  Plan  on Sustainable Finance. While the taxonomy regulations entered into force on 12 July 2020 in the EU, the new requirements will only apply from  2022  for  the  first  two  environmental  goals  (climate  change mitigation and climate change adaptation), and from 2023 for the other  four  environmental  goals  (sustainable  use  and  protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biological diversity and ecosystems). Legislative measures including the EU Taxonomy and sustainability disclosures were passed by the Norwegian Parliament (Stortinget) in December 2021.\n\nThe new regulations entail a mapping of the legislative requirements for  their  products  and  services.  Large,  listed  companies  will  be required to report on the proportion of their turnover, investments and operational costs that are covered by the EU Taxonomy. In 2023, companies must report on the share of turnover, investments and operational costs that are defined as environmentally sustainable activities in accordance with the technical criteria that the EU has prepared for each economic activity.",

Shareholder matters\n- 7. Annual Accounts and Notes\n- 8. Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThe  new  rules  for  sustainable  finance  will  establish  standards for  sustainable  asset  management,  as  well  as  clarify  disclosure and  customer  information  requirements.  We  believe  that  the development  will  result  in  a  higher  quality  of  financial  and  nonfinancial  reporting,  better  information  to  key  stakeholders,  and make it easier to compare data across the financial sector.\n\nA challenge of implementing the new rules for sustainable finance is  to  get  correct  and  necessary  data.  See  appendix  on  page  248 for an overview of how much of our business is covered by the EU Taxonomy. The Taxonomy's reporting requirements are increasing step by step, and we will report on the share of our business that will be classified as sustainable in the years to come.\n\n## Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD)\n\nIn  April  2021,  the  European  Commission  adopted  a  revision  in existing  MiFID  II  and  IDD  regulations  that  require  businesses  to map  sustainability  in  the  same  way  as  financial  risk.  Companies that  provide  investment  advice  must  obtain  information  about customers'  preferences  related  to  sustainability,  in  addition  to mapping  their  experience  and  knowledge  of  investments.  The mapping  of  sustainability  risks  and  preferences  will  become  an integral part of the suitability assessment made by companies that offer financial products. Supplementary provisions on sustainability in  MIFID  II  and  IDD  are  being  considered  for  incorporation  into Norwegian  law  through  the  EEA  Agreement.  These  regulatory changes will take effect in the EU in the second half of 2022.\n\n## Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\n\nIn  April  2021,  the  European  Commission  adopted  a  proposal  to prepare a new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) to  replace  the  previous  Non-Financial  Reporting  Directive  (NFRD). CSRD aims to raise  sustainability information to the same level as financial information. The proposal aims to improve the flow of information on sustainability within corporate governance. This will make  sustainability  reporting  from  companies  more  consistent, so  that  finance  players,  investors  and  the  general  public  can  use comparable  and  reliable  sustainability  information.  Storebrand's annual report will be in line with this regulation.\n\n## Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFRD)\n\nAnother  important  part  of  the  EU's  Action  Plan  on  Sustainable Finance  is  the  EU's  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure  Regulation (SFDR).  The  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure  Regulation  (Hereafter the Disclosure Regulation) is intended to help clients make informed investment decisions. It requires Storebrand, as a financial player, to be transparent about how we manage sustainability risk, potential negative consequences of our investments, and the sustainability of our products.\n\nThe  Disclosure  Regulation  divides  financial  products  into  three categories that affect the degree of sustainability information to be disclosed by companies. The three categories are:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial products that have sustainability as the main objective (defined  as  an  Article  9  financial  product):  Investments  in companies or projects that contribute to an environmental or a social sustainability goal. This may be investments in companies that produce renewable energy or have services that contribute to increased equality. In addition, the companies invested in must not harm any other sustainability goals.\n- \u00b7 Financial  products  that  promote  environmental  or  social aspects, but that do not have sustainability as the main objective of its investment (defined as an Article 8 financial product): It may be funds that have sustainability requirements, such as avoiding fossil fuels or having the lowest possible emissions, but  where  the  entire  investment  does  not  focus  solely  on sustainability.\n- \u00b7 All  other  financial  products  (defined  as  Article  6  financial products):  This  is  a  broad  'other'  category  that  includes everything from funds that completely ignore sustainability to funds that analyse sustainability and take sustainability risk into account without meeting the EU's requirements under the Disclosure Regulation.\n\nWe  welcome  the  Disclosure  Regulation  as  it  should  provide increased transparency on financial savings products and make it easier to compare data across the financial sector.\n\n## Changes in IFRS\n\nA  new  accounting  standard  for  insurance  contracts,  IFRS  17, is  set  to  be  implemented  in  2023.  The  purpose  is  to  introduce common  accounting  rules  for  insurance  contracts  and  improve the  comparability  of  insurance  accounts.  IFRS  17  entails,  among other things, market valuation of liabilities, separation of insurance cohorts  in  the  accounts,  income  recognition  over  the  contract period rather upfront, and an amended profit and loss statement. Storebrand will implement IFRS 9 for financial instruments at the same time. For Storebrand's consolidated financial statements, the new standards will lead to changes in the valuation of insurance contracts, classification of fixed income investments and how profits are recognised. Estimated effects for Storebrand will be presented closer to implementation. Whether IFRS 17 is implemented in the statutory reporting requirements is decided by national regulations in each country. Storebrand expects that its property and casualty business  will  be  required  to  implement  IFRS  17  in  the  statutory reporting. For the life insurance business, IFRS 17 is not expected to be applied in the statutory reporting requirements. The effects from the  implementation of IFRS 17 is thus not expected to affect the Solvency calculations nor dividend capacity significantly.",

Appendix\n\nDuring COP26, IFRS announced that it will establish an International Sustainability  Standards  Board  (ISSB)  with  the  aim  of  developing standards in sustainability reporting. Storebrand views this positively and believes it is an important measure to meet increasing demands for sustainability information.\n\n## Norwegian regulations\n\n## Savings in Norwegian Defined Contribution pensions\n\nIn  December  2021,  new  legislation  was  adopted  making  pension contributions  mandatory  for  all  of  employees'  income,  not  just income above 1G (G = NOK 17 Interim Report Storebrand Group 106,399)  for  employees  working  more  than  20  per  cent  and  are above the age of 13. Companies need to adapt to the new legislation before 1 July 2022. It is estimated that the changes will increase total savings in the Defined Contribution pension market by about NOK 3 billion per year.\n\n## Individual pension savings\n\nThe  savings  limit  in  the  IPS  scheme  for  individual,  tax-favoured pension savings has been reduced from NOK 40,000 to NOK 15,000 per  year,  with  effect  from  the  tax  year  2022.  The  tax  rules  will continue unchanged. In this sense, this is still a favorable scheme, which is nevertheless weakened by a sharp reduction in how much it is allowed to save.\n\n## Changes announced in the government platform\n\nThe government parties have announced in the Hurdal platform that a sales tax on health insurance will be introduced, in order to reduce the use of such insurances.\n\nThe  governing  parties  have  also  announced  a  revenue-neutral reorganisation of the financial tax, in which the increased employer's contribution for financial companies will be removed.\n\n## Public Occupational Pensions\n\nThe Norwegian parliament also passed new legislation in December 2021 regulating the buffer capital within public occupational pension schemes. The new legislation merges the market value adjustment reserves with the additional statutory reserves into a more flexible customer  buffer  fund  which  can  cover  negative  returns.  There  is no cap on the size of the new buffer fund. The new regulation will facilitate competition in the market for public occupational pensions and is expected to be positive for Storebrand's growth ambitions in this market.\n\n## Paid-up policies\n\nNew legislation was passed for Paid-up policies in December 2021. The final changes are:\n\n- \u00b7 The ability for providers to build additional statutory reserves separately  for  individual  contracts.  This  will  allow  for  profit sharing  and  increased  benefits  on  contracts  with  sufficient additional statutory reserves.\n- \u00b7 Faster pay-outs for small paid up-policies. Providers can reduce",

The policyholder and provider also have the option to enter into an agreement to reduce the pay-out period so that the annual payments equal 1G. This can reduce longevity risk and duration risk for the affected contracts.\n\n- \u00b7 Providers  will  be  allowed  to  compensate  customers  who convert guaranteed paid-up policies to investment choice. It will still be possible to offer conversion without compensation. If  compensation  is  offered,  it  should  reflect  the  value  of  the guaranteed returns the customer surrenders. The legislation change  passed  regarding  more  flexible buffer capital management within public occupational pensions mentioned above was not passed for paid-up policies. The Ministry of Finance has however announced that it may consider further regulatory changes.\n\nThe  Financial  Supervisory  Authority  of  Norway's  proposal  for  a flexible  buffer  fund,  where  exchange  rate  adjustment  funds  and additional provisions are merged into a new customer-distributed buffer fund that can cover negative returns, has so far only been introduced for municipal pension schemes. This happened through the Norwegian Parliament's (Stortinget) consideration of Prop. 223 L. The Ministry of Finance announced there that it would assess the need for further regulatory changes later.\n\n## Transparency Act\n\nThe Transparency Act has been passed by the Parliament and will enter into force on 1 July 2022. The Norwegian Consumer Authority has been given the task of providing guidance and supervision of the Transparency Act. The law imposes a number of obligations on larger businesses related to human rights and working conditions, and gives both consumers and others the right to information about the companies' handling of these.\n\nAll  eligible  companies  are  obliged  to  carry  out  due  diligence assessments in line with the OECD's guidelines for multinational companies. The requirement for the scope of the due diligence assessments must be proportionate to the size of the business, and the assessments must be carried out regularly.\n\nDisclosures of the due diligence assessments shall be published each year. The statement must meet the minimum requirements under the Transparency Act, but can also be more comprehensive. The  report  can  be  published  in  several  places,  but  must  as  a minimum be easily accessible on the company's website.\n\nThe Transparency Act gives the opportunity for anyone to demand to  receive  information  from  companies  about  how  they  handle actual  and  potential  negative  consequences  that  have  been assessed in the due diligence assessments. The right to information\n\nincludes both general information about how the company handles negative consequences, and specific information related to goods and services.\n\nAdaptations  to  the  new  regulatory  requirements  has  been implemented  both  in  departments  that  are  responsible  for processes that are directly affected by new obligations and at Group level to identify the need for adaptations in group-wide processes, including those related to reporting and transparency.\n\n## Swedish regulations\n\n## New transfer market regulation\n\nTo promote the transfer of pension rights, additional fee restrictions were introduced on 1 April 2021 for the repurchase and transfer of unit-linked and custodial insurance. Insurance companies can only charge an administration fee that corresponds to direct costs for the transaction, and the amount can not exceed 0.0127 basic amounts (equivalent to approximately SEK 600 in 2021).\n\nOn the question of the right of transfer for agreements entered into before 1 July 2007, the Swedish Government has proposed in a proposition that the right shall apply regardless of when a unitlinked and custodian insurance agreement has been entered into. The Swedish government has proposed that the fee restrictions for relocation and repurchase should also apply to these contracts. The new legislative amendments are proposed to take effect on 1 July 2022. The Swedish Parliament is expected to consider the proposals in the spring of 2022.\n\nSPP supports a more open relocation market. In the past, this has been voluntary for insurance companies, and something SPP allows.\n\n## Premium pensions (PPM) of the national retirement pension system\n\nA negotiated fund market is implemented as a second step in the reform of PPM, and a new set of rules was presented by the Swedish government on 22 December 2021. The fund market will continue to give pension savers the freedom to choose how the funds are to be invested. A new authority - Fondstorgsnemnda - which will negotiate funds and manage the fund market is also proposed. Increased demands will be placed on funds in the fund market; they must be suitable for pension savings, cost-effective, sustainable, controllable and of high quality. The Swedish government plans to present a proposition to the Swedish Parliament on 22 March 2022 and the legislative amendments are proposed to take effect on 1 June 2022.\n\nPPM fund platform is a large distribution channel for SPP's funds. We envisage that the new fund platform will offer fewer funds at a lower price, but it is too early to say anything about the consequences of this.",

Appendix\n\n## A driving force for sustainable investments\n\nStorebrand manages our customers' savings over several decades and  we  therefore  have  a  long-term  perspective.  We  take  an integrated  approach  to  sustainable  investments,  in  which  we combine our sustainability strategy with our investment strategy. We believe that companies that have a good understanding of how to manage sustainability risks and opportunities have a competitive advantage that will enable them to deliver better returns, while contributing positively to sustainable development.\n\nIn recent years, the debate about sustainability has largely focused on cutting greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. Going forward, the global sustainability agenda will increasingly also revolve around topics such as biodiversity and ecosystems to solve climate challenges. In addition, the resilience of safeguarding good working conditions and social and economic justice in the transition to a low-emission society has received increased attention. To achieve long-term positive effects, it is important to view environmental and social conditions, and corporate governance in context.\n\nWe believe that investments in companies that are well-positioned to deliver on the UN Sustainable Development Goals will deliver better  risk-adjusted  returns  for  our  customers  over  time.  A  main goal is to positively support the achievement of the UN's Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDGs),  without  causing  harm  or  having  a negative impact on society and the environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith this in mind, we strive to:\n\n- 1. Contribute to positive influence by allocating more capital to investments in solution companies (see below for definition), green bonds, certified real estate and green infrastructure.\n- 2. Exercising active ownership and excluding companies to reduce the negative impact our investments can have.\n\nThis  approach  enables  us  to  be  a  driving  force  for  sustainable investments that contribute to positive change and development, while reducing financial risk.\n\n## Directing capital towards sustainable solutions\n\nStorebrand aims to be a driving force for lasting change in the way companies are managed, while ensuring the best possible return for customers and owners. We fundamentally believe that investing in companies well-positioned to deliver on the SDGs, will deliver better risk-adjusted  long-term  returns  for  our  clients. We  therefore  put capital into action to fund socially beneficial, sustainable solutions aligned with the achievement of the SDGs; and we reduce exposure to activities that impact society and the environment negatively.\n\nStorebrand  works  to  increase  our  positive  contribution  to sustainability by directing more capital to investments that are wellpositioned to deliver solutions to global sustainability challenges, as described through the SDGs. We do this by increasing investments in solution companies, green bonds, investments in real estate and infrastructure that support the SDGs. One of our goals is to invest 15 per cent of our assets under management in solution companies, green bonds, green infrastructure, and certified real estate by 2025.\n\nSince 2012, Storebrand has developed and integrated a proprietary Sustainability Score to identify companies that have the potential to deliver good returns, while helping to solve sustainability challenges. All our portfolio managers can use the Sustainability Score in a way that is aligned with the investment strategy and risk profile of individual funds and portfolios.\n\nThrough  proprietary  analysis,  we  identify  what  we  call  'solution companies'.  These  are  companies  that  help  achieve  the  SDGs through  products,  services  and  operations,  without  causing significant  harm.  The  companies  that  are  categorised  as  solution companies are included in a database that is updated regularly. The database is a valuable tool for fund managers in their work on sustainable investments and serves as the basis for our thematic solution  portfolios  (for  example,  on  renewable  energy,  smart cities and equal opportunities), or as part of broader investment portfolios. At the end of 2021, 13 per cent of our equity investments were invested in solution companies. During the year, Storebrand launched two new solution funds; one with a focus on sustainable cities and one with a focus on equal opportunities.",

Appendix\n\nWe invest in green bonds, which allow fixed income funds to increase their  exposure to projects that are focused on sustainability. The green bonds are for companies that both meet the Storebrand standard and are in line with international standards such as the Green Bond Principles, the forthcoming EU Green Bond standard, and  with  the  framework  of  the  International  Capital  Market Association (ICMA). By the end of 2021, we had invested NOK 25.7 billion in green bonds. This accounts for 6 per cent of our total bond investments, up from 5 per cent in 2020.\n\nWe  integrate  sustainability  throughout  our  real  estate  business and aim to be the Nordic region's leading player in sustainable real  estate  management.  The  share  of  our  buildings  that  were environmentally certified (BREEAM or equivalent) increased from 43 per cent in 2020 to 68 per cent in 2021.  We reduced emissions from our real estate investments, from 7.9 kg CO2 per m2 in 2020, to 5.9 CO2 per m2 in 2021. In 2021, three out of four reporting companies with direct real estate investments achieved a 5-star rating from the Global ESG Benchmark for Real Assets (GRESB). The Danish-based\n\ncompany Capital Investment, which we acquired in 2021, has not yet reported to GRESB, and the properties that the company manages are not included in the figures for certification and greenhouse gas emissions above.\n\nStorebrand also manages capital for infrastructure investments that enable the transition to a green economy. The transition away from fossil  fuels  will  require  significant investment in renewable energy infrastructure, both from the public and private sector. Sustainable infrastructure is a key focus area in the EU Commission's Investment Plan  for  Europe,  that  aims  to  mobilise  EUR  650  billion  of  public and private investment by 2027 to transition to a climate-friendly economy  in  the  coming  years.    During  2021,  Storebrand  Asset Management established and raised capital for a fund that invests in sustainable infrastructure. Throughout the year, the fund made three direct  investments in  a  US  onshore  wind  farm,  an  offshore wind farm in the UK and 65 electric train sets in the UK. Each investment has a positive sustainability impact.\n\n## HOW WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN SOLUTIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe invest in companies that deliver climate solutions and contribute to achieving the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe invest in companies that deliver solutions in sustainable management and efficient use of  natural  resources.  We  promote  circular economy and waste reduction in the product life cycle.\n\nWe  ensure  exposure  to  companies  that contribute to sustainable urban development, transport systems, and reduce the impact of cities  on  the  environment.  More  specifically, companies that improve air quality and waste management,  promote  inclusion,  promote resource  efficiency,  mitigates  and  adapts  to climate  change  and  increases  resilience  to natural disasters.\n\nWe invest in companies that promote energy efficiency and enable increased production, distribution and use of renewable energy in  the  global  energy  mix.  We  increase investments in infrastructure, grid, storage and clean energy technology.\n\nWe promote safe drinking water solutions at an affordable price, improved sanitation, water  quality,  efficient  water  consumption, management  of  water  resources  and recovery of water-related ecosystems.\n\nWe  promote  companies  that  contribute to good health and quality of life. We are increasing  exposure  to  companies  that are helping more people access necessary health  services,  medicines  and  vaccines, health insurance,  and  companies  that prevent deaths as a result of unsatisfactory water and sanitation conditions.",

Appendix\n\n## Active ownership\n\nWe set requirements for the companies we invest in and use our position as owners to influence the companies for improvement.  To reduce negative impact, we have a clear and transparent process to ensure that companies meet our sustainability risk standards. This, combined with a structured corporate governance process, reduces our exposure to sustainability-related risks, such as climate risk. During 2021, we defined even more demanding criteria to the boards and management of the companies we invest in, and further developed our general principles of engagement. We also initiated several international initiatives.\n\nFive principles of engagement guide Storebrand's active ownership:\n\n- 1. Creating shareholder value: Our activities shall contribute to long-term value creation in a responsible manner.\n- 2. Aiming for a positive impact: Our activities should be driven by the goal of creating a real difference, not symbolic value.\n- 3. Nordic approach: We focus on topics and issues where Nordic actors  have  real  influence  and/or  have  a  major  impact  on Nordic stakeholders.\n- 4. Multi-stakeholder engagement: We work with a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, organisations, businesses and investors.\n- 5. Targeted engagement: We strive to gain the greatest possible influence  by  concentrating  our  commitment  to  companies where we have a significant stake.\n\nWe have chosen to prioritise four themes for active ownership for 2021-2023:\n\n- \u00b7 The race to net zero: Storebrand is committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions in all our assets under management  by  no  later  than  2050,  in  line  with  the  Paris Agreement.  This  entails  a  decarbonised  portfolio  across all asset classes. In line with this commitment, we have set an  intermediate  target  of  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of Storebrand's  total  equity,  corporate  bond  and  real  estate investments by at least 32 per cent by 2025 with a base year in 2018.  Storebrand was one of the founders of the UN-backed Net-Zero  Asset  Owner  Alliance  initiative  in  2019.    We  also became a member of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative in 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity and ecosystems: Our goal is that our investment portfolio will not contribute to deforestation by 2025. During 2021,  we  surveyed  and  identified  companies  with  high exposure and insufficient risk management. Next, we selected 50  companies  for  further  targeted  engagement  to  achieve better forest protection in operations and supply chains.  Based on this dialogue, we have chosen to cooperate with companies that show a willingness to improve. Divestments are considered in companies that do not have a satisfactory response.  To help promote international regulation in this area, we also signed the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge, which is described below in the section on multilateral engagement.\n- \u00b7 Resilient  supply  chains: Respect for labour rights in supply chains has been an important issue for Storebrand for many years.  Dialogue  on  these  topics  helps  to  ensure  healthy operations in the enterprises through robust supply chains, while helping to reduce maternity, child labour, forced labour and low living standards. Throughout the year, we established a partnership through the Platform for Living Wages Financials (PLWF),  focusing  on  achieving  a  decent  living  wage,  in  the clothing, food and retail sectors.\n- \u00b7 Corporate  sustainability  disclosure: Storebrand  believes that all companies should report according to standardised and  company-specific  sustainability  indicators.  We  therefore highlight  the  importance  of  consistent,  reliable  and  verifiable reporting on sustainability indicators in our dialogue with our portfolio companies.  Increased transparency also depends on reporting tools, such as the work of the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD), which Storebrand helped launch this year, and continues to provide advisory support.\n\nTogether with more than 50 members of The Institutional Investors Group  on  Climate  Change  (IIGCC),  Storebrand  has  stated  clear expectations  about  companies'  management  of  physical  climate risk. We want companies to demonstrate how they deal with the physical  effects  of  climate  change  in  their  businesses.  In  2021, we  contacted  50  of  the  companies  we  have  invested  in  that  are highly exposed to climate risk, to require them to comply with our expectations. Expectations include strategic planning using climate scenarios, integration of climate adaptation in business decisions, and reporting in line with the TCFD recommendations.",

Appendix\n\n## Details of how we engaged in 2021\n\nDuring  2021,  we  initiated  contact  382  times  with  332  different companies.  This  was  in  addition  to  already  ongoing  dialogues. During  the  year,  we  had  a  total  of  601  dialogues  with  people  or departments in a total of 490 companies. 42 The contact includes both obtaining information and direct dialogue about the companies' sustainability work. In addition to dialogue with companies, we also had four dialogues with external fund managers and 38 meetings with authorities and public organisations in 2021.\n\n## Dialogue with companies\n\nStorebrand accounted for 154 of the dialogues with companies we have invested in. In other cases, we took the initiative together with other companies: 67 initiatives were with Storebrand in a leading role, and 358 with Storebrand as a contributor. A total of 87 per cent of the initiatives took place proactively, while 3.2 per cent took place on a reactive basis and 9.7 per cent were not categorised. 43\n\nThe dialogues took place mainly in the form of e-mail, letters and digital  meetings.  In  the  vast  majority  of  cases,  the  dialogue  took place with investor contacts or sustainability teams. In 16 per cent of cases, we were in contact with the CEO of the companies in question.\n\n## What types of companies we engaged with (sectors)\n\nMost of the initiatives included companies in the materials sector, consumer goods, financial services and manufacturing.\n\n## Geography\n\nThe majority of the companies we had dialogue with in 2021 were based in the US, Japan, Sweden and Norway.\n\n## What aspects of ESG we engaged on (ESG categories)\n\nIn 2021, our engagements with companies dealt with several topics within ESG and we addressed as many as 12 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Just over half of the dialogues dealt with climate issues, including climate change, emissions, deforestation and the use of chemicals, while 29 per cent focused on social issues such as human rights, working conditions and wage conditions. 18 per cent of the dialogues were about corporate governance.\n\n## Outcomes of engagements concluded\n\nDuring  2021,  we  conducted  and  concluded  33  dialogues.  We achieved the outcomes we sought in eight of the dialogues, while we did not achieve the desired outcomes in six of them. In the remaining 18 dialogues, we consider the outcomes to have been neutral. In cases where the engagements concluded successfully, the result was first and foremost an increased awareness and understanding. In some cases, the companies changed their practices or committed to implementing concrete changes.\n\n## Voting\n\nIn 2021, we voted at the Annual General Meeting of 947 companies based in a total of 47 countries. Nearly 30 per cent of the meetings we attended took place in the United States. The financial sector accounted  for  the  largest  amount    -  247  meetings  -  while  the utilities sector accounted for the lowest number with 57 meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG ENGAGEMENTS - ESG ISSUES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Tema                                    |   Number of engangements | Percentage distribution   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| GHG emissions                           |                      161 | 26.8 %                    |\n| Climate change                          |                      104 | 17.3 %                    |\n| Deforestation                           |                       80 | 13.3 %                    |\n| Chemicals                               |                       51 | 8.5 %                     |\n| Human rights in conflict zones          |                       37 | 6.2 %                     |\n| Climate change financing                |                       28 | 4.7 %                     |\n| Forced labour                           |                       26 | 4.3 %                     |\n| Access to medicines                     |                       21 | 3.5 %                     |\n| Living wages                            |                       18 | 3.0 %                     |\n| Human Rights                            |                       12 | 2.0 %                     |\n| Sustainability reporting and disclosure |                       11 | 1.8 %                     |\n| Healthy food and nutrition              |                        9 | 1.5 %                     |\n| Coal financing                          |                        8 | 1.3 %                     |\n| Biodiversity                            |                        6 | 1.0 %                     |\n| Indigenous Peoples rights               |                        4 | 0.7 %                     |\n\n- 42)  The number of dialogues is higher than the number of companies because in some cases we have contact with several people on different topics in the same company.\n\n43)  Proactive dialogues / initiatives mean internal pre-planned engagements in a case (e.g. dialogue with 20 companies with the highest emissions), while reactive means that we respond to a response that\n\nhas been notified of a case (e.g. from a third party).",

Appendix\n\nOut  of  18,016  proposals  for  consideration,  we  voted  in  18,003 cases.  In  90  per  cent  of  cases,  we  supported  proposals  from the management of the companies, while we voted against the management's recommendation in 10 per cent of cases.\n\nStorebrande  against  proposals  from  the  management  dealt with, among other things, extraordinary compensation schemes, reporting and plans related to climate risk, reporting on matters related to human rights, as well as the independence of the board and a lack of diversity. For example, we voted against a proposal from the management of the energy company Equinor for targets for  climate  change  in  the  short,  medium  and  long  term.  Our rationale was that companies we invest in should adopt targets for greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. The Equinor management's proposal received a majority with the support of the Norwegian state, but Storebrand's vote sent a strong signal that investors want ambitious and concrete climate targets both in the short and long term.\n\n## Multilateral cooperation to support active ownership\n\nMany sustainability challenges are so extensive that they can only be solved through multi-party involvement and cooperation, for example authorities, trade associations, environmental and human rights organisations and trade unions.\n\nSeveral of the initiatives and alliances we have engaged in in recent years focus on the priority areas for active ownership in 2021-2023 as discussed above.\n\nIn 2021, we joined the Platform for Living Wages Financials (PLWF) to contribute to a positive development in the living wages in within the clothing, food and agricultural and retail sectors.\n\nAnother example of this type of collaboration is the Task force on  Nature-related  Financial  Disclosures  (TNFD),  a  framework  for businesses that will help organisations manage biodiversity risks. Storebrand is an advisory participant in the TNFD Forum, a crosssectoral competence body that supports the work of TNFD.\n\nBusiness  engagement  at  the  political  level  is  also  important  to stimulate  change  and  promote  sustainability  initiatives.    During 2021, we led and supported several broad initiatives to influence the COP26 United Nations Climate Conference and COP15 United Nations  Biodiversity  Conference  sustainability  negotiations.  Both conferences brought together governments around the world to agree on national commitments and set new long-term goals for climate and natural issues. An important element of the negotiations was  to  create  broad  support  among  financial  players  for  revised frameworks and commitments based on climate-based research that  will  contribute  to  achieving  sustainability.    Storebrand  has been active in leading and supporting several important and broad sustainability collaboration initiatives.\n\nThe Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis and the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge were among the initiatives we actively engaged in. These initiatives involved financial institutions\n\nwith a total of USD 46 trillion in assets under management and USD 10 trillion in assets under management, respectively.\n\nProtection  and  sustainable  management  of  oceans,  forests, wetlands and other sensitive ecosystems are essential for long-term social and economic stability. Environmental destruction reduces nature's ability to continue to generate the ecosystem services that businesses and societies depend on. Industry players depend on input factors such as water, materials and minerals. In addition, for  example,  they  need  erosion  control  and  flood  protection  to ensure  stable  production  processes.    A  lack  of  understanding of the relationship between natural capital and industry activity is described as called 'hidden' risks. The value of natural capital is  estimated  at  more  than  NOK  100,000  billion  globally.  Loss  of nature can thus have major economic consequences for business and social development. Activities to avoid loss of biodiversity are therefore high on Storebrand's agenda. In 2022, we will continue our work to establish nature-related risk as a concept, in the same way as climate risk.\n\nAt the forefront of the COP26 and COP15 conferences, we joined forces  with  77  other  financial  institutions  in  the  Finance  for Biodiversity  Pledge  that  urged  the  world's  governments  to  act immediately to stop and reverse biodiversity loss. The statement calls  for  the  creation  of  a  more  ambitious  Global  Biodiversity Framework (GBF) that drives the expectations of financial institutions and businesses to align financial flows to global biodiversity goals.\n\nThis  year,  we  also  signed  the  Business  Call  for  a  UN  Treaty  on Plastic Pollution. Plastic pollution is a problem that is not dealt with effectively by current legal and political frameworks. A global treaty on plastic pollution can help drive the transition to a circular economy for plastics, which Storebrand supports by committing to exercising responsible investment practices on this topic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Myanmar, we have also led a major investor initiative to reduce the risk of contributing to human rights violations. Some of the cases involved led to exclusions. Company reporting is another of our main topics: We have highlighted the importance of consistent, reliable and verifiable reporting on sustainability indicators in our dialogue with our portfolio companies during the period.\n\nBiodiversity  and  ecosystems  are  one  of  our  priority  engagement  topics  -  they  play  a  crucial  role  in  supporting sustainable value creation and meeting climate commitments. We are committed to achieving a deforestation-free portfolio by 2025. We work with portfolio companies to communicate our expectations for improved forest protection in operations and supply chains. Prior to the COP15 negotiations, Storebrand finance for Biodiversity Pledge signed, and called for urgent government action on climate issues. In the Nordic countries, we have also worked on a set of expectations and dialogues with forestry companies.\n\nWe continue our engagement with companies in the aquaculture sector, with a focus on climate issues and impacts on biodiversity. This year we have also collaborated with Grieg Seafood, WWF and the Norwegian Institute for Marine Research (NINA), on a pilot project to improve the aquaculture sector's reporting on influences and dependences on nature.\n\nThe transition to a low-emission society and net zero emissions in 2050 is one of our priority topics. Storebrand has been a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures working group, which was launched this year, with the aim of creating a reporting framework that helps organisations manage biodiversity risk and identify opportunities. We also announced clear expectations of companies in tackling climate risk and have focused on dialogues with the 20 largest emitters in our portfolios. Prior to COP26, we were a signatory of Call to Action for the decarbonisation of shipping, which clarifies an expectation for governments to increase their ambitions and commit to decarbonising shipping by 2050. During this period, Storebrand also signed the Global Investor Statement to governments on the climate crisis and called for urgent government measures to achieve climate targets.\n\nWe work with companies to reduce water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in intensive livestock production. In addition, we have engaged them to raise environmental standards in important sectors, such as palm oil, soy, cattle and timber. In 2021, we signed the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution to help drive the transition to a circular economy for plastics.\n\nWe are engaged with companies in our portfolio where we address issues of working conditions, including the living wage. We have joined the Platform for Living Wages Financials (PLWF) initiative and are working with other investors to address issues of the living wage and create structures that support workers' working conditions.  The platform contributes to a positive development in the living wage in the clothing, food and agricultural and retail sectors.\n\nOne of our most important engagement issues is supply chain resilience, including the issue of forced labour, where we have continued to focus on China and the Xinjiang region, through direct dialogues and with the Investor Alliance on Human rights. Storebrand wants to raise awareness of international labour rights, particularly in high-risk sectors such as the textile industry. We seek to improve our policies and contribute to both better relationships between management and employees and working conditions in our supply chains.\n\nWe strive to ensure that the companies we are invested in ensure good health and quality of life for their employees. This year we also required companies to establish the right practices and measures to protect their employees from Covid-19.\n\nStorebrand has worked actively to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on companies, society, the economy and financial  markets.  As  a  result,  Storebrand  is  committed  to  acting  in  support  of  investor  statement  on  Coronavirus Response.",

Appendix\n\n## Exclusions\n\nAll  our  investments  must  satisfy  the  Storebrand  Standard,  our benchmark requirement for sustainable investments, which excludes companies that violate international norms and conventions or are involved  in  unacceptable  operations.  The  Storebrand  Standard includes criteria for human rights and international law, corruption, corporate  crime,  serious  climate  and  environmental  damage, controversial weapons (land mines, cluster munitions and nuclear weapons) and tobacco. Companies in high-risk industries that have low  sustainability  scores  are  excluded.  Furthermore,  we  do  not invest in companies that are excluded from the Norwegian Pension Fund  Global  (GPFG)  by  Norges  Bank  (the  Norwegian  national central  bank).  For  selected  funds  and  savings  profiles,  we  apply expanded criteria related to businesses involved in the production and distribution of fossil fuels, alcohol, pornography, weapons and gambling, as well as green bond standards.\n\nWe  address  serious  breaches  of  standards  by  our  portfolio companies  through  a  structured,  policy-driven,  and  predicable process, in which exclusion is generally a final resort.\n\nIn case of serious behavioural violations of our standards, we usually begin by engaging in dialogue with the company. If we conclude that the company poses an unacceptable risk of breaching our standards, we sell our existing investments in the company and exclude it from our investment portfolio. 44\n\nIn case of product-based breaches, our exclusion process is based on more data analysis than dialogue. We have agreements with thirdparty databases that document and report to us the percentage of  revenue  that  companies  receive  from  specific  classifications  of\n\nproducts. If a company's revenue from the excluded product classes rises  above  our  threshold  levels,  we  automatically  exclude  the company. The detailed product-based threshold levels vary, rising to a maximum of 5 per cent of total revenue.\n\nIn  2021,  the  exclusion  process  resulted  in  the  exclusion  of  67 companies from our investment portfolios consisting of over 5,000 companies. A total of 7 companies were re-included, after observed and sustained returns to the required standards. As of December 31st, 2021, there are 257 companies of the MSCI ACWI Index on our exclusion list, while an additional 517 companies are excluded from certain funds based on our extended criteria.\n\n## Companies excluded based on the Storebrand standard, by category, as of 31 December 2021\n\n| Conduct-based exclusion - Environment                         | 18    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Conduct-based exclusion - Corruption                          | 10    |\n| Conduct-based exclusion - Human Rights  and International Law | 39    |\n| Tobacco                                                       | 25    |\n| Controversial weapons                                         | 27    |\n| Climate - Coal                                                | 133   |\n| Climate - Lobbying                                            | 5     |\n| Climate - Oilsand                                             | 9     |\n| Unsustainable Palmoil                                         | 11    |\n| Cannabis                                                      | 1     |\n| Total number of companies                                     | 257 * |\n\n*) For further description of our exclusion methods, see Storebrand's exlusion list.\n\n## Human rights in Myanmar\n\nAfter a military coup against Myanmar's democratically elected government in early 2021, Storebrand has been taking a leading role regarding investor engagement to help secure human rights in the country.\n\nFollowing the coup, the military government that took control over the country carried out actions against prodemocracy protesters. These actions have resulted in hundreds of deaths and several thousand people being arrested, tortured and injured. Furthermore, an estimated 700,000 people hailing from Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic minority group have been forced to seek refuge outside the country. The Myanmarese military government's actions were met with international protests, condemnations and sanctions from the United States, the European Union and many other countries, multilateral institutions and organisations around the world.\n\nStorebrand  led  the  work  to  formulate  a  joint  statement  from  the  international  business  community,  in cooperation with the Investor Alliance for Human Rights and the Heartland Initiative. One outcome is this work was the formal publication of the Investor Statement on Human Rights and Business Activities in Myanmar which was signed in June 2021 by 77 investors globally. The statement called on companies operating in Myanmar to identify the risk of human rights violations in their own value chain, take measures to reduce risk, report publicly on development, and participate in collective measures to support human rights in the country.\n\nStorebrand carried out due diligence related to companies operating in Myanmar to identify links to the military junta government and potential human rights violations.",

Appendix\n\n## Risk\n\nOur risk management framework is designed to ensure that we take the appropriate risk for delivering returns to customers and shareholders,  while  protecting  them,  our  employees  and  other stakeholders  from  adverse  events  and  losses.  The  framework covers all risks Storebrand may be exposed to. The main risks are business risk, financial market risk, insurance risk, counterparty risk, operational risk, climate risk and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA and the directors of the subsidiaries adopt a risk appetite and risk strategy at least once per year. Risk taking shall contribute to the achievement of our strategic and commercial  goals,  including  customers  receiving  a  competitive return  on  their  pension  funds,  and  that  Storebrand  receives adequate  payment  for  taking  on  risk.  Risk  appetite  is  defined  as the overall risk level and what types of risk are deemed acceptable. The guidelines from the risk appetite are incorporated in our risk strategy, which sets the targets and frameworks. Based on these, more detailed strategies are compiled for different risk categories. Storebrand publishes an annual Solvency and Financial Condition Report  (SFCR)  which  helps  customers  and  other  stakeholders understand the risks in the business and how these are managed.\n\nThe Board assesses the risk in the Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA)  process.  The  greatest  risk  for  Storebrand  is  the  financial market risk. In the short term, troubled financial markets, especially falling stock, credit and real estate markets, may result in investment losses, or falling interest rates may increase the insurance liability. In the longer term, persistently low interest rates are a risk because it  becomes  more  difficult  to  achieve  the  guaranteed  return  on investment. Other risk areas include business risk, insurance risk, counterparty risk, operational risk, climate risk and liquidity risk.\n\nCovid-19 has had a limited impact on Storebrand's operations. The reorganisation of work routines during the pandemic took place without  significant  adverse  events,  and  the  customer  service  and deliveries  were  affected  only  to  a  small  degree.  Increased  use  of digital services in the normal working day has, however, reinforced the need to take care of and further develop IT security solutions. Overall, we saw a stable development in the number of reported incidents  in  2021.  The  number  of  customer  and  process-related incidents was at the same level as in 2020. However, the number of 'high-risk incidents' was somewhat higher, where we reported several cases to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority in 2021.\n\nThe  financial  markets  developments  have  been  positive  for Storebrand  throughout  the  year,  with  rising  stock  markets  and interest rates at the same time as credit spreads remained stable.\n\nOne of the biggest financial risks associated with Covid-19 has been the risk associated with rising unemployment as a result of a weak economy. This has historically led to an increase in disability and related claims. Storebrand has strengthened its reserves to meet the increased uncertainty. The autumn of 2021 marked a reopening of Norwegian society, but the renewed infection pressure towards the end of the year means that the risk is still higher than usual.\n\nThe risk landscape varies between business areas. The main risks are described per business area below. Risks associated with regulatory changes are discussed in the section Outlook above.\n\n## Insurance\n\nInsurance  consists  of  personal  risk  products  and  property  and casualty insurance. The price can normally be adjusted on an annual basis if the risk changes. The greatest risk is disability risk. More people than expected may become disabled and/or fewer disabled people will be able to work again. Some policies provide a payout in the event of death, but Storebrand's risk from this is limited. In P&C insurance, most of the risk is linked to developments in claims payments from car and home insurance. Climate change is one factor which may affect future claims.\n\n## Savings\n\nSavings consists of Unit Linked insurance and other non-guaranteed pensions, the asset management business and the banking business. For Unit Linked insurance, the customer bears the financial market risk. The disbursements are generally time limited, and Storebrand bears low risk from increased life expectancy. For Storebrand, the risk from United Linked insurance is primarily changes in future income or cost. Managing customer's assets in a professional and sustainable way, which at that at the same time ensures a good riskadjusted return, is however important to attract new customers and create growth.\n\nThe  asset  management  business  offers  active  and  passive management, as well as management of fund-in-fund structures. Operational risks, including regulatory compliance, are the greatest risks.\n\nThe  greatest  risks  for  the  banking  business  are  credit  risk  and liquidity  risk.  Virtually  the  entire  loan  portfolio  is  secured  by mortgages, limiting our credit risk.\n\n## Guaranteed pensions\n\nGuaranteed Pension encompasses savings and pension products with  guaranteed  interest  rates.  The  greatest  risks  are  financial market risk and longevity risk.",

Appendix\n\nA common feature of the products is that Storebrand guarantees a minimum return. In Norway, the return must exceed the guarantee in each year, while in Sweden it is enough to achieve the guaranteed return on average over time.\n\nThe  guaranteed  insurance  liabilities  are  sensitive  to  changes in interest rates, where lower rates will increase the value of the liabilities and make it harder to achieve the guaranteed return. We aim to control the risk through the investments, but there is a residual risk from lower interest rates.\n\nThe traditional guaranteed products are closed for new business, but there is a large back-book of reserves. New premiums are mainly in Defined Contribution pensions (Unit Linked) or hybrid schemes with a zero per cent guarantee.\n\nStorebrand wants to grow in the guaranteed public occupational pension  market  and  received  new  customers  in  2021.  Public pension products differ from guaranteed pension products in the private  sector  because  in  the  public  sector,  the  employer  pays for the interest rate guarantee, even for resigned employees and pensioners.\n\n## Other\n\nThe  Other  unit  encompasses  the  holding  company  Storebrand ASA, as well as the company portfolios. The assets in Storebrand ASA and the company portfolios are invested at low risk, primarily in investment grade short-term interest-bearing securities.\n\nTax\n\nChanges have been made to the Norwegian tax legislation for the insurance industry over many years. Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration have interpreted some of the legislation changes and  the  associated  transitional  rules  differently.  Consequently, Storebrand has three significant uncertain tax positions with regards to recognised tax expenses. These are described in more detail in  note  26.  Should  Storebrand's  interpretation  be  accepted  in  all three cases, an estimated positive tax result of up to NOK 2.8 billion may be recognised. Should all the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretations be the final verdict, a tax expense of NOK 1.8 billion could be recognised. However, the timeline for settling the process with the Norwegian Tax Administration might take several years. If necessary, Storebrand will seek clarification from the court of law on the matter.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Appendix\n\n## Climate risk and opportunities\n\nClimate  risk  often  is  divided  into  two  categories:  physical  risk (consequences of changes to the climate and the environment) and transition risk (consequences of the transition to a low-carbon society).\n\nPhysical climate risk is impacted by the extent and speed of climate change. A common reference for total physical climate risk is the average global temperature increase since the pre-industrial age. The United Nations states that the global temperature rise already is 1.1 degrees. 52 The development the next decade is expected to be a consequence of previous years' emissions. Decisions made during the next few years will affect the risk significantly in the long term.\n\nThe transition risk will be influenced by how extensive and fast the transmission to a low-carbon society will take place. The transmission will  be  affected  by  politics,  regulatory  demands,  technological development, business priorities and consumer preferences.\n\n## Why\n\nBoth climate change and the transmission to a low-carbon society represent both challenges and opportunities for Storebrand. Every year, we assess how climate risk may impact the Group's operations, financial  situation,  framework  conditions,  and  reputation.  The assessment  provides  a  basis  on  which  to  analyse  measures  to reduce risks or exploit opportunities.\n\nClimate change and the transition to a low-carbon society could impact our business significantly. The consequences may be further enhanced by changes to the oil price and activities in the oil and gas industry.\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand developed a climate strategy to contribute to global warming being limited to about 1.5 degrees. 53 A key element is to ensure carbon-neutral investments by 2050, at the latest, with specific  sub-goals  along  the  way.  Measures  to  reduce  risks  and maximise opportunities are described in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments .\n\nThe effects on investments and obligations may be sudden, in the form of market volatility, or gradual, through lower returns and lasting low interest rates. Policy or regulations may also entail risk if it is difficult to meet targets due to limited technological or investment opportunities. Examples could be an abrupt change to Norway's\n\npolicies in order to reach the Paris agreement targets, dropping interest rates or oil price, or reduced petroleum activities.  As part of  our  work  to  reduce  risk,  we  mapped  Storebrand's  exposure in the fossile fuel sector last year, particularly in terms of income from pension products, as well as disability coverage related to the industry and related sectors.\n\nWe  use  the  recommendations  from  the  Task  Force  on  ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as a framework for reporting of climate-related financial risks. 54 Storebrand's impact on the climate is described elsewhere in this report, mainly in the chapter Keeping our house in order and in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments .\n\nWe  have  established  an  index  to  describe  where  the  TCFDrecommended disclosures are addressed in this report. The index is included in the appendix on page 216.\n\n## Our approach\n\nStorebrand assesses climate risk based on the same framework as other business risks. Overall risks, including climate risk, are described in a risk analysis report addressed by the Group Executive Management  and  Board  twice  a  year.  The  risk  analysis  includes assessments of business and reputation risks related Storebrand's strategy to uphold a leading sustainability position. Climate risk also is addressed in the annual ORSA-report 55 , which is sent to Norway's Financial Supervisory Authority following approval by the Storebrand Board. Climate risk also is a part of the risk review conducted by all Group subsidiaries. Climate risk, particularly physical risk, is very long term and therefore is assessed in based on a longer time perspective than other risks.\n\n## Scenarios for climate risk assessments\n\nAs historical events have a limited relevance for climate risk, it is necessary to assess risks related to various scenarios. Storebrand bases our annual assessment on three scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 Rapid transition to a low carbon society, meeting the target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees\n- \u00b7 Somewhat slower transition, but global warming is nevertheless limited to about 2 degrees\n- \u00b7 Emissions continue to be high and global warming reaches or exceeds 3 degrees\n\nMetrics\\_Targets\\_Guidance-1.pdf\n\n55)  Own Risk and Solvency Assessment, ORSA",

The  scenarios  will  be  further  developed,  including  quantitative stress tests, as a basis for supervisory processes and analyses of financial stability.\n\nNGSF  has  defined  six  scenarios  with  risk  varying  along  two dimensions.\n\n- 1. How serious will the physical consequence of global warming be?\n- 2. Will  the  transition  be  a  controlled  or  disruptive  process? (transition risk)\n\nNGFS outlines two scenarios that lead to zero emissions in 2050. The scenario 'Net Zero 2050' expects a rapid transition, with a high degree of coordination among nations and sectors. The transition risk in this scenario therefore is seen as low, despite the speed of the transition. The 'Divergent Net Zero' scenario considers the\n\ntransition risk significantly higher, as the use of oil as transportation fuel is phased out very quickly while the use of fossil energy for industrial activities declines more slowly. The physical risk is about the same in both scenarios because global warming is limited to 1,5 degrees.\n\nStorebrand  has  chosen  \u00abDivergent  Net  Zero\u00bb  as  a  basis  for  the 'Speedy transition' scenario. Norway could be particularly exposed to transition risk because of a rapid phasing out of oil and gas as energy sources. In addition, ambitions and preferred means are likely to vary significantly among various stakeholders.\n\nStorebrand's 'Delayed transition'  scenario  is  based  on  the  NGFSscenario  carrying  the  same  name.  In  this  scenario,  emissions continue  to  rise  up  until  2030,  after  which  policy  becomes significantly restrictive. This is expected to result in a rapid decline in emissions after 2030, towards zero in 2050, keeping global warming below 2 degrees. In this scenario, transition risk is about the same as for \u00abSpeedy transition\u00bb but it is postponed until after 2030. The physical climate risk in this scenario is expected to be somewhat higher than for 'Speedy transition.'",

Appendix\n\n## Figure 2: Storebrand's climate risk scenarios\n\n## A: Speedy transition\n\n## B: Delayed transition\n\n## C: Current policies\n\nThe scenario is based on the NGFS 'Divergent Net Zero'. Climate policies are subject to a major shift, and the technological development happens fast. The zero emission target by 2050 is reached. Global warming is contained at less than 1.5 degrees. Costs related to the transition will be considerable, accelerated by a lack of coordination among nations and sectors. The use of oil for transporation is phased out rapidly, while the reduction in the fossil share for energy supply and industry are variable. The scenario is based on moderate use of CO2 capture and storage.\n\nThe scenario is based on the NGSF 'Delayed Transition'-scenario. The absence of regulations lead to economical growth in the wake of Covid-19 are based on fossil energy. The CO2 emissions grow up until 2030. Policies then become stricter and include a significant increase in the price of CO2. This leads to a rapid decline in emissions post 2030, towards zero in 2050. The overall emission decline is sufficient to ensure a global warming below 2 degrees.\n\nThe scenario is based on the NGSF 'Current Policies' scenario. Limited awareness of the climate crisis combined with shortsighted political priorities prevent the implementation of future restrictions. Measures implemented to reduce emissions are continued. Emissions increases until 2080. Global warming is expected to reach about 3 degrees, with a significant risk of an even further increase. This will lead to large and irreversible climate change.\n\nIt is useful to understand what the various scenarios mean for conditions  that  affect  Storebrand's  risks.  A  global  temperature increase is a key indicator of physical risk, while carbon costs are a key indicator of the global temperature development. Carbon price development is a main indicator of transition risk. In Norway, the demand and price development for oil and gas are key indicators for transition risk. Both the transition and physical climate changes could affect economic growth and the financial markets. The development of  the  Norwegian  economy  will  influence  out  customers,  whose behaviour, in turn will impact Storebrand's future earnings. At the same time, the global effects on global financial markets will affect Storebrand as an asset manager.\n\nAreas where climate-related risks can affect Storebrand\n\nClimate risk affects several parts of our business. At the same time, it is important to understand that both the source of risk and the way the risk affects the business can be different. Therefore, it is important that separate assessments are made for each of the areas listed below.\n\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's investments, both securities and real estate\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's life insurance liabilities\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's non-life insurance liabilities\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's asset management\n- \u00b7 Storebrand's banking business\n- \u00b7 Risk that Storebrand's customers may be affected by climate risk\n- \u00b7 Reputation  risk,  especially  linked  to  Storebrand's  strategy choice to be a leader in sustainability\n- \u00b7 Regulatory risk from non-compliance with new requirements for climate adaptation or reporting\n\nFurther  in  this  chapter,  we  will  focus  on  the  areas  that  are  most important  in  different  parts  of  our  business.  For  each  area, implemented  and  planned  measures  that  affect  the  risk  are described, in addition to assessments of any new measures that can contribute to reducing risks or realising opportunities from climate change.\n\n## Climate risk for investments\n\nStorebrand's largest climate-related financial risks and opportunities are considered to be in the transition to a low-emission society. Our investments may be affected by climate policy and regulations, stricter emission requirements, a changed cost structure and market preferences. Our most important measures to reduce these risks and exploit potential opportunities are described in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments .\n\nClimate risk can affect Storebrand's return through two mechanisms:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate-related  factors  affecting  returns  from  the  financial market as a whole, for example because economic growth is affected by physical climate change or due to a less effective policy to achieve zero emissions (absolute climate risk).\n- \u00b7 Effects  of  Storebrand  investing  differently  from  the  broad market, for example by failing to invest in some industries or companies and investing more in solution companies (relative climate risk).",

Appendix\n\n## Absolute climate risk\n\nThe transition risk can have both positive and negative consequences for various players, which can make it challenging to decide whether to invest in given sectors and companies. It can be difficult to argue whether the transition as a whole will have positive or negative consequences for the capital market. For long-term pension savings, it is therefore beneficial to invest broadly in global financial markets in order to diversify risk and meet any future risks.\n\nThe main difference between the scenarios above is the long-term negative  effect  of  physical  climate  risk.  The  risk  is  greatest  in  the scenario 'Current policies ', while it is least in the 'Speedy transition' scenario.  One  challenge  is  that  the  negative  effects  of  climate change are not evident to the individual company and consumer, especially in the short term. It is therefore important that authorities and other actors adjust framework conditions and preferences so that companies and private individuals can adapt both behaviours and attitudes in the interest of society.\n\nStorebrand's  most  important  contribution  is  to  ensure  that  the Group's  investments  are  carbon  neutral  by  2050.  Through  active ownership, we work systematically to ensure that the companies that  we  invest  in  do  their  part  to  reduce  emissions.  Our  work is carried out in direct dialogue with individual companies, and through several strategic collaborations, such as in the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance, the Net Zero Asset Manager Alliance, and the Climate Action 100+.\n\n## Relative climate risk\n\nStorebrand's investment strategy means that our investments have deliberate deviations from the global market index. This is partly a consequence of Storebrand Asset Management's sustainability strategy that applies to all investments, and partly a consequence of Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring having their own requirements as part of the investment strategy. We make a number of adjustments to reduce the relative climate risk to which our investments are exposed, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Excluding companies that contribute to serious environmental damage. 57\n- \u00b7 Excluding companies that actively work against the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n- \u00b7 Excluding companies in the fossil sector in parts of the portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Setting  requirements  for  a  minimum  average  sustainability condition, which also includes climate-related conditions.\n- \u00b7 A minimum of 15 per cent of the portfolio must be invested in solutions by 2025.\n\n57)  We exclude companies that contribute to serious environmental damage, including companies that receive more than 5 per cent of the revenues from coal, oil sands-based activities, and companies that are involved in serious and / or systematic unsustainable production of palm oil, soy, cattle and timber. Read more about our exclusions here: https://www.storebrand.no/asset-management/barekraftige-investeringer/utelukkelser\n\n- 59)  See definitions for investments in solutions on page 241 in the appendix Sustainability indicators and definitions.\n\nIn 2020, we launched a new climate strategy for our investments, with the goal of entering into investments that greatly contribute to climate change. We no longer invest in companies that receive more than 5 per cent of the revenues from coal, oil sands-based activities, are involved in serious and / or systematic unsustainable production of palm oil, soy, cattle and timber. Storebrand will not invest in companies that consciously and systematically work against the goals agreed in the Paris Agreement. We expect companies to support  effective  policy  measures  aimed  at  reducing  climate  risk and limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. This support should apply to all commitments made by the company in all geographical regions,  and  to  political  commitments  made  indirectly,  through third-party organisations acting on behalf of the company or with the company's financial support.\n\nBased on the targets for carbon-neutral investments by 2050 and intermediate  targets  for  emission  reductions,  we  established  a framework in 2021 with the following targets for 2025:\n\n- \u00b7 Emission  targets  for  equity,  corporate  bonds  and  real estate investments: We have a goal of reducing the carbon footprint 58 in Storebrand's  total  investments  in  equities, corporate bonds and real estate by at least 32 per cent by 2025 (base year in 2018).\n- \u00b7 Direct capital towards solution companies: Storebrand has a goal that 15 per cent of our total investments will be invested in  what  we  define  as  solutions  by  2025.  This  includes  equity investments  in  solution  companies 59 ,  green  bonds,  certified green real estate and investments in green infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Be an active owner and driver force: In  2021,  we  had  our focus on the 20 companies with the highest emissions. 60 The impact  work  took  place  mainly  in  collaboration  with  other investors, including Climate Action 100+. In addition, we held meetings with the management of the 20 companies in which we had ownership interests and which represented the largest emissions:",

The  valuation  reflects,  to  some  extent,  that  the authorities' target of zero emissions in 2050 may have consequences for oil and gas demand, and earnings for oil and gas shares and that the price of carbon emissions may be higher in the future. Similarly, the  financial  market  has  priced  in  that  companies  that  invest  in renewable energy, or that can in other ways take advantage of opportunities in the green shift, can achieve increased earnings in the future (high valuation in relation to current results is a measure of this).\n\nLower  future  returns  for  fossil  fuel  companies  than  solution companies are due to the climate effects being larger or coming faster than expected. It is therefore likely that Storebrand will have a somewhat lower climate risk than the market in the scenario 'Speedy transition'. In the scenarios 'Delayed transition' or 'Current policies', it is likely that Storebrand will have a somewhat higher climate risk than the market because we were early in developing a\n\n## Shipping\n\n- \u00b7 DFDS A/S\n- \u00b7 Odfjell SE\n- \u00b7 Wallenius Wilhelmsen ASA\n- \u00b7 Wilh Wilhelmsen Holding ASA\n\n## Oil & Gas\n\n- \u00b7 Equinor ASA\n- \u00b7 Gazprom PJSC\n- \u00b7 LUKOIL PJSC\n- \u00b7 SFL Corp Ltd\n\nstrategy to realise the goal of zero emissions. The risk must be seen in connection with Storebrand's total investments being broadly diversified, which means that the deviation risk in the portfolios is limited, including the effects of climate risk.\n\n## Exposure for different technologies\n\nThe  overview  of  companies  in  high-emitting  sectors  (Figure  3) is based on each individual company being assessed as a whole, based on its own main business. An oil and gas company is defined in  the  overview  as  100  per  cent  fossil  sector,  even  though  it  has activities within green energy or technology.\n\nStorebrand has performed a more granular analysis for selected investment  portfolios  based  on  methodologies  from  PACTA.  As an example, the PACTA analysis is used for 'Storebrand Balansert Pensjon',  which  is  the  largest  investment  profile  for  Defined Contribution pensions in Storebrand Livsforsikring.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Overall, the analysed industries account for approximately 75 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Measured as a proportion of investments, the analysed industries amounted to approximately 6 per cent of the equity and bond investments for Storebrand  Balansert  Pensjon,  while  they  accounted  for  43  per\n\ncent of emissions from the equity investments and 20 per cent of emissions from the bond investments. The proportion of emissions covered  by  the  analysis  was  significantly  lower  than  75  per  cent. This was due to Storebrand having lower exposure than the rest of the market to the analysed sectors. Non-analysed sectors are considered to be relatively larger contributors to emissions.\n\nFigure 5: Storebrand Balansert Pensjon, exposure to different technologies for selected industries compared to index\n\nFinancial exposure to climate relevant sector",

Appendix\n\nStorebrand  had  lower  exposure  than  the  index  in  the  most exposed industries. As a consequence, Storebrand was therefore underexposed  to  some  of  the  green  technologies.  This  was especially  relevant  in  power  production,  where  Storebrand  had lower exposure than the market to renewable energy. Many of the companies use fossil energy sources, including coal, while being involved in renewable energy. Other companies with exposure to renewable energy are excluded from other sustainability criteria, such as violations of basic human rights (this illustrates that a good strategy for climate and other sustainability adaptation requires many considerations).\n\n## Forward-looking analysis\n\nBoth the carbon footprint and exposure to industries or technologies provide a snapshot of risks. We believe it is more important to look at  how  companies  work  towards  reducing  the  footprint  in  line with the zero-emission target. Storebrand assesses, among other things, whether companies we plan to invest in have committed to emission targets based on scientific facts. We also closely monitor the proportion of companies in our portfolios that have set sciencebased targets.\n\nThe  PACTA  tool  provides  an  opportunity  to  assess  how  the companies' plans will affect the composition of technologies over time. Figure 12 shows what exposure to one of the expected future that our portfolio, as well as the world market index looks like. This is compared with what is required to be in line with the two degreetarget or below (Aligned portfolio / benchmark).\n\nThe  analysis  above  assumes  that  Storebrand  owns  the  same companies  in  five  years.  The  portfolio's  exposure  over  time  can be influenced through dynamic goals for the investment strategy. Examples  may  be  not  investing  in  bonds  issued  by  fossil  fuel companies  maturing  after  2030  or  setting  gradually  increasing targets for the share of solution companies. By investing fossil-free, we can also reduce our risk, but this will not help the world reach its emission targets today. Therefore, investments in companies moving in the right direction may be effective, even if they have large emissions in the short term.\n\n## Figure 6: Storebrand Balansert Pensjon, exposure in five years based on the companies' plans\n\nListed Equity: Future technology mix as % of sector based on ETP2017: B2DS\n\nscenario compared to iShares MSCI ACWI ETF as a subset of Global Market .",

Gaining relative returns through appropriate managing and prevention of risks, and utilising opportunities in the transition to the low-emission society, varies from the market in general.\n\nAcute  physical  climate  risk  is  already  affecting  real  estate,  also in Scandinavia, even though the risk is far lower than in the most vulnerable parts of the world. The risk increases over time, especially during the 'Current policies' scenario. Extreme rainfall and flooding stand out as the most important single factors. Micro-location and the robustness of properties affect exposure to damage, increased insurance costs and other costs. Chronic physical risk such as heat waves and sea level rise are more long-term, but can have both direct and indirect financial effects. In the worst case, property can become unusable and unchangeable.\n\nTransition risk in the form of increased public requirements and fees,  increased  climate-related  market  requirements,  as  well  as reputational risk of having too low climate ambitions or not achieving own targets, is most relevant in the 'Speedy transition' scenario and then the 'Delayed transition' scenario. Under the scenarios 'Current policies' and 'Delayed transition', there is a risk of lower returns in the short or medium term as a result of over-investment or premature investment in relation correct market values. Timing is critical to reduce risk. It will be important both on the cost and revenue side, and may be able to have a double effect. The general long-term nature of real estate investments can dampen the effect by getting return on investments at a later stage in the event of a delayed transition.\n\nThe main strategy for reducing risk is through active ownership. Proactive analysis and implementation of measures will optimise adaptation  to  future  climate  change  and  a  1.5-degree  emission pathway, both on the portfolio and individual properties. This is better for society, rather than leaving property with lower climate efficiency to investors who do not have an active strategy. Selection",

Sustainability  certification  (the BREEAM system or equivalent) gives the properties both a quality rating and an important basis for improvement plans. Benchmarking through  GRESB  (Global  Real  Asset  Sustainability  Benchmark) provides a similar sustainability rating at portfolio and management level, and supports development towards a global standard that reduces risk and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nKey indicators for climate risk in real estate:\n\n- \u00b7 Requirements regarding energy efficiency and greenhouse gas  emissions: measures  to  improve  energy  efficiency and  waste  management  are  assessed  and  implemented continuously  on  the  properties,  and  result  in  reduced greenhouse gas emissions from operations.\n- \u00b7 Long-term goal of 100 per cent environmentally certified property.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability  ranking  of  real  estate: The management of our direct real estate investments is ranked by GRESB in four different portfolios, and the portfolios are among the best in Northern  Europe  with  a  similar  composition.  In  2021,  three out of four portfolios are ranked among the top 20 per cent globally, and awarded the maximum of 5 stars. 64\n\n|                                                         | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021 65   | Goal 2025   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| Carbon emissions                                        |        |        |        |           |             |\n| kgCO2e/m2 per year  66                                  | 9.96   | 9.12   | 7.9    | 5.9       | Reduce      |\n| Certified green real  estate, percentage share  AuM  67 | 30 %   | 41 %   | 43 %   | 68%       | 90%         |\n| GRESB-score                                             | 76.4 % | 81.7 % | 84.8 % | 88.6%     | Increase    |\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe  direct  impact  of  climate  change  on  Storebrand's  insurance obligations  is  limited  because  our  business  is  largely  based  on reassurance where the terms of the agreement are adjusted annually. As a responsible insurance company, we still have a responsibility to assist our customers in securing themselves and their assets against potential climate risks. The biggest climate-related financial risk to our property and non-life insurance business is increased insurance settlements related to climate-related damage.\n\nThe  biggest  climate-related  risk  is  more  damage  and  higher compensation  for  property  insurance  due  to  precipitation  that leads to water intrusion. The risk is mainly associated with buildings where the lowest floor is below ground level. The risk has increased because  there  are  more  frequent  storms  with  heavy  rain  in  a concentrated  area,  with  the  greatest  consequences  in  densely populated areas. Although it can cause flooding in a large area, it is not described as a natural catastrophe and must therefore be covered by Storebrand. Major incidents that are directly caused by landslides, storms, floods (rivers and streams that cross their banks), storm surges, earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, on the other hand, are covered by the natural perils pool and internal reinsurance.\n\nEven if physical risk is central to non-life insurance, transitional risk may occur. One possible risk is that fewer people want or need to own their own car. Measures to mitigate climate change may accelerate such a trend. Cars will then to a greater extent be owned by public transport actors, and this will change the market from a private market to a large customer market. For a small player like Storebrand Forsikring, it can be a threat. Increased use of car sharing of privately owned cars will also lead to changes in the need for insurance.\n\nOur  most  important  measures  to  reduce  climate  risk  are  the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk assessment and pricing: Climate factors are included in risk assessment and pricing in the underwriting process. We improve the risk assessment, among other things, by analyzing the risk of extreme precipitation and floods in various areas. At the same time, we give a higher price for insurance of buildings with basements in risk areas.\n- \u00b7 Exposure  mapping  and  reinsurance: We  reinsure  assets in areas with high exposure to physical risk associated with climate change.\n- \u00b7 Diversified  risk  through  national  plan: Participation  in Norwegian natural perils  pool  is  statutory  and  provides  joint reinsurance protection linked to property insurance for real estate and housing.\n- \u00b7 Rewarding  damage  prevention: We  actively  communicate with our customers, encouraging damage prevention measures, such as securing property during periods prone to flooding.",

In  order  for  funds  to be  marketed  as  'green'  or  'sustainable',  they  must  promote sustainability as part of the investment strategy (an Article 8 financial product) or have sustainability as an investment objective (an Article 9 financial product). 68 In 2021, Storebrand and SPP classified all their fixed  income and equity funds as Article 8 or Article 9 under the SFDR standard.\n\nThere is a risk in linking sustainability and climate to Storebrand's brand and customer message if customers are more concerned with other things when they make the decision to purchase funds. Increased awareness of the importance of sustainability, especially climate, means that the risk is considered low.\n\nStorebrand has a wide range of funds, including specialised funds with sustainability as an investment goal through investing in solution companies. This degree of sustainability alignment in investments carries the risk of lower returns than the market and competitors. Storebrand's  solution  fund  received  a  strong  return  in  2020,  but had a weak period from February to May in 2021. Such results are expected, and the long-term return is good, both in absolute terms and relative to the broad market.\n\n## Risk of customers being affected by climate risk\n\nIf  climate  risk  has  a  negative  effect  on  Storebrand's  customers,  it may lead to a reduced business volume and thus lower revenues. The  consequences  of  this  are  particularly  significant  for  Defined Contribution  pensions.  The  annual  savings  premium  (2021)  was NOK  20  billion,  of  which  NOK  13  billion  was  in  Norway.  Given that  Storebrand  Livsforsikring  maintains  a  market  share  of approximately  30  per  cent  for  Defined  Contribution  pensions  in Norway, growth in premiums be reliant on employee numbers in Norwegian companies as well as the increased or decreased wage growth  effect  on  possible  changes  in  savings  rates.  A  scenario with negative economic effects in the transition to a low-emission society can affect all these conditions negatively. With no changes in the transition pathway, 1 per cent lower growth in the number of employees or 1 per cent lower wage growth will result in a NOK 130 million lower premium in the first year. The effect will grow and accumulate over time if the change is prolonged.\n\nThe risk of negative effects from transition risk can be particularly high for customers in the fossil fuel sector. A review of the customer base shows that Storebrand has a significant exposure to the fossil fuel sector.\n\nAs  an  appendix  to  this  report,  we  have  prepared  a  TCFD  index. This  provides  an  overview  of  how  we  respond  to  the  various recommendations for reporting, as well as which pages of the annual report more detailed information can be found. The index ensures transparency, and makes it easier to find relevant information. The table is on page 216.",

Appendix\n\n## Working environment and HSE\n\nManagers  are  encouraged  to  discuss  ethics,  ethical  dilemmas, information  security,  financial  crime  and  HSE  in  departmental meetings. We monitor whether this is implemented and implement further measures when necessary.\n\nStorebrand's sick leave rate among employees has been at a stable low level for many years. Sick leave among employees was 2.5 per cent in Norway and 1.6 per cent in the Swedish business in 2021. Storebrand has been an 'inclusive workplace' (IA) company since 2002,  and  the  Group's  managers  have  over  the  years  built  up routines for the follow-up of employees who are ill. Sick leave and overtime are regularly followed up in the Cooperation Committee (SU) in each business unit, which consists of the executive manager, union  representatives,  safety  representatives  and  the  People Business  Partner.  For  members  of  the  Working  Environment Committee and safety representatives, there is a requirement for a mandatory HSE course.\n\nThere were no (zero) injuries to a staff member in 2021. No damage to property was reported, and no accidents were otherwise reported in the Storebrand Group in 2021.\n\nStorebrand's work on gender equality, human  resources management,  working  environment  and  ethical  regulations  is described in more detail in the chapters People and Keeping our house in order. See also our compilation of sustainability indicators and definitions on page 240. A separate remuneration report has been prepared by the Board of Storebrand ASA and is available on on our website, www.storebrand.no.\n\nInsurance  for  the  Board  members  and  the  company's management\n\nThe  Board  and  senior  executives  are  covered  by  the  company's ongoing board liability insurance. This is placed with insurers with a solid rating.\n\nThe insurer will, within the framework of the insurance coverage, compensate for loss of assets as a result of claims made against the  insured  for  personal  management  responsibility  during  the insurance period.",

Appendix\n\n## Share Capital, rights issue and number of shares\n\nStorebrand's share is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (Oslo B\u00f8rs) under the ticker  code  STB.  Storebrand  ASA's  share  capital  at  the end of 2021 was NOK 2,360 million. The company has 471,974,890 shares with a nominal value of NOK 5. In 2021, the share capital was increased by NOK 21 million through the issuance of 4,160,908 new shares in a private placement to the sellers of Capital Investment. As  of  31.12.2021,  the  company  owned  1,839,776  own  shares corresponding to 0.4 per cent of the shareholding. The company has not issued options that could lead to the dilution of existing shareholders.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nStorebrand ASA is among the largest companies listed on Oslo B\u00f8rs measured in terms of number of shareholders. The company has shareholders from almost all Norwegian municipalities and from 48 countries. At the end of the year, Storebrand was the 11th largest company to be included in the Oslo Stock Exchange's benchmark index (OSEBX).\n\n## Share purchase scheme for employees\n\nStorebrand ASA has every year since 1996 offered employees to buy shares in the company through a separate scheme. The purpose has been to link employees more closely to the economic development of the company. In 2021, just over half of the Group's employees subscribed for a total of 391,365 shares.\n\n## Share-based remuneration for executive management\n\nStorebrand's executive management team will work to ensure that the  Group  develops  for  the  benefit  of  customers,  shareholders and employees. The Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA believes that the share remuneration model, in which a substantial part of the Group management's remuneration is paid in the form of shares in Storebrand ASA, provides good incentives for Executive management to act in line with the long-term interests of customers and owners. The table below shows how much of gross salary went to share purchases in 2021, actual equity exposure and normative equity exposure at the end of 2021.

In the corresponding period, the OSEBX index of the Oslo Stock Exchange ended at +19 per cent, while the European insurance index Beinsur had a total return of +12.7 per cent in the corresponding period, measured in NOK.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nStorebrand aims to pay an ordinary dividend of more than 50 per cent of Group profit after tax. The Board of Directors' ambition is to pay ordinary dividends per share of at least the same nominal amount as the previous year. Ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency ratio above 150 per cent. If the solvency ratio is  above 180 per cent, the Board of Directors intends to propose special dividends or share buy backs. In 2021, NOK 3.25 per share was paid in ordinary dividend for the financial year of 2020.\n\n## Capital gains taxation\n\nDividends for personal shareholders are taxable. Dividends after deduction  for  a  shielding  amount  shall  be  multiplied  by  1.6.  This amount is  taxed  at  the  tax  rate  for  capital  income  (22  per  cent), which gives a real tax on dividends of 35.2 per cent. The deduction for risk-free return is calculated by multiplying the share's basis for shielding (normally the purchase price of the share) by a shielding rate. The shielding rate is set by the Directorate of Taxes in January of the year after the income year. It is a rounded amount based on the average three-month interest rate on Treasury bills with a supplement of 0.5 percentage point reduced by the capital income tax rate.  Dividends within the deduction for risk-free return are taxfree.\n\n## Storebrand share\n\nTable of contents\n\n|                                                   | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2016    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Highest closing price (NOK)                       | 92.08   | 74.24   | 73.98   | 75.20   | 70.45   | 47.10   |\n| Lowest closing price (NOK)                        | 62.30   | 34.73   | 50.86   | 59.48   | 46.97   | 28.45   |\n| Closing price on 31/12 (NOK)                      | 88.52   | 64.20   | 69.02   | 61.64   | 66.9    | 45.92   |\n| Market cap 31/12 (NOK million)                    | 41,779  | 30,034  | 32,289  | 28,836  | 31,296  | 20,660  |\n| Annual turnover (1000s of shares)                 | 288,998 | 585,004 | 335,202 | 445,614 | 427,632 | 589,322 |\n| Average daily turnover (1000s of shares)          | 1,147   | 2,321,  | 1,346   | 3,094   | 2,450   | 2,780   |\n| Annual turnover (NOK million                      | 22,931  | 30,552  | 21,348  | 30,477  | 25,359  | 21,249  |\n| Rate of turnover (%)                              | 61.6    | 125.1   | 71.7    | 95.3    | 94.9    | 131     |\n| Number of ordinary shares 31/12 (1000s of shares) | 471,975 | 467,814 | 467,814 | 467,814 | 467,814 | 449,910 |\n| Earnings per ordinary share (NOK)                 | 6.68    | 5.02    | 4.43    | 7.89    | 5.28    | 4.73    |\n| Dividend per ordinary share (NOK)                 | 3.50    | 3.25    | 0       | 3.0     | 2.1     | 1.55    |\n| Total return (%)                                  | 42.9    | -7.0    | 16.8    | -4.7    | 49.1    | 31.4    |",

The cash flows show the overall change in means of payment over the year.\n\n## OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\nA substantial part of the activities in a financial group will be classified as operating. All receipts and payments from insurance activities are included from the insurance companies, and these cash flows are invested in financial assets that are also defined as operating activities. One subtotal is generated in the statement that shows the net cash flow from operations before financial assets and banking customers, and one subtotal that shows the cash flows from financial assets and banking customers. This shows that the composition of net cash flows from operational activities for a financial group includes cash flows from both operations and investments in financial assets. The life insurance companies' balance sheets include substantial items linked to the insurance customers that are included on the individual lines in the cash flow analysis. Since the cash flow analysis is intended to show the change in cash flow for the company, the change in bank deposits for insurance customers is included on its own lines in operating activities to neutralise the cash flows associated with the customer portfolio in life insurance.\n\n## INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n\nIncludes cash flows for holdings in group companies and tangible fixed assets.\n\n## FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n\nFinancing activities include cash flows for equity, subordinated loans and other borrowing that helps fund the Group's activities. Payments of interest on borrowing and payments of share dividends to shareholders are financial activities.\n\n## CASH/CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash/cash equivalents are defined as claims on central banks and loans to and claims from financial institutions. The amount does not include claims on financial institutions linked to the insurance customers portfolio, since these are liquid assets that are not available for use by the Group.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 1: Corporate information and accounting policies\n\n## 1. COMPANY INFORMATION\n\nStorebrand ASA is a Norwegian public limited company that is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The consolidated financial statements for 2021 were approved by the Board of Directors of Storebrand ASA on 8 February 2022.\n\nThe Storebrand Group offers a comprehensive range of insurance and asset management services, as well as securities, banking and investment services, to private individuals, companies, municipalities, and the public sector. The Storebrand Group consists of the business areas Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pensions and Other. The Group's head office is located at Professor Kohts vei 9, in Lysaker, Norway.\n\n## 2. BASIS FOR PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are described below.  The policies are applied consistently to similar transactions and to other events involving similar circumstances. There is no required use of uniform accounting policies for insurance contracts and this exemption is applied for insurance contracts in the consolidated financial statements. This is discussed in section 14.\n\nStorebrand ASA's consolidated financial statements are presented using EU-approved International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related interpretations, as well as other Norwegian disclosure requirements laid down in legislation and regulations.\n\n## Use of estimates when preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, the notes to the financial statements and information on potential liabilities. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. See Note 2 for further information.\n\n## 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR MATERIAL ITEMS ON THE BALANCE SHEET\n\nFor the most part, the asset side of the Group's balance sheet comprises financial instruments and investment properties and a differentiation is made between assets in the company portfolio (shareholders) and assets belonging to the customer portfolio. This split is due to the fact that the Group has a significant life insurance business in which customer assets must be kept separate from the company's assets.\n\n## Financial instruments - IFRS 9\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments replaces IAS 39, and was generally applicable from\n\n1 January 2018. However, for insurance-dominated groups and companies, IFRS 4 allows for the implementation of IFRS 9 to be deferred until implementation of IFRS 17. The Storebrand Group qualifies for temporary deferral of IFRS 9 because over 90 per cent of the Group's total liabilities as at 31 December 2015 were linked to the insurance businesses. For the Storebrand Group, IFRS 9 will be implemented together with IFRS 17, which is expected to be applicable from 1 January 2023\n\nThe Storebrand Group has conducted a provisional analysis of the classification and measurement of financial instruments in accordance with the present IAS 39 for the transition to IFRS9, based on the current business model for the individual instruments. For debt instruments that are expected to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through total comprehensive income upon transition to IFRS9, a SPPI ('Solely payment of principal and interest') test is carried out. This is a provisional categorisation under IFRS9, based on the present asset allocation. No assessments have been made of any changes in classification and measurement of financial assets under IFRS9 in connection with the transition to IFRS17.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nA large majority of the financial assets are measured at fair value (the fair value option is used), whilst other financial instruments that are included in the categories Loans and receivables and Held to maturity are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are largely related to Norwegian pension liabilities with annual interest rate guarantee.\n\nBalance Sheet items - not covered by IFRS 9 Investment properties are measured at fair value.\n\nIntangible assets comprise excess value relating to insurance contracts and customer relations acquired in connection with a business combination and acquired and self-developed IT solutions. This excess value is measured at acquisition cost less annual amortisation and write-downs.\n\nThe liabilities side of the balance sheet primarily comprises of insurance liabilities, however also includes items such as financial liabilities and minority shares of managed securities funds. With the exception of derivatives and minority shares, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.\n\nInsurance liabilities must be adequate and cover liabilities relating to issued insurance contracts. Various methods and principles are used in the Group when assessing the reserves for different insurance contracts. A considerable part of the insurance liabilities relate to insurance contracts with interest guarantees. The recognised liabilities related to Norwegian insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates are discounted by the basic interest rate (which corresponds to the guaranteed return/interest rate) for the respective insurance contracts.\n\nThe recognised liabilities related to the Swedish insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates in the subsidiary SPP are discounted by an observable market interest rate and by an estimated market interest rate for terms to maturity when no observable interest rate is available and corresponds essentially to the same interest rate that is used in the solvency calculations.\n\nIn the case of unit-linked insurance contracts, reserves for the savings element in the contracts will correspond to the value of related asset portfolios.\n\nDue to the fact that the customers' assets in the life insurance business (guaranteed pension) have historically yielded a return that has exceeded the increased value in guaranteed insurance liabilities, the excess amount has been set aside as customer buffers (liabilities), including in the form of additional reserves, value adjustment reserve and conditional bonus.\n\nInsurance liabilities include Incurred But Not Settled (IBNS) reserves, which consist of amounts reserved for claims either incurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet settled (Incurred But Not Reported 'IBNR' and Reported But Not Settled 'RBNS'). IBNS reserves are included in the premium reserve.\n\nIBNS reserves are measured using actuarial models based on historical information about the portfolio.\n\n## 4. Changes in accounting policies\n\nNew accounting standards that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements have not been implemented in 2021. For changes in estimates, see Note 2 for further information.\n\nStorebrand selected early implementation of 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform-Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7' (IBOR Reform) that was issued in September 2019. The discontinuation of LIBOR rates has had no impact other than for hedge accounting (see note 42) because all ISDA/CSA agreements have been renegotiated, and EURSTR + 8.5bps has replaced EONIA based on the 'fallback' calculation under the auspices of ISDA.\n\n## 5. New IFRS that have not entered into force\n\nNew standards and changes in standards that have not come into effect\n\n## IFRS 17:\n\nIFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and introduces new requirements for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of issued insurance contracts. The standard was adopted by the European Union in 2021 and will enter into force from 1 January 2023. The purpose of the new standard is to establish uniform practices for the accounting treatment of insurance contracts and greater transparency between insurance companies.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIFRS 17 is a comprehensive and complex standard, with fundamental differences to the present standard for measuring liabilities and recognising earnings. Insurance contracts must be recognised at the risk-adjusted present value of future cash flows, with the addition of unearned profit in a group of contracts. The unearned profit is the sum total of each contract's service margin and is recognised as income over the contract's service period in line with how the insurance services are provided. Loss-making contracts must be recognised immediately.\n\nAs a starting point, the retrospective transition method must be applied upon transition to IFRS 17, however the modified retrospective transition method or application is permitted or application based on the fair value on the transition date if retrospective application is impracticable.\n\nIFRS 17 will be introduced into Storebrand's consolidated financial statements. The implementation date is 1 January 2023, with a requirement that comparable figures are stated for 2022. The financial regulatory authorities in Norway and Sweden have yet to decide on the rules for the company accounts of the legal entities, however it is expected that only the Group's P&C insurance companies will introduce IFRS 17 into the company accounts. The life insurance companies are expected to follow equivalent regulations to those that presently apply for the company accounts, and discrepancies will arise between the legal company accounts of the life insurance activities and the consolidated values from the activities in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nStorebrand is working on preparing for implementation of IFRS17, including assessing the effects implementation of IFRS17 will have for Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere are no other new or changed accounting standards that have not entered into force that are expected to have a significant effect on Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 6. Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Storebrand ASA and companies controlled by Storebrand ASA. Minority interests are included in the Group's equity, unless there are options or other conditions that entail that minority interests are classified as liabilities.\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS, Storebrand Asset Management AS, Storebrand Bank ASA and Storebrand Forsikring AS are significant subsidiaries owned directly by Storebrand ASA. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS also owns the Swedish holding company Storebrand Holding AB, which in turn owns SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (publ). On acquiring the Swedish operations in 2007, the authorities instructed Storebrand to make an application to maintain a group structure by the end of 2009. Storebrand has filed an application to maintain the existing group structure. A controlling interest in Skagen AS was acquired in 2017 and is owned by Storebrand Asset Management AS. The Norwegian authorities have granted Storebrand an exemption from the requirement to organise equivalent businesses in the same company. This exemption expires in 2022.\n\nInvestments in associated companies (normally investments of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the company's equity) in which the Group exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures are recognised in accordance with the equity method. Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are initially recognised at acquisition cost.\n\nStorebrand consolidates certain funds in the Group's balance sheet when the requirement for control has been met. This encompasses funds in which Storebrand has an ownership interest of approximately 40 per cent or more, which are managed by companies in the Storebrand Group. In the Group's accounts, such funds are consolidated fully in the balance sheet, and the non-controlling interests are shown on a line for assets and on a corresponding line for liabilities. The non-controlling interests can demand redemption of their ownership interests and, as a result of this, they are classified as liabilities in the consolidated financial statements of Storebrand.\n\n## Currencies and translation of foreign companies' accounts\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is Norwegian kroner. Foreign companies that are part of the Group and have different functional currencies are converted to Norwegian kroner. Translation differences are included in the total comprehensive income.\n\n## Elimination of internal transactions\n\nInternal receivables and payables, internal gains and losses, interest, dividends and similar between companies in the Group are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Transactions between the customer portfolios and the company portfolio in the life insurance business and between the customer portfolios in the life insurance business and other companies in the Group will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The reason for this is that the result in the customer portfolio is assigned to the customers each financial year and must not influence the result and equity of the company. Pursuant to the life insurance regulations, transactions with customer portfolios are carried out at fair value.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 7. Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method is applied when accounting for acquisition of businesses. The consideration is measured at fair value. The direct acquisition expenses are expensed when they arise, with the exception of expenses related to raising debt or equity (new issues).\n\nWhen making investments in subsidiaries, including purchasing investment properties, a decision is made as to whether the purchase constitutes acquisition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3. When such acquisitions are not regarded as an acquisition of a business, the acquisition method pursuant to IFRS 3 is not applied. Among other things, this does not entail provisions for deferred tax such as for business combinations.\n\n## 8. Segment information\n\nThe segment information is based on the internal financial reporting structure of the most senior decision-maker. At Storebrand, the executive management is responsible for following-up and evaluating the results of the segments and is defined as the most senior decision-maker. Four segments are reported for:\n\n- \u00b7 Savings\n- \u00b7 Insurance\n- \u00b7 Guaranteed Pension\n- \u00b7 Other\n\nThere are some differences between the result lines used in the income statement and the segment results. The Group's income statement includes gross income and costs linked to both the insurance customers and owners (shareholders). The segment results only include result elements relating to owners (shareholders) which are the result elements that the Group has performance measures and follow-up for.\n\nFinancial services provided between segments are priced at market terms. Services provided from joint functions and staff are charged to the different segments based on supply agreements and distribution keys.\n\n## 9. Income recognition\n\n## Premium income\n\nNet premium income includes the year's premiums written (including savings elements, administration premium, fees for issuing Norwegian interest rate guarantees and profit element risk), premium reserves transferred and ceded reinsurance. Annual premiums are generally accrued on a straight-line basis over the coverage period.\n\n## Income from properties and financial assets\n\nIncome from properties and financial assets are described in Sections 12 and 13.\n\n## Other income\n\nFees are recognised when the income can be measured reliably and is earned. Return-based revenues and performance fees are recognised when the uncertainty associated with the income is no longer present. Fixed fees are recognised as income in line with delivery of the service.\n\n## 10. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAdded value when acquiring a business that cannot be directly attributable to assets or liabilities on the date of the acquisition is classified as goodwill on the balance sheet. Goodwill is measured at acquisition cost on the date of the acquisition and classified as an intangible asset.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised, instead it is tested for impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually when assessing the recoverable amount or if there are indications that impairment has occurred. Goodwill is allocated to the relevant cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the acquisition so that it can subsequently be tested for impairment. If the discounted cash flow for the cash-generating unit(s) that goodwill is allocated to is lower than the recognised value, goodwill will be written down. Reversal of an impairment loss for goodwill is prohibited even if information later comes to light showing that there is no longer a need for the write-down or the impairment loss has been reduced.",

The useful life and amortisation method are measured each year. With initial recognition of intangible assets in the balance sheet, it must be demonstrated that probable future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group. The acquisition cost of the asset must also be reliably estimated. The value of an intangible asset is tested for impairment when there are indications that its value has been impaired, normally by the related cash-generating unit(s) being tested Intangible assets are otherwise subject to write-downs and reversals of write-downs in the same manner as described for tangible fixed assets.\n\n## 11. Adequacy test for insurance liabilities and related excess values\n\nA liability adequacy test must be conducted of the insurance liability pursuant to IFRS 4 each time the financial statements are presented. The test conducted in Storebrand's consolidated financial statements is based on the Group's calculation of capital.\n\n## 12. Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between well-informed, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. Income from investment properties consists of both changes in fair value and rental income.\n\nInvestment properties primarily consist of centrally located office buildings, shopping centres and logistics buildings. Investment properties are properties leased to tenants outside the Group. In the case of properties partly occupied by the Group for its own use and partly let to tenants, the identifiable tenanted portion is treated as an investment property. All properties are measured at fair value and the changes in value are allocated to the customer portfolios.\n\n## 13. Financial instruments\n\n## 13-1. General policies and definitions\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are included in the balance sheet from such time Storebrand becomes party to the instrument's contractual terms and conditions. General purchases and sales of financial instruments are recorded on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is initially recognised in the financial statements, it is valued at fair value. Initial recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the date of acquisition or issue of the financial asset/liability if the financial asset/liability is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flow from the financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised in the balance sheet when they cease to exist, i.e. once the contractual liability has been fulfilled, cancelled or has expired.\n\nMeasurement of impairment and doubtful financial assets\n\nFor financial assets carried at amortised cost, an assessment is made on each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets have incurred losses.\n\nIf there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not occurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate calculated at initial recognition). The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nLosses expected as a result of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised.\n\n## 13-2. Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified into one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets held for trading\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option\n- \u00b7 Financial assets held to maturity\n- \u00b7 Financial assets, loans and receivables",

Appendix\n\n## Held for trading\n\nA financial asset is classified as held for trading if:\n\n- \u00b7 it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the short term,\n- \u00b7 is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking, or\n- \u00b7 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.\n\nWith the exception of derivatives, only a limited proportion of Storebrand's financial assets fall into this category.\n\nFinancial assets held for trading are measured at fair value at the reporting date, Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement.\n\nAt fair value through profit or loss in accordance with the fair value option (FVO).\n\nA significant proportion of Storebrand's financial instruments are classified in the category of fair value through profit or loss because:\n\n- \u00b7 such classification reduces the mismatch in the measurement or recognition that would otherwise arise as a result of the different rules for measuring assets and liabilities, or\n- \u00b7 the financial assets form part of a portfolio that is managed and reported on a fair value basis\n- \u00b7 The accounting is equivalent to that of the held for trading category (the instruments are measured at fair value and changes in value are recognised in the income statement).\n\n## Investments held to maturity\n\nHeld to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity and that a company has the intention and ability to hold to maturity, with the exception of:\n\n- \u00b7 assets that are designated upon initial recognition as assets at fair value through profit or loss, or\n- \u00b7 assets that are defined as loans and receivables.\n\nAssets held to maturity are recognised at amortised costs using the effective interest method. The category is used in the Norwegian life insurance business for assets linked to insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees.\n\n## Loans and receivables\n\nLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, with the exception of assets that the company intends to sell immediately or in the near term that are classified as held for trading and those that the company upon initial recognition designates at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nLoans and receivables are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The category is used in the Norwegian life insurance business linked to insurance contracts with a guaranteed interest rate, and in the banking business.\n\nLoans and receivables that are designated as hedged items are subject to measurement under the hedge accounting requirements.\n\n## 13-3. Derivatives\n\nAccounting treatment of derivatives that are not hedging\n\nDerivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are recognised as financial instruments held for trading. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe majority of the derivatives used routinely for asset management fall into this category.\n\nSome of the Group's insurance contracts contain embedded derivatives such as interest rate guarantees. These insurance contracts do not follow the accounting standard IAS 39 Financial Instruments, but instead follow the accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and the embedded derivatives are not continually measured at fair value.\n\n## 13-4. Hedge accounting\n\n## Fair value hedging\n\nStorebrand uses fair value hedging for the interest rate risk. The items hedged are financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through profit or loss.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Cash flow hedging\n\nSome borrowing in foreign currency is hedged by means of hedging instruments (derivatives). Storebrand uses cash flow hedging of the foreign exchange risk on the principal amount and foreign exchange risk for the credit margin. The net ongoing changes in value in the hedging instrument that is considered effective hedging are recognised in total comprehensive income and the non-effective share is recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Hedging of net investments\n\nHedging of net investments in foreign businesses is recognised in the accounts in the same way as cash flow hedging. Gains and losses on the hedging instrument that relate to the effective part of the hedging are recognised through total comprehensive income, while gains and losses that relate to the ineffective part are recognised in the income statement. The total loss or gain in equity is recognised in the income statement when the foreign business is sold or wound up.\n\n## 13-5. Financial liabilities\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities that are not derivatives are primarily measured at amortised cost using an effective interest method.\n\n## 14. Insurance liabilities\n\nThe accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts addresses the accounting treatment of insurance contracts. Storebrand's insurance contracts fall within the scope of this standard. IFRS 4 is a temporary standard until IFRS 17 is to be used. IFRS 4 allows the use of non-uniform principles for the treatment of insurance contracts in consolidated financial statements. In the consolidated financial statements, the insurance liabilities in the respective subsidiaries are included as these are calculated on the basis of the laws of the individual countries. This also applies to insurance contracts acquired via business combinations. In such cases, positive excess values are capitalised as assets.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 4, provisions for insurance liabilities must be adequate. When assessing the adequacy associated with recognised acquired insurance contracts, reference must also be made to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, and Solvency II calculations.\n\nAn explanation of the accounting policies for the most important insurance liabilities can be found below.\n\n## 14-1.  General - life insurance\n\n## Claims for own account\n\nClaims for own account comprise claims settlements paid out, less reinsurance received, premium reserves transferred to other companies, and reinsurance ceded.\n\n## Changes in insurance liabilities\n\nChanges in insurance liabilities comprise premium savings that are taken to income under premium income and payments, as well as changes in provisions for future claims This item also includes added guaranteed returns on the premium reserve and the premium fund, as well as returns to customers beyond the guaranteed returns.\n\n## Insurance liabilities (premium reserve)\n\nThe premium reserve represents the present value of the company's total expected insurance liabilities, including future administration costs in accordance with the individual insurance contracts, after deducting the present value of agreed future premiums. In the case of individual account policies with flexible premium payments, the total policy value is included in the premium reserve. The premium reserve is equivalent to 100 per cent of the guaranteed surrender or transfer value of insurance contracts prior to any fees for early surrender or transfer and the policies' share of the market value adjustment reserve.\n\nThe premium reserve is calculated using the same assumptions as those used to calculate premiums for the individual insurance contracts, i.e. assumptions about mortality and disability rates, interest rates and costs. Premium tariffs are based on the observed level of mortality and disability in the population with the addition of security margins that include expected future developments in this respect.\n\nThe premium reserve includes reserve amounts for future administration costs for all lines of insurance including settlement costs (administration reserve). In the case of paid-up contracts, the present value of all future administration costs is allocated in full to the premium reserve. In the case of contracts with future premium payments, a deduction is made for the cash value of the proportion of future administration costs expected to be financed by future premium receipts.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nA substantial proportion of the Norwegian insurance contracts have a one-year interest rate guarantee, meaning that the guaranteed return must be achieved every year. In the Swedish business, there are no contracts with an annual interest rate guarantee, but there are insurance contracts with a terminal value guarantee.\n\n## Insurance liabilities, special investments portfolio\n\nInsurance liabilities associated with the value of the special investments portfolio must always equal the value of the investments portfolio assigned to the contract. The proportion of profit in the risk result is included. The company is not exposed to investment risk on customer assets, since the customers are not guaranteed a minimum return. The only exception is in the event of death, when the beneficiaries are repaid the amount originally paid in for annuity insurance and for customer assets in the guarantee portfolio and Garanti90.\n\n## IBNS reserves\n\nIncluded in the premium reserve for insurance risk are provisions for claims either occurred but not yet reported or reported but not yet settled. IBNR are reserves for potential future payments when Storebrand has yet to be informed about whether an instance of disability, death or other instance entailing compensation has occurred. Since Storebrand is neither aware of the frequency nor the amount payable, IBNR is estimated using actuarial models based on historical information about the portfolio. Correspondingly, RBNS is a provision for potential future payments when Storebrand has knowledge of the incident, but has not settled the claim. Actuarial models based on historical information are also used to estimate the reserves.\n\n## Transfers of premium reserves, etc. (transfers)\n\nTransfers of premium reserves resulting from transfers of policies between insurance companies are recorded in the profit and loss account as net premiums for own account in the case of reserves received and claims for own account in the case of reserves paid out. The recognition of costs and income takes place on the date the insured risk is ceded. The premium reserve in the insurance liabilities is reduced/increased on the same date. The premium reserve transferred includes the policy's share of additional statutory reserves, the market value adjustment reserve, conditional bonus and the profit for the year. Transferred additional reserves are not shown as part of premium income, but are reported separately as changes in insurance liabilities. Transferred amounts are classified as current receivables or liabilities until the transfer takes place.\n\n## Selling costs\n\nAll selling costs in the Norwegian life insurance business are expensed as they are accrued, whilst in the Swedish subsidiaries, parts of the selling costs are recorded in the balance sheet and amortised over the expected duration of the contract.\n\n## 14-2. Life insurance - Norway\n\n## Additional statutory reserves\n\nThe company is allowed to make allocations to the additional statutory reserves to ensure the solvency of its life insurance business. These additional reserves are divided among the contracts and can be used to cover a negative interest result up to the interest rate guarantee. In the event that the company does not achieve a return that equals the interest rate guarantee in any given year, the allocation can be reversed from the contract to enable the company to meet the interest rate guarantee. This will result in a reduction in the additional statutory reserves and a corresponding increase in the premium reserve for the contract. For allocated annuities, the additional statutory reserves are paid in instalments over the disbursement period.\n\nThe additional statutory reserves cannot exceed 12 per cent of the premium reserve. If the limit is exceeded, the excess amount is assigned to the contract as surplus.\n\n## Premium fund, deposit reserve and pensioners' surplus fund\n\nThe premium fund contains premiums prepaid by policyholders as a result of taxation regulations for individual and group pension insurance and allocated profit shares. The contribution fund contains payments and deposits for employees who have been members for less than 12 months. Credits and withdrawals are not recognised through the income statement but are taken directly to the balance sheet.\n\nThe pensioners' surplus fund comprises surplus assigned to the premium reserve in respect of pensions in group payments. The fund is applied each year as a single premium payment to secure additional benefits for pensioners.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Market value adjustment reserve\n\nThe current year's net unrealised gains/losses on financial assets at fair value in the group portfolio are allocated to or reversed from the market value adjustment reserve in the balance sheet assuming the portfolio has a net unrealised excess value. The portion of the current year's net unrealised gains/losses on financial current assets denominated in foreign currencies that can be attributed to fluctuations in exchange rates is not transferred to the market value adjustment reserve. The foreign exchange fluctuations associated with investments denominated in foreign currencies are largely hedged through foreign exchange contracts on a portfolio basis. Similarly, the change in the value of the hedging instrument is not transferred to the market value adjustment reserve, but is charged directly to the profit and loss account. Pursuant to accounting standard for insurance contracts (IFRS 4) the market value adjustment reserve is shown as a liability.\n\n## Risk equalisation reserve\n\nUp to 50 per cent of the positive risk result for group pensions and paid-up policies can be allocated to the risk equalisation fund to cover any future negative risk result. The risk equalisation reserve is not considered to be a liability according to IFRS and is included as part of the equity (undistributable equity).\n\n## 14-3. Life insurance Sweden\n\n## Life insurance liabilities\n\nThe life insurance liabilities are estimated as the present value of the expected future guaranteed payments, administrative expenses and taxes, discounted by the current risk-free interest rate. Insurance reserves with guaranteed interest rates in SPP use a marked-based yield curve. A real discount curve is used for risk insurance within the defined-contribution portfolio. For endowment insurance within the defined-benefit and defined-contribution portfolios, as well as sickness insurance in the defined-benefit portfolio, the provisions are discounted using the nominal yield curve. As a starting point, the applicable discount rate is determined based on the methods used for the discount rate in Solvency II.\n\nWhen calculating the life insurance liabilities, the estimated future administrative expenses that may reasonably be expected to arise and can be attributed to the existing insurance contracts are taken into account. The expenses are estimated according to the company's own cost analyses and are based on the actual operating costs during the most recent year. Projection of the expected future costs follow the same principles on which Solvency II is based. Any future cost-rationalisation measures are not taken into account.\n\n## Conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution\n\nThe conditional bonus arises when the value of customer assets is higher than the present value of the liabilities, and thus covers the portion of the insurance capital that is not guaranteed. In the case of contracts where customer assets are lower than liabilities, the owners' result is charged via deferred capital contribution allocations. The conditional bonus and deferred capital contribution are recognised on the same line in the balance sheet as part of the buffer capital.\n\n## 14-4.  P&C insurance\n\nCosts related to insurance claims are recognised when the claims occur. The following allocations have been made:\n\nReserve for unearned premium for own account concerns on-going policies that are in force at the time the financial statements were closed and is intended to cover the contracts' remaining risk period.\n\nThe claims reserve is a reserve for expected claims that have been reported, but not settled (RBNS). The reserve also covers expected claims for losses that have been incurred, but have not been reported (IBNR) at the expiry of the accounting period. In addition, claims reserves shall include a separate provision for future claims on losses that have not been settled.\n\n## 15. Pension liabilities for own employees\n\nStorebrand has country-specific pension schemes for its employees. The schemes are recognised in the accounts in accordance with IAS 19. In Norway, Storebrand has a defined-contribution pension. Storebrand is a member of the Norwegian contractual early retirement (AFP) pension scheme. The Norwegian AFP scheme is regarded as a defined-benefit scheme, but there is insufficient quantitative information to be able to estimate reliable accounting obligations and costs.\n\nIn Sweden, SPP has agreed, in accordance with the Finance Companies' Service Pension Plan (BTP Plan), to collective, defined-benefit pension plans for its employees. A group defined-benefit pension implies that an employee is guaranteed a certain pension based on the pay scale at the time of retirement on termination of the employment.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 15-1. Defined-benefit scheme\n\nPension costs and pension obligations for defined-benefit pension schemes are determined using a linear accrual formula and expected final salary as the basis for the entitlements, based on assumptions about the discount rate, future salary increases, pensions and National Insurance benefits, future returns on pension plan assets as well as actuarial estimates of mortality, disability and voluntary early leavers. The net pension cost for the period comprises the total of the accrued future pension entitlements during the period, the interest cost on the calculated pension liability and the calculated return on pension plan assets.\n\nActuarial gains and losses and the impact of changes in assumptions are recognised in total comprehensive income during the period in which they arise. Employees who resign before reaching retirement age or leave the scheme will be issued ordinary paid-up policies.\n\n## 15-2. Defined-contribution scheme\n\nA defined-contribution pension scheme involves the Group in paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The Group does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. Defined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the financial statements.\n\n## 16. Tangible fixed assets and intangible assets\n\nThe Group's tangible fixed assets comprise equipment, IT systems and properties used by the Group for its own activities.\n\nEquipment, inventory and IT systems are valued at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and any write-downs.\n\nProperties used for the Group's own activities are measured at appreciated value less accumulated depreciation and write-downs. The fair value of these properties is tested annually in the same way as described for investment properties. The increase in value for buildings used by the Group for its own activities is recognised through total comprehensive income. Any write-down of the value of such a property is recognised first in the revaluation reserve for increases in the value of the property in question. If the write-down exceeds the revaluation reserve for the property in question, the excess is expensed over the profit and loss account.\n\nThe write-down period and method are reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period being used both correspond to the useful economic life of the asset. The disposal value is similarly reviewed. Properties are split into components if different parts have different useful economic lives. The depreciation period and method of depreciation are measured then separately for each component.\n\nThe value of a tangible fixed asset is tested when there are indications that its value has been impaired. The impairment test is carried out for each asset if the asset primarily has independent, inward cash flows, or possibly a larger cash-generating unit. Any impairment losses are charged to the income statement as the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value less costs of sale and the value in use.  On each reporting date it is determined as to whether there is a basis for reversing previous impairment losses on non-financial assets.\n\n## 17. Tax\n\nThe Group's tax liabilities are valued in accordance with IAS 12 and clarifications in IFRIC 23.\n\nThe tax cost in the income statement consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in total comprehensive income. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on the basis of the Group's tax loss carryforward, deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences.\n\nAny deferred tax assets shall be recognised if it is considered probable that the tax asset will be recovered. Assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax are recognised as a net amount when there is a legal right to offset assets and liabilities for tax payable and the Group has the ability and intention to settle net tax payable.\n\nChanges in assets and liabilities associated with deferred tax that are due to changes in the tax rate are generally recognised in the income statement.\n\nReference is made to Note 27 - Tax for further information.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## 18. Provision for dividends\n\nThe proposed dividend is classified as equity until approved by the general meeting and presented as liabilities after this date. The proposed dividend is not included in the calculation of the solvency capital.\n\n## 19. Leases\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet. The present value of the combined lease payments shall be recognised on the balance sheet as debt and an asset that reflects the right of use of the asset during the lease period. Storebrand has chosen to classify the right to use the asset as tangible fixed assets and the lease liability as other debt. The recognised asset is amortised over the lease period and the depreciation expense is recognised as an operating expense on an ongoing basis. The interest expense on the lease liability is recognised as a financial expense. Leases with a duration of less than 12 months and leases that include assets valued at less than approximately NOK 50,000 will not be recognised in the balance sheet, but rental amounts will be recognised as an operating expense over the lease period.\n\n## 20. Statement of cash flows\n\nThe statement of cash flows is prepared using the direct method and shows cash flows grouped by sources and use. Cash is defined as cash, receivables from central banks and receivables from credit institutions with no agreed period of notice.\n\n## Note 2: Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements the management are required to apply estimates, make discretionary assessments and apply assumptions for uncertain amounts. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and expectations of future events and represent the management's best judgement at the time the financial statements were prepared.\n\nA description of the most important elements and assessments in which discretion is used and which may influence recognised amounts or key figures is provided below and in Note 14 for Solvency II and in Note 27 for Tax.\n\nActual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Insurance contracts\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of higher than expected payments and/or unfavourable changes in the value of an insurance liability due to the actual development differing from what was expected when premiums or provisions were calculated.\n\nIn the consolidated accounts, insurance liabilities with a guaranteed interest rate are included, but using different principles in the Norwegian and the Swedish activities. An immaterial asset (value of business in-force - VIF) linked to the insurance contracts in the Swedish activities is also included. This asset originated from Storebrand's purchase of the insurance business. There are several factors that may have an impact on the size of the insurance liabilities including VIF, such as biometric factors relating to higher life expectancy, future returns and invalidity, as well as the development of future costs and legal aspects, such as amendments to legislation and judgments handed down in court cases, etc.\n\nIn the long term, a low interest rate will represent a challenge for insurance contracts with a guaranteed interest rate and, together with a reduced customer buffer, may have an impact on the amount recorded that is linked to the insurance contracts. The Norwegian insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates are discounted at the premium calculation rate (around 3.1 per cent). The Swedish insurance liabilities with guaranteed interest rates have been discounted by a yield curve that coincides with the Solvency II yield curve.\n\nIn the Norwegian business, a significant share of the insurance contracts have annual interest rate guarantees. Changes in estimates and valuations may entail a change in the return on the customer portfolios. Depending on the size of any impairment in value, such impairment may be offset by a reduction in the market value adjustment reserve and additional statutory reserves, so that the effect on the owner's result may be limited. Correspondingly, increases in values could, to a large extent, increase the size of such funds.\n\nIn the Swedish business, there are no contracts with an annual interest rate guarantee, but there are insurance contracts with interest rate guarantees which enable them to receive a guaranteed terminal value. These contracts are discounted by a market-based calculated interest rate where parts of the yield curve used are not liquid. Changes in the discount rate may have a significant impact on the size of the insurance liabilities and impact the result. If the associated customer assets have a higher value than the recognised value of these insurance liabilities, then the difference will represent a conditional customer allocated fund - conditional bonus (buffer capital). Changes in the assumptions for future cost, mortality and other biometric assumptions may also have a significant impact on the recognised insu-",

Depending on the size of any impairment in value, such impairment may be offset by a reduction in the conditional bonus, so that the effect on the owner's result may be limited. If the value of the individual insurance contract is higher than the associated customer assets, the owner will have to cover the deficient capital.\n\nFurther information about insurance liabilities is provided in Notes 7, 39 and 40.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are measured at fair value. The commercial real estate market in Norway and Sweden is not particularly liquid, nor is it transparent. Uncertainty will be linked to the valuations, and they require exercise of professional judgement, especially in periods with turbulent finance markets.\n\nKey elements included in valuations that require exercising judgement are:\n\n- \u00b7 Market rent and vacancy trends\n- \u00b7 Quality and duration of rental income\n- \u00b7 Owners' costs\n- \u00b7 Technical standard and any need for upgrading\n- \u00b7 Discount rates for both certain and uncertain cash flows, as well as residual value\n\nExternal valuations are also obtained for parts of the portfolio every quarter. All properties must have a minimum of one external valuation during a 3 year period.\n\nReference is also made to Note 13 in which the valuation of investment properties at fair value is described in more detail.\n\n## Financial instruments at fair value\n\nThere will be some uncertainty associated with the pricing of financial instruments, particularly instruments that are not priced in an active market. This is particularly true for the types of securities priced on the basis of non-observable assumptions, and for these investments various valuation techniques are applied in order to fix fair value. These include private equity investments, investments in foreign properties, and other financial instruments where theoretical models are used in pricing. Any changes to the assumptions could affect recognised amounts. The majority of such financial instruments are included in the customer portfolio.\n\nThere is uncertainty linked to the valuation of fixed-rate loans recorded at fair value, due to variation in the interest rate terms offered by banks and since individual borrowers often have different credit risks.\n\nReference is also made to note 13, in which the valuation of financial instruments at fair value is described in more detail.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nStorebrand is impacted by Covid-19 and the uncertainty associated with future economic development.\n\nMutations and new waves of infection resulted in more stringent infection control measures and effects for the economy during 2021. There is an uncertainty relating to future developments and the impact on Storebrand's accounts. The risk associated with Covid-19 is considered to have declined over the course of the year, however there is a risk that the scaling down of financial and monetary policy support packages could potentially weaken financial recovery. Negative financial market effects may be compounded by a high rate of savings, low interest rates and good access to credit having contributed to good investment returns and high valuations. Both the stock market and the property market are priced higher than before the pandemic. The risk for the property market is that demand for commercial space will fall as a consequence of a faster transition to online trade and increased use of remote work.\n\nThere is still uncertainty associated with the effect of the outbreak of Covid-19 on the insurance risk at Storebrand Livsforsikring. The assessment generally remains unchanged from 2020, however the uncertainty related to Covid-19 directly and financial uncertainty from infection control measures on the business sector have been more extensive than estimated in 2020. At the same time, the uncertainty of the insurance risk associated with the fall in oil prices during the first quarter of 2020 has proved less dramatic. There is thus considered to have been grounds for the extraordinary provisions relating to Covid-19 and financial uncertainty that were made in 2020. There is major uncertainty relating to these provisions and future developments. There is particular uncertainty associated with indications that Covid-19 may in some cases result in delayed harmful effects. New mutations (Delta - Omicron) may also be of significance to the potential effects of the virus. On the whole, there is still major uncertainty regarding the development of potential delayed harmful effects, and there are thus grounds for maintaining the provisions.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nIn 2020, there were temporary regulations which stipulated that benefit periods for the work assessment allowance (AAP) were extended by six months without consideration to the provisions concerning duration. The decision was applicable for jobseekers until 30 June 2021. Some AAP decisions, which were initially due to be clarified during the 2020 financial year and the first half of 2021, have therefore been deferred. In subsequent regulations, the extension has been expanded to apply until the end of June 2022. A reduction in unemployment has resulted in fewer people starting to receive AAP. At the same time, the option to access AAP for a longer period of time during the pandemic has resulted in fewer people no longer receiving AAP and disability pensions from Storebrand Livsforsikring are therefore maintained.\n\nThe Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) recorded a 'somewhat higher' mortality rate in the fourth quarter. Due to the increased mortality rate in the community, a good accident result was expected during the period. The increased mortality rate is viewed in connection with the infection control measures potentially having contributed to people who did not die one year ago dying now. This refers to delayed death, which occurs due to the limited prevalence of other infectious respiratory diseases and influenza viruses. An indication of mortality deficit was observed in 2020. This trend is observed evenly across the products, however, factors such as different dynamics in product regulations, previous provision levels and differences in portfolios mean that there are varied effects on the result. No significant shifts in assumptions related to future mortality have been assumed in the provisions.\n\nThe developments relating to Covid-19 directly and the financial uncertainty are being closely monitored. A continuation of the situation of high unemployment may lead to increased disability and result in higher provisions. The provisions as at 31 December 2021 are the company's best estimate and these provisions are considered adequate.\n\nStorebrand has a risk management system which, through principles that have been adopted, manages and mitigates the impact of volatile financial markets. Storebrand will continue to monitor the development of Covid-19 and its effects on the economy. A long-term situation with high unemployment may result in higher levels of disability and increased liabilities. However, the current insurance liabilities represent Storebrand's best estimate of the insurance liabilities.\n\nCovid-19 and the uncertain macroeconomic situation mean that there is greater uncertainty relating to several estimates at the end of 2021 than was the situation prior to the start of the pandemic. There is still major uncertainty about the spread of Covid-19 and the consequences for society. There is thus also increased uncertainty regarding cash flows associated with financial instruments and investment properties that are priced based on level 3 calculations, as well as estimated expected losses on lending.\n\n## Management fee\n\nIn April 2021, the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway sent an identical letter to all life insurance companies and pension funds regarding the treatment of management fees to management companies for securities funds and other managers of 'fund' structures. A united industry, including Storebrand, is of the opinion that the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway's interpretation of the law is incorrect. Both Finance Norway and the Norwegian Association of Pension Funds have therefore asked the Ministry of Finance to review the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway's interpretation. Both associations have obtained opinions supporting the industry's position. The question in the case is whether the management fee the fund pays to the manager should be deducted from the return (net entry) or should be covered by the company's cost result as part of the premium (gross entry). For some investment classes, for example, investments in infrastructure funds and private equity funds, for which investments are made in underlying funds to achieve effective risk diversified management, costs are recognised in the funds included in the customer's investment result. Storebrand considers the industry's legal understanding to be correct, and has therefore chosen to continue with previous practices, pending further clarification from the Ministry of Finance. The estimated annual effect for Storebrand, given present allocations and investments, is approximately NOK 45 million.\n\n## Deferred tax and uncertain tax positions\n\nCalculation of deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities and the income tax expense is based on the interpretation of rules and estimates.\n\nThe Group's business activities may give rise to disputes, etc. related to tax positions with an uncertain outcome. The Group makes provisions for uncertain and disputed tax positions with best estimates of expected amounts, subject to decisions by the tax authorities in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. The provisions are reversed if the disputed tax position is decided to the benefit of the Group and can no longer be appealed.\n\nReference is made to further information in Note 27.",

The acquisition includes two legal companies: Capital Investment A/S and CI AM ApS. The transaction was completed on 30 September 2021.\n\nCapital Investment delivers a comprehensive suite of real estate investment management services, handling the entire investment process from the beginning to the end on behalf of national and international clients. Capital Investment has 18 employees.\n\nThe acquisition of Capital Investment is in line with Storebrand's growth strategy within Nordic alternative investments and will further build Storebrand's position as a gateway to the Nordic market in asset management.\n\nAll shares in Capital Investment that were acquired by Storebrand ASA were transferred to Storebrand Asset Management AS as of 30 September 2021 as a contribution in kind.\n\nStorebrand has paid the selling shareholders consideration for the shares amounting to NOK 692 million upon completion of the transaction, divided between newly issued shares in Storebrand ASA and a cash consideration of NOK 351 million. Upon completion of the transaction, 4,160,908 new shares have been issued in Storebrand ASA as a partial financing of the share acquisition by the capital increase having been carried out in return for contributions in the form of assets other than cash so that shareholders do not have preferential rights. The value of the consideration that Storebrand ASA is paying for the shares in Capital Investment is based on the price of the shares in Storebrand ASA of NOK 82.02 per share. In addition, there may be additional consideration based on developments in results and income in Capital Investment, estimated to NOK 93 million as of 30 September. The additional consideration has an upper limit of NOK 273 million.\n\nThe acquisition of the shares in Capital Investment was made public on 31 August 2021, and the transaction has been approved by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway and the Norwegian Ministry of Finance.\n\nThe table below shows the acquisition analysis. Excess value of NOK 242 million has been identified before deferred tax related to customer contracts and deferred tax of NOK 53 million has been calculated on the excess value. Goodwill amounts to NOK 586 million and this item is not depreciated, but is tested yearly against impairment.\n\n## ACQUISITION ANALYSIS CAPITAL INVESTMENT\n\n|                                         | Book values in  the company   | Excess value  upon acquistion   | Book  values   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Assets                                  |                               |                                 |                |\n| Customer contracts                      |                               | 242                             | 242            |\n| Other assets                            | 6                             |                                 | 6              |\n| Bank deposits                           | 20                            |                                 | 20             |\n| Total assets                            | 27                            | 242                             | 269            |\n| Liabilities                             |                               |                                 |                |\n| Current liabilities                     | 11                            |                                 | 11             |\n| Deferred tax                            |                               | 53                              | 53             |\n| Net identifiable assets and liabilities | 16                            | 189                             | 205            |\n| Goodwill                                |                               |                                 | 581            |\n| Fair value at acquisition date          |                               |                                 | 785            |\n| Conditional payment                     |                               |                                 | 93             |\n| Cash payment                            |                               |                                 | 692            |\n\nThe tables below show the distribution of the consideration and an overview of the profit in Capital Investment in 2021 prior to acquisition and after acquisition on 30 September 2021.",

December 2021 entered into an agreement to buy 100% of the shares in Danica Pensjonsforsikring AS, Norway ('Danica'). Danica, a subsidiary of Danske Bank, is the 6th largest provider of Defined Contribution pensions in Norway with 5% market share. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS will pay NOK 2.01 billion for the shares of Danica (adjusted for the change in the net asset value of Danica in the period from 30 September 2021 to 31 December 2021). The conclusion of the transaction is expected in the first half of 2022 and is subject to approval from the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority and the Norwegian Competition Authority.\n\n## Note 4: Pro/fit by segments\n\nStorebrand's operation includes the segments Savings, Insurance, Guaranteed Pension and Other.\n\n## Savings\n\nThe savings segment includes products for retirement savings with no interest rate guarantees. The segment consists of defined contribution pensions in Norway and Sweden, asset management and retail banking products. In addition, certain other subsidiaries in Storebrand Livsforsikring and SPP are included in Savings.\n\n## Insurance\n\nInsurance has responsibility for the Group's risk products in Norway and Sweden. The unit provides health insurance in the Norwegian and Swedish corporate and retail markets, P&C insurance and personal risk products in the Norwegian and Swedish retail markets and employee-related and pension-related insurance in the Norwegian and Swedish corporate markets.\n\n## Guaranteed Pension\n\nThe Guaranteed Pension business area encompasses long-term pension savings products that give customers a guaranteed rate of return. The area includes defined contribution pensions in Norway and Sweden, paid-up policies and individual capital and pension insurances.\n\n## Other\n\nThe result for the holding company Storebrand ASA is reported under Other, as well as the result for the company portfolios and small subsidiaries of Storebrand Life Insurance and SPP. This also includes minority interests in securities funds and eliminations of intra-group transactions included in the other segments.\n\n## Reconciliation between the profit and loss statement and alternative statement of the result (segment)\n\nThe results in the segments are reconciled against the Group result before amortisation and write-downs of intangible assets. The Group's income statement includes gross income and costs linked to both the insurance customers and owners (shareholders). The alternative statement of the result only includes result elements relating to owners (shareholders) which are the result elements that the Group has performance measures and follow-up for. The result lines that are used in segment reporting will therefore not be identical with the result lines in the corporate profit and loss account. Below is an overall description of the most important differences.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nFee and administration income consists of fees and fixed administrative income. In the Group's income statement, the item is classified as premium income, net interest income from bank or other income depending on the type of activity. The Group's income statement also includes savings elements for insurance contracts and possibly transferred reserve.\n\n## Price of return guarantee and profit risk (fee incomes) - Storebrand Life Insurance AS\n\nThe return guarantees in group pension insurance with a return guarantee must be priced upfront. The level of the return guarantee, the size of the buffer capital (additional statutory reserves and unrealised gains), and the investment risk of the portfolio in which the pensions assets are invested determine the price that the customer pays for his or her return guarantee. Return guarantees are priced on the basis of the risk to which the equity is exposed. The insurance company bears all the downside risk and must carry reserves against the policy if the buffer reserves are insufficient or unavailable.\n\nThe insurance result consists of insurance premiums and claims\n\nInsurance premiums consist of premium income relating to risk products (insurance segment) that are classified as premium income in the Group's income statement.\n\nClaims consist of paid-out claims and changes in provisions for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims reported but not settled (RBNS) relating to risk products that are classified as claims in the Group's income statement.\n\nAdministration costs consist of the Group's operating costs in the Group's income statement minus operating costs allocated to traditional individual products with profit sharing.\n\nFinancial items and risk result life and pensions include risk result life and pensions and financial result includes net profit sharing and Loan Losses.\n\nRisk result life and pensions consists of the difference between risk premium and claims for products relating to defined-contribution pension, unit linked insurance contracts (savings segment) and defined-benefit pension (guaranteed pension segment). Risk premium is classified as premium income in the Group's income statement.\n\nThe financial result consists of the return for the company portfolios of Storebrand ASA, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB (Other segment), while returns for the other company portfolios in the Group are a financial result within the segment which the business is associated with. Returns on company portfolios are classified as net income from financial assets and property for companies in the Group's income statement. The financial result also includes returns on customer assets relating to products within the insurance segment, and in the Group's income statement this item will be entered under net income from financial assets and property for customers. In the alternative income statement, the result before tax of certain unimportant subsidiaries is included in the financial result, while in the Group's income statement, this is shown as other income, operating costs and other costs.\n\n## Net profit sharing\n\nStorebrand Livsforsikring AS\n\nA modified profit-sharing regime was introduced for old and new individual contracts that have left group pension insurance policies (paid-up policies), which allows the company to retain up to 20 per cent of the profit from returns after any allocations to additional statutory reserves. The modified profit-sharing model means that any negative risk result can be deducted from the customers' interest profit before sharing, if it is not covered by the risk equalisation fund.\n\nIndividual endowment insurance and pensions written by the Group prior to 1 January 2008 will continue to apply the profit rules effective prior to 2008. New contracts may not be established in this portfolio. The Group can retain up to 35 per cent of the total result after allocations to additional statutory reserves.\n\nAny negative returns on customer portfolios and returns lower than the interest guarantee that cannot be covered by additional statutory reserves must be covered by the company's equity and will be included in the net profit-sharing and losses line.",

Appendix\n\n## SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB\n\nFor premiums paid from and including 2016, previous profit sharing is replaced by a guarantee fee for premium-determined insurance (IF portfolio). The guarantee fee is annual and is calculated as 0.2 per cent of the capital. This goes to the company.\n\nFor contributions agreed to prior to 2016, the profit sharing is maintained, i.e. that if the total return on assets in one calendar year for a premium-determined insurance (IF portfolio) exceeds the guaranteed interest, profit sharing will be triggered. When profit sharing is triggered, 90 per cent of the total return on assets passes to the policyholder and 10 per cent to the company. The company's share of the total return on assets is included in the financial result.\n\nIn the case of defined-benefit insurance (KF portfolio), the company is entitled to charge an indexing fee if the group profit allows the indexing of the insurance. Indexing is allowed up to a maximum equalling the change in the consumer price index (CPI) between the previous two Septembers. Pensions that are paid out are indexed if the ratio between assets and guaranteed insurance liabilities in the portfolio as at 30 September exceeds 107 per cent, and half of the fee is charged. The entire fee will be charged if the ratio between assets and guaranteed insurance liabilities in the portfolio as at 30 September exceeds 120 per cent, in which case paid-up policies can also be included. The total fee equals 0.8 per cent of the insurance capital.\n\nThe guaranteed liability is continuously monitored. If the guaranteed liability is higher than the value of the assets, a provision must be made in the form of a deferred capital contribution. If the assets are lower than the guaranteed liability when the insurance payments start, the company supplies capital up to the guaranteed liability in the form of a realised capital contribution. Changes in the deferred capital contribution are included in the financial result.\n\n## Loan losses:\n\nLoan losses consist of individual and group write-downs on lending activities that are on the balance sheet of Storebrand Bank Group. In the Group's income statement, the item is classified under loan losses. With regard to loan losses that are on the balance sheet of the Storebrand Livforsikring Group, these will not be included on this line in either the alternative income statement or in the Group's income statement, but in the Group's income statement will be included in the item, net income from financial assets and property for customers.\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets includes depreciation and possible write-downs of intangible assets established through acquisitions of enterprises.\n\n## GROUP PROFIT BY SEGMENT\n\n| NOK million                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Savings                           | 2,355  | 1,730  |\n| Insurance                         | 423    | 204    |\n| Guaranteed pension  1)            | 1,432  | 805    |\n| Other  1)                         | 293    | -28    |\n| Group profit before amortisation  | 4,503  | 2,711  |\n| Amortisation of intangible assets | -527   | -492   |\n| Group pre-tax profit              | 3,976  | 2,219  |\n\n- 1) Comparing figures for previous periods have been revised.

Corporate governance\n\n9. Sustainability Assurance\n\n10. Appendix\n\n## Note 5: Risk management and internal control\n\nStorebrand's income and performance are dependent on external factors that are associated with uncertainty. The most important external risk factors are the developments in the financial markets and changes in life expectancy in the Norwegian and Swedish populations. Certain internal operational factors can also result in losses, e.g. errors linked to the management of the customers' assets or payment of pension.\n\nContinuous monitoring and active risk management are core areas of the Group's activities and organisation. At the Storebrand Group, responsibility for risk management and internal control is an integral part of management responsibility.\n\n## Organisation of risk management\n\nThe Group's organisation of the responsibility for risk management follows a model based on three lines of defence. The objective of the model is to safeguard the responsibility for risk management at both company and Group level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe boards of directors of both Storebrand ASA and the group companies have the overall responsibility for limiting and following up the risks associated with the activities. The boards set annual limits and guidelines for risk-taking in the company, receive reports on the actual risk levels, and perform a forward-looking assessment of the risk situation.\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA has established a Risk Committee consisting of 3 Board members. The main task of the Risk Committee is to prepare matters to be considered by the Board in the area of risk, with a special focus on the Group's appetite for risk, risk strategy and investment strategy. The Committee should contribute forward-looking, decision-making support related to the Board's discussion of risk taking, financial forecasts and the treatment of risk reporting.\n\nManagers at all levels in the company are responsible for risk management within their own area of responsibility.  Good risk management requires targeted work on objectives, strategies and action plans, identification and assessment of risks, documentation of processes and routines, prioritisation and implementation of improvement measures, and good communication, information and reporting.\n\n## Independent control functions\n\nIndependent control functions have been established for risk management for the business (Risk Management Function/Chief Risk Officer), for compliance with the regulations (Compliance Function), for ensuring the insurance liabilities are calculated correctly (Actuary Function), for data protection (Data Protection Officer), for money laundering (Anti Money Laundering) and for the bank's lending. Relevant functions have been established for both the Storebrand Group (the Group) and all of the companies requiring a licence. The independent control functions are organised directly under the companies' managing directors and report to the respective company's board.\n\nIn terms of function, the independent control functions are affiliated with Governance Risk & Compliance (GRC). GRC is a knowledge community headed by the Group CRO. The Group CRO is responsible to the Group CEO and reports to the Board of Storebrand ASA. GRC's task is to ensure that all significant risks are identified, measured and appropriately reported. The GRC function shall be actively involved in the development of the Group's risk strategy and maintain a holistic view of the company's risk exposure. This includes responsibility for ensuring compliance with the relevant regulations for risk management and the consolidated companies' operations.\n\nThe internal audit function is organised directly under the Board and shall provide the boards of the relevant consolidated companies with confirmation concerning the appropriateness and effectiveness of the company's risk management, including how well the various lines of defence are working.",

Appendix\n\n## Note 6: Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss, damaged reputation or sanctions related to violations of internal or external regulations as a result of ineffective, insufficient or defective internal processes or systems, human error, external events or rules and guidelines not being followed.\n\nThe Group seeks to reduce operational risk through an effective system for internal control. Risks are followed up through the management's risk reviews, with documentation of risks, measures and the follow-up of incidents. In addition, Internal Audit carries out independent checks through audit projects adopted by the Board.\n\nContingency and continuity plans have been prepared to deal with serious incidents in business-critical processes.\n\nStorebrand's IT systems are vital for operations and reliable financial reporting. Errors and disruptions may have consequences for commercial operations and can impact on the trust the Group has from both customers and shareholders. In the worst case, abnormal situations can result in penalties from the supervisory authorities. Storebrand's IT platform is characterised by complexity and integration between different specialist systems and joint systems. The operation of the IT systems has largely been outsourced to different service providers. A management model has been established with close follow-up of providers and internal control activities in order to reduce the risk associated with the development, administration and operation of the IT systems, as well as information security.\n\nStorebrand is facing a major technological shift with the transition to cloud-based infrastructure and in 2021 the entire asset management business was migrated to cloud. Risks increase in connection with the actual transformation, and the consequence of errors can be greater when services are provided online. Cloud-based services and infrastructure have good inbuilt security solutions and reduce the risk associated with self-developed systems and, in the long term, outdated infrastructure. The asset management business has a modern and standardised core system, combined with self-developed applications. The bank platform and insurance platform are based on purchased standard systems that are operated and monitored through outsourcing agreements. There is a greater degree of own development for the life insurance activities, while parts of the operation of this have also been outsourced. The unit administration within defined-contribution occupational pension and unit linked products is managed in a purchased system solution.\n\nIn 2021, the security function was divided into two formal lines of responsibility. These consist of an independent second line placed with the Group's other control functions and an operational first line as an integrated part of infrastructure operations. Staffing was increased for both lines of responsibility and expanded monitoring systems were also implemented. During the pandemic, the threat landscape for information security and cyber-risk has changed in nature, and 'home office fatigue', combined with migration to cloud platform, complex and manual processes, third-party vendors and dependency on key personnel have created increased short-term uncertainty.\n\nThe latter has to some extent already been addressed through the reinforcement and division of responsibilities that took place earlier in the year. The control function has been given a defined mandate and resources have been allocated that specifically address the expertise and awareness of employees now that we have a distributed work model. There is also an increased focus on and resources assigned to monitor third-party suppliers and technical vulnerabilities in infrastructure.\n\n## Note 7: Insurance risk\n\nStorebrand offers traditional life and pension insurance as both group and individual contracts. Contracts are also offered in which the customer has the choice of investment.\n\nThe insurance risk in Norway is largely standardised for contracts within the same product category as a result of detailed regulation from the authorities. In Sweden, the framework conditions for insurance contracts entail major differences between the contracts within the same product category.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\nThe insurance risk associated with an increase in life expectancy and thereby an increase in future pension payments (longevity) is the greatest risk for the Group. Other risks include disability risk and mortality risk. The life insurance risks are:\n\n- 1. Long life expectancy - The risk of erroneously estimating life expectancy and future pension payments. Historical developments have shown that an increasing number of people attain retirement age and live longer as pensioners than was previously the case. There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding future mortality development. In the event of longer life expectancy beyond that assumed in the premium tariffs, there is also an increased risk of the owner's result having to be charged in order to cover necessary statutory provisions.\n- 2. Disability - The risk of erroneous estimation of future illness and disability. There will be uncertainty associated with the future development of disability, including disability pensioners who are returned to the workforce.\n- 3. Death The risk of erroneous estimation of mortality or erroneous estimation of payment to surviving relatives. Over the last few years, a decrease in mortality and fewer young surviving relatives have been registered, compared with earlier years.\n\nIn the Guaranteed Pensions segment, the Group has a significant insurance risk relating to estimation of life expectancy and future pension payments for group and individual insurance agreements. In addition, there is an insurance risk associated with estimates of disability and pensions left to spouses and/or children. The disability coverage in Guaranteed Pensions is primarily sold together with a retirement pension. The risk of mortality is low in Guaranteed Pensions when viewed in relation to other risks. In SPP it is possible to change the future premiums for the IF portfolio, reducing the risk significantly. In Norway it is also possible to change the future premiums of group policies, but only for new accumulation, entailing reduced risk.\n\nOccupational pension agreements (hybrid) are reported in the Guaranteed Pension segment when a customer has an agreement without a choice for investment of the pension assets. This is a small portfolio with limited insurance risk.\n\nIn the Savings segment the Group has a low insurance risk. The insurance risk is largely associated with death, with some long-life risk for paid-up policies with investment options. Occupational pension agreements (hybrid) are reported in the Guaranteed Pension segment when a customer has an agreement with a choice for investment of the pension assets. This is a small portfolio with limited insurance risk.\n\nOwn pension accounts are also included in the Savings segment. In 2021, 1.5 million Norwegians received an own pension account. During 2021, defined-contribution pensions from current and former employers were combined in the person's own pension account. There is no longer a requirement for 12 months of employment for employees to be able to take their accrued pension capital with them. Storebrand has no insurance risks related to own pension accounts.\n\nIn the Insurance segment, the Group has an insurance risk associated with disability and death. In addition, there are insurance risks associated with occupational injury, critical illness, cancer insurance, child insurance, pregnancy insurance, accident insurance and health insurance. For occupational injury, the risk is first and foremost potential errors in the assessment of the level of provisions, because the number of claim years can be up to 25 years. The insurance risk within critical illness, cancer, accident and health insurance is considered to be limited based on the volume and underlying volatility of the products. Within P&C insurance, the risk of fire in commercial buildings, housing cooperatives and residential homes, as well as personal injury for motor vehicle insurance constitute the main risks.\n\n## Covid-19 and the impact on the insurance business\n\nThere is still uncertainty related to the effect of the Covid-19 outbreak on the insurance risk in the Group. See the reference to Covid-19 under Note 2: Important accounting principles and discretionary assessments.\n\n## Rules for laid-off employees in private occupational pension schemes\n\nThe duration of the temporary statutory amendments which give employers the option to decide that laid-off employees shall continue as members of the private pension scheme has been extended until 28 February 2022. The employer can choose whether the laid-off employees shall still be covered by the insurance coverage in the pension scheme. Laid-off employees who do not have their insurance coverage continued are entitled to take out separate individual insurance (continuation insurance). The employees who remain members of the pension scheme will not be issued with pension capital certificates, paid-up policies or pension certificates. The temporary statutory amendments are not considered to be of significance to Storebrand Livsforsikring's insurance risk.\n\n## Rules for pension from the first krone and day enter into force\n\nThe rules for pension from the first krone and day enter into force on 1 January 2022. The companies will be given until 30 June 2022 to adjust their pension schemes to the new rules. Among other things, the new rules entail that there will be requirements for all private occupational pension schemes to save a minimum of 2 per cent of the members' income and that the option of exempting employees with salaries below 1 G (the National Insurance base amount) will be removed. Furthermore, the minimum requirement of",

Like the National Insurance scheme, the age limit for membership has been reduced from 20 to 13 years. Employees are entitled to membership in the schemes when their income exceeds the limits for reportable salary in the a-ordning (a-scheme) 1 . There will no longer be separate exemption rules for seasonal workers.\n\nThe overall annual increased savings for Storebrand Livsforsikring are estimated at NOK 500 million. Increased savings also depend on how companies with savings rates that are higher than the minimum rate will potentially adapt the pension scheme.\n\n## Introduction of buffer funds for municipal pension schemes\n\nThe introduction of buffer funds for municipal pension schemes will enter into force on 1 January 2022. The new rules entail the introduction of a combined and customer-distributed buffer fund for municipal pension schemes effective from 1 January 2022. This buffer fund replaces the current additional statutory reserves and market value adjustment reserves for these schemes. Among other things, the rule change will facilitate a more neutral regulatory framework when transferring municipal pension schemes. The Ministry of Finance has stipulated transitional rules in regulations which entail that transfer processes initiated before the new rules enter into force must comply with the rules that applied at the time the decision to transfer was made. The new rules have no significance for Storebrand Livsforsikring as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Description of products\n\n## Risk premiums and tariffs\n\nGuaranteed Pension\n\nGroup pension insurance schemes in Norway follow the premiums for traditional retirement and survivor coverage in the industry tariff K2013. The premiums for disability pensions are based on the company's own experience. Expense premiums are determined annually with a view to securing full cover for the next year's expected costs.\n\nFor individual insurance in Norway, the premiums for death risk and long life expectancy risk are based on tariffs produced by insurance companies on the basis of their shared experience. This applies to both endowment and pension insurance. Disability premiums are based on the company's own experience.\n\nThe risk premium for group insurance in Sweden is calculated as an equalised premium within the insurance group, based on the group distribution of age and gender, as well as the requirement for coverage of next of kin. The risk premium for individual insurance is determined individually based on age and gender.\n\nSPP's mortality assumptions are based on the general mortality tariff DUS14, adjusted for the company's own observations.\n\nThe new public service occupational pension entered into force from 2020 and includes retirement pensions in the public sector. The new scheme is a premium pension and is a net pension that is known from the private sector. Premium pension means that the pension is accrued each year based on the employee's salary. This is as opposed to the previous schemes whereby the pension was calculated based on the final salary. The premium pension ensures a life-long retirement pension, and the retirement pension can be fully or partly withdrawn from and including the age of 62 until and including the age of 75. Payment of the pension will start at the age of 75 regardless. Members who are not entitled to an AFP are given a conditional occupational pension as a supplement to the retirement pension.\n\n## Insurance\n\nTariffs for group life insurance and certain risk insurances within group pensions also depend on the industry or occupation, in addition to age and gender. Group life insurance also applies tariffs based on claims experience. The company's tariff for group life insurance, both for life and disability cover, is based on the company's own experience.\n\nNewer individual endowment policies are priced without taking gender into account. The tariffs for all individual endowment policies are based on the company's own experiences.\n\nFor P&C insurance (occupational injury, property and motor vehicle) the tariffs are based on the company's own experiences.\n\n1) The a-ordning is a coordinated method for employers to report information about employees and income to Statistics Norway, the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) and the Norwegian Tax Administration. This information will be sent electronically either via a service in Altinn or the employer's payroll system and entered into force on 1 January 2015.  Through the scheme, employer reporting was simplified by going from five forms to one a-message (a-melding).",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Management of insurance risk\n\nInsurance risk is monitored separately for every line of insurance in the current insurance portfolio. The development of the risk results is followed throughout the year. For each type of risk, the ordinary risk result for a period represents the difference between the risk premiums the company has collected for the period and the sum of provisions and payments that must be made for insured events that occur in the period. The risk result takes into account insured events that have not yet been reported, but which the company, on the basis of experience, assumes have occurred.\n\nWhen writing individual risk cover, the customer is subject to a health check. The result of the health check is reflected in the level of premium quoted. When arranging group policies with risk cover, all employees of small companies are subject to a health check, while for companies with many employees a declaration of fitness for work is required. In the assessment of risk, the company's business category, sector and sickness record are also taken into account.\n\nLarge claims or special events constitute a major risk for all products. The largest claims will typically be in the group life, occupational injury and personal injury (motor vehicle accidents) segments.\n\nThe company manages its insurance risk through a variety of reinsurance programmes. Through catastrophe reinsurance (excess of loss), the company covers losses (single claims and reserves provisions) where a single event causes more than two deaths or disability cases. This cover is also subject to an upper limit. A reinsurance agreement for life policies covers death and disability risk that exceeds the maximum risk amount for own account the company practises. The company's maximum risk amount for own account is relatively high, and the risk reinsured is therefore relatively modest.\n\nThe company also manages its insurance risk through international pooling. This implies that multinational corporate customers can equalise the results between the various units internationally. Pooling is offered for group life and risk cover within group pensions.\n\n## Risk result\n\nThe risk result consists of premiums the company charges to cover insurance risks less the actual costs in the form of insurance reserves and payments for insured events such as death, pensions, disability and accidents.\n\nThe table below specifies the risk result for the largest entities in the Group and also states the effect of reinsurance and pooling on the result. The risk result in the table shows the total risk result for distribution to customers and owner (the insurance company).\n\n## SPECIFICATION OF RISK RESULT\n\n|                   |   Storebrand Livsforsikring AS |   Storebrand Livsforsikring AS |   SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB |   SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| NOK million       |                           2021 |                           2020 |                          2021 |                          2020 |\n| Survival result   |                             33 |                              7 |                            83 |                            54 |\n| Death result      |                            229 |                            243 |                             3 |                            23 |\n| Disability result |                            249 |                            -26 |                            48 |                           134 |\n| Reinsurance       |                             -3 |                              5 |                            -1 |                             0 |\n| Pooling           |                             -7 |                            -44 |                           -22 |                           -26 |\n| Other             |                             -1 |                            -33 |                            30 |                             1 |\n| Total risk result |                            500 |                            153 |                           139 |                           186 |\n\n## Adequacy test\n\nIn accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, the insurance liabilities that are included shall be adequate and a liability adequacy test shall be performed.

Appendix\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nThe volatility of the risk results depends on the development in insurance risk, and the sensitivities indicate the uncertainty associated with different insurance risks. Storebrand's products have different insurance risks, however when calculating sensitivity, the starting point is the same changes, since the development in, for example, disability in the community, is assumed to be the same across the products. However, it is expected that there will be different effects on the risk results because the premium is calculated using a tariff that is specific for the product. Some forms of coverage have a stronger tariff for which a better risk result is expected, while other products have a weaker tariff for which the risk result is expected to be weaker. The tariff will also reflect any differences in the risk for products taken out as a collective or individual agreement. It will also reflect the different waiting periods, i.e. the period from when the claim is made until the right to compensation. The pension products typically have a waiting period of 12 months, while employee insurance is paid out in the event of permanent disability.\n\nIn the table below, the following stress factors are used:\n\n- \u00b7 5% increase for disability\n- \u00b7 5% reduction for reactivation\n- \u00b7 5% increased mortality\n- \u00b7 5% increased longevity\n\n## STOREBRAND LIFE INSURANCE AND STOREBRAND INSURANCE\n\n## Guaranteed pension\n\n| NOK million                          |   Group pension  private sector | Occupational  pension   |   Paid-up   policies | Individual with  guarantee   |   Sum |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|-------|\n| Mortality                            |                              -4 | NA                      |                  -15 | -3                           |   -22 |\n| Longevity                            |                             -11 | -2                      |                  -66 | -7                           |   -87 |\n| Disability                           |                              -6 | NA                      |                  -16 | -4                           |   -26 |\n| Recovering to work after  disability |                              -2 | -11                     |                   -3 | NA                           |   -16 |\n\nThe table above shows the sensitivity as a one-year gross effect on the risk result. It varies as to how the gross effect is recognised in the company's income statement. The business rules define buffer capital and other factors which entail that a negative risk result for the collective pension products may be covered by the risk equalisation fund, provided that this is sufficient. Equivalently, up to 50% of the positive risk result will be added to the risk equalisation fund, while other positive risk results will pass to the customers. The risk result for individual insurance policies is included in the profit sharing between the customers and Storebrand.\n\nFurthermore, the need for an increased premium reserve has been estimated as a result of a permanent change in the assumptions. There has been an estimated increase in the premium reserve for increased longevity of NOK 1.6 billion and an increase of NOK 0.4 billion as a result of increased disability and reduced reactivation as stated above. Such a development may also entail the need for an increased premium. Pursuant to Sections 3-15 and 3-16 of the Insurance Activity Act, increased premium reserves can be fully or partly covered by the profit for the year on the risk result, risk equalization fund and future profit on the risk result if the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway has consented to the plan for strengthening reserves.\n\n## Insurance\n\n| Effect on profit before tax                 | Effect NOK million   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 5 per cent change in premium income         | +/- 259              |\n| 5 percentage point change in combined ratio | +/- 242              |\n\nThe table above shows the effect on earnings and equity before tax of a 5 per cent change in gross premiums earned and a 5 percentage point change in the combined ratio. The combined ratio is the most commonly applied criterion for measuring profitability within P&C insurance and may result from a change in claims frequency, level of compensation and/or operating costs.",

The change in increased longevity and mortality have their full impact in SPP's result.\n\n## Note 8: Financial market risk\n\nMarket risk means changes in the value of assets as a result of unexpected volatility or changes in prices on the financial markets. It also refers to the risk that the value of the insurance liability develops differently to that of the assets as a result of changes in interest rates.\n\nThe most significant market risks for Storebrand are interest rate risk, share market risk, property price risk, credit risk, and exchange rate risk.\n\nFor the life insurance companies, the financial assets are invested in a variety of sub-portfolios. Market risk affects Storebrand's income and profit differently in the different sub-portfolios. There are three main types of sub-portfolio: company portfolios, customer portfolios without a guarantee (unit linked insurance) and customer portfolios with a guarantee.\n\nThe market risk in the company portfolios has a direct impact on the profit.\n\nThe market risk in unit linked insurance is at the customers' risk, meaning Storebrand is not directly affected by changes in value. Nevertheless, changes in value do affect Storebrand's profit indirectly. Income is based largely on the size of the reserves, while the costs tend to be fixed. Lower returns on the financial market than expected will therefore have a negative effect on Storebrand's future income and profit.\n\nFor customer portfolios with a guarantee, the net risk for Storebrand will be lower than the gross market risk. The extent of measures to reduce risk depends on several factors, the most important being the size and flexibility of the customer buffers and level and duration of the return guarantee. If the investment return is not sufficient to meet the guaranteed interest rate, the shortfall may be met by using customer buffers built up from previous years' surpluses.\n\nFor guaranteed customer portfolios, the risk is affected by changes in the interest rate level. Falling interest rates are positive for the investment return in the short term due to price appreciation for bonds and interest rate swaps, but negative in the long term because it reduces the probability of achieving a return higher than the guarantee. Both short-term money market rates and long-term interest rates increased in Norway in 2021. Long-term rates have increased in Sweden, while short-term money market rates have remained stable at close to zero.\n\nThe composition of the assets within each sub-portfolio is determined by the company's investment strategy. The investment strategy also establishes guidelines and limits for the company's risk management, credit exposure, counterparty exposure, currency risk, use of derivatives, and requirements regarding liquidity.",

Storebrand's role is to offer a good, broad range of funds, to assemble profiles adapted to different risk profiles, and to offer systematic reduction of risk towards retirement age. The most significant market risks are share market risk and exchange rate risk.\n\nThe most significant market risks facing guaranteed customer portfolios are linked to equity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and property price risk. The investment allocation was not significantly changed during 2021. In Norway, most of the credit risk is linked to securities, which are carried at amortised cost. This significantly reduces the risk to the company's result because the result is not normally influenced by market fluctuations. The exception is if there is a loss event.\n\nThe market risk is managed by segmenting the portfolios based on risk-bearing capacity. For customers who have large customer buffers, investments are made with higher market risk that give increased expected returns. Equity risk is also managed by means of dynamic risk management, the objectives of which are to maintain good risk-bearing capacity and to adjust the financial risk to the buffer situation and the company's financial strength. By exercising this type of risk management, Storebrand expects to create good returns both for individual years and over time.\n\nFor company portfolios and guaranteed customer portfolios, most of the assets that are in currencies other than the domestic currency are hedged. This limits the currency risk from the investment portfolios.\n\nForeign exchange risk primarily arises as a result of investments in international securities, including as a result of ownership in SPP.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the value of assets and results from the Swedish operations are affected by changes in the value of the Swedish krone. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS has hedged parts of the value of SPP through forward foreign exchange contracts and borrowings in Swedish kroner.",

EUR and USD NOK 57 billion.\n\nThe table above shows the currency positions as at 31 December 2021. The currency exposure is primarily related to investments in the Norwegian and Swedish insurance business.\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring:\n\nForeign exchange risk exists primarily as a result of investments in international securities, as well as subordinated loans in a foreign currency to a certain extent. The company hedges most of the foreign exchange risk in the customer portfolios on an ongoing basis. Most of the non-guaranteed pension profiles are currency hedged. Most of the fixed-interest portfolios for the guaranteed pension portfolios are currency hedged, while approximately 70 per cent of global equity portfolios are currency hedged. Foreign exchange risk due to subordinated loans in a foreign currencies is currency hedged.\n\nHedging is performed by means of forward foreign exchange contracts at the portfolio level, and the currency positions are monitored continuously against a total limit. Negative currency positions are closed out no later than the day after they arose. In addition, separate limits have been defined so that active currency positions can be taken. Storebrand employs a currency hedging principle called block hedging, which makes the execution of currency hedging more efficient.\n\n## SPP:\n\nSPP uses currency hedging for its investments to a certain degree. Currency exposure may be between 0 and 30 per cent in accordance with the investment strategy.\n\n## Banking business\n\nStorebrand Bank ASA hedges net balance sheet items by means of forward contracts.\n\nThe permitted limit for the bank's foreign exchange position is 0.50 per cent of primary capital, which is approximately 17 million at present.\n\n## Guaranteed customer portfolios in more detail\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring\n\nThe annual guaranteed return to the customers follows the basic interest rate. New premiums were taken in with a basic interest rate of 2.0 per cent, and pensions were adjusted upwards with a basic interest rate of 0.5 per cent.",

If the company's investment return in any given year is lower than the guaranteed interest rate, the equivalent of up to one year's guaranteed return for the individual policy can be covered by transfers from the policy's additional statutory reserves.\n\nTo achieve adequate returns with the present interest rates, it is necessary to take an investment risk. This is primarily done by investing in shares, property and corporate bonds.\n\nInterest rate risk is in a special position because changes in interest rates also affect the fair value of the insurance liability for the solvency calculation. Since pension disbursements may be many years in the future, the insurance liability is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the Norwegian business, greater interest rate sensitivity from the investments will entail increased risk that the return is below the guaranteed level. The risk management must therefore balance the risk of the profit for the year (interest rate increase) with the reinvestment risk if interest rates fall below the guarantee in the future. Bonds at amortised cost are an important risk management tool.\n\n## SPP Pension & Insurance\n\nThe guaranteed interest rate is determined by the insurance company and is used when calculating the premium and the guaranteed benefit. The guaranteed interest rate does not entail that there is an annual minimum guarantee for the return as is the case in Norway.\n\nNew premiums in individual defined-contribution pensions (IF) have a guarantee of 1.25% for 85% of the premium. Group defined-benefit pension (KF) is closed to new members.",

For IF, profit sharing becomes relevant in SPP if the return exceeds the guaranteed yield. The contracts' buffer capital must be intact in order for profit sharing to represent a net income for SPP. In the case of KF, a certain degree of consolidation, i.e. that the assets are greater than the present value of the liabilities by a certain percentage, is required in order for the owner to receive profit-sharing income (indexing fee).\n\nIf the assets in an insurance contract in the company are less than the market value of the liability, an equity contribution is allocated that reflects this value shortfall. This is termed a deferred capital contribution (DCC), and changes in DCC are recognised in the profit and loss account as they occur. When the contracts' assets exceed the present value of the liabilities, a buffer, which is termed the conditional bonus, is established. Changes in this customer buffer are not recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n| Interest rate   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|\n| 5.20 %          | 10.2 % | 12.1 % |\n| 4,5%-5,2%       | 0.1 %  | 0.4 %  |\n| 4.00 %          | 4.9 %  | 4.5 %  |\n| 3.00 %          | 50.6 % | 47.4 % |\n| 2,75%-4,0%      | 4.9 %  | 5.0 %  |\n| 2.70 %          | 0.1 %  | 0.1 %  |\n| 2.50 %          | 5.3 %  | 5.9 %  |\n| 1.60 %          | 0.0 %  | 0.0 %  |\n| 1.50 %          | 1.4 %  | 1.9 %  |\n| 1.25 %          | 3.5 %  | 4.2 %  |\n| 1,25% *         | 10.8 % | 9.7 %  |\n| 0,5%-2,5%       | 2.4 %  | 3.5 %  |\n| 0.00 %          | 5.9 %  | 5.4 %  |\n\n| Average interest rate guarantee in per cent   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Individual pension insurance                  | 3.0 %  | 3.0 %  |\n| Group pension insurance                       | 2.9 %  | 2.6 %  |\n| Individual occupational pension insurance     | 3.1 %  | 3.1 %  |\n| Total                                         | 3.1 %  | 3.0 %  |\n\nIn the Swedish operations management of interest rate risk is based on the principle that the interest rate risk from assets shall approximately correspond to the interest rate risk from the insurance liabilities.\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nThe tables show the fall in value for Storebrand Life Insurance and SPP's investment portfolios because of immediate changes in value related to financial market risk. The calculation is model-based, and the result is dependent on the choice of stress level for each category of asset. The stresses have been applied to the company portfolio and guaranteed customer portfolios as of 31 December 2021. The effect of each stress changes the return in each investment profile.\n\nUnit linked insurance without a guaranteed annual return is not included in the analysis. For these products, the customers bear the market risk and the effect of a falling market will not directly affect the result or buffer capital.\n\nThe amount of stress is the same that is used for the company's risk management. Two stress tests have been defined. Stress test 1 is a fall in the value of shares, corporate bonds and property in combination with lower interest rates. Stress test 2 is a somewhat smaller fall in the value of shares, corporate bonds, and property in combination with higher interest rates.",

If it is assumed that the market changes occur over a period of time, then dynamic risk management would reduce the effect of the negative outcomes and reinforce the positive to some extent.\n\nAs a result of customer buffers, the effect of the stresses on the result will be lower than the combined change in value in the table. As at 31 December 2021, the customer buffers are of such a size that the effects on the result are significantly lower.\n\n## Stresstest 1\n\n|                    | Storebrand Life Insurance   | Storebrand Life Insurance   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Resultatrisiko     | NOK Million                 | Share of portfolio          | NOK Million                | Share of portfolio         |\n| Interest rate risk | 4,811                       | 2.1%                        | -283                       | -0.3%                      |\n| Equtiy risk        | -4,406                      | -1.9 %                      | -2,565                     | -2.8 %                     |\n| Property risk      | -2,723                      | -1.2 %                      | -1,333                     | -1.4 %                     |\n| Credit risk        | -1,097                      | -0.5 %                      | -796                       | -0.9 %                     |\n| Total              | -3,415                      | -1.5 %                      | -4,977                     | -5.4 %                     |\n\n## Stresstest 2\n\n|                    | Storebrand Life Insurance   | Storebrand Life Insurance   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   | SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Resultatrisiko     | NOK Million                 | Share of portfolio          | NOK Million                | Share of portfolio         |\n| Interest rate risk | -4,814                      | -2.1 %                      | 283                        | 0.3 %                      |\n| Equtiy risk        | -2,643                      | -1.1 %                      | -1,539                     | -1.7 %                     |\n| Property risk      | -1,588                      | -0.7 %                      | -778                       | -0.8 %                     |\n| Credit risk        | -658                        | -0.3 %                      | -478                       | -0.5 %                     |\n| Total              | -9,703                      | -4.2 %                      | -2,512                     | -2.7 %                     |\n\n## Storebrand Livsforsikring\n\nFor Storebrand Livsforsikring it is stress test 2, which includes an increase in interest rates, that makes the greatest impact. The overall market risk is NOK 9.7 billion, which is equivalent to 4.2 per cent of the investment portfolio.\n\nIf the stress causes the return to fall below the guarantee, it will have a negative impact on the result if the customer buffer is not adequate. Other negative effects on the result are a lower return from the company portfolio and that there is no profit sharing from paid-up policies and individual contracts.\n\n## SPP Pension & Insurance\n\nFor SPP it is stress test 1, which includes a fall in interest rates, that creates the greatest impact. The overall market risk is SEK 5.0 billion, which is equivalent to 5.4 per cent of the investment portfolio.\n\nThe buffer situation for the individual contracts will determine if all or portions of the fall in value will affect the financial result. Only the portion of the fall in value that cannot be settled against the customer buffer will be charged to the result. In addition, the reduced profit sharing or loss of the indexing fees may affect the financial result.\n\n## Other operations\n\nThe other companies in the Storebrand Group are not included in the sensitivity analysis, as there is little market risk in these areas. The equity of these companies is invested with little or no allocation to high-risk assets, and the products do not entail a direct risk for the company as a result of price fluctuations in the financial market.",

Appendix\n\n## Note 9: Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the company is unable to fulfil its obligations without incurring substantial additional expenses in the form of reduced prices for assets that must be realised, or in the form of especially expensive financing.\n\nFor the insurance companies, the life insurance companies in particular, the insurance liabilities are long-term and the cash flows are generally known long before they fall due. In addition, liquidity is required to handle payments related to operations, and there are liquidity needs related to derivative contracts. The liquidity risk is handled by liquidity forecasts and the fact that portions of the investments are in very liquid securities, such as government bonds. The liquidity risk is considered low based on these measures.\n\nLiquidity risk is one of the largest risk factors for the banking business, and the regulations stipulate requirements for liquidity management and liquidity indicators. The guidelines for liquidity risk specify principles for liquidity management, and limits stipulated by the Board for different minimum liquidity and financing indicators. In addition to this, an annual funding strategy and funding plan are being drawn up that set out the overall limits for the bank's funding activities.\n\nSeparate liquidity strategies have also been drawn up for other subsidiaries in accordance with the statutory requirements. These strategies specify limits and measures for ensuring good liquidity and a minimum allocation to assets that can be sold at short notice. The strategies define limits for allocations to various asset types and mean the companies have money market investments, bonds, equities and other liquid investments that can be disposed of as required.\n\nIn addition to clear strategies and the risk management of liquidity reserves in each subsidiary, the Group's holding company has established a liquidity buffer. The development of the liquid holdings is continuously monitored at the Group level in relation to internal limits. A particular risk is the fact that during certain periods the financial markets can be closed for new borrowing. Measures for minimising the liquidity risk are to maintain a regular maturity structure for the loans, low costs, an adequate liquidity buffer and credit agreements with banks which the company can draw on if necessary.\n\n## UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 1)\n\n| NOK million                                        | 0 - 6             months   | 7 - 1 2          months   | 2 - 3               years   | 4 - 5                    years   | > 5 years   | Total  cashflows   | Total  booked  value 2021   | Total  booked  value 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Subordinated loan capital  2)                      | 905                        | 1,109                     | 5,282                       | 3,361                            | 3,290       | 13,947             | 11,441                      | 9,110                       |\n| Loans and deposits from  credit institutions       | 502                        |                           |                             |                                  |             | 502                | 502                         | 1,653                       |\n| Deposits from bank  customers                      | 16,752                     | 1                         | 94                          | 150                              | 242         | 17,239             | 17,239                      | 15,506                      |\n| Debt raised from issuance of  securities           | 3,302                      | 1,155                     | 11,619                      | 9,309                            | 780         | 26,165             | 24,924                      | 20,649                      |\n| Other current liabilities                          | 14,457                     | 11                        | 132                         | 42                               |             | 14,643             | 14,643                      | 16,209                      |\n| Uncalled residual liabilities  Limited partnership | 4,870                      |                           |                             |                                  |             | 4,870              |                             |                             |\n| Unused credit lines lending                        | 13,416                     |                           |                             |                                  |             | 13,416             |                             |                             |\n| Lending commitments                                | 3,516                      |                           |                             |                                  |             | 3,516              |                             |                             |\n| Total financial liabilities                        | 57,719                     | 2,276                     | 17,127                      | 12,862                           | 4,313       | 94,297             | 68,749                      |                             |\n| Derivatives related to  funding                    | -118                       | 87                        | -96                         | 61                               | -88         | -154               | -3                          |                             |\n| Total financial liabilities 2020                   | 49,351                     | 1,253                     | 13,556                      | 18,340                           | -2,357      | 80,143             |                             | 63,127                      |\n| Derivatives related to funding  2020               | -149                       | 74                        | -209                        |                                  |             | -284               |                             | 4                           |\n\n1) Liabilities for which repayment may be demanded immediately are included in the 0-6 month column.\n\n2) In the case of perpetual subordinated loans the cash flow is calculated through to the first call date.",

This risk also includes losses on lending and losses related to the failure of counterparties to fulfil their financial derivative contracts.\n\nThe maximum limits for credit exposure to individual counterparties and for overall credit exposure to rating categories are set by the boards of the individual companies in the Group. Particular attention is paid to ensuring diversification of credit exposure in order to avoid concentrating credit exposure on any particular debtors or sectors. Changes in the credit standing of debtors are monitored and followed up. Thus far, the Group has used published credit ratings wherever possible, supplemented by the company's own credit evaluation.\n\nUnderlying investments in funds managed by Storebrand are included in the tables.",

The placement of the individual customer is determined by the customer's primary business.\n\nThe majority of the loans at Storebrand consist of home loans to retail market customers. The home loans are approved and administered by Storebrand Bank, but a significant share of the loans have been transferred to Storebrand Livsforsikring as a part of the investment portfolio.

Appendix\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, Storebrand had loans to customers totalling NOK 69.5 billion net after provisions for losses of NOK 0.1 billion. Of this, NOK 12.9 billion was to the corporate market and NOK 56.7 billion to the retail market.\n\nThe corporate market portfolio consists of income generating properties and development properties with few customers and low level of default that are primarily secured by mortgages in commercial property.\n\nIn the retail market, most of the loans are secured by means of home mortgages. Customers are evaluated according to their capacity and intent to repay the loan. In addition to their capacity to service debt, checks are conducted of customers in relation to policy rules and they are given a credit rating.\n\nThe weighted average loan-to-value ratio for home loans is approximately 57 per cent. Approximately 58 per cent of home loans have a loan to value ratio within 60 per cent, 97 per cent are within 85 and 99 per cent are within a 100 per cent loan to value ratio. The portfolio is considered to have a low credit risk.\n\n## TOTAL COMMITTMENTS BY REMAINING TERM\n\n|                         | 2021                                      | 2021                | 2021               | 2020                                      | 2020                | 2020               |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| NOK million             | Loans to and  receivables  from customers | Unused  credit line | Total  commitments | Loans to and  receivables  from customers | Unused  credit line | Total  commitments |\n| Up to one month         | 56                                        | 1                   | 57                 | 9                                         | 2                   | 12                 |\n| 1 - 3 months            | 686                                       | 29                  | 716                | 553                                       | 32                  | 586                |\n| 4 months - 1 year       | 633                                       | 191                 | 823                | 2,060                                     | 172                 | 2,232              |\n| 2 -5 years              | 12,858                                    | 477                 | 13,334             | 10,267                                    | 609                 | 10,876             |\n| More than 5 years       | 55,395                                    | 2,686               | 58,081             | 50,423                                    | 2,311               | 52,734             |\n| Total gross commitments | 69,627                                    | 3,384               | 73,011             | 63,312                                    | 3,128               | 66,440             |\n\nDefault occurs after 90 days with arrears/overdrafts above both absolute and relative thresholds.

These risks are consolidated in the Storebrand Life Insurance Group, which includes Storebrand Livsforsikring AS and SPP Livf\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB. Other companies directly owned by Storebrand ASA that are exposed to significant risks are Storebrand Forsikring AS, Storebrand Helseforsikring AS, Storebrand Asset Management Group and Storebrand Bank Group.\n\nFor the life insurance businesses, the greatest risks are largely the same in Norway and Sweden. The financial market risk will depend significantly on global circumstances that influence the investment portfolios in all businesses. The insurance risk may be different for the various companies, and long life risk in particular can be influenced by universal trends.\n\nBoth the insurance business and the banking business are exposed to credit risk. The insurance business primarily has a credit risk relating to bonds with significant geographical and industry-related diversification, while the bank is mostly exposed to direct loans for residential property in Norway. There is no significant concentration risk across bonds and loans.\n\nThe financial market and investment risks are largely related to the customer portfolios in the life insurance business. The risk associated with a negative outcome in the financial market is described and quantified in Note 8, financial market risk. The banking business has little direct exposure to types of risk other than credit.\n\nIn the short term, an interest rate increase will negatively impact on the returns for the life insurance companies. An interest rate increase can also result in bank customers having lower debt-servicing capacity and increased losses for the banking business.\n\nThe risk from the P&C insurance and health insurance risk in Storebrand Skadeforsikring AS and Storebrand Helseforsikring AS has a low correlation with the risk from the rest of the businesses in the Group.\n\nIn the asset management business, the principal risk is operational risk in the form of behaviour that can trigger claims and/or impact on reputation. Since the asset management business is the principal manager of the insurance businesses, errors in asset management could result in errors in the insurance businesses.\n\n## Note 12: Climate risk\n\nStorebrand is exposed to climate risk. This risk is not only commercial, but also applies to investments, including property, and the insurance liabilities. Both physical climate change and risks associated with the transition to low emissions may have an impact. For Storebrand, the transition risk is of the greatest importance, particularly in the short and medium term. A rapid transition to low emissions could impact the Norwegian economy in general and the fossil fuel sector in particular. This could result in an increased disability frequency and lower interest rates that increase insurance liabilities. For investments, the effect of climate risk is difficult to differentiate from other factors that influence financial market developments.\n\nReference is made to further descriptions of climate risk in the annual report under the chapter 'Climate risks and opportunities'.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 13: Valuation of /financial instruments and properties\n\nThe Group conducts a comprehensive process to ensure that financial instruments are valued as closely as possible to their market value. Publicly listed financial instruments are valued on the basis of the official closing price on stock exchanges, supplied by Reuters and Bloomberg. Fund units are generally valued at the updated official NAV prices when such prices exist. Bonds are generally valued based on prices collected from Nordic bond pricing and Bloomberg. Bonds that are not regularly quoted will normally be valued using recognised theoretical models. This principally applies to bonds denominated in Norwegian kroner. Discount rates composed of the swap rates plus a credit premium are used as a basis for these types of valuations. The credit premium will most often be specific to the issuer.\n\nUnlisted derivatives, such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, are also valued theoretically. Money market rates, swap rates and exchange rates that form the basis for valuations are supplied by Reuters and Bloomberg. The valuations of currency options and swaptions are provided by Markit.\n\nThe Group carries out continual checks to safeguard the quality of market data that has been collected from external sources. This involves controlling and assessing the likelihood of unusual changes.\n\nThe Group categorises financial instruments valued at fair value on three different levels, which are described in more detail below. The levels express the differing degrees of liquidity and different measurement methods used. The company has established valuation models to gather information from a wide range of well-informed sources with a view to minimising the uncertainty of valuations.\n\n## Level 1: Financial instruments valued on the basis of quoted prices for identical assets in active markets\n\nThis category encompasses listed equities that over the previous three months have experienced average daily trading equivalent to approximately NOK 20 million or more. Based on this, the equities are regarded as sufficiently liquid to be included at this level. Bonds, certificates or equivalent instruments issued by national governments in local currencies are generally classified as level 1. When it comes to derivatives, standardised stock index futures and interest rate futures will also be included at this level.\n\n## Level 2: Financial instruments valued on the basis of observable market information not covered by level 1\n\nThis category encompasses financial instruments that are valued on the basis of market information that can be directly observable or indirectly observable. Market information that is indirectly observable means that the prices can be derived from observable related markets. Level 2 includes shares or equivalent equity instruments for which market prices are available, but where the volume of transactions is too limited to fulfil the criteria in level 1. Shares in this level will normally have been traded during the last month. Bonds and equivalent instruments are generally classified in this level. Moreover, interest rate and foreign exchange swaps, as well as non-standardised interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives are classified as level 2. Fund investments, including hedge funds but excluding other alternative investment funds, are generally classified as level 2.\n\n## Level 3: Financial instruments valued on the basis of information that is not observable in accordance with level 2\n\nEquities classified as level 3 are primarily investments in unlisted/private companies as well as funds consisting of these. These include investments in forestry, microfinance, infrastructure and property. Private equity is generally classified at this level through direct investments or investments in funds. Private customer loans and funds consisting of these are also at level 3.\n\nThe types of mutual funds classified as level 3 are discussed in more detail below with a reference to the type of mutual fund and the valuation method. Storebrand is of the opinion that the valuation method used represents a best estimate of the mutual fund's market value.\n\n## Equities\n\nForestry represents most of the value of the level 3 shares. An external valuation was carried out as at 31 December which forms the basis for the valuation of the company's investments. The valuation is based on models that include non-observable assumptions.\n\nFor alternative investments organised as limited liability companies, equity investments are valued based on the value-adjusted equity reported by external sources when available.\n\nIn the case of private equity investments, the valuation is normally based on either the most recent transaction or a model in which a company that is in continuous operation is assessed by comparing the key figures with groups of equivalent listed companies.",

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Units\n\nOf the fund units, it is private equity investments that represent the majority at level 3. Moreover, there are also some other types of funds, such as infrastructure funds and microfinance funds, loan funds and property funds here. The majority of Storebrand's private equity investments are investments in private equity funds. These fund investments are valued based on the value reported by the funds. Most of the funds report on a quarterly basis, while a few report less often. Reporting typically takes place with a few months' delay. The most recently received valuations are used as a basis, adjusted for cash flows and market effects in the period from the most recent valuation until the reporting date. For private equity, the market effect is calculated based on the development in value in the relevant index, multiplied by the estimated beta in relation to this index.\n\n## Loans to customers\n\nThe value of fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting the agreed cash flows over the remaining maturity by the current discount rate adjusted for market spread. The discount rate that is used is based on a swap interest rate (mid swap) with a maturity that corresponds to the remaining lock-in period for the underlying loans. The market spread that is used on the balance sheet date is determined by assessing the market conditions, market price and the associated swap interest rate. However, the fair value of loans to corporate customers with margin loans is lower than the amortised cost because certain loans run with lower margins than they would have done if they had been taken up as of the end of 2021. The value shortfall is calculated by discounting the difference between the agreed margin and the current market price over the remaining duration.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nBonds are normally not priced at level 3, but if the loan is in default and a payment is expected, these are priced based on the expected payment. As at 31 December 2021, this was not a significant amount for Storebrand's financial statements.\n\n## Investment properties\n\nThe investment properties primarily consist of office buildings located in Oslo and Stockholm and shopping centres in Southern Norway.\n\nOffice properties and shopping centres in Norway:\n\nThe required rate of return is of greatest importance when calculating the fair value for investment properties. An individual required rate of return is determined for each property. The knowledge available about the market's required rate of return, including transactions and appraisals, is used when determining the cash flow.\n\nThe required rate of return is divided into the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk-free interest\n- \u00b7 Risk premium, adjusted for:\n- \u00b7 Type of property\n- \u00b7 Location\n- \u00b7 Structural standard\n- \u00b7 Environmental standard\n- \u00b7 Duration of the contract\n- \u00b7 Quality of tenant\n- \u00b7 Other factors such as transactions and perception in the market, vacancy and general knowledge about the market and the individual property.\n\nWhen calculating fair value, Storebrand uses internal cash flow models. Net cash flows for the individual property are discounted by an individual required rate of return. A future income and expense picture for the first 10 years has been estimated for the office properties and a final value has been calculated for the end of the 10th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property. A future income and expense picture for the first 6 years has been estimated for the shopping centre properties and a final value has been calculated for the end of the 6th year based on market rent and normal operating costs for the property.  In both models, the net income stream has been taken into consideration for existing and future loss of income due to vacancy, necessary investments and an assessment of the future development in the market rent. The majority of new contracts that are entered into have a duration of five or ten years for offices (three to five years for trading). The cash flows from the lease agreements (contractual rent) are included in the valuations. To estimate the long-term, future non-contractual rental incomes, a forecasting model has been developed. The office model is based on the rental price overview from Arealstatistikk, as well as data and observations from brokers. A long-term, time-weighted average of the annual observations is calculated in which the oldest observations are weighted with the lowest importance. For non-contractual rent in the short-term, the current rental prices and market situation are used. For trading, the forecast is based on the development of the shopping centre.",

Appendix\n\n## External valuation:\n\nFor properties in the Norwegian business, a methodical approach is taken to a selection of properties that are to be externally valued each quarter so that all properties have had an external valuation at least every three years. In 2021, external valuations were obtained for properties worth NOK 24.6 billion (98 per cent of the portfolio's value as at 31 December 2021).\n\nFor quality control and updating of the internal model, external valuations shall be obtained each quarter from reputable appraisers to verify the value that appears when using the internal model. When obtaining such valuations, the individual appraiser's routines for valuations, including collection of information, inspections etc., shall apply. External valuations shall be rotated in such a way that all segments are regularly appraised. The task of valuing investment properties shall be rotated between reputable appraisers within a reasonable time interval, and knowledge of the property must be taken into consideration. In the event of a discrepancy between the valuation and value obtained using the internal model, the model shall be used as long as the discrepancy is within what is discretionarily considered to be best practice in the market. If there is a discrepancy of more than 5% between the internal and external valuation, the discrepancy shall be reported and the grounds for this provided in the valuation memorandum/valuation item memorandum that is presented to the Board of Storebrand Livsforsikring AS.\n\nExternal valuations are obtained for properties in the Swedish business. Shopping centres and commercial premises are valued annually, while other wholly-owned property investments are valued on a quarterly basis.\n\n## VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO AMORTISED COST\n\n| NOK million                                   | Level 1 Quoted prices   | Level 1 Observable  assumptions   | Level 1 Non-  observable  assumptions   | T o t a l                 fair value  31.12.21   | Book  value    31.12.21   | T o t a l                 fair value  31.12.20   | Book  value    31.12.20   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Financial assets                              |                         |                                   |                                         |                                                  |                           |                                                  |                           |\n| Loans to and due from financial  institutions |                         | 67                                |                                         | 67                                               | 67                        | 103                                              | 103                       |\n| Loans to customers -

Forestry investments are characterised by, among other things, very long cash flow periods. There can be some uncertainty associated with future cash flows due to future income and costs growth, even though these assumptions are based on recognised sources. Nonetheless, valuations of forestry investments will be particularly sensitive to the discount rate used in the estimate. The company bases its valuation on external valuations. These utilise an estimated market-related required rate of return.\n\n|                                   | Change in value at change in discount rate   | Change in value at change in discount rate   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| NOK million                       | Increase + 25 bp                             | Decrease - 25 bp                             |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.21 | -11                                          | 10                                           |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.20 | -12                                          | 11                                           |\n\n## Fund units\n\nLarge portions of the portfolio are private equity funds invested in companies priced  against comparable listed companies The valuation of the private equity portfolio will thus be sensitive to fluctuations in global equity markets. The private equity portfolio has an estimated Beta relative to the MSCI World (Net - currency hedged to NOK) of around 0.54.\n\n|                                   | Change MSCI World   | Change MSCI World   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| NOK million                       | Increase + 10 %     | Decrease - 10 %     |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.21 | 861                 | -861                |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.20 | 430                 | -430                |\n\nThe valuation of indirect property investments will be sensitive to a change in the required rate of return and the expected future cash flow.  Remaining indirect property investments are no longer leveraged.",

They are not priced based on a discount rate as bonds normally are, and these investments are therefore included in the same sensitivity test as private equity.\n\n|                                   | Change MSCI World   | Change MSCI World   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| NOK million                       | Increase + 10 %     | Decrease - 10 %     |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.21 |                     |                     |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.20 | 15                  | -15                 |\n\n## Properties\n\nThe sensitivity assessment for properties includes investments properties.\n\nThe valuation of property is particularly sensitive to a change in the required rate of return and the expected future cash flow. A change of 0.25 per cent in the required rate of return where everything else remains unchanged will result in a change in the value of Storebrand's property portfolio of approximately 5.5 per cent. In the order of 25 percent of the property's cash flow is linked to lease agreeements entered into. This means that the changes in the uncertain parts of the cash flow by 1 per cent will result in a change in value of 0.70 to 0.75 per cent.\n\n| NOK million                       | Change in required rate of return 0.25 %   | -0.25 %   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.21 | -2,128                                     | 2,401     |\n| Change in fair value per 31.12.20 | -1,827                                     | 2,041     |",

Appendix\n\n## Note 14: Solidity and capital management\n\nThe Storebrand Group is an insurance-dominated, cross-sectoral financial group with capital requirements in accordance with Solvency II. Storebrand calculates Solvency II according to the standard method as defined in the Solvency II Regulations.\n\nConsolidation is carried out in accordance with Section 18-2 of the Norwegian Act relating to Financial Undertakings and Financial Groups. The solvency capital requirement and minimum capital requirement for the group are calculated in accordance with Section 46 (1)-(3) of the Solvency II Regulations using the standard method.\n\n## Capital management\n\nStorebrand places particular emphasis on continually and systematically adapting the levels of equity in the Group. The level is adapted to the financial risk and capital requirements in the business, where growth and the composition of segments are important motivating factors for the need for capital. The purpose of capital management is to ensure an efficient capital structure and provide for an appropriate balance between in-house goals and regulatory and rating company requirements. If there is a need for new capital, this is raised by the holding company Storebrand ASA, which is listed on the stock exchange and is the ultimate parent company.\n\nThe Storebrand companies are subject to various capital requirements depending on the type of business. In addition to the capital requirements for the Storebrand Group and insurance companies, the banking and asset management businesses have capital requirements in accordance with CRD IV. The companies in the group governed by CRD IV are included in the group's solvency capital and solvency capital requirements with their respective primary capital and capital requirements.\n\nStorebrand has the goal of paying a dividend of more than 50% of the Group profit after tax. The board has the ambition of ordinary dividends per share being, at a minimum, at the same nominal level as the previous year. The normal dividend is paid with a sustainable solvency margin of more than 150%. If there is a solvency margin of more than 180%, the board's intention is to propose extraordinary dividends or share buy-backs. In general, equity in the Group can be controlled without material limitations if the capital requirement is met and the respective legal entities have sufficient solvency.\n\n## SOLVENCY CAPITAL\n\n| NOK million                                                                | Total   | Group 1  unlimited   | 31.12.21 Group 1  limited   | Group  2   | Group  3   | 31.12.20 Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------------|\n| Share capital                                                              | 2,360   | 2,360                |                             |            |            | 2,339            |\n| Share premium                                                              | 10,842  | 10,842               |                             |            |            | 10,521           |\n| Reconciliation reserve                                                     | 28,711  | 28,711               |                             |            |            | 31,851           |\n| Including the effect of the transitional arrangement                       |         |                      |                             |            |            | 4,815            |\n| Counting subordinated loans                                                | 10,860  |                      | 2,002                       | 8,857      |            | 8,734            |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                        | 356     |                      |                             |            | 356        | 247              |\n| Risk equalisation reserve                                                  | 616     |                      |                             | 616        |            | 438              |\n| Deductions for CRD IV subsidiaries                                         | -3,728  | -3,728               |                             |            |            | -3,006           |\n| Expected dividend                                                          | -1,645  | -1,645               |                             |            |            | -1,519           |\n| Total basic solvency capital                                               | 48,369  | 36,538               | 2,002                       | 9,473      | 356        | 49,605           |\n| Subordinated capital for subsidiaries regulated in  accordance with CRD IV | 3,728   |                      |                             |            |            | 3,006            |\n| Total solvency capital                                                     | 52,098  |                      |                             |            |            | 52,611           |\n| Total solvency capital available to cover the  minimum capital requirement | 40,688  | 36,538               | 2,002                       | 2,148      |            | 43,533           |",

In a multi-sectoral financial group, all the capital requirements of the CRD IV companies are calculated based on their respective applicable requirements, including buffer requirement for the largest company in the Group (Storebrand Bank). This increases the total requirement from the CRD IV companies in relation to what is included in the Solvency II calculation. As at 31 December 2021, the difference amounted to NOK 181 million.",

In a defined-contribution scheme, the company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the defined-contribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the defined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the defined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- -Saving starts from the first krone of salary.\n- -Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 106,399 at 31 December 2021)\n- -In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved.\n- -Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent.\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of financial position. The scheme is financed by means of an annual premium that is defined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.5 % in 2021.\n\nThere are also pension liabilities for the defined-benefit scheme related to direct pensions for certain former employees and former board members.\n\nThe pension plan for employees at SPP in Sweden follows the plan for bank employees in Sweden (BTP).\n\nSPP has a defined-contribution occupational pension known as BTP1. All new employees were enrolled in this pension agreement from and including 1 January 2014. In BTP1, the employer pays a premium for pension savings that is calculated based on pensionable salary up to 30 times the 'basic income amount' (inkomstbasbelopp). The insurance includes retirement pension with or without mortality inheritance, disability pension and children's pension. The premium is calculated independently of age and is calculated primarily based on the monthly salary. The premium is paid monthly in two parts, a fixed part that is 2.5 per cent of the pensionable salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount'. The optional part of the premium is 2 per cent of salary up to and including 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' and 30 per cent of salary between 7.5 and 30 times the 'basic income amount'.\n\nThe pension in the BTP2 agreement (defined-benefit occupational pension that is a closed scheme) amounts to 10 per cent of the annual salary up to 7.5 times the 'basic income amount' (which was SEK 68,200 in 2021 and will be SEK 71.000 in 2022), 65 per cent of salary in the interval from 7.5 to 20, and 32.5 per cent in the interval from 20 to 30. No retirement pension is paid for the portion of salary in excess of 30 times the 'basic income amount'. Full pension entitlement is reached after 30 years of membership in the pension scheme. In addition to the defined-benefit part, the BTP plan has a smaller defined-contribution component. Here the employees can decide themselves how assets are to be invested (traditional insurance or unit-linked insurance). The defined-contribution part is 2 per cent of the annual salary.\n\nThe retirement age for SPP's CEO is 65 years. The CEO is covered by BTP1. In addition, the CEO has a defined-contribution based additional pension with SPP. The premium for this insurance is 20 per cent of salary that exceeds 30 times the 'basic income amount'.",

Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Financial assumptions:\n\nThe financial assumptions have been determined on the basis of the regulations in IAS 19. Long-term assumptions such as future inflation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\n- In Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpecific company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the financial assumptions.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions:\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway. With effect from 2014 a new mortality basis, K2013, has been introduced for group pension insurance in life insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions in Sweden follow the industry's mutual mortality table DUS14 adjusted for corporate differences. The average employee turnover rate is estimated to be 4 per cent p.a.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis pension calculations\n\nStorebrand's risk associated with the pension scheme relates to the changes in the financial and actuarial assumptions that must be used in the calculations and the actual return on the pension funds. The pension liabilities are particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate. A reduction of the discount rate will in isolation entail an increase in pension liabilities.\n\nFor the Norwegian companies that have converted to defined contribution pensions as of 1 January 2015, the sensitivity has not been calculated, and the figures below illustrate the sensitivity for the Swedish companies.\n\nThe following estimates are based on facts and circumstances as of 31 December 2021 and are calculated for each individual when all other assumptions are kept constant.\n\n## SWEDEN\n\n|                                  | Discount rate   |        | Expected  earnings growth   | Expected  earnings growth   | Expected annual increase  in pensions payment   | Mortality - change in  expected life expectancy   | Mortality - change in  expected life expectancy   | Mortality - change in  expected life expectancy   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                  | 1.0 %           | -1.0 % | 1.0 %                       | -1.0 %                      | 1.0 %                                           |                                                   | + 1 \u00e5r                                            | - 1 \u00e5r                                            |\n| Percentage change in pension:    |                 |        |                             |                             |                                                 |                                                   |                                                   |                                                   |\n| - Pension liabilities            | -8 %            | 10 %   | -2 %                        | -4 %                        | 0 %                                             | 0 %                                               | 2 %                                               | -2 %                                              |\n| - The period's net pension costs | -10 %           | 13 %   | 5 %                         | -4 %                        | 0 %                                             | 0 %                                               | 1 %                                               | -1 %                                              |",

The real estate investments are made on behalf of the customer assets. Each real estate is owned by a separate investment company, and a sale of real estate itself would entail a tax expense that will reduce the return on the customer assets and will not affect the income tax for SPP / Storebrand. The deferred tax is in the consolidated financial reporting recognised as a claim on the customer funds and will not affect the income tax expense for SPP / Storebrand. Deferred tax relating to real estate investments in the customer assets is not netted against other temporary differences in the balance sheet.\n\n2) The effective tax rate is influenced by the fact that the Group has operations in countries with tax rates that are different from Norway. The income tax expense is also influenced by tax effects relating to previous years. The tax rate for companies in Norway is 22 per cent. For companies subject to financial tax is the tax rate 25 per cent. The Storebrand Group includes companies that are both subject to and not subject to the financial tax. Therefore, when capitalising deferred tax/deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements, the company tax rate that applies for the individual companies is used (22 or 25 per cent). The tax rate for companies in Sweden was changed to 20.6 per cent for 2021, from 21.4 per cent in 2020.\n\n## TAX EXPENSES ON OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ELEMENTS\n\n| NOK million                                                                      |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Tax on other comprehensive income elements not to be reclassified to profit/loss |      8 |     15 |\n| Total tax expenses on other comprehensive income elements                        |      8 |     15 |",

In some cases, Storebrand and the Norwegian Tax Administration have had different interpretations of the tax rules and associated transitional rules. As a result of this, uncertain tax positions arise in connection with the recognised tax expenses. Whether or not the uncertain tax positions have to be recognised in the financial statements is assessed in accordance with IAS 12 and IFRIC 23. Uncertain tax positions will only be recognised in the financial statements if the company considers it to be probable that the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation will be accepted in a court of law. Significant uncertain tax positions are described below.\n\nA. In 2015, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS discontinued the Norwegian subsidiary, Storebrand Eiendom Holding AS, with a tax loss of approximately NOK 6.5 billion and a corresponding increase in the tax loss carryforward. In January 2018, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS received notice of an adjustment to the tax returns for 2015 which claimed that the calculated loss was excessive but provided no further quantification. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS disagrees with the arguments that were put forward and submitted its response to the Norwegian Tax Administration on 2 March 2018. The notice was unclear, but based on the notice, a provision was made in the 2017 annual financial statements for an uncertain tax position of approximately NOK 1.6 billion related to the former booked tax loss (appears as a reduction in the loss carryforward and, in isolation, gave an associated increased tax expense for 2017 of approximately NOK 0.4 billion). In May 2019, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS received a draft decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration claiming changes in the tax return from 2015. Storebrand disagrees with the notice from the Norwegian Tax Administration and submitted its response in October 2019. In March 2021 Storebrand received a decision from the Norwegian Tax Administration based on similar grounds as the ones outlined in the draft decision. Storebrand continues to disagree with the view of the Norwegian Tax Administration in this case and has in May 2021 challenged the decision to the Norwegian Tax Appeals Committee. Storebrand considers it to be probable that Storebrand's understanding of the tax legislation will be accepted by the Tax Appeals Committee or a court of law, and thus, no additional uncertain tax position has been recognised in the financial statements based on the received decision. If the Norwegian Tax Administration's position is accepted, Storebrand estimates that a tax expense for the company of approximately NOK 1.2 billion will arise. There will also be negative effects for returns on customer assets after tax. The effects are based on best estimates and following a review with external expertise.",

These rules contained transitional rules for how the companies should revalue/ write-down the tax values as at 31 December 2018. In December 2018, the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes published an interpretive statement that Storebrand does not consider to be in accordance with the wording of the relevant act. When presenting the national budget for 2020 in October 2019, the Ministry of Finance proposed a clarification of the wording of the transitional rules in line with the interpretive statement from the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes. The clarification was approved by the Norwegian Parliament in December 2019. Storebrand considers there to be uncertainty regarding the value such subsequent work on a legal rule has as a source of law, and which in this instance only applies for a previous financial year. In the tax return for 2018, Storebrand Livsforsikring AS applied the wording in the original transitional rule. However, in October 2019 Storebrand received a notice of adjustment of tax assessment in line with the interpretive statement from the Norwegian Directorate of Taxes and the clarification from the Ministry of Finance. Storebrand Livsforsikring AS disagrees with the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation but considers it uncertain as to whether the company's interpretation will be accepted if the case is decided by a court of law. The uncertain tax position has therefore been recognised in the financial statements. Based on our revised best estimate, the difference between Storebrand's interpretation and the Norwegian Tax Administration's interpretation is approximately NOK 6.4 billion in an uncertain tax position. If Storebrand's interpretation is accepted, a deferred tax expense of approximately NOK 1.6 billion will be derecognised from the financial statements..\n\nC. The outcome of the interpretation of tax rules for group contributions referred to above under (A) will have an impact when calculating the effect from the transitional rules for the new tax rules referred to under point (B). An equivalent interpretation to that described under (A) has been used as a basis in the financial statements when calculating tax input values on property shares owned by customer assets for 2016 and 2017. There is thus an uncertain tax position relating to the effect from the transitional rules described in (B). This effect will depend on the interpretation and outcome of (A). If Storebrand's position is accepted under (A), Storebrand will recognise an additional tax income of approximately NOK 0.8 billion if Storebrand's position under (B) is accepted. If the Norwegian Tax Administration prevails with its argument under point (A), Storebrand will recognise a tax expense of approximately NOK 0.6 billion.\n\nStorebrand has reviewed the uncertain tax positions as part of the annual reporting process. The review has not reduced the company's assessment of the probability that Storebrand's interpretation will be accepted in a court of law. The timeline for the continued process with the Norwegian Tax Appeals Committee is unclear, but if necessary, Storebrand will seek clarification from the court of law for the aforementioned uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Note 28: Intangible assets and fair value adjustments on purchased insurance contracts\n\n|                                          | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets   | Intangible assets        |          |         |         |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------|---------|---------|\n| NOK million                              | IT systems          | VIF  1)             | Other intangible  assets | Goodwill | 2021    | 2020    |\n| Acquisition cost 01.01,                  | 1,454               | 10,602              | 1,811                    | 2,552    | 16,419  | 14,901  |\n| Additions in the period                  |                     |                     |                          |          |         |         |\n| - Developed internally                   | 60                  |                     |                          |          | 60      | 105     |\n| - Purchased separately                   | 183                 |                     | 7                        |          | 191     | 200     |\n| - Purchased via acquistion/merger        | 27                  |                     | 459                      | 581      | 1,067   | 14      |\n| Disposals in the period                  | -8                  |                     |                          |          | -8      | -10     |\n| Exchange rate adjustments                | -23                 | -679                | -51                      | -64      | -817    | 1,209   |\n| Acquisition cost 31.12                   | 1,693               | 9,923               | 2,227                    | 3,069    | 16,912  | 16,419  |\n| Accumulated depreciation and write-downs |                     |                     |                          |          |         |         |\n| 01.01                                    | -708                | -7,954              | -1,149                   | -305     | -10,116 | -8,681  |\n| Write-downs in the period                | -23                 |                     |                          |          | -23     | -22     |\n| Amortisation in the period  2)           | -162                | -365                | -162                     |          | -689    | -592    |\n| Disposals in the period                  | 5                   |                     |                          |          | 5       | 7       |\n| Exchange rate adjustments                | 3                   | 527                 | 47                       |          | 577     | -828    |\n| Acc. depreciation and write-downs 31.12  | -884                | -7,792              | -1,264                   | -305     | -10,245 | -10,116 |\n| Book value 31.12                         | 809                 | 2,131               | 963                      | 2,764    | 6,667   | 6,303   |\n\n1) Value of business-in-force, the difference between market value and book value of the insurance liabilities in SPP and Silver",

Livsforsikring AS acquired SPP Pension & F\u00f6rs\u00e4kring AB and its subsidiaries (SPP).  The majority of the intangible assets linked to the acquisition of SPP include the value of business in force (VIF), for which liability adequacy tests are conducted in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 4. To determine whether goodwill and other intangible assets linked to SPP have declined in value, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount by calculating the entity specific value of the business. SPP is considered to be a separate cash flow generating unit.",

When calculating the terminal value, a growth rate equivalent to observed inflation of 1.7 per cent is used. This is lower than Riksbanken's inflation target of 2.0 per cent, but is consistent with the risk-free interest rate used in the required rate of return. The primary drivers of improved long-term results will be the return on total assets, underlying inflation and wage growth in the market (which drive premium growth). In addition to cash flows from the forecasted result, the change in expected regulatory tying-up of capital is also used in the valuation. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 6.7 per cent. The required rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added to a premium that reflects the risk of the business.\n\nCalculations related to the future are uncertain. The value will be impacted by various growth parameters, expected return and the required rate of return used as a basis, etc. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the recoverable amount, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulation using reasonable assumptions indicates a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the banking business\n\nWhen calculating the utility value for the banking business, a cash flow based assessment of value has been made using the expected profit after taxes. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years are used as the basis for the valuation. The cash flow is based on two elements, profit/loss to equity and change in expected regulatory tying-up of capital. It is also assumed that all capital in addition to regulatory tied-up capital, can be withdrawn at the end of each period. The management has made assessments for the period from 2025 to 2031, and the annual growth has been determined in the income statement. A growth rate of 1.8 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is lower than Norges Bank's inflation target, but consistent with the risk-free interest rate used in the required rate of return. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 5.2 per cent. The required rate of return is calculated based on the risk-free interest rate and added to a premium that reflects the risk of the business.\n\nThere will be uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be affected by the assumptions for the interest rate margin, expected losses on lending, growth parameters and capital requirements, as well as what required rate of return is assumed, etc. It is noted that the aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the utility value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Skagen\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Skagen AS in 2017. The intangible assets linked to Skagen are customer lists, branded products, technology and goodwill. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years  are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2025 to 2026, a growth rate in line with the equity market for the income and a constant ratio between income and expenses were used as a basis. A growth rate of 1.8 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is lower than Norges Bank's inflation target, but consistent with the risk-free interest rate used in the required rate of return. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return of 6.7 per cent.\n\n.\n\nThere are uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be influenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the discount rate. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the entity specific value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.\n\n## Intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Cubera Private Equity\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Cubera Private Equity AS in 2019. The intangible assets linked to Cubera are customer lists, customer relations and database over the private equity market. Budgets and forecasts approved by the Board for the next three years  are used as the basis for the valuation. For the period from 2025 to 2026, a projected forecast has been used that is based on the expected development in the private equity market. A growth rate of 1.8 per cent is used when calculating the terminal value. This is lower than Norges Bank's inflation target, but consistent with the risk-free interest rate used in the required rate of return. The utility value is calculated using a required rate of return after tax of 6.7 per cent.\n\nThere are uncertainty related to the assumptions that have been made in the valuation. The value will be influenced by changes in the assumptions regarding expected returns of the financial markets, costs, management fees, growth parameters, and the required rate of return that is used as the discount rate. The aim of the calculations is to achieve a satisfactory level of certainty that the entity specific value, cf. IAS 36, is not lower than the value recognised in the accounts. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value.",

The intangible assets linked to the acquisition of Silver include the value of business in force (VIF), which is included in Storebrand Livsforsikring's liability adequacy test in accordance with the requirements in IFRS 4. Silver has been integrated into Storebrand Livsforsikring's business and is predominantly part of the savings segment. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the entity specific value of the business. The assessment of the intangible assets is done by estimating the value of the contracts that were purchased, despite these not being a separate cash-generating unit. In order to determine whether there has been impairment that is less than the book values, the parameters used in the valuation and acquisition analysis are assessed. A comparison is also made with the development of expected values used in the valuation upon acquisition.\n\nThe value will be influenced by the assumptions regarding expected returns in the financial markets, costs, transfers, income development and the discount rate.  Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value, cf. IAS 36.\n\n## knyIntangible assets related to the purchase of customer portfolio from Insr\n\nIn 2020, Storebrand Forsikring AS entered into an agreement to acquire a customer portfolio from Insr Insurance Group ASA. The policies were renewed in Storebrand's systems during 2020 and 2021, and the intangible asset was accrued based on actual renewals, cf. IAS 38. The customer portfolio from Insr is integrated into Storebrand's business and primarily Storebrand Forsikring AS and the Insurance segment. The recoverable amount is determined by calculating the utility value of the business. It is considered most accurate to estimate the value of the contracts that were acquired, despite these not being a separate cashflow generating unit. In order to determine whether there has been impairment that is less than the book values, the parameters used in the valuation and acquisition analysis are assessed. A comparison is also made with the development of expected values used in the valuation upon the entering into of the agreement to acquire the customer portfolio.\n\nThe utility value will be influenced by the assumption of profitability and claims ratio, customer loss, and the required rate of return that is used. Simulations with reasonable and also conservative assumptions indicate a value that justifies the book value, cf. IAS 36.\n\n## Intangible assets related to the acquisition of Capital Investment\n\nStorebrand Asset Management AS acquired Capital Investment in 2021. See Note 3 for the acquisition analysis. This acquisition analysis is still considered to be the best estimate of the value of Capital Investment and further calculations have not been carried out as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Note 29: Tangible /fixed assets and lease agreements\n\n| NOK million      |   Vehicles/ equipment | Real estate   |   2021 |   2020 |\n|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Book value 01.01 |                    59 | 2             |     60 |     49 |\n| Additions        |                    24 | 1             |     24 |     20 |\n| Disposals        |                    -2 |               |     -2 |     -2 |\n| Depreciation     |                    -7 |               |     -7 |     -7 |\n| Book value 31.12 |                    73 | 2             |     75 |     60 |\n\nFor specifiaction of write-downs and depreciation, see note 20.\n\n| Depreciation plan and financial lifetime:   | Straight line   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Vehicles/equipment                          | 3-10 years      |\n| Fixtures & fittings                         | 3-8 years       |\n| Properties                                  | 15 years        |",

The Group has decided not to recognise leases when the underlying asset has a low value and therefore does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for any of these leases. Instead, the lease payments are expensed as they are incurred. The Group also does not recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases of less than 12 months.\n\n## Depreciations lease agreements\n\nLease agreements for right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## NON-DISCOUNTED LEASE LIABILITIES\n\n| NOK million                                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Year 1                                        | 144    | 145    |\n| Year 2                                        | 126    | 141    |\n| Year 3                                        | 114    | 112    |\n| Year 4                                        | 113    | 108    |\n| Year 5                                        | 113    | 107    |\n| After 5 years                                 | 651    | 793    |\n| Total non-discounted lease liabilities 31.12. | 1,260  | 1,406  |",

In consequence of other investors in the funds being able to request redemption of their ownership interests from the respective funds, such are deemed to be minority interests that are classified as liabilities in Storebrand's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SPECIFICATION OF ASSOCIATED COMPANIES AND JOINT VENTURES CLASSIFED AS SUBSTANTIAL (100% FIGURES)\n\n| NOK million                | 2021 Storebrand Helseforsikring AS   | 2020 Storebrand Helseforsikring AS   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Accounting method          | Equity-method                        | Equity-method                        |\n| Type of operation          | Insurance                            | Insurance                            |\n| Type of interest           | Joint venture                        | Joint venture                        |\n| Current assets             | 748                                  | 694                                  |\n| Fixed assets               | 120                                  | 121                                  |\n| Short term liabilities     | 89                                   | 74                                   |\n| Long term liabilities      | 451                                  | 446                                  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents  | 26                                   | 34                                   |\n| Income                     | 937                                  | 862                                  |\n| Result after tax           | 35                                   | 67                                   |\n| Total comprehensive income | 35                                   | 67                                   |",

The average effective interest rate for total holdings is calculated using the individual security's share of fair value as a weighting. Interest derivatives are included in the calculation of modified duration and average effective interest rate.\n\n## Note 38: Derivatives\n\n## Nominal volume\n\nFinancial derivatives are related to underlying amounts which are not recognised in the statement of financial position. In order to quantify the scope of the derivatives, reference is made to amounts described as the underlying nominal principal, nominal volume, etc. Nominal volume is arrived at differently for different classes of derivatives, and provides some indication of the size of the position and risk the derivative presents.\n\nGross nominal volume principally indicates the size of the exposure, while net nominal volume provides some indication of the risk exposure. However , nominal volume is not a measure which necessarily provides a comparison of the risk represented by different types of derivatives. Unlike gross nominal volume, the calculation of net nominal volume also takes into account which direction of market risk exposure the instrument represents by differentiating between long (asset) positions and short (liability) positions.\n\nA long position in an equity derivative produces a gain in value if the share price increases.  For interest rate derivatives, a long position produces a gain if interest rates fall, as is the case for bonds. For currency derivatives, a long position results in a positive change in value if the relevant exchange rate strengthens against the NOK. Average gross nominal volume are based on daily calculations of gross nominal volume.\n\n| NOK million                                  | Gross nominal  volume  1)   | Gross booked  value fin. assets   | Gross booked  value fin.  liabilities   | Net amount    2021   | Net amount    2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Interest derivatives                         | 167,367                     | 2,992                             | 675                                     | 2,317                | 5,659                |\n| Currency derivatives                         | 168,575                     | 828                               | 1,373                                   | -545                 | 3,353                |\n| Total derivater 31.12.                       |                             | 3,820                             | 2,048                                   | 1,772                |                      |\n| Total derivater 31.12.20                     |                             | 9,977                             | 964                                     |                      | 9,012                |\n| Distribution between company and  customers: |                             |                                   |                                         |                      |                      |\n| Derivatives - company                        |                             |                                   |                                         | 695                  | 1,275                |\n| Derivatives - customers with guarantee       |                             |                                   |                                         | 1,514                | 5,753                |\n| Derivatives - customers without guarantee    |                             |                                   |                                         | -437                 | 1,984                |\n| Total                                        |                             |                                   |                                         | 1,772                | 9,012                |\n\n- 1) Values 31.12.\n\n## Note 39: Technical insurance reserves - life insurance\n\n## SPECIFICATION OF BUFFER CAPITAL ITEMS CONSERNING LIFE INSURANCE\n\n| NOK million                     | Guaranteed  pension   | Savings   | Insurance  1)   | Total  Storebrand  Group 2021   | Total  Storebrand  Group 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Additional statutory reserves   | 13,602                |           |                 | 13,602                          | 11,380                          |\n| Conditional bonus               | 13,781                |           |                 | 13,781                          | 10,769                          |\n| Market value adjustment reserve | 6,173                 |           | 136             | 6,309                           | 7,170                           |\n| Total buffer capital            | 33,557                |           | 136             | 33,693                          | 29,319                          |",

Appendix\n\n## Note 42 Hedge accounting\n\n## Fair value hedging of interest rate risk and cash flow hedging of foreign exchange risk\n\nStorebrand uses fair value hedging for the interest rate risk. The hedged items are financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through profit or loss.\n\nHedge effectiveness is monitored at an individual security level.\n\nStorebrand uses cash flow hedging for the credit margin. The hedged items are liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value. The proportion of the profit or loss on the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective hedging is recognised in total comprehensive income. The proportion is subsequently reclassified to profit or loss in step with the hedged item's effect on earnings. Hedge effectiveness is 99 per cent  per 31.12.21.\n\n## HEDGING INSTRUMENT/HEDGED ITEM\n\n|                                             | 2021                     | 2021                   | 2021        | 2021   | 2021                                     | 2020                    | 2020                | 2020           | 2020   | 2020                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------|--------|------------------------------------------|\n| NOK millionon                               | Contract/ nominal  value | Book value   1) Assets | Liabilities | Booked | Recog- nised of  compre- hensive  income | Conract/ nominal  value | Book value   Assets | 1) Liabilities | Booked | Recog- nised of  compre- hensive  income |\n| Interest rate swaps                         | 2,374                    | 699                    |             | -4     | -391                                     | 2,557                   | 1,101               |                | 8      | 141                                      |\n| Subordinated loans                          | -1,865                   |                        | 2,685       | -1     | 335                                      | -2,238                  |                     | 3,420          | -2     | -173                                     |\n| Debt raised through  issuance of securities | 480                      |                        | 475         | 5      |                                          | 284                     |                     | 284            | -7     |                                          |\n\n1) Book values as at 31.12.\n\n## Fair value hedging of interest rate risk\n\nStorebrand uses fair value hedging for the interest rate risk. The items hedged are financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost. Derivatives are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are recognised through profit or loss. Hedge effectiveness is monitored at an individual security level. Hedge effectiveness was 90 per cent as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## HEDGING INSTRUMENT/HEDGED ITEM\n\n|                                              | 2021                    | 2021            | 2021            |        |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|\n|                                              |                         | Book value   1) | Book value   1) |        |\n| NOK million                                  | Contract/ nominal value | Assets          | Liabilities     | Booked |\n| Renteswapper                                 | 3 045                   |                 | 158             |        |\n| Ansvarlig l\u00e5nekapital                        | -3 039                  |                 | 2 876           | 2      |\n| Gjeld stiftet ved utstedelse av verdipapirer |                         |                 |                 |        |\n\n## Hedging of net investment in Storebrand Holding AB\n\nIn 2021, Storebrand used cash flow hedging of the foreign exchange risk linked to Storebrand's net investment in Storebrand Holding AB. Three-month rolling currency derivatives were used, and the spot element of these was used as a hedging instrument. The effective share of the hedging instruments is recognised in total comprehensive income. There is partial hedging of the net investment in Storebrand Holding AS and it is therefore expected that the hedge effectiveness in the future will be about 100 per cent. A revenue of NOK 577 million were recognised in total comprehensive income in connection with the hedging of Storebrand Holding AB, compared with an expence of NOK 868 million in 2020.",

The transition to new 'overnight rates' has been demanding for many market players, however the transition has gone better than many feared. From 1 January 2022, LIBOR for USD, GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY will be replaced by new 'overnight rates', SOFR, SONIA, EURSTR, SARON and TONA. The value of some of the LIBOR rates will still be quoted in 2022, however this will only be synthetic for GBP and JPY. The transition to and use of the new official 'overnight rates' will continue in 2022.\n\nFor Storebrand, the process of LIBOR rates being discontinued has not been particularly difficult because exposure to LIBOR rates has been limited. The necessary adaptation of agreements related to EONIA when concerning certain counterparties was completed in Q4 2021. EONIA has been replaced by EURSTR and the stipulated 'fallbacks' which has entailed a continuation of the values based on EONIA. NIBOR and STIBOR, which have the greatest significance to the management of Storebrand's customer portfolios, will be continued until further notice. The same applies to EURIBOR.\n\nStorebrand hedges an exposure in the reference interest rate EURIBOR 3M that is divided among two cross currency swaps in EUR/NOK which has a total nominal amount of EUR 550 million.\n\n## Note 43: Collateral\n\n| NOK million                                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Collateral for Derivatives trading                         | 2,324  | 3,380  |\n| Collateral received in connection with Derivatives trading | -3,077 | -8,828 |\n| Total received and pledged collateral                      | -753   | -5,448 |\n\nThe CSA agreements entered into with 15 counterparties regulate the security that can be used by the parties in OTC contracts that have been entered into. Most of the agreements have a minimum transfer amount of EUR 500,000. Most agreements stipulate that cash in EUR and NOK can be used as security. In some of the agreements, government bonds are also defined as approved security. Interest is calculated based on the NOWA and EONIA rates respectively.\n\nSecurity provided for futures and options is adjusted daily on the basis of a daily margin settlement for each contract.\n\nSecurity is received and provided in the form of both cash and securities.

The loans in Storebrand Boligkreditt AS have been provided as security in connection with the issuing of covered bonds in Storebrand Boligkreditt AS.\n\nStorebrand Boligkreditt AS has over-collateralisation (OC) of 11 per cent. The company must maintain the applicable OC that the rating agency requires if the company wishes to retain the current AAA rating. This requirement was 7.77 per cent at the end of 2021. The statutory OC is 2 per cent. Through commitments from previous prospectuses for covered bond issues, the company is obligated to maintain OC of up to 9.5% until these securities mature. Storebrand Boligkreditt AS has security that is NOK 710 million more than what the present rating requires.

Corporate governance\n- 9. Sustainability Assurance\n- 10. Appendix\n\n## Note 1: Accounting policies\n\nStorebrand ASA is the holding company of the Storebrand Group. The Storebrand Group is engaged in life and P&C insurance, banking and asset management, with insurance being the primary business. The financial statements of Storebrand ASA have accordingly been prepared in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act, generally accepted accounting policies in Norway, and the Norwegian Regulations relating to annual accounts for nonlife insurance companies. Storebrand ASA has used the simplified IFRS provisions in the regulations for recognition and measurement.\n\n## Use of estimates and discretionary assumptions\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, Storebrand has made assumptions and used estimates that affect the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs, as well as the information provided on contingent liabilities. Future events may cause these estimates to change. Such changes will be recognised in the financial statements when there is a sufficient basis for using new estimates. The most important estimates and assessments are related to the valuation of the company's subsidiaries and the assumptions used for pension calculations.\n\n## Classification and valuation policies\n\nAssets intended for permanent ownership and use are classified as fixed assets, and assets and receivables due for payment within one year are classified as current assets. Equivalent policies have been applied to liability items.\n\n## Profit and loss account and statement of financial position\n\nStorebrand ASA is a holding company with subsidiaries in the fields of insurance, banking and asset management. The layout plan in the Regulations relating to annual financial statements for nonlife insurance companies has not been used, a custom layout plan has been used.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries, dividends and group contributions\n\nIn the company's accounts, investments in subsidiaries and associated companies are valued at the acquisition cost less any write-downs. The need to write down is assessed at the end of each accounting period. Storebrand ASA's primary income is the return on capital invested in subsidiaries. Group contributions and dividends received in respect of these investments are therefore recorded as ordinary operating income. Proposed and approved dividends and group contributions from subsidiaries at the end of the year are recognised in the financial statements of Storebrand ASA as income in that financial year.\n\nA prerequisite for recognition is that this is earned equity by a subsidiary. Otherwise, this is recognised as an equity transaction, which means that the ownership interest in the subsidiary is reduced by dividends or group contributions.\n\n## Tangible fixed assets\n\nTangible fixed assets for own use are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. Write-downs are made if the book value exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\n## Pension liabilities for company's own employees\n\nStorebrand ASA have defined-contribution pension, but have some pension obligation that are recorded as defined-benefit pension. The defined-contribution pension scheme involves the company paying an annual contribution to the employees' collective pension savings. The future pension will depend upon the size of the contribution and the annual return on the pension savings. The company does not have any further work-related obligations after the annual contribution has been paid. No provisions are made for ongoing pension liabilities for these types of schemes. Defined-contribution pension schemes are recognised directly in the financial statements.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax cost in the profit and loss account consists of tax payable and changes in deferred tax. Deferred tax and deferred tax assets are calculated on the differences between accounting and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recorded on the balance sheet to the extent it is considered likely that the company will have sufficient taxable profit in the future to make use of the tax asset. Deferred tax is applied directly against equity to the extent that it relates to items that are themselves directly applied against equity.",

Shares held as fixed assets are translated at the exchange rate on the date of acquisition.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nEquities and units\n\nEquities and units are valued at fair value. For securities listed on an exchange or other regulated market, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day immediately prior to or on the balance sheet date.\n\nAny repurchase of own shares is dealt with as an equity transaction, and own shares (treasury stock) are presented as a reduction in equity.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed income securities\n\nBonds and other fixed income securities are included i the statement of financial position from such time the company becomes party to the instrument's contractual terms and conditions. Ordinary purchases and sales of financial instruments are recognised on the transaction date. When a financial asset or a financial liability is initially recognised in the financial statements, it is valued at fair value. Initial recognition includes transaction costs directly related to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset/liability.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to the cash flows from the financial asset expires, or when the company transfers the financial asset to another party in a transaction by which all, or virtually all, the risk and reward associated with ownership of the asset is transferred.\n\n## Bonds and other fixed income securities are recognised at fair value.\n\nFair value is the amount for which an asset could be sold for, or a liability settled with, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. For financial assets that are listed on an exchange or other regulated market place, fair value is determined as the bid price on the last trading day up to and including the balance sheet date, and in the case of an asset that is to be acquired or a liability that is held, the offer price.\n\n## Financial derivatives\n\nFinancial derivatives are recognised at fair value. The fair value of such derivatives is classified as either an asset or a liability with changes in fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Bond funding\n\nBond loans are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The amortised cost includes the transaction costs on the date of issue.\n\n## Note 2:  Income from investments in subsidiaries\n\n| NOK million                    | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Storebrand Livsforsikring AS   | 3,210  | 2,222  |\n| Storebrand Bank ASA            | 238    | 80     |\n| Storebrand Asset Management AS | 948    | 620    |\n| Storebrand Forsikring AS       | 146    | 105    |\n| Storebrand Facilities AS       |        | 1      |\n| Total                          | 4,542  | 3,028  |\n\nGroup contribution from Storebrand ASA, see note 8",

In a defined-contribution scheme, the company allocates an agreed contribution to a pension account. The future pension depends upon the amount of the contributions and the return on the pension account.  When the contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations relating to the defined-contribution pension and the payment to the pension account is charged as an expense on an ongoing basis. For regulatory reasons, there can be no savings in the defined-contribution pension for salaries that exceed 12G (G = National Insurance Scheme basic amount). Storebrand has pension savings in the savings product Extra Pension for employees with salaries exceeding 12G.\n\nThe premiums and content of the defined-contribution pension scheme are as follows:\n\n- -Saving starts from the first krone of salary\n- -Savings rate of 7 per cent of salary from 0 to 12 G (the National Insurance basic amount 'G' was NOK 106,399 as at 31 December 2021)\n- -In addition, 13 per cent of salary between 7.1 and 12 G is saved\n- -Savings rate for salary over 12 G is 20 per cent\n\nThe Norwegian companies participate in the Joint Scheme for Collective Agreement Pensions (AFP). The private AFP scheme provides a lifelong supplement to an ordinary pension and is a multi-employer pension scheme, but there is no reliable information available for inclusion of this liability on the statement of financial position. The scheme is financed by means of an annual premium that is defined as a percentage of salaries from 1 G to 7.1 G, and the premium rate was 2.5 % in 2021.",

Long-term assumptions such as future inflation, real interest rates, real wage growth and adjustment of the basic amount are subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty.\n\nIn Norway, a discount rate based on covered bonds is used. Based on the market and volume trends observed, the Norwegian covered bond market must be perceived as a deep market.\n\nSpecific company conditions including expected direct wage growth are taken into account when determining the financial assumptions.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions:\n\nIn Norway standardised assumptions on rates of mortality and disability as well as other demographic factors are prepared by Finance Norway. With effect from 2014 a new mortality basis, K2013, has been introduced for group pension insurance in life insurance companies and pension funds. Storebrand has used the mortality table K2013BE (best estimate) in the actuarial calculations at 31 December 2021.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited non-audit services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided.\n\nWe have been the auditor of the Company for 4 years from the election by the general meeting of the shareholders on 11 April 2018 for the accounting year 2018.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe group's activities are largely unchanged compared to last year. We have not identified regulatory changes, transactions or other material events that qualified as new key audit matters for our audit of the 2021 financial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nValuation of life insurance liabilities\n\nWe focused on the valuation of the insurance liabilities because it is significant estimates in the financial statements. The estimates involves complex assessment concerning the probability that insured events occurs, and uncertainty related to whether the provisions are sufficient to cover the total liabilities to the policyholders. Small adjustments of the assumptions may have significant impact on the estimates.\n\nThe calculation of the insurance liabilities will to a large extent depend on good quality of data in the insurance system and use of assumptions that are in accordance with regulatory requirements and appropriate industry standards.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2, 7 and 39 in the financial statements where management further describes the insurance liabilities, assumptions and uncertainty of the estimates.\n\nIn our audit we have considered and tested the design and effectiveness of established controls for review of used assumptions and calculation methods, including the company's internal recalculations of the insurance liabilities. We also examined whether management had established effective controls that ensured good data quality for the calculation of the insurance liabilities. This included controls related to data collection, data processing, reconciliation of the insurance systems and IT General Controls relevant for financial reporting. Those controls we elected to base our audit on, was working efficiently.\n\nWe also performed independent calculations for a selection of insurance obligations using our internal actuarial models and compared these with the company's calculations. We used our internal actuaries for this work. The comparison did not indicate any deviations of significance.\n\nWe considered and challenged management's use of key assumptions that the estimated insurance liabilities are based on. We did the same for the method and the models the management used. We used our own internal actuaries for parts of this work. Our findings are that assumptions, methods and models were in",

We particularly examined whether management had established controls to ensure assessment of market rent and discount rate. We found that routines to ensure that these elements regularly were checked against both external valuations and marked data was established. Those controls that we elected to base our audit on, was in our view working efficiently.\n\nWe obtained, read through and understood the internal valuation model. We concluded that the model contains the elements required by the financial reporting framework and therefore is appropriate as a basis for determining fair value on the Group's investment properties. We tested whether, and concluded that the model made mathematically correct calculations.\n\nIn our assessment of the valuation, we challenged the assumptions for expected future cash flows and discount rate by comparing a sample of properties against information from relevant external sources. Substantial changes in value from previous periods was subject to discussions with management. We concluded that assumptions were consistent with information from relevant sources and that explanations regarding substantial changes in value were based on changes in the information from relevant sources. We challenged the management and external valuers on the possible effects from climate risk in setting fair value. We assessed the explanations reasonable.\n\nWe also assessed the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the external valuers. We reviewed the engagement letters with the valuers to assess whether there were any clauses or fee provisions that may have affected their objectivity or in any other way limited their engagement. We did not find any indications of such circumstances.\n\nWe compared the internal valuations against the valuers estimates on values for a sample of properties.\n\n## Valuation of investment properties\n\nThe Group has investment properties that mainly consists of office and retail properties. We have focused on investment property because it represents an estimate and a substantial part of the assets in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\nThese properties are measured at fair value and classified in level 3 according to IFRS 13. Valuation of the properties involves use of assumptions which are subject to management judgement. Important assumptions for the value of individual properties are primarily expected future cash flows and discount rate.\n\nThe basis for management's estimate is an internal valuation model and external valuations. Management obtain observations of market data from various market participants. Management considers reasonableness of their own estimates through obtaining valuations from external valuers for a sample of properties on a continuing basis. The valuers were engaged by management.\n\nRefer to note 1, 2, 13 and 34 in the financial statements for management's further description of investment properties, the methods used and the assumptions the valuations are based on.",

We assessed management's explanations as reasonable.\n\nWe also assessed and came to the conclusion that the information about investment properties in the notes to the financial statements were in accordance with the accounting principles and provides an adequate description of the method and the underlying assumptions that is used for the valuation.\n\nIn our audit we considered design and tested effectiveness of Storebrand's established controls over valuation of financial assets measured at fair value. Particularly we focused on those controls that ensured complete and accurate use of quoted market prices and other observable masterdata, return on investments controls and IT General Controls relevant for financial reporting. In our opinion, the controls that we have chosen to base our audit on are working effectively.\n\nFor financial assets measured through use of models and assumptions that are not observable, we assessed valuation principles, the models and assumptions that were used. We found that the models and assumptions were reasonable and used consistently.\n\nFor a sample of investments, we also tested that fair value was in accordance with external valuations. We considered the reliability of the sources of information, when relevant. Our tests did not reveal substantial deviations.\n\nWe also assessed and found that the information in the notes regarding the Group's valuation principles and fair value determination were sufficient and adequate.\n\nWe have reviewed and challenged management assessment of the uncertain tax positions.

We found that the information meets the requirements in the accounting standards.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the information in the Board of Directors' report. The other information comprises information in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Appendix\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

Appendix\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGood  corporate  governance  is  important  to  ensure  that  an enterprise  can  achieve  its  defined  goals,  including  best  possible utilisation of resources and good value creation. The Storebrand Group (hereinafter referred to as Storebrand) works continuously on improving both the overall decision-making processes and the day-to-day management of the company.\n\nStorebrand's corporate governance principles have been laid down in accordance with the Norwegian Corporate Governance Board's (NUES)  Code  of  Practice.  The  Board  of  Directors  of  Storebrand ASA  (hereafter  referred  to  as  the  Board)  and  management  an annual review of Storebrand's corporate governance policies and compliance  therewith.  Storebrand  reports  in  accordance  with section 3-3b of the Norwegian Accounting Act and the NUES Code of Practice.\n\nStorebrand  publishes  an  integrated  annual  report  presenting financial,  social,  environmental  and  governance  issues  that  are material  for  Storebrand  and  our  stakeholders.  The  materiality analysis can be found on page 19.\n\nStorebrand complies with the Code of Practice without significant deviations  -  with  the  exception  of  a  minor  deviation  in  section  3 below  on  Board  authorisations  to  make  capital  increases  and  to purchase own shares. The discrepancy relates to the fact that it was not facilitated for the general meeting to vote separately on each individual purpose to which the board authorisations apply.\n\n## Statement in line with the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (NUES) of 17 October 2018\n\nThe statement below describes how Storebrand complies with the 15 sections of the NUES Code of Practice.\n\n## 1. Implementation and reporting on corporate governance (no deviations from the code of practice).\n\nThe  Board  has  decided  that  the  Norwegian  Code  of  Practice  for Corporate Governance shall be followed. Compliance with the Code of Practice is discussed in the Directors' Report. Storebrand complies with the Code of Practice without any significant exceptions. One minor deviation has been accounted for below under section 3.\n\n## 2. Business (no deviations from the code of practice).\n\nStorebrand ASA is the parent company in a financial group, and its statutory  object  is  to  manage  its  equity  interests  in  Storebrand's subsidiaries in compliance with the current legislation. Storebrand's main business areas encompass pensions and savings, insurance, and banking. The Articles of Association are available in their entirety on the Storebrand's website www.storebrand.no.\n\nThe market is kept updated on Storebrand's goals, strategies and creation of value through quarterly performance presentations and other  thematic  presentations.  Read  more  about  the  Company's goals and main strategies in the Directors' Report on page 46.\n\nStorebrand aims to be a world-class savings group that delivers better pensions - simple and sustainable. Storebrand's strategy and corporate values are described in the framework 'Our driving force' which represents a common direction for how Storebrand will deliver attractive results to customers and shareholders.\n\nStorebrand's  strategy  is  to  deliver  profitable  growth  within established focus areas through simple and sustainable solutions. The Board conducts ongoing evaluations of the goals, strategy and risk  profile.  More information about 'Our driving force' and focus areas can be found in the section This is Storebrand in the annual report.\n\nSince  1995  Storebrand  has  been  focussed  on  sustainable investments, taking an active position on how both the customers and  their  own  funds  are  invested.  Storebrand  believes  that companies  that  integrate  environmental,  social  and  governance considerations in their business activities reduce risk and create new opportunities for the business activities and capital owners. Our work with sustainable investing is described in detail in the chapter A driving force for sustainable investments in the Director's report above. This  includes  our  principles  for  sustainable  investments,  which are approved by the group board and integrated throughout the group's operations.\n\nStorebrand's sustainability principles summarise how the work is an integral part of the Group's overall objectives and governance and control processes. The principles were updated in 2018 and include all parts of the business, including investments, product development,  procurement,  employee  follow-up  and  house operations.",

Corporate governance\n\nCorporate governance\n\n206\n\nCompanies in the Storebrand Group\n\n214\n\n9. Sustainability Assurance\n\n10. Appendix\n\nThese principles are:\n\n- \u00b7 We  base  our  business  activities  on  the  UN  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n- \u00b7 We help our customers to live more sustainably through the products and services we offer.\n- \u00b7 We are a responsible employer.\n- \u00b7 Our  processes  and  decisions  are  based  on  sustainability outcomes  -  from  the  board  and  management,  who  have the ultimate responsibility, to each employee who promotes sustainability in their respective business area.\n- \u00b7 We  work  with  our  customers,  suppliers,  authorities  and partners to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n- \u00b7 We are transparent about our work on sustainability and the results we achieve.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  adopts  Storebrand'  s  overall  goals  for the work on sustainability, which is in line with these principles. Executive  management  is  responsible  for  realising  the  strategic goals.  An  overall  strategic  goal  in  2021  has  been  to  strengthen sustainability as a competitive advantage. This goal has underlying targets  related  to  our  own  operations,  our  products  and  our external communications. The targets are reviewed by Executive management three times a year and twice a year by the Board.\n\nThrough our materiality analysis, we have defined the Group's focus areas. These are financial capital and investment universe, customer relations, our employees and keeping our house in order. On page 26, 33, 44 and 71, detailed targets and results are presented for all these areas.\n\nStorebrand believes that diversity reinforces the company's relative capacity for value creation. Increased diversity is an important aspect of Storebrand recruitment policy. Storebrand works to maintain and further develop an organization with equality and diversity. For more information see the chapter People in the annual report\n\nStorebrand has its own ethical rules. In addition, guidelines have been  established  for  events,  whistleblowing  and  combating corruption, among others. See our sustainability library for a full list of sustainability guidelines.\n\nhttps://www.storebrand.no/en/sustainability/sustainability-library\n\n## 3. Equity and and dividends (deviations from the code of practice).\n\nThe Board of Storebrand ASA continuously monitors Storebrand's capital adequacy in light of its goals, strategy and risk profile. Read more under the heading 'Capital situation, rating and risk' in the Directors' Report.\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted and made known a dividend policy whereby Storebrand aims to pay a dividend of over 50 per cent of the group profit after tax. The ambition of the Board is to pay an ordinary dividend per share of at least the same nominal level as in the previous year. Normally, dividends are paid when there\n\nis  a  sustainable solvency margin of more than 150 per cent. With a solvency margin above 180 per cent, the Board's intention is to propose extraordinary dividends or the buyback of shares.\n\nThe  dividend  is  adopted  by  the  General  Meeting,  based  on  a proposal put forward by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe General Meeting may, by simple majority, authorise the Board of Directors to distribute a dividend pursuant to Section 8-1, second paragraph of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. This shall be based on the annual financial statements adopted by the General Meeting. This authorisation may not be granted for a period longer than until the next Annual General Meeting. In addition, the authorisation shall be based on the adopted dividend policy. The General Meeting was not requested to provide such authorisation in 2021. Read more about Storebrands dividend policy on page 54.\n\nStorebrand ASA would like to have various tools available for its efforts  to  maintain  an  optimal  capital  structure  for  Storebrand  to contribute  to  good  shareholder  returns  and  financial  resilience. At  the  2021  Annual  General  Meeting,  the  Board  was  granted authorization to increase the share capital through issuing new shares  for  a  total  maximum  value  of  NOK  233,906,990.  This authorisation  may  be  used  for  the  acquisition  of  businesses  in consideration for new shares or for increasing the share capital by other means. The Board of Directors may decide to waive the shareholders' preferential rights to subscribe for new shares in accordance with the authorization. This authorisation may be used for one or more new issues. This authorisation is valid until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nAt the same General Meeting, the Board of Directors was authorised to buy back shares for a maximum value of NOK 233,906,990. The total holdings of treasury shares must, however, never exceed 10 per cent of the share capital. The buyback of treasury shares may be a tool for the distribution of surplus capital to shareholders in addition to dividends. In addition, each year Storebrand ASA sells shares  to  employees  from  its  own  holdings  in  connection  with the share purchase scheme and long-term incentive schemes for employees of Storebrand. Accordingly, it is appropriate to authorise the  Board  of  Directors  to  buy  shares  in  the  market  to  cover  the aforementioned needs or any other needs. This authorisation is valid until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nApart from this, there are no provisions in Storebrand ASA's Articles of Association that regulate the buyback or issuance of shares.\n\nDeviation from the Code of Practice: The Board's authorisations to increase the share capital and buy back shares are limited to defined purposes. However, no provision was made for the General Meeting to vote on each individual purpose to be covered by the authorisations.",

Equal treatment of shareholders and transactions with close associatess (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nStorebrand ASA has only one class of shares. There are no special ownership and voting restrictions beyond the restrictions imposed by the Act on Financial Undertakings and Financial Groups Through their work, the board and management of Storebrand place great emphasis on equal treatment of the shareholders.\n\nThe general competence rules for board members and executive personnel may be found in the rules of procedure for the Board of Storebrand ASA, rules of procedure for the boards of subsidiaries, instructions  for  the  CEO,  guidelines  for  conflicts  of  interest  and Storebrand's  code  of  ethics.  Board  members  must  inform  the company if they have direct or indirect material interests in an agreement concluded by one of the companies in the Storebrand Group.  The  Board  shall  ensure  that  an  independent  third  party assesses  the  value  of  transactions  that  are  not  insubstantial  in nature. Furthermore, the rules of procedure for the Board stipulate that no board member may participate in discussions or a decision concerning matters that are of such material importance to them or a close associate that the member must be regarded as having a conspicuous personal or special financial interest in the matter. Each board member has a responsibility to continuously assess whether or not such a situation exists.\n\nTransactions with close associates involving Storebrand's employees and other officers of the Group are regulated by Storebrand's code of ethics. Employees shall on their own initiative immediately report conflicts  of  interest  that  may  arise  to  their  immediate  superior as soon as they become aware of such a situation. In general, an employee is defined as disqualified if circumstances exist that could result in others questioning the person's impartiality in relation to matters other than Storebrand's interests.\n\nIn the event of capital increases in accordance with the authorisation set out in Item 3 above, the Board may decide that the shareholders' preferential rights shall be waived.\n\nFor a complete account of shareholder matters, see page 87 above.\n\n## 5. Freely negotiable shares (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nShares  in  Storebrand  ASA  are  listed  on  Oslo  B\u00f8rs  (Oslo  Stock Exchange). The shares are freely negotiable, and the Articles of Association do thus not contain any restrictions with regard to the negotiability of the shares. All the shares carry equal rights, cf. point 4 above.\n\n## 6. General Meeting (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association, Storebrand ASA's General Meeting shall be held by the end of June each year. The General Meeting  was  held  on  18th  April  2021.  All  shareholders  with  a known address will receive notice of the General Meeting, which will be sent out no later than 21 days prior to the General Meeting.\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association, the deadline for giving notice\n\nof attendance shall be set at no later than five calendar days prior\n\nto the General Meeting. In accordance with Storebrand's Articles\n\n- of  Association,  the  opportunity  to  make  other  agenda  papers\n\navailable on the Storebrand website is exercised, cf. Section 5-11a of the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act. A shareholder may nevertheless demand to receive agenda papers by post.\n\nAll shareholders may participate at the General Meeting. Storebrand' s  Articles  of  Association  allow  shareholders  to  vote  in  advance by  means  of  electronic  communication,  cf.  section  5-8b  of  the Norwegian Public Limited Companies Act.\n\nIt is also possible to vote by proxy. Provisions have been made so that the proxy form is linked to each individual item to be considered. We will seek whenever possible to design the form so that it also allows voting  for  candidates  who  are  to  be  elected.  Further  information about voting in advance, use of proxies and the shareholders' rights to have matters discussed at the General Meeting is available both in the notice of the General Meeting and on Storebrand' s website. The  access  to  electronic  voting  and  the  use  of  proxy  allows shareholders to cast their votes without even attending the general meeting. All shareholders are thus given an opportunity to exert influence on Storebrand through the use of the right to vote.\n\nThe Board Chair, at least one representative from the Nomination Committee  and  the  external  auditor  must  attend  the  General Meeting. The Board members of Storebrand ASA are not obligated to attend but are encouraged to attend. The Group Chief Executive Officer, executive management team and the Group Legal Director participate  from  the  management.  The  minutes  of  the  General Meeting are available on Storebrand's website in both Norwegian and English. The General Meeting is opened by the Chair. The Board of Directors endorses an independent chairman of the meeting, elected by the General Meeting.\n\n## The General Meeting shall:\n\n- \u00b7 consider  the  annual  accounts,  consisting  of  the  income statement, the balance sheet and the annual report,\n- \u00b7 including  the  consolidated  income  statement  and  balance sheet, and the auditor's report,\n- \u00b7 decide upon adoption of the income statement and balance sheet,\n- \u00b7 decide upon adoption of the consolidated income statement and balance sheet,\n- \u00b7 decide  upon  the  allocation  of  profit  or  manner  of  covering losses in accordance with the adopted balance sheet, and upon the distribution of dividends,\n- \u00b7 elect the auditor,\n- \u00b7 appoint  members  to  the  Nomination  Committee,  and  this should include the Chair of the Nomination Committee, elect members to the Board of Directors, and this should include the Board Chair,\n- \u00b7 consider  the  Board's  statement  on  the  fixing  of  salaries  and other remuneration to executive personnel,\n- \u00b7 adopt  the  remuneration  of  the  members  of  the  Board  of Directors and board committees,\n- \u00b7 adopt the remuneration of the members of the Nomination Committee,\n- \u00b7 adopt the remuneration of the auditor,\n- \u00b7 and transact any other business listed on the agenda.",

Appendix\n\nDecisions are generally made on the basis of an ordinary majority. Pursuant  to  Norwegian  law,  however,  a  special  majority  is required for certain decisions, including decisions about setting aside  pre-emptive  rights  in  connection  with  any  share  issues, mergers,  spin-offs,  amendments  to  the  Articles  of  Association, or authorizations to increase or reduce the share capital. Such decisions require approval by at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the share capital represented at the General Meeting.\n\n## 7. Nomination Committee (no deviation from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe Nomination Committee of Storebrand ASA is statutory and consists  of  a  minimum  of  3  and  a  maximum  of  5  members.  For the  election  period  2021-2022,  the  nomination  committee  has consisted of five members.\n\nThe Chair of the Nomination Committee and the other members are elected annually by the General Meeting.\n\nThe majority of the nomination committee is independent of the board and the administration. The committee is put together with a view to safeguarding the interests of the shareholder community. The general meeting's instructions to the nomination committee include  provisions  on  rotation  for  members  of  the  nomination committee.\n\nThe articles of association stipulate that the nomination committee shall follow instructions laid down by the general meeting in its work. The nomination committee's instructions were most recently revised  at  the  annual  general  meeting  in  the  spring  of  2019.  In accordance  with  the  instructions,  the  nomination  committee shall pay attention to, among other things, the following factors in the preparation of its settings of candidates for the company's Board  of  Directors:  competence,  experience,  capacity,  gender distribution, independence and consideration for the interests of the shareholder community. More information about the members is  posted  on  Storebrand's  website.  The  Nomination  Committee annually  attributes  the  company's  30  largest  shareholders  with  a call  to  come forward with proposals for candidates for the Board of  Directors  and  the  Nomination  Committee.    A  similar  call  to shareholders has been made on the company's website.\n\nThe  nomination  committee's  mandate  in  accordance  with  the company's  articles  of  association  is  to  propose  candidates  and remuneration to the board and the nomination committee, through settings to the general meeting.\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the nomination committee has been sought adapted to the nature of the work and the time spent in the committee work. The Nomination Committee held 14 meetings in 2021.\n\n## 8. Composition and independence of the Board (No deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe  Articles  of  association  stipulate  that  between  five  and  seven Board  members  are  elected  by  the  General  Meeting  at  the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The Board Chair is elected separately by the General Meeting.\n\nTwo members, or three members if the General Meeting elects six or seven Board members, are elected by and among the employees. Members of the Board are elected for one year at a time. The dayto-day management is not represented on the Board of Directors. At the end of 2021, the Board consisted of 10 members (five men and five women).\n\nNone of the Board members elected by the General Meeting have any  employment,  professional  or  consultancy  relationship  with Storebrand, beyond their appointment to the Board of Directors. The backgrounds of the individual board members are described in the annual report on page 230 and on Storebrand's website. The composition of the Board of Directors satisfies the independence requirements  set  forth  in  the  Code  of  Practice.  There  are  few instances  of  disqualification  during  the  consideration  of  matters by the Board (none during 2021). An assessment of the individual board members' independence is noted in the list of governing and controlling bodies under the heading 'Members of Storebrand ASA's Board of Directors and Committees'. An overview of the number of shares in Storebrand ASA owned by members of governing bodies as of 31 December 2021 is included in the notes to the financial statements for Storebrand ASA (Information on related parties) on page 193. None of the board members have held office for more than ten years.\n\n9. The work of the Board of Directors (no deviations from the Code of Practice)\n\n## Duties of the Board of Directors\n\nIn 2021, 19 board meetings were held. Storebrand's future strategic direction is discussed at the Board's annual strategy meeting, which establishes guidelines for the management's preparation of plans and  budgets  in  connection  with  the  annual  financial  plan,  which must be approved by the Board.\n\nThe Board shall stay informed about Storebrand' s financial position and development, and it shall ensure that the Company's value creation  and  profitability  are  safeguarded  in  the  best  possible manner on behalf of the owners. The Board shall also ensure that the  activities  are  subjected  to  adequate  control  and  ensure  that Storebrand has adequate capital based on the scope of, and risks associated with, its activities.\n\nThe Board has established guidelines that give Board members and senior employees a duty to familiarize Storebrand with the essential interests they may have in matters that the Board is to consider. This also applies to interests that do not imply disqualification, but which may be necessary to take into account when matters are considered. Reference is made to Item 4 above.",

Appendix\n\nAll Board members attended all Board meetings in 2021. The work\n\nof  the  Board  is  regulated  by  special  rules  of  procedure  for  the Board, which are reviewed annually. In order to ensure sound and well-considered decisions, importance is attached to ensuring that meetings of the Board are well prepared so that all the members can participate in the decision-making process. The Board prepares an annual schedule for its meetings and the topics it will consider. The agenda for the next board meeting is normally presented to the Board based on the approved schedule for the year and a list of matters carried forward from previous meetings. The final agenda is fixed in consultation with the Board Chair. Time is set aside at each board meeting to evaluate the meeting without the management present. The Board is entitled to appoint external advisers to help it with its work whenever it deems this necessary. The Board has also\n\ndrawn up instructions for the CEO.\n\nThe  Board  annually  carries  out  an  evaluation  of  its  work  and  its working method that provides the basis for changes and measures. The report from the Board's evaluation, or relevant excerpts, will be made available to the Nomination Committee, which will use the evaluation in its work.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has established four subcommittees in the form of the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee, Risk Committee and Strategy Committees. The composition helps ensure a thorough and independent consideration of matters that concern internal control,  financial  reporting,  risk  assessment  and  remuneration  of executive personnel. The committees are preparatory and advisory working committees and assist the Board with the preparation of items for consideration. Decisions are made, however, by the full Board.  The  committees  are  able  to  hold  meetings  and  consider matters  at  their  own  initiative  and  without  the  participation  of company management.\n\nThe  Compensation  Committee  assists  the  Board  with  all  matters concerning  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  remuneration.  The Committee monitors the remuneration of Storebrand's executive personnel and proposes guidelines for fixing executive personnel remuneration and the Board's statement on the fixing of executive personnel remuneration, which is presented to the General Meeting annually. In addition, the Committee safeguards the areas required by  the  Compensation  Regulations  in  Norway  and  Sweden.  The Compensation Committee held three meetings in 2021.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board by reviewing, evaluating and, where necessary, proposing appropriate measures with respect to the  Group's  overall  controls,  financial  and  operational  reporting, risk  management/control, and internal and external auditing. The Audit Committee held seven meetings in 2021, including one joint meeting with the Risk Committee. The external and internal auditors participate in the meetings. The majority of the Committee members are independent of the company.\n\nThe main task of the Risk Committee is to prepare matters to be considered by the Group's Board of Directors in the area of risk, with a special focus on Storebrand's risk appetite and risk strategy, including the investment strategy. The Committee should contribute forward-looking  decision-making  support  related  to  the  Board's discussion  of  risk  taking,  financial  forecasts  and  the  treatment  of risk  reporting.  The  Risk  Committee  held  seven  meetings  in  2021, including a joint meeting with the Audit Committee.\n\nThe main task of the strategy committee is to prepare the board management in the strategy area, with particular attention to the Group's work on strategy, including mergers and acquisitions. The Committee shall provide forward-looking decision support related to the board's discussion of the company's strategic choices and targets The Strategy Committee held four meetings during 2021.\n\n## 10. Risk management and internal control (no deviation from the recommendation)\n\n## Overall management and control\n\nThe Board of Directors has drawn up general policies and guidelines for management and control. These policies deal with the Board's responsibility for determining Storebrand's appetite for risk and risk profile,  approval  of  the  organisation  of  the  business,  assignment of areas of responsibility and authority, requirements concerning reporting lines and information, and risk management and internal control  requirements.  The  Board's  and  Chief  Executive  Officer's areas  of  responsibility  are  defined  in  the  rules  of  procedure  for the  Board  and  the  instructions  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, respectively. The Board of Directors has drawn up instructions for Storebrand's subsidiaries that are to ensure that they implement and comply with Storebrand's management and control policies and guidelines.\n\nThe  Investor  Relations  guidelines  ensure  reliable,  timely  and identical information to investors, lenders and other stakeholders in the securities market.\n\nAs  an  extension  of  the  general  policies  and  guidelines,  a  code of ethics has been drawn up that applies to all employees and representatives of Storebrand, in addition to corporate rules for areas such as risk management, internal control, financial reporting, handling inside information and share trading by primary insiders. Guidelines and information about information security, contingency plans,  measures  against  money  laundering  and  other  financial criminality  have  also  been  drawn  up.  Storebrand  is  subject  to statutory supervision in the countries where it has operations that require  a  licence,  including  the  Financial  Supervisory  Authority  of Norway, as well as its own supervisory bodies and external auditor.",

Appendix\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe  assessment  and  management  of  risk  are  integrated  into Storebrand's corporate governance. This management system shall ensure that there is a correlation between goals and actions at all levels of Storebrand and the overall policy of creating value for Storebrand's shareholders.\n\nStorebrand's  financial  and  operational  goals  are  defined  annually in a board-approved business plan. The business plan builds on separate decisions on risk strategy and investment strategies, and includes  three-year  financial  forecasts,  budgets  and  action  plans. The Board of Directors receives ongoing reports on the status of the strategy implementation.\n\nStorebrand Compass is the company's monitoring tool. It provides comprehensive reports for management and the Board concerning financial and operational targets. In addition, the Board of Directors receives risk reports from the risk management function, which monitors the development of key figures for risk and solidity.\n\nRisk assessment forms part of the managerial responsibilities in the organisation. Its purpose is to identify, assess and manage risks that can hinder a unit's ability to achieve its goals. The process covers both the risk of incurring losses and failing profitability linked to economic downturns, changes in the general conditions, changed customer behaviour, etc., and the risk of incurring losses due to inadequate or  failing  internal  processes,  systems,  human  error  or  external events.  Developments  in  the  financial  markets  are  important  risk factors in relation to Storebrand's earnings and solvency position. In  addition  to  assessing the effects of sudden shifts in the equity markets or interest rate levels (stress tests), scenario analysis is used to estimate the effect of various sequences of events in the financial markets on Storebrand's financial performance and solvency. This provides important premises for the Board's general discussion of risk appetite, risk allocation and capital adequacy.\n\nStorebrand's independent control functions for risk management, compliance,  actuary  professional  and  information  security  are gathered  in  a  competence  community,  Governance  Risk  & Compliance,  led  by  the  Group  Chief  Risk  Officer  (CRO)  The  CRO reports  directly  to  the  CEO  and  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  CRO function  is  responsible  for  supporting  the  Board  and  Executive management  team  with  respect  to  the  establishment  of  a  risk strategy and operationalisation of the setting of limits and monitoring of risk raking across Storebrand's business areas.\n\nStorebrand has a common internal audit function, which conducts an  independent  review  of  the  robustness  of  the  management model. The internal audit function's instructions and annual plan are  determined by the Board pursuant to the current legislation, regulations and international standards. The internal audit function produces  quarterly  reports  for  the  boards  of  the  respective Storebrand companies.\n\nThe  appraisal  of  all  Storebrand  employees  is  integrated  into corporate governance and is designed to ensure that the adopted strategies are implemented. The policies for earning and paying any variable remuneration to Storebrand's risk managers comply with the  regulations  relating  to  remuneration  in  financial  institutions, cf.  Section  12  below.  The  Chief  Risk  Officer  and  employees  with control functions related to risk management, internal control and compliance only have fixed salaries.\n\n## Financial information and Storebrand's accounting process\n\nStorebrand publishes four interim financial statements, in addition to the ordinary annual financial statements. The financial statements must satisfy legal and regulatory requirements and be prepared in accordance with the adopted accounting policies and be published according to the schedule adopted by the Board of Storebrand ASA. Storebrand's  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  by the Consolidated Accounts Unit, which reports to the Group Chief Financial  Officer.  Key  managers  in  the  Consolidated  Accounts Unit  have  fixed  annual  compensation  that  is  not  influenced  by Storebrand' s accounting results. The division of work involved in the preparation of the financial statements is organised in such a way that the Consolidated Accounts Unit does not carry out valuations of investment assets. Instead it exercises a control function in relation to the accounting processes of the group companies.\n\nA  series  of  risk  assessment  and  control  measures  have  been established  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  the  financial statements.  Assessments  relating  to  significant  accounting  items and  any  changes  in  principles  etc.  are  described  in  a  separate document (assessment item memo). The Board's Audit Committee conducts  a  preparatory  review  of  interim  financial  statements and  annual  financial  statements,  focusing  in  particular  on  the discretionary valuations and estimates that have been made prior to consideration by the Board.\n\nMonthly and quarterly operating reports are prepared in which the results by business area and product area are analysed and assessed against set budgets. The operating reports are reconciled against other financial reporting.\n\n## 11. Remuneration to the Board of Directors (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe  General  Meeting  determines  fixes  the  Board's  remuneration annually on the basis of the recommendations of the Nomination Committee.  The  fees  paid  to  the  members  of  the  Board  are  not linked  to  earnings,  option  schemes  or  similar  arrangements. Members  of  the  Board  and  Board  Committees  do  not  receive incentive-based remuneration; instead they receive a fixed annual compensation, either per year or per meeting the member attends, or a combination of such remuneration. The shareholder-elected members of the Board do not participate in Storebrand's pension schemes. None of the shareholder-elected members of the Board",

More detailed information on the remuneration, loans and  shareholdings  of  board  members  can  be  found  in  Note  23 (Group) and Note 15 (ASA). Board members are encouraged to hold shares in the company.\n\n## 12. Remuneration to senior management (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe Board of Directors decides the structure of the remuneration for  senior  executives  in  Storebrand,  and  guidelines  on  the remuneration (previously the executive remuneration statement) are presented to the general meeting. The remuneration consists of  fixed  salary,  variable  remuneration, pension scheme and other personnel  benefits  that  are  common  for  a  financial  group.  The remuneration  shall  motivate  good  efforts  for  long-term  value creation and resource utilization in the company. The board's stance is that the total remuneration should be competitive, but not leading within the industry.\n\nThe salary of the Executive management is determined based on the level of responsibility and complexity of the position. An annual assessment is carried out based on external market data to ensure remuneration is adequate in relation to equivalent positions in the market.\n\nStorebrand shall have an incentive model that supports Company strategy,  with  emphasis  on  the  customer's  interests  and  longterm perspective and an ambitious model of cooperation, as well as transparency that enhances the Storebrand's reputation. The Group's  executive  management  only  receive  fixed  salaries  and use  a  percentage  of  their  fixed  salaries  to  purchase  shares  in Storebrand with a lock-in period of three years. This is to clarify that the Storebrand's top management acts in accordance with the longterm interests of the owners.\n\nStorebrand's  strategy  and  operational  objectives  are  based  on annual individual assessments of the remuneration of employees. This further strengthens the compliance between owners and the administration. Sustainable solutions are a key part of Storebrand's business  strategy  and  will  also  be  part  of  the  assessment  of employees.\n\nMore detailed information about the remuneration of executive personnel  may  be  found  in  Note  23  (Group)  and  Note  15  (ASA), and  in  the  Board's  statement  on  the  fixing  of  salaries  and  other remuneration  to  executive  personnel,  which  is  included  in  the notice of the General Meeting and available at www.storebrand.no. Executive personnel are encouraged to hold shares in Storebrand ASA, even beyond the lock-in period.\n\n## 13. Information and communication (no deviation from the code of practice)\n\nThe  Board  has  issued  guidelines  for  the  company's  reporting  of financial and other information and for contact with shareholders other than through the General Meeting. Storebrand's reporting with regard to sustainable investments goes beyond the statutory requirements. Storebrand's financial calendar is published on the Internet and in the company's annual report. Financial information is  published  in  the  quarterly  and  annual  reports,  as  described under  Item  10  above  -  Financial  information  and  Storebrand's accounting process. Documentation that is published is available on Storebrand's website. All reporting is based on the principle of transparency and takes into account the need for the equal treatment of all participants in the securities markets and the rules concerning good stock exchange practices. Storebrand has its own guidelines  for  handling  inside  information,  see  also  section  10  Overall management and control, above.\n\n14.\n\nCorporate\n\ntakeover\n\n(no\n\ndeviation\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nrecommendation)\n\nThe Board of Directors has prepared guidelines for how to act in the event of a possible takeover bid for the company. These guidelines are based on the Board of Directors ensuring the transparency of the process and that all the shareholders are treated equally and given an opportunity to evaluate the bid that has been made. It follows from the guidelines that the Board of Directors will evaluate the bid and issue a statement on the Board's opinion of the bid, in addition to obtaining a valuation from an independent expert. In addition, the Board of Directors will, in the event of any takeover bid, seek whenever possible to maximise the shareholders' assets. The guidelines cover the situation before and after a bid is made.\n\n## 15. Auditor (no deviation from the Code of Practice)\n\nThe external auditor is elected by the General Meeting of Storebrand ASA and conducts a financial audit. The external auditor issues an auditor's report in connection with the annual financial statement, conducts  limited  audits  of  the  interim  accounts.  The  external auditor attends board meetings where the quarterly accounts are processed, and all meetings of the Audit Committee, unless the items on the agenda do not require the presence of the auditor. The external auditor shall rotate the responsible partner on the audit assignment every seven years, and Storebrand shall carry out tenders for the election of an auditing company at least every ten years. Each year, the work and independence of the external auditor is evaluated by the Board's Audit Committee. The auditor also holds an annual meeting with the Board without the administration being present. The other companies in Storebrand have the same auditor as Storebrand ASA.",

A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.\n\nOur work involves performing actions to obtain evidence that Storebrand's GRI Index for 2021 and key performance indicators for sustainability are developed in accordance with the Standards published by the Global Reporting Initiative and the criteria for reporting and measurement that are explained in relation to each individual table of key performance indicators. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including assessments of the risks that the sustainability reporting contains material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we take into account the internal control that is relevant for the preparation of the sustainability reporting. The purpose is to design control procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.\n\nOur procedures include an assessment of whether the criteria used are appropriate, as well as an assessment of the overall presentation of the sustainability reporting. Our procedures include meetings with representatives from Storebrand who are responsible for the material sustainability topics covered by the sustainability reporting; review of internal control and routines for reporting key performance indicators for sustainability; obtaining and reviewing relevant information that supports the preparation of key performance indicators for sustainability; assessment of completeness and accuracy of the sustainability reporting; and controlling the calculations of key performance indicators for sustainability based on an assessment of the risk of error.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that\n\nStorebrand's GRI Index for 2021 is not, in all material respects, developed and presented in accordance with the requirements of the Standards published by The Global Reporting Initiative;\n\nStorebrand's key performance indicators are not, in all material aspects, developed, measured and reported in accordance with the definitions and explanations provided in relation to each table containing the key performance indicators.\n\nOslo, 8 February 2022\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AS\n\nThomas Steffensen State Authorized Public Accountant\n\n(This translation from Norwegian has been made for information purposes only)",

fossil-free products.\n- 71)  The method for calculating carbon footprints has been further developed for the annual report 2021. Data are obtained through Trucost (S&P Global)'s systems and weighted by market value per position. For index figures, corresponding calculations are weighted per index and it is weighted together with the portfolios' indices based on portfolio values. This represents a coverage ratio of 96.7% in our carbon footprint from equity investments, and a coverage ratio of 93.8% for index.\n\n- 75)  Capital Investment, which we acquired in 2021, has not yet reported to GRESB, and the properties the company manages are not included in the figures for certification.\n- 76)  The number of companies we have engaged in has increased at the same time as the investment universe has increased. Commitments as a share of the investment universe will thus be the same as in 2020.\n- 77)  The increase from 2020 to 2021 is due to a partial automation of the voting process.",

The  Taxonomy  regulation  entered  into  force  on  12  July 2020 in the EU, but the new requirements will only apply from 2022 for  the  first  two  environmental  goals  (climate  change  mitigation and climate change adaptation), and from 2023 for the other four environmental  goals  (sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biological diversity and ecosystems).\n\nIn accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the underlying Disclosures Delegated Act, the Taxonomy reporting must be done on two levels. Firstly, companies must report on how much of their turnover, investments and operational costs are covered by the Taxonomy, defined as Taxonomy eligible activities. Secondly, companies must report the share of their activities that are aligned to the Taxonomy, which means that the activities are considered to  be  environmentally  sustainable  activities  due  to  meeting  the specified technical criteria as defined by the Taxonomy. For example, an entire car company will be covered by the Taxonomy (Taxonomyeligible), but only the cars with zero emissions or emissions below the  defined  threshold  value  (Technical  Screening  Criteria),  and  in compliance  with  Do  no  significant  harm  criteria  and  the  minimal safeguards will be in accordance with the Taxonomy (Taxonomyaligned).\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, Storebrand must disclose the degree of insurance premiums, loans and investments that are Taxonomy-eligible. For the investments, this is based on data from underlying  investments.  Storebrand  works  actively  to  meet  the reporting requirements in accordance with the EU Taxonomy, and follows the regulatory aspects closely. We interact with third-party suppliers, and internally in the organisation, so we are well prepared to fully implement the regulations. Storebrand has worked to obtain data  related  to  our  underlying  investments'  share  of  economic activities that are covered by the Taxonomy. In the selection of data suppliers, the providers have been thoroughly assessed based on, among other things, data quality, coverage rate and the suppliers' ability to adapt and change the delivery in accordance with the regulations.\n\nOur reporting of key figures related to the EU Taxonomy will become increasingly important as a measure of climate change as data quality and coverage increase.\n\nWe have divided the reporting into two parts: mandatory reporting and voluntary reporting. The regulations for how the reporting is to be done are still unclear and the reporting is thus done to the best of our ability and available data. Note that interpretations of the regulations may change, and that the definitions behind the figures for next year may thus have to be adapted to new understandings.\n\n## Mandatory reporting for Storebrand as an insurancedominated cross-sectoral financial group:\n\nThe  mandatory  Taxonomy  reporting  for  financial  companies  can only include actual reported data from companies that are required to report under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). This means that, for example, companies with less than 500 employees or companies located outside Europe cannot be included in the mandatory Taxonomy reporting.\n\n## Key indicators related to non-life insurance activities\n\nShare of non-life insurance premiums that is Taxonomy-eligible\n\n63.4 %\n\nStorebrand  offers  non-life  and  health  insurance  to  Norwegian customers.  In  order  to  analyse  the  share  of  non-life  insurance premiums covered by the Taxonomy, Storebrand has segmented the insurance activities according to the Lines of Business defined in the Solvency II regulations. 89 In addition to segmenting products under Solvency II, the product categories must refer to a policy on climate-related risks in order to be fully covered by the Taxonomy. 90 We have analysed each insurance product to determine whether the products refer to climate-related risks.\n\nSome players have chosen to include product categories as long as they do not explicitly exclude compensation as a result of climaterelated  risks.  We  have  chosen  a  stricter  interpretation  by  only including products that refer to climate-related risks specifically in the policy terms, or in additional coverage, when we have calculated the  share  of  insurance  premiums  covered  by  the  Taxonomy. Workers'  compensation  insurance,  income  protection  insurance and health insurance, including expenses for medical treatment, do not mention climate-related risks and are in our assessment not Taxonomy eligible. Most of our non-life insurance products have additional coverage defined by the natural perils regulations and will then be covered by the Taxonomy eligibility requirements. 91\n\nThe insurance products in Storebrand, which are both defined under Solvency  II  and  which  refer  to  climate-related  risks,  correspond to  63.4  per  cent  of  the  total  insurance  premium.  The  rest  of  our insurance business is not covered by the taxonomy.\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/level-2-measures/taxonomy-regulation-delegated-act-2021-2800-annex-2\\_en.pdf",

The loans are mainly mortgages with  a  small  proportion  of  unsecured  credits.  Mortgages  are covered by the Taxonomy. In the calculation of what is Taxonomy eligible within the bank's activities, we have chosen not to include unsecured  credits.  Thus,  99  per  cent  of  the  bank's  activities  are covered by the Taxonomy.\n\n## Key indicators related to investment activities\n\n| Share of investments that is Taxonomy-eligible in the   | 0 %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| mandatory reporting                                     |       |\n\nSince the implementation of the Taxonomy Regulation started on 1 January 2022, the underlying NFRD companies we invest in have not yet had time to publish information on how much of their business  is  covered  by  the  Taxonomy.  We  use  third-party  data providers to collect this information for listed shares and bonds, as we have an investment universe of approximately 5,000 companies, which makes it almost impossible to obtain the information directly from  the  companies.  We  have  compared  most  data  providers and evaluated them carefully before we chose to collaborate with Sustainalytics. Sustainalytics has estimated data for a large number of companies, on which we base our voluntary reporting below. But as mentioned above, actual reported data is still missing.\n\nIn addition to investments in listed companies, we also invest in other types of assets where we have been in contact with the companies to obtain relevant data. None of these qualify for reporting under the  NFRD,  which  means  that  they  are  also  not  reported  in  the mandatory reporting, but below in the voluntary reporting.\n\nSince none of the companies that are required to be assessed in the mandatory reporting, i.e. those that follow the NFRD, have reported their  data  yet,  the  figure  on  the  share  of  investments  covered  by Taxonomy  will  be  0  per  cent.  Below  you  will  find  the  voluntary taxonomy description, with a more detailed description for equities, corporate bonds, real estate, infrastructure and private equity.\n\n## Voluntary reporting for Storebrand as an\n\ninsurance-dominated cross-sectoral financial group\n\n## Key indicators related to activities within equity and bond investments\n\n| Share of equity investments that is Taxonomy-eligible   | 3.4 %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Share of bond investments that is Taxonomy-eligible     | 3.4 %   |\n\nThe data provider Sustainalytics provides estimates of how much of the investee companies' activites that are covered by the Taxonomy.\n\nThe numerator multiplies our investments (assets under management)  in  companies  with  headquarters  in  Europe  by the  proportion  of  activities  covered  by  the  Taxonomy  of  the\n\nrespective companies. Exposures to governments, central banks and supranational issuers are excluded from the calculation of the numerator.\n\nThe  denominator  includes  all  investments  globally,  with  the exception of exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers. Thus, only 3.4 per cent of Storebrand's equity investments and 3.4 per cent of Storebrand's bond investments are covered by the Taxonomy.\n\nFor  equity  investments  in  Europe,  we  have  estimates  from Sustainalytics  covering  77.6  per  cent  of  the  companies  we  have invested in based on assets under management. If we had only used the investments in the companies where we have available data as a basis for our calculations, 11.9 per cent of our equity investments in Europe would have been covered by the Taxonomy.\n\nFor equity investments globally, we have estimates from Sustainalytics covering 82.3 per cent of the companies we have invested in based on assets under management. If we had only based our calculations on investments in the companies where we have available data, and including  companies  outside  Europe,  12.7  per  cent  of  our  global equity investments would have been covered by the Taxonomy.\n\nThese are estimates based on information from our data providers and will probably change somewhat when the data quality improves.\n\n## Key indicators related to activities within investments in infrastructure\n\nShare of infrastructure investments that is Taxonomy-eligible\n\n100 %\n\nAll our infrastructure investments are in activities that are covered by the Taxonomy. Infrastructure investments are not covered by the NFRD, and are thus not reported as mandatory reporting, but as voluntary. Since infrastructure is direct investment made from Europe, we have defined that investment in infrastructure projects located outside Europe is also covered by the Taxonomy.\n\n## Key indicators related to activities within investments in private equity\n\n| Share of investments in private equity that is   | 3 %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Taxonomy-eligible                                |       |\n\nOnly 3 per cent of private equity investments are covered by the taxonomy. 53 per cent of investments in private equity are outside Europe, and the remaining companies are not covered by the NFRD.\n\n## Key indicators related to activities in real estate investments\n\nShare of real estate investments that is Taxonomy-eligible\n\n100 %\n\nAll the direct real estate investments are in activities that are covered by the taxonomy. Real estate investments are not covered by the NFRD, and are thus not reported as mandatory reporting, but as voluntary.",
