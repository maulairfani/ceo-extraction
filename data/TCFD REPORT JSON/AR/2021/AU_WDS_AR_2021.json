        "page_content": "## CHAIRMAN'S REPORT\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to report that 2021 has delivered improved financial performance and significant decisions which we think will set Woodside up to deliver value to all our stakeholders in the years ahead.\n\nWith the global economy rebounding during the year, we were able to capitalise on high oil and gas prices to report a 2021 net profit after tax of $1,983 million. Strong operating revenue and prudent management of capital and expenditure have us very well positioned to deliver our growth ambitions while returning value to shareholders. We will pay a full-year total dividend of 135 US cents per share.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continued to evolve around the world and in Australia, we maintained rigorous controls and response measures to protect the health of our workforce and community, and maintain production at our operations.\n\nOur safety performance was disappointing. Our total recordable injury rate increased, in contrast with a downward trend in previous years. Improving this performance is a priority in the year ahead, both in operations and as we embark on new major projects requiring thousands of additional workers.\n\nOur announcement of a proposed merger with BHP's petroleum business in August, followed by execution of a binding share sale agreement in November, is a momentous decision for Woodside's long-term future.\n\nThe case for the proposed merger is compelling, bringing together the best of both organisations to create a larger global independent energy company with the scale, diversity, and resilience to provide value to shareholders and navigate the energy transition. We are expecting to deliver significant synergies as we bring both businesses together.\n\nI look forward to seeking our shareholders' approval for the merger, with the vote targeted for 19 May 2022.\n\nAnnouncing final investment decisions on our Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 projects and the sell-down of 49% of Pluto Train 2 to Global Infrastructure Partners which completed in January 2022, were further significant achievements for Woodside in 2021.\n\nScarborough is a world-class reservoir containing only 0.1% carbon dioxide that will be processed through the expanded Pluto LNG facility. It is targeted to deliver first cargo in 2026 into a market with anticipated robust demand for LNG. It will\n\nalso deliver significant benefits to Western Australia and the nation in the form of thousands of jobs during development, tax revenues and domestic gas supply.\n\nThe COP-26 global climate summit in October-November 2021 saw renewed focus on global e/fforts to address climate change. Woodside aims to thrive in the energy transition as a low-cost, lower-carbon energy provider and our approach to climate strategy is simple.\n\nFirst, like all firms and consumers, we must reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions. Secondly, as an energy producer, we must ensure that we invest in the products and services that our customers want, as they too reduce their emissions.\n\nNatural gas, when used to generate electricity, emits around half the life cycle emissions of coal. It can also play an important role in 'firming up' intermittent renewable generation and be used in 'hard to abate' industrial sectors. Major customer countries for Woodside's LNG, including Japan, the Republic of Korea and China, have set net zero targets and identified ongoing use of natural gas in their energy mix.\n\nGlobal demand for oil is forecast to continue for decades, particularly given the challenges in substituting other energy sources in certain applications. Oil production, as part of Woodside's broader diversified portfolio, will help meet this global demand, contributing margins and cash flow as Woodside navigates the energy transition.\n\nWe are making solid progress against our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. Our 2021 net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions were 10% below the 2016 - 2020 gross annual average. These reductions were achieved by a range of design, operations and o/ffsetting actions and we are on course to achieve Woodside's near-term 2025 target of a 15% reduction. From there, we have a mid-term target of a 30% reduction by 2030, with a net zero aspiration by 2050./one.num\n\nWe are also pursuing opportunities to commercialise new energy products and lower-carbon services as part of our broader product mix. In December 2021 we set ourselves a new target to invest $5 billion in profitable new energy",

We generated an operating cash flow of $3.8 billion, a 105% increase from 2020, strengthening our balance sheet and financial position.\n\nWe announced the proposed merger with BHP's petroleum business in August and signed a binding share sale agreement in November. The merger is transformative and will deliver increased scale, diversity, and resilience to better navigate the energy transition. It will provide the financial strength to fund planned developments in the near term, investment in future energy opportunities and return value to shareholders through the cycle. Completion of the merger is targeted for early June 2022 subject to a shareholder vote on the transaction which is targeted for 19 May 2022.\n\nUnfortunately, and contrary to the importance we place on keeping our colleagues safe, our total recordable injury rate increased to 1.74 per million work hours. The safety of our employees and contractors is our number one priority. A focus area for 2022 is to address common root causes for the 2021 incidents to deliver improvements in overall safety performance.\n\nWe continued to deliver reliable and lower-cost operations, all while completing our largest ever program of planned maintenance which included work scopes deferred from 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe established the Operations Transformation program to support the long-term cost competitiveness of our assets and business. As part of this program we are streamlining processes, utilising technology to enable more informed decision making and automating routine tasks. A key focus for our team has been improving the e/fficiency and e/ffectiveness of maintenance planning and execution.\n\nWe had a reserves downgrade on Julimar-Brunello and a reserves revision on the Greater Pluto region following the completion of integrated subsurface studies incorporating 4D seismic and well performance data.\n\nWe approved final investment decisions on our Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 projects. These decisions are/uni00A0as significant for us as the North West Shelf was in the 1980s, and Pluto in the 2000s./uni00A0Scarborough is a world-class reservoir containing only 0.1% carbon dioxide and will be processed through the expanded Pluto LNG facility. The Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 projects leverage existing infrastructure at Pluto LNG and site works for Pluto Train 2 were previously completed when the original LNG train was built.\n\nProcessing Scarborough gas through the e/fficient and expanded Pluto LNG facility makes it an attractive option for major LNG customers seeking reliable, a/ffordable, and lower-carbon energy to meet demand and support their decarbonisation goals. The approved FID decisions have also resulted in an increase to Woodside's overall corporate Proved plus Probable (2P) Total Reserves by 1,432.7 MMboe. In addition to achieving FID, we also completed the selldown of a 49% non-operated participating interest in Pluto Train 2 to Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). This transaction completed in January 2022.\n\nConstruction of our Sangomar project in Senegal continued on schedule with the first well drilled and completed and FPSO conversion activities continuing. First oil is targeted for 2023.\n\nConstruction of the Pluto-KGP Interconnector pipeline between Pluto LNG and the Karratha Gas Plant was completed and commissioning activities commenced ahead of ready for start-up (RFSU) targeted for the first quarter of 2022. The Interconnector will provide opportunities to take advantage of future excess capacity at KGP. It will also provide potential",

There was also an approximately threefold increase in the number of Corpus Christi cargoes lifted. This was partially o/ffset by fewer condensate cargoes sold, lower facility reliability on Ngujima-Yin as well as weather events in the first half of 2021. The corresponding trading costs for the purchase of third-party traded LNG cargoes and Corpus Christi cargoes are shown in the \"trading costs\" line item within \"other costs of sales\" in note A.1 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Impairment reversals\n\nFinal investment decisions for the Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 projects supported the reversal of a non-cash impairment for Pluto, previously recognised in 2020. The non-cash impairment for NWS Gas recognised in 2020 was also reversed, supported by updated cost and production profiles and an improved price environment.\n\n## Trading costs\n\nTrading costs increased due to a higher number of traded cargoes in 2021. The trading revenue is recognised in LNG revenue, and the corresponding higher trading costs are shown in the \"trading costs\" line item within \"other costs of sales\" in note A.1 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Income tax and PRRT\n\nIncome tax and PRRT expense increased primarily due to the e/ffect of higher operating revenue in 2021.\n\n## Other\n\nOil and gas properties depreciation expense decreased primarily due to a reduction in asset bases following the asset impairments announced in July 2020. It was also impacted by lower oil production volumes as a result of lower facility reliability on Ngujima-Yin and weather events in 2021.\n\nExploration wells in Myanmar were written-o/ff during the period as a result of the decision to relinquish the blocks and withdraw from Myanmar.\n\nOther items decreasing NPAT included higher royalties, exercise and levies due to higher pricing and revenue, higher repurchase and cancellation costs for revenue optimisations and net loss on hedging activities.\n\n## Dividend per share\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contingent payments were made to ExxonMobil and BHP following the final investment decisions taken on Scarborough and Pluto Train 2.\n\n## Dividend payments\n\nA 2021 final dividend of US 105 cents per share (cps) has been declared. The final dividend is based on the 2021 underlying NPAT of $1,620 million and reflects the performance of our high-reliability and low-cost operations.

Total production cost remained stable despite increased planned turnaround activity but produced volumes decreased, impacted by the expiry of NWS joint domestic gas contract obligations, cessation of production from the Angel field in 2020, turnaround activity on NWS Project and Wheatstone and the impact of weather events in the first half of 2021.\n\n## Production cost\n\n## Debt maturity profile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Total production cost ($ million)\n\nUnit production cost ($/boe)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /one.num Other funding activities includes repayment of borrowings and lease liabilities, borrowing costs and contributions to NCI.\n\n## Liquidity\n\n$ million\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021 we announced the selldown of a 49% non-operating participating interest in the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture. This transaction completed in January 2022. In 2022, we will continue the targeted sell-down processes for Sangomar and the Scarborough o/ffshore resource.\n- \u00b7  Hedging, to protect the balance sheet against the commodity cycle.\n- \u00b7  Debt management, to ensure that we continue to have access to premium debt markets at a competitive cost to support our growth activities. We seek to manage average debt maturity on our debt portfolio. Our gearing target is 15-35%. We continue to target maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.\n\n## 2022 PRIORITIES\n\n- \u00bb Maintain a strong balance sheet through liquidity and debt portfolio management\n- \u00bb Active balance sheet management including commodity and foreign exchange hedging\n- \u00bb Sell-down Sangomar and the Scarborough o/ffshore resource\n- \u00b7  Shareholder returns, to ensure we reward our shareholders appropriately. Our dividend policy is to aim to pay a minimum of 50% of net profit after tax excluding non-recurring items. The net profit after tax basis helps preserve cash and protect the balance sheet in periods of low commodity pricing. We will target a payout ratio between 50 and 80% and our dividend reinvestment plan remains active. We will maintain the flexibility to consider opportunities to provide additional returns to shareholders through special dividends and share buybacks in periods of excess cash generation.\n- \u00b7  Focused expenditure management, to ensure prudent and e/fficient deployment of capital to support delivery of base business and growth opportunities.\n\n## Optimise value and shareholder returns\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestment grade credit rating\n\nMaintain dividend based on NPAT excluding non-recurring items, targeting 50-80% payout ratio\n\nTargeted 15-35% gearing",

In 2021, north Asian LNG prices reached all-time highs in January and again in October, supported by various factors including colder winter weather in many key gas-consuming countries and disruptions experienced by a number of suppliers. Global LNG demand grew by 6% in 2021, supported by continued strong demand growth in Asia./one.num\n\nThe World Bank estimates in its Global Economic Prospects report released in January 2022 that global GDP growth will continue in 2022 but at a slower rate, expected to be 4.1% in 2022, down from 5.5% estimated for 2021.\n\nGlobal commitment to take decisive action to address climate change continues to strengthen. In the lead-up to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP-26) held in Glasgow during November 2021, many countries, including Japan, South Korea and China, pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by around the middle of this century. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated in November 2021 that if all of the climate pledges announced to date were met in full and on time, global warming could be limited to below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100./two.num\n\nThe global energy transition is creating uncertainty over how global energy markets will evolve, but there is broad consensus that lower-carbon power sources, such as solar, wind and lower-carbon hydrogen, will play an increasingly important role in global energy systems.\n\nNatural gas, which on a lifecycle basis emits half the carbon dioxide of coal to generate power, is expected to play a critical role in the energy transition. Gas-fired power generation is expected to be an important source of grid stability and flexibility as power systems become renewables-rich./three.num\n\nNatural gas can also be used in conjunction with carbon capture and storage to create lower-carbon hydrogen, which is likely to become an increasingly significant source of energy over time. It also has the potential to displace highercarbon fuel sources in many applications.\n\nThere is a significant opportunity for natural gas to assist with the decarbonisation goals of developing countries in Asia, which typically are fast-growing and often coal-dependent.\n\nWood Mackenzie analysis indicates that growth in global gas demand is expected to at least 2035 under all of their scenarios, including their AET-2 scenario, with most growth coming from developing Asian nations./four.num\n\nUnder Wood Mackenzie's AET-2 scenario, global LNG demand grows by 62% between 2021 and 2040. Asian LNG demand growth over this period is even stronger, at 90%. Under Energy Transition Outlook, their base case, global LNG demand increases by 90% between 2021 and 2040./four.num\n\nIn addition to our own Scarborough project, 2021 saw Qatar's North Field East (NFE) project, the Darwin LNG backfill (Barossa) project in Australia, and Russia's Baltic LNG (Ust-Luga) project take FID. Scarborough's competitive cost of supply, low reservoir carbon content and proximity to key Asian demand centres makes it ideally placed to supply the world's growing LNG needs.\n\n## LNG demand by region - AET-2/four.num\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- /one.num Wood Mackenzie Short Term Demand Tracker, January 2022, pg 2.\n- /two.num IEA Commentary: COP26 climate pledges could help limit global warming to 1.8 degrees C, but implementing them will be key, Dr Fatih Birol, 4 November 2021.\n- /three.num Grattan Institute 2021: 'Go for net zero - a practical plan for reliable, a/ffordable, low-emissions electricity' page 30.\n- /four.num AET-2 is Wood Mackenzie's accelerated energy transition 2 degrees Celsius scenario.

An infrastructure-led portfolio approach during 2021 identified opportunities which are notionally planned for the 2023-2024 period.\n\nThe Gemtree exploration prospect in permit WA-49-L has received Environment Plan approval and is planned to be drilled in 2023 for tie-back to Wheatstone infrastructure.\n\nAdditional subsurface studies facilitated Woodside's bid and award of WA-550-P gazettal permit, which provides highly prospective tie-back options for Woodside's Pluto infrastructure.\n\nA 2D seismic survey acquisition in NT-P86 o/ffshore the Northern Territory is targeted for 2022.\n\n## Global activities\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering approximately 2,575km/two.sup was successfully acquired in H1 2021 for Blocks 8 and 6-1N in o/ffshore the Republic of Korea. This data will support the continued subsurface assessment and identification of prospects.\n\nWoodside progressed and approved the Senegal SNE North-2 well location. This well targets both appraisal and exploration oil intervals to enable tie-back into the under construction Sangomar FPSO. The well is planned to be drilled in the second half of 2022, in conjunction with the ongoing Sangomar Field Development Phase 1 drilling campaign. An extension to the RSSD Exploration Licence was supported.\n\n## 2022 PLANNED ACTIVITIES\n\n- \u00bb Continue to prioritise infrastructure-led activities\n- \u00bb Drill SNE North-2 well in Senegal\n- \u00bb Evaluate 3D seismic data from o/ffshore Republic of Korea to identify prospectivity close to the Korean market\n- \u00bb Relinquish remaining interests in Myanmar\n\nIn March 2021 Woodside completed a three well exploration campaign in Myanmar blocks A-7, AD-1 and AD-8. All three wells were safely drilled, evaluated, and abandoned, and while AD-8 and A-7 found hydrocarbons, none of the wells were considered a commercial discovery.\n\nNotice to terminate the Production Sharing Contract for Myanmar Block A-7 was accepted by Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise on 23 November 2021. The e/ffective date is 30 September 2021 with the formal relinquishment process on-going.\n\nOn 27 January 2022 Woodside announced its decision to withdraw from its interests in Myanmar.\n\nLocation of SNE North-2 o/ffshore Senegal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We manage our LNG portfolio through a mix of short-, mid- and long-term contracts, supplied by Woodside and cargoes purchased from third parties. This combination of di/fferent arrangements within our LNG portfolio enables operational flexibility to capitalise on changing market conditions as they occur. In 2021 Woodside supplied 8.6 million tonnes of LNG from both produced volumes and purchased Corpus Christi volumes.\n\nOur trading and optimisation activity significantly increased in 2021 reaching its highest level, driven by favourable commodity price levels and volatile market conditions. Our LNG portfolio approach enables sales commitments to be met from produced and purchased o/fftake, allowing optimisation of both our portfolio o/fftake and our shipping fleet to maximise value. Portfolio optimisation activities include the purchase and on-sale of third-party cargoes to extract additional value, which has enabled Woodside to increase exposure to gas hub indices at higher price levels.\n\nGas hub exposure is the proportion of produced equity LNG volumes expected to be sold on gas hub indices such as JKM, TTF and UK National Balancing Point. Henry Hub is excluded from the calculation. In 2021 our produced LNG sold on gas hub indices was approximately 16% and we expect approximately 20-25% of our produced LNG to be sold on gas hub indices in 2022.\n\n## Liquids marketing\n\nWoodside has built its liquids marketing capability to optimise value from its oil portfolio. The marketing of crude, condensate and LPG is based on short-term sales, and may be supplemented by term arrangements.\n\nWoodside achieved record premiums to Dated Brent for three cargoes in 2021; a Vincent crude cargo produced from the Ngujima-Yin FPSO, which targeted low sulphur fuel oil blenders as opposed to traditional refineries, and two Wheatstone condensate cargoes resulting from strengthening regional condensate demand.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Development of Scarborough will include the installation of a floating production unit with eight wells drilled in the initial phase and thirteen wells drilled over the life of the Scarborough field. The gas will be transported to the existing Pluto LNG facility through a new approximately 430 km trunkline.\n\nExpansion of Pluto LNG will include the construction of a second LNG train, associated domestic gas processing facilities, supporting infrastructure and modifications to Pluto Train 1 to allow it to process Scarborough gas. The composition of gas from the Scarborough field is well suited to Pluto LNG which is designed for lean gas and nitrogen removal. An area for a second train was pre-prepared when the foundation project was built, with minimal earthworks required for Pluto Train 2.\n\nDuring 2021, Woodside completed key activities to support the final investment decisions. This included entering into a sale and purchase agreement with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for the sale of a 49% non-operating participating interest in the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture. The transaction included a number of other related agreements\n\nbetween Woodside and GIP, including a project commitment agreement. The transaction completed on 18 January 2022.\n\nWoodside is continuing the sell-down process for Scarborough, targeting an operating equity interest of 51% or greater in the Scarborough Joint Venture.\n\nWoodside continues to work with Traditional Custodians to identify, manage and protect heritage. In 2021 an independent ethnographic assessment found no ethnographic sites within the proposed Scarborough development area. This, coupled with an archaeological assessment that did not find any prospective submerged archaeological locations likely to be impacted by the project, supports there being a nil to low likelihood of submerged heritage in the development area.\n\nAll key primary environmental approvals to support the final investment decisions are in place, with secondary environmental approvals progressing to support project execution activities.\n\nWoodside's Pluto Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program (GGAP) was approved by the Western Australian Minister for Environment.

The hub has the potential to reduce emissions, acting as a catalyst to new net zero industries that can continue throughout the energy transition.\n\nIn November, Woodside, bp and Japan Australia LNG (MIMI) Pty Ltd agreed to form a consortium to progress feasibility studies for a large-scale, multi-user carbon capture and storage (CCS) project near Karratha in Western Australia.\n\nThe consortium will assess the technical, regulatory and commercial feasibility of capturing carbon emitted by multiple industries located near Karratha and storing it in o/ffshore reservoirs in the Northern Carnarvon Basin. The study represents an important step towards the development of one of Australia's first multi-user CCS projects, ideally located to aggregate emissions from various existing sources.\n\n- /one.num Target is for net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, relative to a starting base of the gross annual average equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over 2016-2020 and may be adjusted (up or down) for potential equity changes in producing or sanctioned assets with an FID prior to 2021. Post-completion of the Woodside and BHP petroleum merger (which remains subject to conditions including regulatory approvals), the starting base will be adjusted for the then combined Woodside and BHP petroleum portfolio. Assumes equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are as currently forecast in Woodside's business plan.\n- /two.num Further information on the cost of o/ffsets is available in our Climate Report 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are committed to managing risks in a proactive and e/ffective manner as a source of competitive advantage.\n\nWe apply a structured and comprehensive approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of current risks and in response to emerging risks. Our risk management framework provides a single consolidated view of risks across the company to quantify our full risk exposure and prioritise risk management and governance.\n\nThe framework is aligned with the intent of the International Standard ISO31000 for risk management, providing line of sight of risk at appropriate levels of the organisation, including the executive team and the Board, based on defined materiality thresholds. Our assessment of risk considers both financial and non-financial exposures, including health and safety, environment, finance, reputation and brand, legal and compliance, social and culture.\n\nA twice yearly review by the executive team and the Board evaluates the strategic risk profile, and the e/ffectiveness of material current risks being managed across the business.\n\nUncertainty in the external environment has increased in 2021 such as growing geopolitical concerns and nationalism, increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber and digital related attacks, continuing global and domestic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher and evolving societal and stakeholder expectations (notably on environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics). We continually monitor external signals to ensure we are able to adapt our strategies, or review and improve the controls we rely on, to e/ffectively and e/fficiently manage our exposure to risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to Woodside's Corporate Governance Statement for more information ( woodside.com.au/about-us/ corporate-governance ).\n\nThe Board reviewed and confirmed in 2021 that the risk management framework is sound, and that Woodside is operating with due regard to the risk appetite endorsed by the Board.\n\n## Social Licence to Operate\n\nStakeholders have higher and evolving expectations of Woodside's social responsibility, with a focus on transparency and ethical decision making. In 2021 the release of 'Our Risk and Compliance Behaviours' framework helped our leaders at all levels of the organisation, by reinforcing the positive behaviours and actions to influence decision making, realise opportunity and support sustainable long-term performance consistent with our Vision and Compass values.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to our Sustainable Development Report 2021 for more information on ESG.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower-carbon economy influences Woodside's strategy, presenting both risk and opportunity in the operation of our existing assets or commercialisation of our growth portfolio.\n\nWe leverage our risk management framework to ensure an integrated and coordinated approach to the management of climate change across the business. The risks posed by the transition to a lower-carbon economy are recognised given changes in policy, regulation or social expectations in current or future markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to our Climate Report 2021 for more information.",

On average, 99% of Woodside's Proved Reserves have been externally verified by independent review over the past four years.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, all petroleum resource estimates are quoted as net Woodside share at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 pounds per square inch (psi) (101.325 kPa) and sixty degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n\n## Qualified Petroleum Reserves and Resource Evaluator Statement\n\nThe estimates of petroleum resources are based on and fairly represent information and supporting documentation prepared under the supervision of and approved by Mr Jason Greenwald, Woodside's Vice President Reservoir Management, who is a full-time employee of the company and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Mr Greenwald's qualifications include a Bachelor of Science (Chemical Engineering) from Rice University, Houston, Texas, and more than 20 years of relevant experience.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Reserves and Resource Statement\n\n- 1. 'Reserves' are estimated quantities of petroleum that have been demonstrated to be producible from known accumulations in which the company has a material interest from a given date forward, at commercial rates, under presently anticipated production methods, operating conditions, prices and costs.\n- 2. 'Contingent resources' are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied project(s) are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies. Contingent resources may include, for example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, or where evaluation of the accumulation is insu/fficient to clearly assess commerciality. Woodside reports contingent resources net of the fuel and flare required for production, processing and transportation up to a reference point and non-hydrocarbons not present in sales products. Contingent resources estimates may not always mature to reserves and do not necessarily represent future reserves bookings. Contingent resource volumes are reported at the 'Best Estimate' (P50) confidence level.\n- 3. Assessment of the economic value of the project, in support of a reserves classification, uses Woodside Portfolio Economic Assumptions (PEAs). The PEAs are reviewed on an annual basis or more often if required. The review is based on historical data and forecast estimates for economic variables such as product prices and exchange rates. The PEAs are approved by the Woodside Board. Specific contractual arrangements for individual projects are also taken into account.\n- 4. Woodside uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods for estimation of petroleum resources at the field and project levels. Unless otherwise stated, all petroleum estimates reported at the company or region level are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category. Note that the aggregated Proved level may be a very conservative estimate due to the portfolio e/ffects of arithmetic summation. Probabilistic aggregation at field and project level is more appropriate than arithmetic summation as inter-field dependencies reflecting di/fferent reservoir characteristics between fields are incorporated.\n- 5. Woodside reports reserves net of the fuel and flare required for production, processing and transportation up to a reference point. For o/ffshore oil projects, the reference point is defined as the outlet of the floating production storage and o/ffloading facility (FPSO), while for the onshore gas projects the reference point is defined as the inlet to the downstream (onshore) processing facility. Downstream fuel and flare represent 10.0% of Woodside's Proved (Developed and Undeveloped) reserves, and 9.9% of Proved plus Probable (Developed and Undeveloped) reserves.\n- 6. 'Dry gas' is defined as 'C4 minus' petroleum components including non-hydrocarbons. These volumes include LPG (propane and butane) resources. Dry gas reserves and contingent resources include 'C4 minus' hydrocarbon components and non-hydrocarbon volumes that are present in sales product.\n- 7. 'Condensate' is defined as 'C5 plus' petroleum components.\n- 8. 'Bcf' means Billions (10/nine.num) of cubic feet of gas at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and sixty degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n- 9. 'MMbbl' means millions (10/six.num) of barrels of oil and condensate at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and sixty degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n- 10. 'MMboe' means millions (10/six.num) of barrels of oil equivalent. Dry gas volumes, defined as 'C4 minus' hydrocarbon components and nonhydrocarbon volumes that are present in sales product, are converted to oil equivalent volumes via a constant conversion factor, which for Woodside is 5.7 Bcf of dry gas per 1 MMboe. Volumes of oil and condensate, defined as 'C5 plus' petroleum components, are converted from MMbbl to MMboe on a 1:1 ratio.\n- 11. 'Proved reserves' are those reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests, to a high degree of confidence that the quantities are recoverable. Where probabilistic methods are used, there is at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated Proved (1P) reserves.\n- 12. 'Probable reserves' are those reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. Proved plus Probable reserves represent the best estimate of recoverable quantities. Where probabilistic methods are used, there is at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated Proved plus Probable (2P) reserves.\n- 13. 'Developed reserves' are those reserves that are producible through currently existing completions and installed facilities for treatment, compression, transportation and delivery, using existing operating methods and standards.\n- 14. 'Undeveloped reserves' are those reserves for which wells and facilities have not been installed or executed but are expected to be recovered through future investments.\n- 15. The 'reserves replacement ratio' is the reserves (Developed and Undeveloped) change during the year, before the deduction of production, divided by production during the year. The 'three-year reserves replacement ratio' is the reserves (Developed and Undeveloped) change over three years, before the deduction of production for that period, divided by production during the same period.\n- 16. The 'organic annual reserves replacement ratio' is the reserves (Developed and Undeveloped) change during the year, before the deduction of production and adjustment for acquisition and divestments, divided by production during the year.\n- 17. The 'reserves life' is the reserves (Developed and Undeveloped) divided by production during the year.\n- 18. 'Annual production' is the volume of dry gas, condensate and oil produced during the year and converted to 'MMboe' for the specific purpose of reserves reconciliation and the calculation of reserves replacement ratios. The 'Reserves and Resources Statement' annual production di/ffers from production volumes reported in the company's annual and quarterly reports due to di/fferences between the sales and reserves product definitions, di/fferences between the Woodside equity share of NWS domestic gas production and independently marketed pipeline gas sales, reserves being reported gross of downstream fuel and flare and the 'MMboe' conversion factors applied.\n- 19. 'Revision of Previous Estimates' are revisions (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of reserves or contingent resources, which are a result from new information normally obtained from development drilling, field re-interpretation, production performance, or are the result of a change in economic factors including any change in Woodside net revenue interest not arising from acquisition or divestment. This change category is associated with absolute changes to the resource estimates associated with the a/ffected reference projects but excludes re-classification changes.\n- 20. 'Transfer to/from Reserves' are revisions that represent changes (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of reserves or contingent resources, which are a result of re-classification of resource estimates (i.e. from reserves to contingent resources or vice versa) associated with one or more reference project(s).\n- 21. 'Extensions and discoveries' represent additions to reserves or contingent resources that result from increased areal extensions of previously discovered fields demonstrated to exist subsequent to the original discovery and/or discovery of reserves or contingent resource in new fields or new reservoirs in old fields.\n- 22. 'Acquisitions and Divestments' represent changes to resource entitlement (either upward or downward) that result from either purchase or sale of interests and/or execution of contracts conveying entitlement.\n- 23. Material concentrations of undeveloped reserves in the North West Shelf, Greater Pluto and Julimar-Brunello region(s) have remained undeveloped for longer than 5 years from the dates they were initially reported as the incremental reserves are expected to be recovered through future developments to meet long-term contractual commitments. The incremental projects are included in the company business plan, demonstrating the intent to proceed with the developments.\n- 24. The 'Greater Pluto' region comprises the Pluto-Xena, Pyxis, Larsen, Martell, Martin, Noblige and Remy fields.\n- 25. The 'North West Shelf' (NWS) region includes all oil and gas fields within the North West Shelf Project Area.\n- 26. The 'Greater Exmouth' region comprises Vincent, Enfield, Greater Enfield, Greater Laverda, Ragnar and Toro fields.\n- 27. The 'Julimar-Brunello' region comprises the Julimar and Brunello fields.\n- 28. The 'Senegal' region comprises the Sangomar field. The Developed and Undeveloped reserves comprise of oil estimates. The Best Estimate (2C) Contingent resources include gas and oil estimates.\n- 29. The 'Greater Browse' region comprises the Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa fields.\n- 30. The 'Greater Scarborough' region comprises the Jupiter, Scarborough and Thebe fields.\n- 31. The 'Greater Sunrise' region comprises the Sunrise and Troubadour fields.\n- 32. The 'Myanmar' region comprises the fields within the A-6 development. The Myanmar Best Estimate Contingent Resource (2C) of 109.5 MMboe is referenced at 31 December 2021. Woodside announced its decision to withdraw from its interests in Myanmar on 27 January 2022.\n- 33. The 'Canada' region comprises unconventional resources in the Liard Basin. The increase in Liard Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources at 31 December 2021 is due to Woodside assuming full equity in 28 noninfrastructure related Liard Basin leases from Chevron Canada.\n- 34. The Julimar-Brunello and Greater Pluto reserves estimates in this statement di/ffer from the estimates reported in the 21 October 2021 and 5 November 2021 reserves updates, due to the impact of full year production.",

        "page_content": "## Committee Chair's letter\n\n17 February 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDear Shareholders\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nIn 2021 we maintained reliable operations, started up new projects and leveraged favourable market conditions to achieve strong earnings outcomes. We took significant steps to support long-term sustainable returns for shareholders, entering into a binding share sale agreement for the merger with BHP's oil and gas portfolio and taking FIDs on Scarborough and Pluto Train 2. We progressed a portfolio of new energy opportunities and completed our largest ever planned maintenance campaign.\n\n2021 was also a challenging year in which we saw disappointing safety performance compared to our strong results in 2019 and 2020. We fell short of our internal production targets, although results were in line with market guidance.\n\nThese results are reflected in our 2021 Executive remuneration outcomes, as outlined below and in further detail in this report.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\n2021 marked the fourth year since the introduction of the EIS. Changes were made to the Corporate Scorecard for 2021 to strengthen the link between Executive reward and shareholder experience.\n\nThe 2021 Corporate Scorecard was based on the following five equally weighted metrics, with two new financial metrics introduced in place of NPAT:\n\n- \u00b7  Operating Expenditure - 20% (New in 2021)\n- \u00b7  Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) - 20% (New in 2021)\n- \u00b7  Production - 20%\n- \u00b7  Material Sustainability Issues - 20%\n- \u00b7  Delivery against Business Priorities - 20%\n\nWe describe Executive KMP performance and pay outcomes in this report (pages 81-82). This includes discussion of Executives' performance against carbon-related measures which impact award outcomes. Woodside adopted a specific measure for net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction for the first time in the 2021 Corporate Scorecard. We will continue to enhance reporting of remuneration outcomes linked to climate metrics as we progress lower carbon solutions and our new energy portfolio.\n\nThe take home pay table is on page 83.\n\nThe EIS continues to achieve remuneration outcomes which fairly reflect Woodside's performance and are strongly linked to the creation of value for shareholders. There are no material changes to the EIS structure anticipated for 2022.\n\n## Proposed Merger\n\nThe merger with BHP's oil and gas portfolio represents a substantial opportunity for Woodside and its shareholders and is expected to involve updates to our Remuneration Policy including how we benchmark Executive reward, reflecting changes to Executive roles and accountabilities. The international peer group used to measure RTSR performance for equity components of future Executive awards will be reviewed to maintain alignment with Woodside's expanded global business activities.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed preliminary plans for a new senior management structure and the transition of several BHP executives to the EIS on merger completion. The transition will be aimed at ensuring Woodside can continue to attract and retain executive capability in a globally competitive market.\n\n## Business Performance\n\n2021 has been a year of substantial progress for Woodside as it maintains safe and e/fficient operations in a COVID-19-challenged environment, progressing a binding share sale agreement for the merger with BHP's oil and gas portfolio and the FIDs for Scarborough and Pluto Train 2. It is pleasing that the focus on delivering a successful merger has not diverted attention away from other business priorities, including progress on new energy opportunities.\n\nThe company's EBITDA for 2021 was above target at $4,135 million, primarily due to significantly improved market pricing for Woodside's products and activities focussed on optimising value from this.\n\nOperating expenditure failed to meet the target of A$1,000 million, primarily due to costs associated with merger activities, partially o/ffset by lower production costs.\n\nProduction for 2021 was within the range but below target at 91.1 MMboe. Performance was lower largely due to weather impacts.\n\nSafety performance has been a disappointment, with a TRIR of 1.74 which exceeded the target of 1.0. Performance against the remaining Material Sustainability Issues was strong, with no Tier 1 or Tier 2 Process Safety Events occurring and year-end emissions abatement of 80.1kT CO/two.den-e, more than double the annual baseline target.\n\nOur overall Corporate Scorecard was above target at 6 out of 10.",

Details of the treatment of Mr Coleman's unvested equity incentives and his pro-rata 2021 EIS award are on page 80 of this report.\n\nMeg O'Neill was appointed as Acting CEO on 20 April 2021, during the Board's internal and external CEO search, and was subsequently appointed Woodside's CEO and Managing Director on 17 August 2021. Ms O'Neill's FAR on appointment was A$2,200,000 with a target value for VAR set at A$4,400,000.

This was the second test for the 2015 award which resulted in 9.2% partial vesting. Overall, 47.5% of the 2015 award vested. This was the first test for the 2016 award and resulted in 63% vesting.\n- \u00b7  No fee increases for the non-executive directors.\n\nThe Board has reviewed the 2021 EIS outcomes and considers that they align with overall corporate performance.\n\n## 2021 Committee Activities\n\nKey activities undertaken by the Committee during the year included reviewing the company's remuneration policies and practices and changes for Executives who report directly to the CEO and moved roles or reporting structures, including the appointment and remuneration packages of those Executives.\n\nThe Committee considered activities to assess and monitor culture, including across all areas of our Integrated Culture Framework (values, safety, risk and compliance). This included ensuring a robust approach to bullying and harassment in the workplace and endorsing a new Working Respectfully Policy.\n\nThe Committee oversaw implementation of the 2021-2025 inclusion and diversity strategy and reviewed progress against the key performance measures. Details of Woodside's performance against the inclusion and diversity strategy in 2021 are available on pages 53-64 of the Sustainable Development Report 2021.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Board has been proud of the leadership and collaboration shown by our employees during this significant phase of growth, including progressing the merger with BHP's oil and gas portfolio and transforming the way we work in response to the energy transition.\n\nOur employees continued to respond strongly to the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic in ensuring the safety of our employees and the ongoing performance of our assets.\n\nWe look forward to our ongoing engagement with Woodside's shareholders and sharing in Woodside's future success.\n\nYours sincerely\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gene Tilbrook\n\nChair of Human Resources & Compensation Committee",

We are managing our business by focusing on the energy transition through: the provision of natural gas; the decarbonisation of our business; and incremental investment in targeted new energy businesses with prospective exponential growth, such as hydrogen and the development of new, valuecreating projects. To do so, the company must be able to attract and retain executive capability in a globally competitive market. The Board structures remuneration so that it rewards those who perform, is valued by Executives, and is aligned with the company's Compass, strategic direction and the creation of enduring value to shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nFixed Annual Reward (FAR) is determined having regard to the scope of each Executive's role and their level of knowledge, skills and experience.\n\nVariable Annual Reward (VAR) at target is structured to reward the Executives for achieving challenging yet realistic targets set by the Board which deliver short-term and longterm returns for the company. VAR aligns shareholder and executive remuneration outcomes by ensuring a significant portion of executive remuneration is at risk, while rewarding performance.\n\nExecutive remuneration is reviewed annually, having regard to the accountabilities, experience and performance of the individual. FAR and VAR are compared against domestic and international competitors at target, to maintain Woodside's capacity to attract and retain talent and to ensure appropriate motivation is provided to Executives to deliver on the company's strategic objectives.\n\n## 2021 remuneration changes\n\nFollowing feedback from our investors, we implemented changes for 2021 to our Corporate Scorecard and the weighting of individual and corporate performance which determine executive VAR. The change strengthened the connection between corporate performance, executive reward and shareholder experience.\n\nAn Executive's award is based on their individual performance against KPIs and the company's performance against the Corporate Scorecard. Individual performance measures are designed to ensure Executives focus on driving Woodside's culture and the values and behaviours that underpin our success whilst executing Woodside's strategic imperatives.\n\nIndividual performance is weighted at 30% and corporate performance is weighted at 70% to determine an Executive's final performance outcome and reward.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Corporate Scorecard\n\nIn 2021, the overall weighting of the financial metrics increased from 25% (based on NPAT) to 40% (EBITDA and Operating Expenditure).\n\nThe 2021 Corporate Scorecard for Executive KMP was based on five equally weighted measures that were chosen because they impact short-term and long-term shareholder value, with a score of 5 for an outcome at target and a maximum score of 10 on each measure. The Corporate Scorecard is the same for all employees to enable Executives to drive performance at all levels of the organisation. The 2022 Corporate Scorecard is expected to be based on the same five equally weighted measures.\n\n## Individual Performance\n\nIndividual performance is assessed by the Board in the case of the CEO, and by the CEO and the Human Resources & Compensation Committee in the case of Senior Executives.\n\nThe Board has strong oversight and governance to ensure that appropriate and challenging targets are set to create a clear link between performance and reward. The Board has an overriding discretion which it can and does exercise to adjust outcomes in line with shareholder experience and company or management performance.",

Exceeding targets may result in an increased award, whereas under-performance will result\n\nin a reduced award. The minimum award that an Executive can receive is zero if the performance conditions are not achieved.\n\nThe decision to pay or allocate an EIS award is subject to the overriding discretion of the Board, which may adjust outcomes to better reflect shareholder outcomes and company or management performance.\n\nSee pages 81-82 for details of the CEO's and Senior Executives' individual performance assessement.",

        "page_content": "## Target variable reward opportunity for 2021\n\nEach Executive is given a target VAR opportunity and a maximum VAR opportunity which is a percentage of the Executive's FAR. The opportunities for 2021 are outlined below.\n\n| Position          | Minimum opportunity  (% of FAR)   |   Target opportunity  (% of FAR) |   Maximum opportunity  (% of FAR) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| CEO               | Zero                              |                              200 |                               300 |\n| Senior Executives | Zero                              |                              160 |                               256 |\n\n## Cash\n\nThe cash component represents 12.5% of the VAR and is payable following the end of the performance year.\n\n## Restricted Shares\n\nThe Restricted Shares are divided into two tranches. The first tranche is 27.5% of the award and subject to a three-year deferral period. The second tranche is 30% of the award and subject to a five-year deferral period. There are no further performance conditions attached to these awards. This element creates a strong retention proposition for Executives as vesting is subject to employment not being terminated with cause or by resignation during the deferral period. The deferral ensures that awards remain subject to fluctuations in share price across the three and five-year periods, which is intended to reflect the sustainability of performance over the medium-term and long-term and support increased alignment between Executives and shareholders.\n\n## Performance Rights\n\nThe Performance Rights are divided into two portions with each portion subject to a separate RTSR performance hurdle tested over a five-year period. Performance is tested after five years as Woodside operates in a capital intensive industry with long investment timelines. It is imperative that Executives take decisions in the long-term interest of shareholders, focused on value creation across the commodity price cycles of the oil and gas industry. Our view is that RTSR is the best measure of long-term value creation across the commodity price cycle of our industry.\n\nOne-third of the Performance Rights are tested against a comparator group that comprises the entities within the ASX 50 index at 1 December 2021. The remaining two-thirds are tested against an international group of oil and gas companies, set out in Table 11 on page 88.\n\nRTSR outcomes are calculated by an external adviser on or after the fifth anniversary of the allocation of the Performance Rights. The outcome of the test is measured against the schedule below. For EIS awards, any Performance Rights that do not vest will lapse and are not retested.\n\n## RTSR PERFORMANCE HURDLE VESTING\n\n| Woodside RTSR percentile position within peer group   | Vesting of Performance Rights   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Less than 50 th  percentile                           | No vesting                      |\n| Equal to 50 th  percentile                            | 50% vest                        |\n| Vesting between the 50 th  and 75 th  percentile      | Vesting on a pro-rata basis     |\n| Equal to or greater than 75 th  percentile            | 100% vest                       |\n\n## CEO target remuneration\n\n## Senior Executive target remuneration\n\nFIXED REWARD 33 %\n\nFIXED REWARD 38 %\n\nVARIABLE REWARD 67 %\n\nVARIABLE REWARD 62 %",

EBITDA is closely aligned with short-term shareholder value creation. EBITDA is underpinned by e/fficient operational performance and outcomes are exposed to the upside and downside of oil price and foreign exchange fluctuations, as are returns to shareholders.\n\n## 2021 Performance:\n\nEBITDA was $4,135 million, significantly above the target of $2,908 million due to strong operational performance and higher realised oil and gas pricing, through proactive decisions to manage our sales portfolio and successful completion of Pluto LNG price reviews.\n\n## Production (20%)\n\nMID-POINT\n\nMAX\n\nOUTCOME\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRevenue is maximised and value generated from Woodside's assets when they are fully utilised in production. Production must be carefully managed throughout the year to optimise value from the assets. The production target is set relative to the company's annual budget and market guidance and is not revised through the year.\n\n## 2021 Performance:\n\n2021 production was 91.1 MMboe, lower than the 92.6 MMboe internal target, due to weather impacts and equipment reliability. Production performance was in line with market guidance of 90-95 MMboe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board considers performance across material sustainability issues including personal and process safety, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and our social licence to operate. Strong performance in this area creates and protects value in four ways; it reduces the likelihood of major accident events and catastrophic losses; it maintains Woodside's licence to operate which enables the development of its growth portfolio; it reflects e/fficient, optimised and controlled business processes that generate value; and it supports the company's position as a partner of choice.\n\n## 2021 Performance:\n\nSafety performance was disappointing in 2021, with a TRIR of 1.74 significantly above the target of 1.0. No Tier 1 or 2 Process Safety Events were recorded and year-end emissions abatement of 80.1 kT CO/two.den-e was more than double the target of 36 kT CO/two.den-e.\n\n## Delivery against Business Priorities (20%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMAX\n\nOUTCOME\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we focused on key business priorities supporting delivery of long-term shareholder value; safe and reliable base business; advancing our growth projects (Scarborough, Pluto Train 2 and Sangomar) and maturing future opportunities.\n\n## 2021 Performance:\n\n## Merger with BHP Petroleum\n\n- \u00b7  In addition to the key Business Priorities, merger announced with BHP's oil and gas portfolio to deliver increased scale, diversity and resilience; provide financial strength to help fund planned developments in the near-term and invest in future energy opportunities and return value to shareholders through the cycle.\n\n## Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 Final Investment Decisions\n\n- \u00b7  Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) for Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 developments approved\n- \u00b7  Sale and purchase agreement with Global Infrastructure Partners for 49% interest in the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture\n- \u00b7  Fully termed processing and services agreement to process Scarborough gas through Pluto LNG facilities\n- \u00b7  Issued full notice to proceed to key Scarborough contractors for o/ffshore project execution\n\n## Sangomar\n\n- \u00b7  Sangomar Field Development Phase 1 48% complete and on track for targeted first oil in 2023\n- \u00b7  Drilling commenced in July, first well completed\n- \u00b7  Subsea o/ffshore construction campaign: Vessel mobilisation deferred to Q1 2022 for cost and schedule optimisation\n- \u00b7  Sales process launched and management presentations underway\n\n## Future Opportunities\n\n- \u00b7  US H2OK 290MW FEED entry decision\n- \u00b7  Heliogen 5MW FID approved\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Executive KMP KPIs and outcomes for 2021\n\n## CEO KPIs and outcomes\n\nIn August 2021, Meg O'Neill was appointed CEO and Managing Director. Ms O'Neill had been Acting CEO since 20 April 2021 following Peter Coleman's retirement.\n\nMs O'Neill's incentive arrangements are governed under the EIS.\n\n## FAR\n\nMs O'Neill's FAR was increased to A$2,200,000 on appointment to CEO and Managing Director. The FAR for Ms O'Neill is 18.5 per cent less than the FAR paid to her predecessor, Mr Coleman. The Board considers that Ms O'Neill's remuneration is competitive and benchmarks appropriately to peer companies. It is anticipated that the CEO's remuneration will be reviewed following completion of the merger of Woodside and BHP's oil and gas portfolios.\n\nUpon Ms O'Neill's appointment to CEO and Managing Director, the Board approved the accelerated vesting of 37,048 Restricted Shares as set out in Table 12 on page 89. Each vested Restricted Share entitled Ms O'Neill to receive one Woodside share.\n\n## VAR\n\nFor 2021, the individual performance of the CEO was reviewed by the Board against five equally weighted measures. These metrics, outlined in Table 4, were chosen because successful performance in each area is a key driver of superior shareholder returns.\n\nThe same metrics were cascaded to the Senior Executives to measure individual performance.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Board reviews the CEO's performance for that year. The CEO is given an individual performance score of between 0 and 1.6, which together with the Corporate Scorecard outcome results in an IPF. The CEO's overall IPF for 2021 resulted in an award of 75.6% of maximum opportunity.\n\nThe 2021 EIS award for the CEO is detailed in Table 7 on page 84.\n\nInformation on the individual performance of the CEO is shown in Table 4 on page 81.\n\n## Former CEO and Managing Director\n\nPeter Coleman ceased to be CEO and Managing Director on 19 April 2021 and departed Woodside on 3 June 2021. In accordance with the terms of his contract, Mr Coleman is eligible for a 2021 EIS award for the period in which he remained in service. The 2021 award for Mr Coleman is detailed in Table 7 on page 84.\n\nMr Coleman was key to the delivery of a number of achievements in 2021 including the approval of FIDs for the Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 developments. He facilitated a smooth transition of CEO and Managing Director to\n\nMs O'Neill. Mr Coleman's EIS award earned as a percentage of maximum opportunity is 72%. The Board exercised its discretion to award Mr Coleman cash in lieu of the Restricted Shares component of his EIS award. The Performance Rights component of the award is subject to a three-year deferral period with a RTSR test three years after the date of allocation.\n\nNo termination payments were made on cessation of Mr Coleman's employment, other than a payment in lieu of a portion of his contractual notice period and his statutory leave entitlements. Amounts payable to Mr Coleman in 2021 are shown in Table 10 on page 88.\n\n## Senior Executive FAR\n\nIn August 2021, Woodside conducted a review of Senior Executive remuneration based on benchmarking data against a defined peer group alongside the consideration of executive performance and role accountabilities. The Committee approved the continued freeze on FAR and considers that Senior Executive remuneration remains competitive. Senior Executive remuneration will be reviewed following completion of the merger of Woodside and BHP's oil and gas portfolios to ensure it remains competitive and appropriate given any changes in role scope and accountabilities.\n\n## Senior Executive VAR and other incentives\n\nFor 2021, the individual performance of each Senior Executive was evaluated against the same performance measures as the CEO, with individual KPIs set relevant to each Senior Executive's area of responsibility. These metrics aim to align individual performance with the achievement of Woodside's corporate strategy while fostering collaboration between Executives.\n\nThe Board approved EIS awards to Senior Executives based on the Corporate Scorecard result and their individual performance assessment, resulting in an IPF between 0 and 1.6.\n\nInformation on the individual performance of Executives who were KMP as at 31 December 2021 is shown in Table 4 on page 82. Details of the EIS award for each Senior Executive are set out in Table 7 on page 84.\n\nMs Duhe was not eligible for a 2021 EIS award as she resigned during the period. No individual performance assessment has been included for Ms Duhe.\n\nFor 2021, Woodside made one-o/ff cash bonus payments to two Executive KMP, Shaun Gregory (A$170,700) and Ms Duhe (two payments totaling A$220,000), in connection with discretionary e/fforts related the merger with BHP's oil and gas portfolio and the Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 FIDs. These payments are detailed in Table 5 on page 83 and Table 10 on page 88.",

The grant date for Mr P Coleman has been determined to be the date of shareholder approval at the 2021 Woodside Annual General Meeting.

The terms applying to prior year grants are described in past Woodside Annual Reports.\n\n## Executive Incentive Plan (EIP)\n\nThe EIP operated as Woodside's Executive incentive framework until the end of 2017, after which the Board introduced the EIS. The EIP was used to deliver short-term award (STA) and long-term award (LTA) to Senior Executives.\n\nEligible Executives could only receive an STA award if their individual annual performance was assessed as acceptable. Participants were then divided into 'Pool Groups', with the size of the pool determined by each participant's target STA, and then adjusted based on the Corporate Scorecard result.\n\nSTA made up 30-33% of total target remuneration for Senior Executives with no individual maximum STA opportunity because the size of the STA pool varied from year to year depending on performance and other factors. LTA was granted in the form of Variable Pay Rights (VPRs) making up 20-22% of total target remuneration for Senior Executives.\n\nThe LTA award was divided into two portions with each portion subject to a separate RTSR performance hurdle tested over a four-year period. One-third of the LTA is tested against a comparator group that comprises the entities within the ASX 50 index. The remaining two-thirds is tested against an international group of oil and gas companies.\n\nRTSR outcomes are calculated by an external adviser on the fourth anniversary of the allocation. For 2017 awards to Senior Executives, any VPRs that do not vest will lapse and are not retested. Awards made to other Executives are eligible for a retest in the following year. VPRs that do not vest following the re-test will lapse. 2017 is the last year of award to which a retest applies.\n\nExecutives are entitled to receive dividends on Restricted Shares. There is no entitlement to dividends on VPRs. Details of prior year allocations are provided in Table 12 on pages 89-90.\n\n## Peter Coleman's STA and LTA\n\nThe former CEO's incentive arrangements are governed by his contract of employment. Prior to 2018, the former CEO's STA award was determined by multiplying the former CEO's FAR by the Corporate Scorecard result and the former CEO's individual performance factor as determined by the Board. Two-thirds of the award was paid in cash with the remaining third delivered as a deferred equity award of Restricted Shares, subject to an overall cap of two times FAR.",

    {
        "page_content": "For 2017, the LTA opportunity was set at 133% of the former CEO's FAR. The entitlement was allocated at face value and in the form of VPRs and divided into two portions with each subject to a separate RTSR performance hurdle tested over a four year period with no retest. One-third of the LTA will be tested against a comparator group that comprises the entities within the ASX 50 index. The remaining two-thirds will be tested against an international group of oil and gas companies.\n\nDetails of prior year allocations are provided in Table 12 on pages 89-90.\n\n## Woodside Equity Plan (WEP)\n\nThe WEP is available to all permanent employees except EIS participants. The purpose of the WEP is to enable eligible employees to build up a holding of equity in the company as they progress through their career at Woodside.\n\nThe number of Equity Rights (ERs) o/ffered to each eligible employee is determined by the Board, and based on individual performance as assessed under the performance review process. There are no further ongoing performance conditions.\n\nThe linking of performance to an allocation allows Woodside to recognise and reward eligible employees for high performance.\n\nEach ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date three or five years after the e/ffective grant date.\n\nFor o/ffers prior to 2019, each ER entitled the participant to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date three years after the e/ffective grant date. For subsequent awards, the Board amended the terms of the Plan to allow for 75% vesting of the ERs three years after the e/ffective grant date and the remaining 25% of ERs five years after the e/ffective grant date.\n\n## Supplementary Woodside Equity Plan (SWEP)\n\nIn October 2011, the Board approved a remuneration strategy which includes the use of equity to support a competitive base remuneration position. To this end, the Board approved the establishment of the SWEP to enable the o/ffering of targeted retention awards of ERs for key capability.\n\nThe SWEP was designed to be o/ffered to a small number of employees identified as being retention critical. The SWEP awards have service conditions and no performance conditions. Each ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date three years after the e/ffective grant date.\n\nThere were no allocations under the SWEP in 2021. None of the Senior Executives have unvested SWEP ERs at the end of 2021.\n\nERs under both the WEP and the SWEP may vest prior to the vesting date on a change of control or on a pro-rata basis, at the discretion of the CEO, limited to the following circumstances; redundancy, retirement (after six months' participation), death, termination due to illness or incapacity or total and permanent disablement of a participating employee. An employee whose employment is terminated by resignation or for cause prior to the vesting date will forfeit all of their ERs.\n\n## Minimum Shareholding Requirements (MSR) Policy\n\nThe Executive MSR policy reflects the long-term focus of management and aims to further strengthen alignment with shareholders.\n\nThe policy requires Senior Executives to have acquired and maintained Woodside shares for a minimum total purchase price of at least 100% of their fixed remuneration after a period of five years, and in the case of the CEO a minimum of 200% of fixed remuneration.\n\n## Other equity awards\n\nIn February 2018, the Board approved the Equity Award Rules which apply to EIS and discretionary executive allocations. This allows the Board and CEO to award discretionary allocations of Restricted Shares or Performance Rights.\n\n## Contracts for Executive KMP\n\nEach Executive KMP has a contract of employment. Table 8 below contains a summary of the key contractual provisions of the contracts of employment for the continuing Executive KMP.\n\nTABLE 8 - SUMMARY OF CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS FOR EXECUTIVE KMP\n\n|             | Employing company   | Contract duration   | Termination notice  period company 1, 2   | Termination notice  period executive   |\n|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| M O'Neill 3 | Woodside Energy Ltd | Unlimited           | 6 months                                  | 6 months                               |\n| S Gregory 3 | Woodside Energy Ltd | Unlimited           | 6 months                                  | 3 months                               |\n| F Hick 3    | Woodside Energy Ltd | Unlimited           | 6 months                                  | 3 months                               |\n\n- /one.num Woodside may choose to terminate the contract immediately by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the fixed remuneration the Executive KMP would have received during the 'Company Notice Period'. In the event of termination for serious misconduct or other nominated circumstances, Executive KMP are not entitled to this termination payment. Any payments made in the event of a termination of an executive contract will be consistent with the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\n- /two.num On termination of employment, Executive KMP will be entitled to the payment of any fixed remuneration calculated up to the termination date, any leave entitlement accrued at the termination date and any payment or award permitted under the EIS and Equity Award Rules. Executive KMP are restrained from certain activities for specified periods after termination of their employment in order to protect Woodside's interests.\n- /three.num Remuneration is reviewed annually or as required to maintain alignment with policy and benchmarks.",

In 2021, the Board determined that there would be no increase to the Board or committee fees or any other benefits.\n\nFees paid to NEDs are subject to an aggregate limit of A$4.25 million per financial year, which was approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM.\n\nNEDs are required to have acquired shares for a total purchase price of at least 100% of their pre-tax annual fee after five years on the Board. The NEDs may utilise the Non-executive Directors' Share Plan (NEDSP) to acquire the shares on market at market value. As the shares are acquired with net fees, the shares in the NEDSP are not subject to any forfeiture conditions.\n\n## NEDs remuneration structure\n\nNEDs remuneration consists of base Board fees and committee fees, plus statutory superannuation contributions or payments in lieu (currently 10%). Other payments may be made for additional services outside the scope of Board and Committee duties. NEDs do not earn retirement benefits\n\nother than superannuation and are not entitled to any form of performance-linked remuneration in order to preserve their independence.\n\nTable 9 below shows the annual base Board and committee fees for NEDs. There has been no change to Board or committee fees since 2019.\n\nIn addition to these fees, NEDs are entitled to reimbursement of reasonable travel, accommodation and other expenses incurred attending meetings of the Board, committees or shareholders, or while engaged on Woodside business. NEDs are not entitled to compensation on termination of their directorships.\n\nAn allowance is paid to any NED required to travel internationally to attend Board commitments, compensating for factors related to long-haul travel. Where travel is between six and ten hours, an allowance of A$5,000 gross per trip is paid. Where travel exceeds 10 hours, an allowance of A$10,000 gross per trip is paid.\n\nIn 2021, NEDs Frank Cooper, Ben Wyatt and Larry Archibald received an additional payment of A$20,000 each for services provided during the period outside the scope of Board and Committee duties, in connection with the proposed merger with BHP Group's oil and gas portfolio, including membership of the Due Diligence Committee.\n\nBoard fees are not paid to the CEO, as the time spent on Board work and the responsibilities of Board membership are considered in determining the remuneration package provided as part of the normal employment conditions.\n\nThe total remuneration paid to, or in respect of, each NED in 2021 is set out in Table 13 on page 90.\n\nTABLE 9 - ANNUAL BASE BOARD AND COMMITTEE FEES FOR NEDS\n\n| Position                                  | Board/one.num  A$   | Audit & Risk  Committee  A$   | Human Resources  & Compensation  Committee  A$   | Sustainability  Committee  A$   | Nominations  & Governance  Committee  A$   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                           | 723,300             |                               |                                                  |                                 | Chairman of the Board/two.num              |\n| Non-executive directors/three.num 219,178 |                     |                               |                                                  |                                 |                                            |\n| Committee chair                           |                     | 59,360                        | 52,000                                           | 47,400                          | Nil                                        |\n| Committee member                          |                     | 31,964                        | 26,500                                           | 23,700                          | Nil                                        |\n\n- /one.num NEDs receive Board and committee fees plus statutory superannuation (or payments in lieu where statutory superannuation is not required to be paid).\n- /two.num Inclusive of committee work.\n- /three.num Board fees paid to NEDs other than the Chairman.",

Further information on the role of the Committee is described in section 3.4 of the Corporate Governance Statement, available on Woodside's website.\n\n## Use of remuneration consultants\n\nFrom time to time, the Committee may directly engage independent external advisers to provide input to the process of reviewing the remuneration for NEDs and Executives. The Committee may receive executive remuneration advice directly from external independent remuneration consultants.\n\nUnder communications and engagement protocols adopted by the company, market data reports are provided directly to the Committee Chair, and a consultant provides a statement to the Committee that reports have been prepared free of undue influence from Executive KMP. This process ensures the Committee has full oversight of the review process and therefore it, and the Board, can be satisfied that the work undertaken by external independent remuneration consultants is free from undue influence by Executive KMP.\n\nNo executive remuneration advice was obtained from external independent remuneration consultants in 2021 and there were no fees payable to independent external remuneration consultants during the period.\n\nNo loans have been made, guaranteed or secured, directly or indirectly, by Woodside or any of its subsidiaries at any time throughout the year, to any KMP including to a KMP related party.\n\n## Reporting notes\n\n## Reporting in United States dollars\n\nIn this report, the remuneration and benefits reported have been presented in US dollars, unless otherwise stated. This is consistent with the functional and presentation currency of the company.\n\nCompensation for Australian-based employees and all KMP is paid in Australian dollars and, for reporting purposes, converted to US dollars based on the applicable exchange rate at the date of payment. Valuation of equity awards is converted at the spot rate applying when the equity award is granted.",

The second test date for earlier VPR allocations is one year after the vesting date listed in the table.\n- /four.num In accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payment , the fair value of VPRs as at their date of grant has been determined by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing technique or binomial valuation method combined with a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount included as remuneration is not related to or indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executives may ultimately realise should these equity instruments vest.\n- /five.num The fair value of Rights and Restricted Shares as at their date of grant has been determined by reference to the share price at acquisition. The fair value is not related to or indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executives may ultimately realise should these equity instruments vest.\n- /six.num Fair values for the 2020 EIS with a grant date of 17 February 2021 have been estimated as disclosed in footnotes 2 and 3 of Table 7.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## About these statements\n\nWoodside Petroleum Ltd and its controlled entities (Woodside or the Group) is a for-profit entity limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The nature of the operations and the principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors' Report and in the segment information in Note A.1.\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 17 February 2022.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements are general purpose financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards (AASBs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those disclosed in the 2020 Financial Statements, except for the impact of all new or amended standards and interpretations adopted with e/ffect from 1 January 2021. The adoption of these standards and interpretations did not result in any significant changes to the Group's accounting policies, with the exception of AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (refer to Note E.9(c)).\n\nEstimates and judgements reflect current market conditions, including the impact of COVID-19. Estimates used for impairment assessments and the measurement of onerous contracts are disclosed in Notes B.4 and D.5 respectively. Given ongoing economic uncertainty, these assumptions could change in the future.\n\n## Currency\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of Woodside Petroleum Ltd and all its subsidiaries is the US dollar.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the transacting entity at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at that date. Exchange di/fferences in the consolidated financial statements are taken to the income statement.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe amounts contained in these financial statements have been rounded to the nearest million dollars under the option available to the Group under Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, which have been measured at fair value or amortised cost adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risks that are being hedged in e/ffective hedge relationships. Where not carried at fair value,\n\nif the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities does not approximate their fair value, the fair value has been included in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements comprise the financial results of the Group as at 31 December each year (refer to Note E.8).\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date at which the Group ceases to have control.\n\nThe subsidiaries of the Group have the same reporting period and accounting policies as the parent company. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.\n\nNon-controlling interests are allocated their share of the net profit after tax in the consolidated income statement and their share of other comprehensive income net of tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and are presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from parent shareholders' equity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous period. Where required, a reclassification of items in the financial statements of the previous period has been made in accordance with the classification of items in the financial statements of the current period.\n\n## Financial and capital risk management\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework, including review and approval of the Group's risk management strategy, policy and key risk parameters. The Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee have oversight of the Group's internal control system and risk management process, including oversight of the internal audit function.\n\nThe Group's management of financial and capital risks is aimed at ensuring that available capital, funding and cash flows are su/fficient to:\n\n- \u00b7  meet the Group's financial commitments as and when they fall due;\n- \u00b7  maintain the capacity to fund its committed project developments;\n- \u00b7  pay a reasonable dividend; and\n- \u00b7  maintain a long-term credit rating of not less than 'investment grade'.\n\nThe Group monitors and tests its forecast financial position against these criteria and, in general, will undertake hedging activity only when necessary to ensure that these objectives are achieved.\n\nOther circumstances that may lead to hedging activities include the management of exposures relating to trading activities and the underpinning of the economics of a new project. It is, and has been throughout the period, the Group Treasury policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Refer to the Risk section of Corporate on pages 51-54 for more information on the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing financial risk.\n\nThe below risks arise in the normal course of the Group's business.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A. EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## In this section\n\nThis section addresses financial performance of the Group for the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made. This section also includes the tax position of the Group for and at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## A. Earnings for the year\n\nA.1 Segment revenue and expenses\n\nPage 103\n\n- A.2 Finance costs\n\nPage 106\n\nA.3 Dividends paid and proposed\n\nPage 106\n\nA.4 Earnings/(losses) per share\n\nPage 106\n\n- A.5 Taxes\n\nPage 107\n\n## Key financial and capital risks in this section\n\n## Commodity price risk management\n\nThe Group's revenue is exposed to commodity price fluctuations through the sale of hydrocarbons. Commodity price risks are measured by monitoring and stress testing the Group's forecast financial position to sustained periods of low oil and gas prices. This analysis is regularly performed on the Group's portfolio and as required for discrete projects and transactions.\n\nThe Group's management of commodity price risk includes the use of commodity swap derivatives to hedge its exposure (refer to Note D.6). The hedged exposure includes LNG revenue related to produced volumes and revenues derived from trading operations. Commodity swap derivatives protect the Group against downside risk within its strategic and trading portfolio.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group held hedging financial instruments with a net liability carrying value of $431 million (2020: $9 million) exposed to commodity price risk. An increase in relevant commodity prices of 10% would decrease the instruments' carrying value by $255 million, the e/ffect of which would be recognised within reserves and/or the income statement in accordance with hedge accounting application. A 10% decrease would have the same but opposite e/ffect. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant (including the price on underlying physical exposures).\n\n## Foreign exchange risk management\n\nForeign exchange risk arises from future commitments, financial assets and financial liabilities that are not denominated in US dollars. The majority of the Group's revenue is denominated in US dollars. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from operating and capital expenditure incurred in currencies other than US dollars, particularly Australian dollars.\n\nThe Group's management of foreign exchange risk relating to capital expenditure includes the use of forward exchange contract derivatives to hedge its exposure (refer to Note D.6).\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group held hedging financial instruments with a net asset carrying value of $10 million (2020: nil) exposed to foreign exchange risk.\n\nMeasuring the exposure to foreign exchange risk is achieved by regularly monitoring and performing sensitivity analysis on the Group's financial position.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the exchange rate of the US dollar to the Australian dollar (+12%/-12% (2020: +12%/-12%)), with all other variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the Group's equity or the profit or loss in the current period. Refer to Notes C1, C2, D2, D4 and D7 for details of the denominations of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing liabilities, receivables, payables and lease liabilities held at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn order to hedge the foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk (refer to Section C) of a Swiss Franc (CHF) denominated medium term note, Woodside holds a number of cross-currency interest rate swaps (refer to Note C.2 and D.6). The aim of this hedge is to convert the fixed interest CHF bond into variable interest US dollar debt. The Group also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to fix the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in relation to a portion of the Australian dollar denominated capital expenditure expected to be incurred under the Scarborough development (refer to Note D.6).",

EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## A.1 Segment revenue and expenses\n\n## Operating segment information\n\nThe Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the executive management team in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.\n\nThe Group has reviewed its operating segments and has identified the Sangomar and Scarborough Development as separate operating segments within Development due to the progress and materiality of the related projects. The 2020 amounts have been restated to reflect this change.\n\nManagement monitors the performance of the operating results of the segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. The performance of operating segments is evaluated based on profit before tax and net finance costs and is measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nFinancing requirements, including cash and debt balances, finance income, finance costs and taxes are managed at a Group level.\n\nOperating segments outlined below are identified by management based on the nature and geographical location of the business or venture.\n\n## Producing\n\nNorth West Shelf Project - Exploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of liquefied natural gas, pipeline natural gas, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas in assigned permit areas.\n\nPluto LNG - Exploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of liquefied natural gas, pipeline natural gas and condensate in assigned permit areas.\n\nAustralia Oil - Exploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of crude oil in assigned permit areas (North West Shelf, Greater Enfield and Vincent).\n\nWheatstone - Exploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of liquefied natural gas, pipeline natural gas and condensate in assigned permit areas.\n\n## Development\n\nScarborough - Exploration, evaluation and development of liquified natural gas, pipeline natural gas and condensate in assigned permit areas.\n\nSangomar - Exploration, evaluation and development of crude oil in assigned permit areas.\n\nOther development segments - This segment comprises exploration, evaluation and development of liquefied natural gas, pipeline natural gas and condensate in the Browse, Kitimat and Sunrise projects.\n\n## Other\n\nOther segments - This segment comprises trading and shipping activities and activities undertaken in other international locations.\n\nUnallocated items - Unallocated items comprise primarily corporate non-segmental items of revenue and expenses and associated assets and liabilities not allocated to operating segments as they are not considered part of the core operations of any segment.\n\n## Major customer information\n\nThe Group has two major customers which respectively account for 8% and 6% of the Group's external revenue. The sales are generated by the Pluto, North West Shelf and Wheatstone operating segments (2020: two major customers; 15% and 13% generated by Pluto and North West Shelf).\n\n| Geographic information   | Revenue/space.tabfrom/space.tabexternal/space.tab customers /one.tab   | Revenue/space.tabfrom/space.tabexternal/space.tab customers /one.tab   | Non-current/space.tabassets /two.tab                               | Non-current/space.tabassets /two.tab                              |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                          | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                                      | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab                                     | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                                  | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab                                |\n|                          | US/dollar.tabm                                                         | US/dollar.tabm                                                         | US/dollar.tabm                                                     | US/dollar.tabm                                                    |\n| Oceania                  | /three.tab/one.tab/three.tab/space.tab                                 | /two.tab/eight.tab/six.tab/space.tab                                   | /one.tab/eight.tab/comma.tab/three.tab/eight.tab/six.tab/space.tab | /one.tab/seven.tab/comma.tab/five.tab/five.tab/nine.tab/space.tab |\n| Asia                     | /six.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/space.tab                 | /three.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab/six.tab/space.tab              | -                                                                  | /two.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/space.tab                               |\n| Canada                   | -                                                                      | -                                                                      | -                                                                  | /three.tab/four.tab/space.tab                                     |\n| Africa                   | -                                                                      | -                                                                      | /two.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/space.tab            | /one.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/four.tab/four.tab/space.tab            |\n| Other                    | /six.tab/two.tab/zero.tab/space.tab                                    | /two.tab/three.tab/eight.tab/space.tab                                 | /one.tab/space.tab                                                 | /one.tab/space.tab                                                |\n| Consolidated             | /six.tab/comma.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/two.tab/space.tab                  | /three.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/space.tab               | /two.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/one.tab/eight.tab/nine.tab/space.tab    | /one.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/six.tab/seven.tab/space.tab  |\n\n- 1. Revenue is attributable to geographic region based on the location of the customer.\n- 2.  Non-current assets exclude deferred tax of $1,007 million (2020: $1,304 million).\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when or as the Group transfers control of products or provides services to a customer at the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled. If the consideration includes a variable component, the Group estimates the amount of the expected consideration receivable. Variable consideration is estimated throughout the contract and is constrained until it is highly probable a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue from sale of hydrocarbons - Revenue from the sale of hydrocarbons is recognised at a point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which is typically on delivery. Revenue from take or pay contracts is recorded as unearned revenue until the product has been drawn by the customer (transfer of control), at which time it is recognised in earnings.\n- \u00b7 Other operating revenue - Revenue earned from LNG processing and other services is recognised over time as the services are rendered.\n\n## Expenses\n\n- \u00b7 Royalties, excise and levies -Royalties, excise and levies under existing regimes are considered to be production-based taxes and are therefore accrued on the basis of the Group's entitlement to physical production.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisation - Refer to Note B.3.\n- \u00b7 Impairment and impairment reversals -Refer to Note B.4.\n- \u00b7 Leases - Refer to Note D.7.\n- \u00b7 Employee benefits - Refer to Note E.2.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nJudgement is required to determine the point at which the customer obtains control of hydrocarbons. Factors including transfer of legal title, transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership and the existence of a present right to payment for the hydrocarbons typically result in control transferring on delivery of hydrocarbons at port of loading or port of discharge.\n\nThe transaction price at the date control passes for sales made subject to provisional pricing periods in oil and condensate contracts is determined with reference to quoted commodity prices.\n\nJudgement is also used to determine if it is probable that a significant reversal will occur in relation to revenue recognised during open pricing periods in LNG contracts. The Group estimates variable consideration based on reasonably available information from contract negotiations and market indicators.\n\nProgress of performance obligations for LNG processing services revenue recognised over time is measured using the output method which most accurately measures the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation of the services provided.",

The weighted average number of shares makes allowance for shares reserved for employee share plans. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting basic earnings per share by the number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. At 31 December 2021, 9,023,439 awards granted under the Woodside employee share plans are considered dilutive. Total outstanding share awards as at 31 December 2020 were 9,392,203 and considered anti-dilutive due to the loss position in 2020.\n\nOn 22 November 2021, Woodside and BHP Group (BHP) signed a binding share sale agreement to combine their respective oil and gas portfolios by an all stock merger (the Transaction). On completion of the Transaction, BHP's oil and gas business would merge with Woodside, and Woodside would issue new shares to be distributed to BHP shareholders. The expanded Woodside would be owned 52% by existing Woodside shareholders and 48% by existing BHP shareholders. This Transaction is not considered dilutive for the current period.\n\nThere have been no significant transactions involving ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A. EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## A.5 Taxes (cont.)\n\n## Tax transparency code\n\nWoodside participates in the Australian Board of Taxation's voluntary Tax Transparency Code (TTC). To increase public confidence in the contributions and compliance of corporate taxpayers, the TTC recommends public disclosure of tax information. Woodside has addressed the recommended disclosures in two parts. The Part A disclosures are addressed within this Taxes note; the Part B disclosures are addressed in our Sustainable Development Report.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised. The tax rates and laws used to determine the amount are based on those that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity.\n\n## Current taxes\n\nCurrent tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred tax expense represents movements in the temporary di/fferences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base.\n\nWith the exception of those noted below, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary di/fferences.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary di/fferences, unused tax losses and tax credits only if it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise those temporary di/fferences and losses.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised if the temporary di/fference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that a/ffects neither accounting profit nor the taxable profit.\n\nIn relation to PRRT, the impact of future augmentation on expenditure is included in the determination of future taxable profits when assessing the extent to which a deferred tax asset can be recognised in the statement of financial position.\n\n## O/ffsetting deferred tax balances\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset only if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax assets and liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or di/fferent taxable entities that the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Refer to Notes E.8 and E.9 for detail on the tax consolidated group.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Income tax classification\n\nJudgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax. PRRT is considered, for accounting purposes, to be an income tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above, but is not applied to other types of taxes, e.g. North West Shelf royalties, excise and levies which are recognised in cost of sales in the income statement.\n\n## (b)  Deferred tax asset recognition\n\nAustralian tax losses: A deferred tax asset (DTA) of nil (2020: $149 million) has been recognised for carry forward unused tax losses and credits. The 2020 DTA was fully utilised in 2021.\n\nForeign tax losses: Deferred tax assets of $497 million (2020: $477 million) relating to unused foreign tax losses have not been recognised on the basis that it is not probable that the assets will be utilised based on current planned activities in those regions.\n\nPRRT: The recoverability of PRRT deferred tax assets is primarily assessed with regard to future oil price assumptions. As a result of the Pluto impairment reversal (as disclosed in Note B.4) increasing the Pluto PRRT accounting base, the Pluto PRRT DTA has been reduced by $226 million. The Pluto PRRT DTA of $785 million continues to be recognised on the basis that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise the deductible expenditure. In determining the amount of DTA that is considered probable and eligible for recognition, forecast future taxable profits are risk-adjusted where appropriate by a market premium risk rate to reflect uncertainty inherent in long-term forecasts. A long-term bond rate of 1.5% (31 December 2020: 1.0%) was used for the purposes of augmentation. All other deferred PRRT and income tax movements are a result of the e/ffective income tax rates applicable to each Australian or foreign jurisdiction.\n\nCertain deferred tax assets on deductible temporary di/fferences have not been recognised on the basis that deductions from future augmentation of the deductible temporary di/fference will be su/fficient to o/ffset future taxable profit. $4,507 million (2020: $4,167 million) relates to the North West Shelf Project, $1,432 million (2020: $1,345 million) relates to the quarantined exploration spend and unrecognised general spend of Pluto LNG and $1,071 million (2020: $1,049 million) relates to Wheatstone. A long-term bond rate of 1.5% (31 December 2020: 1.0%) was used for the purposes of augmentation.\n\nHad an alternative approach been used to assess recovery of the deferred tax assets, whereby future augmentation was not included in the assessment, the additional deferred tax assets would be recognised, with a corresponding benefit to income tax expense. It was determined that the approach adopted provides the most meaningful information on the implications of the PRRT regime, whilst ensuring compliance with AASB 112 Income Taxes .",

Refer to Note B.4 for details on impairment.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nExpenditure on exploration and evaluation is accounted for in accordance with the area of interest method. The Group's application of the accounting policy is closely aligned to the US GAAP-based successful e/fforts method.\n\nAreas of interest are based on a geographical area for which the rights of tenure are current. All exploration and evaluation expenditure, including general permit activity, geological and geophysical costs and new venture activity costs, is expensed as incurred except for the following:\n\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure relates to an exploration discovery for which the assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable hydrocarbons is not yet complete; or\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure is expected to be recouped through successful exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale.\n\nThe costs of acquiring interests in new exploration and evaluation licences are capitalised. The costs of drilling exploration wells are initially capitalised pending the results of the well.\n\nCosts are expensed where the well does not result in the successful discovery of economically recoverable hydrocarbons and the recognition of an area of interest.\n\nSubsequent to the recognition of an area of interest, all further evaluation costs relating to that area of interest are capitalised.\n\nUpon approval for the commercial development of an area of interest, accumulated expenditure for the area of interest is transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\nIn the statement of cash flows, those cash flows associated with capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure, including unsuccessful wells, are classified as cash flows used in investing activities.\n\n## Exploration commitments\n\nThe Group has exploration expenditure obligations which are contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements. These obligations may be varied from time to time and are expected to be fulfilled in the normal course of the Group's operations.\n\n## Impairment\n\nRefer to Note B.4 for details on impairment, including any write-o/ffs.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Area of interest\n\nTypically, an area of interest (AOI) is defined by the Group as an individual geographical area whereby the presence of hydrocarbons is considered favourable or proved to exist. The Group has established criteria to recognise and maintain an AOI.\n\n## (b) Transfer to projects in development\n\nDevelopment activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management. Judgement is applied by management in determining when the project is technically feasible and economically viable.",

PRODUCTION AND GROWTH ASSETS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## B.3 Oil and gas properties (cont.)\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nOil and gas properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Oil and gas properties include the costs to acquire, construct, install or complete production and infrastructure facilities such as pipelines and platforms, capitalised borrowing costs, transferred exploration and evaluation assets, development wells and the estimated cost of dismantling and restoration.\n\nSubsequent capital costs, including major maintenance, are included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be reliably measured.\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation\n\nOil and gas properties and other plant and equipment are depreciated to their estimated residual values at rates based on their expected useful lives.\n\nTransferred exploration and evaluation and o/ffshore plant and equipment are depreciated using the unit of production basis over proved plus probable reserves or proved reserves for late life assets. The depreciable amount for the unit of production basis excludes future development costs necessary to bring probable reserves into production. Onshore plant and equipment is depreciated using a straight-line basis over the lesser of useful life and the life of proved plus probable reserves. On a straight-line basis the assets have an estimated useful life of 5-50 years.\n\nAll other items of oil and gas properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful life. They are depreciated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Buildings - 24-40 years;\n- \u00b7  Marine vessels and carriers - 10-40 years;\n- \u00b7  Other plant and equipment - 5-15 years; and\n- \u00b7  Land is not depreciated.\n\n## Impairment\n\nRefer to Note B.4 for details on impairment.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nThe Group has capital expenditure commitments contracted for, but not provided for in the financials statements, of $7,875 million (2020: $1,569 million) as at 31 December 2021. Subsequent to year end, capital commitments contracted for has reduced by approximately $2,876 million due to the Group's participating interest in the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture reducing from 100% to 51% (refer to Note E.5).\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Reserves\n\nThe estimation of reserves requires significant management judgement and interpretation of complex geological and geophysical models in order to make an assessment of the size, shape, depth and quality of reservoirs, and their anticipated recoveries.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depreciation and amortisation charges for the Group's oil and gas properties. Judgement is used in determining the reserve base applied to each asset. Typically, late life oil assets use proved reserves.\n\nEstimates are reviewed at least annually or when there are changes in the economic circumstances impacting specific assets or asset groups. These changes may impact depreciation, asset carrying values, restoration provisions and deferred tax balances. If proved plus probable (2P) reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be a/ffected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write-down of the asset's carrying value.\n\nFor more information regarding reserve assumptions, refer to the Reserves and resources statement on pages 55-59 of the Annual Report.\n\n## (b) Depreciation and amortisation\n\nJudgement is required to determine when assets are available for use to commence depreciation and amortisation. Depreciation and amortisation generally commences on first production.\n\n## (c) Change in useful life\n\nAs a result of FID on the Scarborough Development and Pluto Train 2, the Group conducted a review of the expected utilisation of the Pluto LNG onshore assets. Pluto LNG onshore assets were previously intended for use until the cessation of production from Pluto LNG. A number of Pluto LNG onshore assets are now expected to be utilised in the processing of Scarborough reserves and as a result the expected useful lives of these assets have increased by a range of 1-23 years. The change in useful life has been applied prospectively from the month of FID and has resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of $60 million for the year ended 31 December 2021.",

PRODUCTION AND GROWTH ASSETS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## B.4 Impairment of exploration and evaluation and oil and gas properties\n\n## Exploration and evaluation\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nThe recoverability of the carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively, sale of the respective AOI.\n\nEach AOI is reviewed half-yearly to determine whether economic quantities of hydrocarbons have been found or whether further exploration and evaluation work is underway or planned to support continued carry forward of capitalised costs. Where a potential impairment is indicated for an AOI, an assessment is performed using a fair value less costs to dispose (FVLCD) method to determine its recoverable amount. Upon approval for commercial development, exploration and evaluation assets are also assessed for impairment before they are transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\n## Impairment calculations\n\nThe recoverable amounts of exploration and evaluation assets are determined using FVLCD as there is no value in use (VIU). Costs to dispose are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an AOI exceeds its recoverable amount, the AOI is written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nFor assets previously impaired, if the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount, the impairment is reversed, but only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been recognised if no impairment had occurred.\n\n## Oil and gas properties\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nThe carrying amounts of oil and gas properties are assessed halfyearly to determine whether there is an indication of impairment or impairment reversal for those assets which have previously been impaired. Indicators of impairment and impairment reversals include changes in future selling prices, future costs and reserves.\n\nOil and gas properties are assessed for impairment indicators and impairments on a cash-generating unit (CGU) basis. CGUs are determined as an FPSO and associated oil fields for an oil asset, and an LNG plant, o/ffshore infrastructure and associated gas fields for a gas asset.\n\nIf there is an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal for a CGU then the recoverable amount is calculated.\n\n## Impairment calculations\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as the higher of its VIU and FVLCD. VIU is determined by estimating future cash flows after taking into account the risks specific to the asset and discounting to present value using an appropriate discount rate.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or CGU is written down and an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nFor assets previously impaired, if the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount, the impairment is reversed. The carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recognised.",

PRODUCTION AND GROWTH ASSETS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## B.4 Impairment of exploration and evaluation and oil and gas properties (cont.)\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## CGU determination\n\nIdentification of a CGU requires management judgement. In determining the new combined Pluto-Scarborough CGU, management has determined that the Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 development concept integrates with the existing Pluto onshore assets and is the smallest group of assets that generate significant cash inflows that are independent from other assets or group of assets.\n\n## Recoverable amount calculation key assumptions\n\nIn determining the recoverable amount of CGUs, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash flows when determining the VIU. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can also a/ffect the assumptions used and the rates used to discount future cash flow estimates.\n\nThe basis for each estimate used to determine recoverable amounts as at 31 December 2021 is set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Resource estimates - 2P reserves for oil and gas properties, except for NWS Oil (Okha) which is based on 1P reserves due to the reclassification to a late life asset. The reserves are as disclosed in the Reserves and resources statement in the 31 December 2021 Annual Report on pages 55-59.\n- \u00b7  Inflation rate - an inflation rate of 2.0% has been applied.\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange rates - a rate of $0.75 US$:AU$ is based on management's view of long-term exchange rates.\n- \u00b7  Discount rates - a range of pre-tax discount rates between 8.9% and 11.6% (post-tax discount rate 7.5%-8.5%) for CGUs has been applied. The discount rate reflects an assessment of the risks specific to the asset.\n- \u00b7  An evaluation of climate risk is reflected in Woodside's assumptions on carbon cost pricing, including a long-term Australian carbon price of US$80/tonne of emissions (real terms 2022). This is applicable to Australian emissions that exceed facility-specific baselines in accordance with Australian regulations, as well as global emissions that exceed voluntary corporate net emissions targets. Woodside continues to monitor the uncertainty around climate change risks and will revise carbon pricing assumptions accordingly.\n- \u00b7  LNG price - the majority of LNG sales contracts are linked to an oil price marker; accordingly the LNG prices used are consistent with oil price assumptions.\n- \u00b7  Brent oil prices - derived from long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. Prices are adjusted for premiums and discounts based on the nature and quality of the product. Brent oil price estimates have considered the risk of climate policies along with other factors such as industry investment and cost trends. There is significant uncertainty around how society will respond to the climate challenge; Woodside's pricing assumptions reflect a 'most-likely' scenario in which global governments pursue decarbonisation as well as other goals such as energy security and economic development. As with carbon pricing, Woodside continues to monitor this uncertainty and will revise its oil pricing assumptions accordingly in its transition to a lower carbon economy. Further information on climate change risk is provided in Woodside's Climate Report 2021.

PRODUCTION AND GROWTH ASSETS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## B.4 Impairment of exploration and evaluation and oil and gas properties (cont.)\n\nFollowing the impairment recognised at 30 June 2020, the Group assessed each AOI and CGU for indicators of impairment as at 31 December 2020 in accordance with the Group's accounting policy. In assessing whether there was an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal, the Group considered whether there were any significant changes in the key estimates and judgements and underlying project assumptions used for the 30 June 2020 impairment assessment and determined that there were none. No indicators of additional impairment or impairment reversal were identified as at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Recoverable amount calculation key assumptions\n\nIn determining the recoverable amounts of exploration and evaluation assets, the market comparison approach using adjusted market multiples (fair value hierarchy Level 3) was utilised to determine FVLCD.\n\nIn determining the recoverable amount of CGUs, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash flows when determining the VIU. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can also a/ffect the assumptions used and the rates used to discount future cash flow estimates.\n\nThe basis for the estimates used to determine recoverable amounts as at 30 June 2020 is set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Resource estimates - 2P reserves for oil and gas properties as disclosed in the Reserves and resources statement in the 31 December 2019 Annual Report on pages 44 to 47.\n- \u00b7  Inflation rate - an inflation rate of 2.0% has been applied.\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange rates - a rate of $0.75 US$:AU$ is based on management's view of long-term exchange rates.\n- \u00b7  Discount rates - a range of pre-tax discount rates between 9.3% and 14.8% (post-tax discount rates 7.5% and 11.0%) for CGUs has been applied. The discount rate reflects an assessment of the risks specific to the asset, including country risk.\n- \u00b7  An evaluation of climate risk impacts, including a long-term Australian carbon price of US$80/tonne (real terms 2020), applicable to Australian emissions that exceed facility-specific baselines in accordance with Australian regulations.\n- \u00b7  LNG price - the majority of LNG sales contracts are linked to an oil price marker; accordingly the LNG prices used are consistent with oil price assumptions.\n- \u00b7  Brent oil prices - derived from long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. Prices are adjusted for premiums and discounts based on the nature and quality of the product. The nominal Brent oil prices (US$/bbl) used were:\n\n|              | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/three.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/four.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/five.tab   |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 30 June 2020 | /three.tab/five.tab                  | /four.tab/five.tab                  | /five.tab/seven.tab                 | /six.tab/two.tab                      | /six.tab/seven.tab                   | /seven.tab/two.tab/one.num           |\n\n- 1.

The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n\nAdditional payments of up to $55 million are contingent on future commodity prices and timing of first oil. The contingent payments terminate on the earliest of 31 December 2027, three years from first oil being sold, and a total contingent payment of $55 million being reached. The contingent payments are accounted for as contingent liabilities in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nWoodside's interest has increased to 82% in the Sangomar exploitation area (31 December 2020: 68.33%) and to 90% in the remaining RSSD evaluation area (31 December 2020: 75%).\n\n## Assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as at the date of the acquisition inclusive of transaction costs are:\n\n|                                              | US/dollar.tabm                       |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Oil and gas properties                       | /two.tab/zero.tab/five.tab/space.tab |\n| Exploration and evaluation                   | /seven.tab/space.tab                 |\n| Cash acquired                                | /three.tab/space.tab                 |\n| Payables                                     | (/one.tab/three.tab)                 |\n| Net other assets and liabilities assumed     | /one.tab/zero.tab/space.tab          |\n| Total identifiable net assets at acquisition | /two.tab/one.tab/two.tab/space.tab   |\n\n## Cash flows on acquisition\n\n|                                  | US/dollar.tabm                     |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Purchase cash consideration      | /two.tab/one.tab/two.tab/space.tab |\n| Transaction costs                | -                                  |\n| Total purchase consideration     | /two.tab/one.tab/two.tab/space.tab |\n| Net cash outflows on acquisition | /two.tab/one.tab/two.tab/space.tab |\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Nature of acquisition\n\nJudgement is required to determine if the transaction is the acquisition of an asset or a business combination. The Sangomar project is in the early phase of development and a substantive process that has the ability to convert inputs to outputs is not present and therefore the acquisitions in both 2020 and 2021 are treated as asset acquisitions.\n\n## b) BHP merger commitment deed\n\nOn 17 August 2021, Woodside and BHP Group (BHP) entered into a merger commitment deed to combine their respective oil and gas portfolios by an all stock merger (the Transaction). The share sale agreement and the integration and transition services agreement were executed on 22 November 2021.\n\nOn completion of the Transaction, BHP's oil and gas business will merge with Woodside, and Woodside will issue new shares to be distributed to BHP shareholders. The expanded Woodside will be owned 52% by existing Woodside shareholders and 48% by existing BHP shareholders. The Transaction is subject to satisfaction of conditions precedent including shareholder, regulatory and other approvals. The completion of the proposed merger is targeted for Q2 2022 following all necessary approvals.\n\nWoodside and BHP have also agreed on an option for BHP to sell its 26.5% interest in the Scarborough Joint Venture and its 50% interest in the Thebe and Jupiter Joint Ventures to Woodside. The option is exercisable by BHP in the second half of 2022 and, if exercised, consideration of $1,000 million is payable to BHP plus working capital adjustments from 1 July 2021 to completion date. An additional $100 million is payable contingent upon future FID for a Thebe development.\n\n## c) Sangomar - Acquisition from Capricorn Senegal Limited\n\nOn 22 December 2020, Woodside completed the acquisition of Capricorn Senegal Limited's (Cairn's) interest in the RSSD Joint Venture (36.44% interest in the Sangomar exploitation area and 40% interest in the remaining RSSD evaluation area) for an aggregate purchase price of $527 million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n\nAdditional payments of up to $100 million are contingent on future commodity prices and the timing of first oil. The contingent payments are accounted for as contingent liabilities in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\n## Assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as at the date of the acquisition inclusive of transaction costs were:\n\n|                                              | US/dollar.tabm                        |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Oil and gas properties                       | /five.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/space.tab |\n| Exploration and evaluation                   | /two.tab/six.tab/space.tab            |\n| Cash acquired                                | /five.tab/space.tab                   |\n| Payables                                     | (/five.tab/one.tab)                   |\n| Net other assets and liabilities assumed     | /seven.tab/space.tab                  |\n| Total identifiable net assets at acquisition | /five.tab/two.tab/seven.tab/space.tab |\n\n## Cash flows on acquisition\n\n|                                  | US/dollar.tabm                        |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Purchase cash consideration      | /five.tab/two.tab/five.tab/space.tab  |\n| Transaction/space.tabcosts       | /two.tab/space.tab                    |\n| Total purchase consideration     | /five.tab/two.tab/seven.tab/space.tab |\n| Net cash outflows on acquisition | /five.tab/two.tab/seven.tab/space.tab |",

PRODUCTION AND GROWTH ASSETS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## B.6 Non-current assets held for sale\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and liabilities as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Such non-current assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the sale, excluding the finance costs and income tax expense.\n\nThe criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn. Management must be committed to the sale, expected within one year from the date of the classification.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Transfers to non-current assets held for sale\n\nOn 15 November 2021, the Group and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement for GIP to acquire a 49% participating interest in the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture. The transaction completed on 18 January 2022 (refer to Note E.5), reducing the Group's participating interest from 100% to 51%. Accordingly, the associated Pluto Train 2 assets within the Development segment have been reclassified to non-current assets held for sale. The arrangements require GIP to fund its 49% share of capital expenditure from 1 October 2021 and an additional amount of capital expenditure of approximately $822 million. If the total capital expenditure incurred is less than $5,600 million, GIP will pay Woodside an additional amount equal to 49% of the under-spend. In the event of a cost overrun, Woodside will fund up to approximately $822 million of GIP's share of the overrun. Delays to the expected start-up of production will result in payments by Woodside to GIP in certain circumstances. The arrangements include provisions for GIP to be compensated for exposure to additional Scope 1 emissions liabilities above agreed baselines, and to sell its 49% interest back to Woodside if the status of key regulatory approvals materially changes.\n\nIn addition, in December 2021, Woodside committed to sell a portion of the Wheatstone Construction Village and six residential properties. The construction village within the Wheatstone operating segment and the residential properties within the Pluto segment have been reclassified as non-current assets held for sale and both sale transactions are expected to complete in 2022.\n\n## Impairment relating to the non-current assets held for sale\n\nImmediately before the classification as non-current assets held for sale, the recoverable amount of the relevant assets were calculated and an impairment of the Wheatstone Construction Village amounting to $10 million was recognised within oil and gas properties (refer to Note B.4).\n\n## Assets and liabilities of the non-current assets held for sale\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group has reclassified $252 million of Pluto Train 2 assets, $1 million of the Wheatstone Construction Village assets and $1 million of the Pluto residential housing to non-current assets held for sale. There are no recognised liabilities associated with the non-current assets held for sale.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS C. DEBT AND CAPITAL\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## In this section\n\nThis section addresses cash, debt and the capital position of the Group at the end of the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made.\n\n## C. Debt and capital\n\n| C.1   | Cash and cash equivalents                             | Page 123   |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| C.2   | Interest-bearing liabilities and financing facilities | Page 123   |\n| C.3   | Contributed equity                                    | Page 125   |\n| C.4   | Other reserves                                        | Page 125   |\n\n## Key financial and capital risks in this section\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nGroup Treasury is responsible for the Group's capital management including cash, debt and equity. Capital management is undertaken to ensure that a secure, cost-e/ffective and flexible supply of funds is available to meet the Group's operating and capital expenditure requirements. A stable capital base is maintained from which the Group can pursue its growth aspirations, whilst maintaining a flexible capital structure that allows access to a range of debt and equity markets to both draw upon and repay capital.\n\nThe Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2003 for activation as required to fund future growth. The DRP was reactivated for the 2019 interim dividend and will remain in place until further notice.\n\nA range of financial metrics are monitored, including gearing and cash flow leverage, and Treasury policy breaches and exceptions.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the financial liabilities of the Group and the Group's subsequent ability to meet its obligations to repay financial liabilities as and when they fall due. The liquidity position of the Group is managed to ensure su/fficient liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments in a timely and cost-e/ffective manner.\n\nThe Group's liquidity is continually reviewed, including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels. At 31 December 2021, the Group had a total of $6,125 million (2020: $6,704 million) of available undrawn facilities and cash at its disposal. The maturity profile of interest-bearing liabilities is disclosed in Note C.2, trade and other payables are disclosed in Note D.4 and lease liabilities are disclosed in Note D.7. Financing facilities available to the Group are disclosed in Note C.2.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the Group's financial position will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to financial instruments with floating interest rates including long-term debt obligations, cash and short-term deposits. The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To manage the ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt, the Group may enter into interest rate swaps. The Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk (refer to Section A) and interest rate risk of the CHF denominated medium term note. The Group also holds interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the $600 million syndicated facility. Refer to Notes C.2 and D.6 for further details.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group was exposed to various benchmark interest rates that were not designated in cash flow hedges, primarily through $2,962 million (2020: $3,527 million) on cash and cash equivalents, $367 million (2020: $450 million) on interest-bearing liabilities (excluding transaction costs) and $9 million (2020: $15 million) on cross-currency interest rate swaps.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the USD London Interbank O/ffered Rate (LIBOR) (+1.0%/-1.0% (2020: +0.5%/-0.5%)), with all variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the Group's equity or the income statement in the current period.\n\nThe Group's Treasury function is closely monitoring the market and the output from the various industry working groups managing the transition to new benchmark interest rates. The Treasury function is assessing the implications of the Interbank O/ffered Rates (IBOR) reform across the Group and will manage and execute the transition from current benchmark rates to alternative benchmark rates.",

|\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nAll borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any di/fference between the proceeds received and the redemption amount is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nBorrowings designated as a hedged item are measured at amortised cost adjusted to record changes in the fair value of risks that are being hedged in fair value hedges. The changes in the fair value risks of the hedged item resulted in a gain of $5 million being recorded (2020: loss of $19 million), and a loss of $7 million recorded on the hedging instrument (2020: gain of $18 million).\n\nAll bonds, notes and facilities are subject to various covenants and negative pledges restricting future secured borrowings, subject to a number of permitted lien exceptions. Neither the covenants nor the negative pledges have been breached at any time during the reporting period.\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe carrying amount of interest-bearing liabilities approximates their fair value, with the exception of the Group's unsecured bonds and the medium term notes. The unsecured bonds have a carrying amount of $4,081 million (2020: $4,778 million) and a fair value of $4,443 million (2020: $5,196 million). The medium term notes have a carrying amount of $592 million (2020: $597 million) and a fair value of $604 million (2020: $617 million). Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date and classified as Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy. Where these cash flows are in a foreign currency, the present value is converted to US dollars at the foreign exchange spot rate prevailing at the reporting date. The Group's repayment obligations remain unchanged.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAll interest-bearing liabilities are denominated in US dollars, excluding the CHF175 million medium term note.",

Interest is paid at the end of the drawdown period. Evergreen facilities may be extended continually by a year subject to the bank's agreement.\n\n## Syndicated facility\n\nOn 14 October 2019, Woodside increased the existing facility to $1,200 million, with $400 million expiring on 11 October 2022 and $800 million expiring on 11 October 2024. Interest rates are based on USD LIBOR and margins are fixed at the commencement of the drawdown period.\n\nOn 17 January 2020, the Group completed a new $600 million syndicated facility with a term of seven years. Interest is based on the USD London Interbank O/ffered Rate (LIBOR) plus 1.2%. Interest is paid on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) facility\n\nOn 24 June 2008, the Group entered into a two tranche committed loan facility of $1,000 million and $500 million respectively. The $500 million tranche was repaid in 2013. There is a prepayment option for the remaining balance. Interest rates are based on LIBOR. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears and the principal amortises on a straight-line basis, with equal instalments of principal due on each interest payment date (every six months).\n\nUnder this facility, 90% of the receivables from designated Pluto LNG sale and purchase agreements are secured in favour of the lenders through a trust structure, with a required reserve amount of $30 million.\n\nTo the extent that this reserve amount remains fully funded and no default notice or acceleration notice has been given, the revenue from Pluto LNG continues to flow directly to the Group from the trust account.\n\n## Medium term notes\n\nOn 28 August 2015, the Group established a $3,000 million Global Medium Term Notes Programme listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Three notes have been issued under this programme as set out below:\n\n| Maturity date    | Currency      | Carrying/space.tabamount/space.tab (million)   | Nominal/space.tabinterest/space.tab rate                                       |\n|------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 15 July 2022     | US/dollar.tab | /two.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab                     | Floating/space.tabthree/space.tab month/space.tabUS/dollar.tab/space.tab LIBOR |\n| 11 December 2023 | CHF           | /one.tab/seven.tab/five.tab                    | /one.tab/percent.tab                                                           |\n| 29 January 2027  | US/dollar.tab | /two.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab                     | /three.tab/percent.tab                                                         |\n\n## US bonds\n\nThe Group has four unsecured bonds issued in the United States of America as defined in Rule 144A of the US Securities Act of 1933 as set out below:\n\n| Maturity date     | Carrying/space.tabamount  US/dollar.tabm                          | Nominal/space.tabinterest/space.tab rate             |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 5 March 2025      | /space.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/space.tab | /three.tab/period.tab/six.tab/five.tab/percent.tab   |\n| 15 September 2026 | /space.tab/eight.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/space.tab                  | /three.tab/period.tab/seven.tab/zero.tab/percent.tab |\n| 15 March 2028     | /space.tab/eight.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/space.tab                  | /three.tab/period.tab/seven.tab/zero.tab/percent.tab |\n| 4 March 2029      | /space.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/five.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/space.tab | /four.tab/period.tab/five.tab/zero.tab/percent.tab   |\n\nInterest on the bonds is payable semi-annually in arrears.\n\nDuring the period, the Group redeemed the $700 million 2021 US bond and repaid $84 million on the JBIC facility.",

No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments.\n\n## (a) Issued and fully paid shares\n\n|                                                                                        | Number/space.tabof/space.tab shares                                                                                     | US/dollar.tabm                                                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December 2021                                                            |                                                                                                                         |                                                                    |\n| Opening balance                                                                        | /space.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/two.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/two.tab/five.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/one.tab/four.tab/space.tab   | /space.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/seven.tab/space.tab |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at A$24.77   (2020 final dividend)                        | /space.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/three.tab/five.tab/four.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab/two.tab/space.tab                 | /space.tab/two.tab/six.tab/space.tab                               |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at A$19.47   (2021 interim dividend)                      | /space.tab/six.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/five.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/nine.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/space.tab                   | /space.tab/eight.tab/six.tab/space.tab                             |\n| Amounts as at 31 December 2021                                                         | /space.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/three.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/two.tab/six.tab/space.tab  | /space.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab/space.tab |\n| Year ended 31 December 2020                                                            |                                                                                                                         |                                                                    |\n| Opening balance                                                                        | /space.tab/nine.tab/four.tab/two.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/eight.tab/six.tab/comma.tab/nine.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/space.tab | /space.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/zero.tab/space.tab  |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at A$25.61   (2019 final dividend)                        | /space.tab/one.tab/two.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab/two.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/three.tab/four.tab/space.tab         | /space.tab/one.tab/eight.tab/one.tab/space.tab                     |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at A$18.79   (2020 interim dividend)                      | /space.tab/six.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/three.tab/five.tab/space.tab                  | /space.tab/eight.tab/three.tab/space.tab                           |\n| Employee share plan - ordinary shares  issued at A$18.27   (2017 Woodside equity plan) | /space.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/seven.tab/seven.tab/five.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/four.tab/five.tab/space.tab               | /space.tab/two.tab/three.tab/space.tab                             |\n| Amounts as at 31 December 2020                                                         | /space.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/two.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/two.tab/five.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/one.tab/four.tab/space.tab   | /space.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/seven.tab/space.tab |\n\nAll shares are a single class with equal rights to dividends, capital, distributions and voting.

Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise trade and other receivables, loans receivables and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe Group manages its credit risk on trade receivables and financial instruments by predominantly dealing with counterparties with an investment grade credit rating. Su/fficient collateral is obtained to mitigate the risk of financial loss when transacting with counterparties with below investment grade credit ratings. Customers who wish to trade on unsecured credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. As a result, the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group's maximum credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of its financial assets.\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by the Treasury function subject to the Group's established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. At 31 December 2021, the Group had four customers (2020: four customers) that owed the Group more than $10 million each and accounted for approximately 88% (2020: 82%) of all trade receivables. Payment terms are typically 14 to 30 days providing only a short credit exposure.\n\nThe Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of the asset and whether there has been a significant depreciation in credit quality on an ongoing basis. A significant decrease in credit quality is defined as a debtor being greater than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment. Credit losses for trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are determined by applying the simplified approach and are measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected loss. Under the simplified approach, determination of the loss allowance provision and expected loss rate incorporates past experience and forward-looking information, including the outlook for market demand and forward-looking interest rates. A default on other financial assets is considered to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 60 days of when they fall due.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group had a provision for credit losses of nil (2020: nil). Subsequent to 31 December 2021, 100% (2020: 100%) of the trade receivables balance of $152 million (2020: $164 million) has been received.\n\nCredit risk from balances with banks is managed by the Treasury function in accordance with the Group's policy. The Group's main funds are placed as short-term deposits with reputable financial institutions with strong investment grade credit ratings. At 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group and financial instruments are spread amongst a number of financial institutions to minimise the risk of counterparty default. The maximum exposure to financial institution credit risk is represented by the sum of all cash deposits plus accrued interest, bank account balances and fair value of derivative assets. The Group's counterparty credit policy limits this exposure to commercial and investment banks, according to approved credit limits based on the counterparty's credit rating.",

Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value. Receivables that satisfy the contractual cash flow and business model tests are subsequently measured at amortised cost less an allowance for uncollectable amounts. Uncollectable amounts are determined using the expected loss impairment model. Collectability and impairment are assessed on a regular basis.\n\nSubsequent recoveries of amounts previously written o/ff are credited against other expenses in the income statement. Certain receivables that do not satisfy the contractual cash flow and business model tests are subsequently measured at fair value (refer to Note D.6).\n\nThe Group's customers are required to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on the product, settlement terms are 14 to 30 days from the date of invoice or bill of lading and customers regularly pay on time. There are no significant overdue trade receivables as at the end of the reporting period (2020: nil).\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group held $121 million of receivables at 31 December 2021 (2020: $68 million) in currencies other than US dollars (predominantly Australian dollars).\n\n## Loans receivable\n\nOn 9 January 2020, Woodside Energy Finance (UK) Ltd entered into a secured loan agreement with Petrosen (the Senegal National Oil Company), to provide up to $450 million for the purpose of funding Sangomar project costs. The facility has a maximum term of 12 years and semi-annual repayments of the loan are due to commence at the earlier of 12 months after RFSU or 30 June 2025. The carrying amount of the loan receivable is $335 million at 31 December 2021 (2020: $113 million), which approximates its fair value. The remaining balance of loans receivable is due from non-controlling interests.\n\n## D.3 Inventories\n\n|                                | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab US/dollar.tabm   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab US/dollar.tabm   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| (a) Inventories (current)      |                                                    |                                                     |\n| Petroleum products             |                                                    |                                                     |\n| Goods in transit               | /three.tab/five.tab/space.tab                      | /one.tab/eight.tab/space.tab                        |\n| Finished stocks                | /three.tab/four.tab/space.tab                      | /three.tab/three.tab/space.tab                      |\n| Warehouse stores and materials | /one.tab/three.tab/three.tab/space.tab             | /seven.tab/four.tab/space.tab                       |\n|                                | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/space.tab                | /one.tab/two.tab/five.tab/space.tab                 |\n| (b) Inventories (non-current)  |                                                    |                                                     |\n| Warehouse stores and materials | /one.tab/nine.tab/space.tab                        | /four.tab/zero.tab/space.tab                        |\n|                                | /one.tab/nine.tab/space.tab                        | /four.tab/zero.tab/space.tab                        |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nInventories include hydrocarbon stocks, consumable supplies and maintenance spares. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and includes direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable production overheads where applicable. Inventories determined to be obsolete or damaged are written down to net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less selling costs.",

The nature of restoration activities includes the removal of facilities, abandonment of wells and restoration of a/ffected areas. Restoration provisions are updated annually, with the corresponding movement recognised against the related exploration and evaluation assets or oil and gas properties.\n\nOver time, the liability is increased for the change in the present value based on a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent in the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as an accretion charge within finance costs. The carrying amount capitalised in oil and gas properties is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset (refer to Note B.3).\n\nCosts incurred that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not have a future economic benefit, are expensed.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nProvision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the end of the reporting period. These benefits include wages, salaries, annual leave and long service leave.\n\nLiabilities in respect of employees' services rendered that are not expected to be wholly settled within one year after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services are recognised as long-term employee benefits.\n\nThese liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflow to the employees using the projected unit credit method. Liabilities expected to be wholly settled within one year after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services are classified as short-term benefits and are measured at the amount due to be paid.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nTrade and other payables are carried at amortised cost and are recognised when goods and services are received, whether or not billed to the Group, prior to the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe carrying amount of payables approximates their fair value.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group held $311 million of payables at 31 December 2021 (2020: $210 million) in currencies other than US dollars (predominantly Australian dollars).",

OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## D.5 Provisions (cont.)\n\n## Onerous contract provision\n\nProvision is made for loss-making contracts at the present value of the lower of the net cost of fulfilling and the cost arising from failure to fulfill each contract. Long-term expectations of reduced spreads between North American and European/Asian LNG or gas markets has given rise to a loss-making contract.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Restoration obligations\n\nThe Group estimates the future remediation and removal costs of o/ffshore oil and gas platforms, production facilities, wells and pipelines at di/fferent stages of the development and construction of assets or facilities. In many instances, removal of assets occurs many years into the future.\n\nThe Group's restoration obligations are based on compliance with the requirements of relevant regulations which vary for di/fferent jurisdictions and are often non-prescriptive. Australian legislation requires removal of structures, equipment and property, or alternative arrangements to removal which are satisfactory to the regulator. The Group maintains technical expertise to ensure that industry learnings, scientific research and local and international guidelines are reviewed in assessing its restoration obligations.\n\nThe restoration obligation requires judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, environmental legislation and regulations, the extent of restoration activities required, the engineering methodology for estimating cost, future removal technologies in determining the removal cost, and liability-specific discount rates to determine the present value of these cash flows. The Group's provision includes the following costs:\n\n- \u00b7  for onshore assets, provision has been made for the full removal of production facilities and aboveground pipelines.\n- \u00b7  for o/ffshore assets, provision has been made for the plug and abandonment of wells and the removal of o/ffshore platform topsides, floating production storage o/ffloading (FPSO) and some subsea infrastructure. It is currently the Group's assumption that certain pipelines and infrastructure, parts of o/ffshore platform substructures, and certain subsea infrastructure remain in-situ where it can be demonstrated that this will deliver equal or better health, safety and environmental outcomes than full removal and that regulatory approval is obtained where arrangements are satisfactory to the regulator.\n\nElements composed of steel, or steel and concrete, with hydrocarbons removed have previously been accepted by the Australian regulator to be decommissioned in-situ where it has been demonstrated there is an acceptable impact to the environment and to current and future marine users (i.e. fishing, shipping and other activities).\n\nThe basis of the restoration obligation provision for assets with approved decommissioning plans or general directions issued by the regulator can di/ffer from the assumptions disclosed above. Whilst the provisions reflect the Group's best estimate based on current knowledge and information, further studies and detailed analysis of the restoration activities for individual assets will be performed near the end of their operational life and/or when detailed decommissioning plans are required to be submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities. Actual costs and cash outflows can materially di/ffer from the current estimate as a result of changes in regulations and their application, prices, analysis of site conditions, further studies, timing of restoration and changes in removal technology. These uncertainties may result in actual expenditure di/ffering from amounts included in the provision recognised as at 31 December 2021.\n\nA range of pre-tax discount rates between 0.4% and 2.4% (2020: 0.1% to 2%) has been applied. If the discount rates were decreased by 0.5% then the provision would be $134 million higher. If the cost estimates were increased by 10% then the provision would be $225 million higher. The proportion of the non-current balance not expected to be settled within 10 years is 65% (2020: 73%).\n\nIn the event that the removal of all, or a substantial portion of, the elements was required, Woodside estimates the additional cost would lead to an increase to the provision of approximately $300 - $500 million. This excludes costs related to large diameter trunklines between the o/ffshore platforms and onshore plants as further assessment is required for these pipelines which are buried below the seabed or heavily stabilised by rock or concrete due to their location and metocean conditions.\n\n## (b) Long service leave\n\nLong service leave is measured at the present value of benefits accumulated up to the end of the reporting period. The liability is discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Management uses judgement to determine key assumptions used in the calculation including future increases in salaries and wages, future on-cost rates and future settlement dates of employees' departures.\n\n## (c) Legal case outcomes\n\nProvisions for legal cases are measured at the present value of the amount expected to settle the claim. Management is required to use judgement when assessing the likely outcome of legal cases, estimating the risked amount and whether a provision or contingent liability should be recognised.\n\n## (d) Onerous contracts\n\nThe onerous contract provision assessment requires management to make certain estimates regarding the unavoidable costs and the expected economic benefits from the contract. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can a/ffect the assumptions. The present value of the provision was estimated using the assumptions set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Contract term - 19 years; the provision is released as contract deliveries are made up to 2040.\n- \u00b7  Discount rate - a pre-tax, risk free US government bond rate of 1.855% (2020: 1.390%) has been applied.\n- \u00b7  LNG pricing - forecast sales and purchase prices are subject to a number of price markers. Price assumptions are based on the best information on the market available at measurement date and derived from short- and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. The forecasted sales are linked to gas hub prices (Title Transfer Facility (TTF)) at which physical sales are expected to occur and incorporates known pricing information related to sales/one.num. The long-term gas sales price is estimated on the basis of the Group's Brent price forecast. The estimated purchase price is linked to US gas hub prices (Henry Hub (HH)) at which physical purchases are expected to occur. The nominal TTF, Brent oil prices and HH gas prices used at 31 December 2021 were:\n\n|                 | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab     | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/three.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/four.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/five.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/six.tab         |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| TTF (US$/MMBtu) | /one.tab/five.tab/period.tab/zero.tab | /eight.tab/period.tab/two.tab         | /six.tab/period.tab/nine.tab         | /seven.tab/period.tab/zero.tab       | /seven.tab/period.tab/two.tab             |\n| Brent (US$/bbl) | /seven.tab/three.tab                  | /seven.tab/one.tab                    | /six.tab/eight.tab                   | /six.tab/nine.tab                    | /seven.tab/zero.tab/two.sup               |\n| HH (US$/MMBtu)  | /four.tab/period.tab/zero.tab         | /three.tab/period.tab/six.tab         | /three.tab/period.tab/one.tab        | /three.tab/period.tab/two.tab        | /three.tab/period.tab/three.tab/three.num |\n\nThe nominal impact of the e/ffects of changes to discount rate and longterm price assumptions are estimated as follows:\n\n| Change/space.tabin/space.tabassumption/four.num   | US/dollar.tabm                |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| LNG sales price 1 : increase of 10%               | /five.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab   |\n| LNG sales price 1 : decrease of 10%               | (/five.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab) |\n| US hub gas price (HH) 3 : increase of 10%         | (/two.tab/eight.tab/two.tab)  |\n| US hub gas price (HH) 3 : decrease of 10%         | /two.tab/eight.tab/two.tab    |\n| Discount rate: increase of 1%/five.num            | /one.tab/nine.tab             |\n| Discount rate: decrease of 1%/five.num            | (/two.tab/zero.tab)           |",

For relationships designated as fair value hedges, subsequent fair value movements of the derivative are recognised in the income statement. For relationships designated as cash flow hedges, subsequent fair value movements of the derivative for the e/ffective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity; fair value movements for the ine/ffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs of hedging have been separated from the hedging arrangements and deferred to other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item a/ffects profit or loss.\n\nHedge e/ffectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective e/ffectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged exposure and the hedging instrument. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship has been, and is expected to be, e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged exposure using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nIne/ffectiveness is recognised where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the hedging instrument on an absolute basis exceeds the change in value of the hedged exposure attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nIne/ffectiveness may arise where the timing of the transaction changes from what was originally estimated such as delayed shipments or changes in timing of forecast sales. This may also arise where the commodity swap pricing terms do not perfectly match the pricing terms of the LNG revenue contracts.\n\n## Fair value\n\nExcept for the other financial assets and other financial liabilities set out in this note, there are no material financial assets or financial liabilities carried at fair value.\n\nThe fair value of commodity derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable quoted forward pricing and swap models and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models that use present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms of maturity of each contract, using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting date and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and present value calculations based on high credit quality yield curves in the respective currencies and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair values of other financial assets and other financial liabilities are predominantly determined based on observable quoted forward pricing and are predominantly classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange forward contracts that are denominated in Australian dollars. The Group had no material other financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars.\n\n## Hedging activities\n\nDuring the period, the following hedging activities were undertaken:\n\n- \u00b7  The Group hedged a percentage of its oil-linked exposure, entering into oil swap derivatives settling between 2021 to 2023 in order to achieve a minimum average sales price per barrel.\n- \u00b7  The Group also entered into separate HH commodity swaps to hedge the purchase leg of the Corpus Christi volumes and separate TTF commodity swaps to hedge the sales leg of Corpus Christi volumes e/ffectively protecting against pricing risk for 2022 and 2023. As a result of hedging and term sales, approximately 97% of Corpus Christi volumes in 2022 and 70% in 2023 have hedged pricing risk.\n- \u00b7  The Group entered into TTF commodity swaps to hedge equity LNG cargoes expected to be exposed to winter 2021/22 natural gas pricing.\n- \u00b7  The Group entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to fix the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in relation to a portion of the Australian dollar denominated capital expenditure expected to be incurred under the Scarborough development.",

OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## D.6 Other financial assets and liabilities (cont.)\n\n## Hedging activities (cont.)\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2020 the following main hedging activities were undertaken:\n\nThe Group hedged a percentage of its exposure to commodity price risk, entering into 13.4 million barrels of oil swap derivatives to achieve a minimum average sales price of $33 per barrel. The Group also entered into 7.9 million barrels of oil call options, to take advantage of increases in oil prices above $40 per barrel, for a premium of $37 million. Most of the derivatives settled between April 2020 and December 2020, with swaps and options for 1.3 million barrels settling in 2021. The swaps and call options were designated as cash flow hedges.\n\n|                                                                      | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab

financial assets\n\nOther financial assets measured at fair value include receivables subject to provisional pricing adjustments of $163 million (2020: $144 million) and repurchase agreements entered into for the purposes of net settlement rather than for physical delivery of $69 million (2020: nil).\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some interbank o/ffered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as 'IBOR reform'). The Group has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be impacted as part of these marketwide initiatives. The Group's main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is USD LIBOR. In 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that LIBOR will be phased out and eventually replaced by June 2023.\n\nThe Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its operational and risk management processes and hedge accounting. The main risks to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform are operational, for example renegotiating borrowing contracts through bilateral negotiation with counterparties, implementing new fallback clauses with its derivative counterparties, updating contractual terms and revising operational controls related to the reform. Financial risk is predominantly limited to interest rate risk. Hedging relationships may experience ine/ffectiveness due to uncertainty about when and how replacement may occur with respect to the relevant hedged item and hedging instrument or the di/fference in the timing of a replacement.\n\nThe Group's financial instruments have not yet transitioned to an alternative interest rate benchmark. The Group has financial liabilities and financial assets with a total carrying value of $957 million and $367 million respectively, with reference to USD LIBOR.\n\nThe Group has the following hedging relationships which are exposed to interest rate benchmarks impacted by IBOR Reform:\n\n- \u00b7  Interest rate swaps to hedge the LIBOR interest rate risk associated with the $600 million syndicated facility (refer to Note C.2). The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, converting the variable interest into fixed interest US dollar debt, and mature in 2027.\n- \u00b7  A fixed rate 175 million Swiss Franc (CHF) denominated medium term note, which it hedges with cross-currency interest rate swaps designated in both fair value and cash flow hedge relationships. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are referenced to LIBOR (refer to Note C.2).\n\nThe Group's Treasury function continues to assess the implications of the IBOR reform across the Group and will manage and execute the transition from current benchmark rates to alternative benchmark rates.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair value of other financial assets and liabilities\n\nEstimates have been applied in the measurement of other financial assets and liabilities and, where required, judgement is applied in the settlement of any financial assets or liabilities. In the current period, this included a $56 million periodic adjustment which increased other financial liabilities, reflecting the arrangements governing Wheatstone LNG sales (2020: $12 million decrease).",

|\n\nWhen a contract is entered into, the Group assesses whether the contract contains a lease. A lease arises when the Group has the right to direct the use of an identified asset which is not substitutable and to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use. The leases recognised by the Group predominantly relate to LNG vessels, property and drilling rigs.\n\nThe Group separates the lease and non-lease components of the contract and accounts for these separately. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\n## Leases as a lessee\n\nLease assets and lease liabilities are recognised at the lease commencement date, which is when the assets are available for use. The assets are initially measured at cost, which is the present value of future lease payments adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any make-good obligations and initial direct costs incurred.\n\nLease assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their useful life and the lease term. Refer to Note B.3 for the useful lives of assets. Periodic adjustments are made for any re-measurements of the lease assets and for impairment losses, assessed in accordance with the Group's impairment policies.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future minimum lease payments, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate. Minimum lease payments are fixed payments or index-based variable payments incorporating the Group's expectations of extension options and do not include non-lease components of a contract. A portfolio approach was taken when determining the implicit discount rate for LNG vessels with similar terms and conditions on transition.\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there are changes in future lease payments arising from a change in rates, index or lease terms from exercising an extension or termination option. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the lease assets, with any excess recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThere are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low value\n\nShort-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets are recognised as incurred as an expense in the consolidated income statement. Low value assets comprise plant and equipment.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group held $476 million of lease liabilities at 31 December 2021 (2020: $518 million) in currencies other than the US dollar (predominantly Australian dollars).",

The leases commence from 2025 and relate to facilities, marine vessels and carriers (refer to Note E.5).\n\nPayments of $68 million (2020: $101 million) for short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and payments of $18 million (2020: $17 million) for leases of low value assets were expensed in the consolidated income statement. Total payments for leases in the statement of cash flows are $330 million (2020: $275 million), with $244 million (2020: $157 million) included in financing activities.\n\nThe Group has short-term and low value lease commitments for marine vessels and carriers, property, drill rigs and plant and equipment contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements, of $53 million (2020: $94 million).\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Control\n\nJudgement is required to assess whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset and obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset.\n\n## (b) Lease term\n\nJudgement is required when assessing the term of the lease and whether to include optional extension and termination periods. Option periods are only included in determining the lease term at inception when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease terms are reassessed when a significant change in circumstances\n\noccurs. On this basis, possible additional lease payments amounting to $1,654 million (2020: $1,670 million) were not included in the\n\nmeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\n## (c) lnterest in joint arrangements\n\nJudgement is required to determine the Group's rights and obligations for lease contracts within joint operations, to assess whether lease liabilities are recognised gross (100%) or in proportion to the Group's participating interest in the joint operation. This includes an evaluation of whether the lease arrangement contains a sublease with the joint operation.\n\n## (d) Discount rates\n\nJudgement is required to determine the discount rate, where the discount rate is the Group's incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The incremental borrowing rate is determined with reference to the Group's borrowing portfolio at the inception of the arrangement or the time of the modification.",

The policy relating to sharebased payments is set out in Note E.2(c).\n\nAll employees of the Group are entitled to benefits on retirement, disability or death from the Group's superannuation plan. The majority of employees are party to a defined contribution scheme and receive fixed contributions from Group companies and the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions. Contributions to defined contribution funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payment is available. The Group also operates a defined benefit superannuation scheme, the membership of which is now closed. The net defined benefit plan asset at 31 December 2021 was $33 million (2020: $19 million).\n\n## (b) Compensation of key management personnel\n\nKey management personnel (KMP) compensation for the financial year was as follows:\n\n|                              | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab US/dollar.tab                                             | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab US/dollar.tab                                                     |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits | /six.tab/comma.tab/five.tab/nine.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/seven.tab/eight.tab         | /five.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/six.tab/eight.tab/comma.tab/four.tab/seven.tab/six.tab/space.tab       |\n| Post-employment benefits     | /seven.tab/seven.tab/comma.tab/five.tab/one.tab/five.tab                                    | /six.tab/three.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/zero.tab/five.tab/space.tab                                   |\n| Share-based payments         | /five.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab            | /seven.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/five.tab/three.tab/space.tab         |\n| Long-term employee benefits  | /seven.tab/one.tab/seven.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/two.tab/three.tab                            | /five.tab/one.tab/five.tab/comma.tab/five.tab/eight.tab/five.tab/space.tab                           |\n| Termination benefits         | /two.tab/comma.tab/four.tab/four.tab/seven.tab/comma.tab/five.tab/two.tab/five.tab          | /three.tab/nine.tab/zero.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab/seven.tab/space.tab                        |\n|                              | /one.tab/five.tab/comma.tab/four.tab/five.tab/zero.tab/comma.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/three.tab | /one.tab/four.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/three.tab/nine.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/zero.tab/six.tab/space.tab |\n\n## (c) Share plans\n\nThe Group provides benefits to its employees (including KMP) in the form of share-based payments whereby employees render services for shares (equity-settled transactions).\n\n## Woodside equity plan (WEP) and supplementary Woodside equity plan (SWEP)\n\nThe WEP is available to all permanent employees, but since 1 January 2018 has excluded EIS participants. The number of Equity Rights (ERs) o/ffered to each eligible employee is calculated with reference to salary and performance. The linking of performance to an allocation allows the Group to recognise and reward eligible employees for high performance. The ERs have no further ongoing performance conditions after allocation, and do not require participants to make any payment in respect of the ERs at grant or at vesting.\n\nEach ER relating to the WEP for 2018 and prior years entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share on a vesting date three years after the grant date. From the 2019 WEP onwards, 75% of the ERs o/ffered to each participant will vest three years after the grant date, with the remaining 25% vesting five years after the grant date.\n\nThe SWEP award is available to employees identified as being retention critical. Each ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date three years after the e/ffective grant date. Participants do not make any payment in respect of the ERs at grant or at vesting.\n\n## Executive incentive plans (EIP)\n\nThe EIP operated as Woodside's Executive incentive framework until the end of 2017, after which the Board introduced the EIS. The EIP was used to deliver short-term awards (STA) and longterm awards (LTA) to Senior Executives.\n\n## Short-term awards (STA)\n\nSTAs were delivered in the form of restricted shares to Executives, including all Executive KMP. There are no further performance conditions for vesting of deferred STA. Participants are not required to make any payments in respect of STA awards at grant or at vesting. Restricted shares entitle their holders to receive dividends.\n\n## Long-term awards (LTA)\n\nLTAs were granted in the form of Performance Rights (PRs) to Executives, including all Executive KMP. Vesting of LTA is subject to achievement of relative total shareholder return (RTSR) targets, with 33% measured against the ASX 50 and the remaining 67% tested against an international group of oil and gas companies.\n\nParticipants are not entitled to receive dividends and are not required to make any payments in respect of LTA awards at grant or at vesting.",

OTHER ITEMS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## E.2 Employee benefits (cont.)\n\n## Executive incentive scheme (EIS)\n\nThe EIS was introduced for the 2018 performance year for all Executives including Executive KMP. The EIS is delivered in the form of a cash incentive, Restricted Shares and Performance Rights. The grant date of the Restricted Shares and Performance Rights has been determined to be subsequent to the performance year, being the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Accordingly, the 2020 Restricted Shares and Performance Rights for Executives were granted on 17 February 2021, while the Performance Rights for the outgoing CEO were granted on 15 April 2021 and have been included in the table below. The expense estimated as at 31 December 2021 in relation to the 2021 performance year was updated to the fair value on grant date during the period.\n\nThe 2021 Restricted Shares and Performance Rights have not been included in the table below as they have not been approved as at 31 December 2021. An expense related to the 2021 performance year has been estimated for Restricted Shares and Performance Rights, using fair value estimates based on inputs at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nAll compensation under WEP, SWEP and  Executive share plans is accounted for as share-based payments to employees for\n\nservices provided. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair values of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share-based payments is recognised, together with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employee becomes fully entitled to the shares. At each balance sheet date, the Group reassesses the number of awards that are expected to vest based on service conditions. The expense recognised each year takes into account the most recent estimate.\n\nThe fair value of the benefit provided for the WEP and SWEP is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing technique. The fair value of the restricted shares is estimated as the closing share price at grant date. The fair value of the benefit provided for the RTSR PRs was estimated using the Binomial or Black-Scholes option pricing technique combined with a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, where relevant, using historical volatility to estimate the volatility of the share price in the future.\n\nThe number of awards and movements for all share plans are summarised as follows:\n\n## Number/space.tabof/space.tabperformance/space.tabawards\n\n|                                                                               | Employee/space.tabplans                                                                         | Employee/space.tabplans                                            | Executive/space.tabplans                                                        | Executive/space.tabplans                                                                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                               | WEP                                                                                             | SWEP                                                               | STA/three.num                                                                   | LTA/three.num                                                                                   |\n| Year ended 31 December 2021                                                   |                                                                                                 |                                                                    |                                                                                 |                                                                                                 |\n| Opening balance                                                               | /five.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/one.tab/eight.tab/comma.tab/six.tab/zero.tab/three.tab/space.tab    | -

The Group completed the relinquishment of permits AD-2, AD-5 and A-4 in 2021 and is in the process of withdrawing from AD-6, AD-7 and A-7. In 2022, the Group will also commence arrangements to formally exit AD-1, AD-8, the A-6 Joint Venture and the A-6 production sharing contract.\n\nThe principal activities of the joint operations above are exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Accounting for interests in other entities\n\nJudgement is required in assessing the level of control obtained in a transaction to acquire an interest in another entity; depending upon the facts and circumstances in each case, Woodside may obtain control, joint control or significant influence over the entity or arrangement. Judgement is applied when determining the relevant activities of a project and if joint control is held over it.\n\nRelevant activities include, but are not limited to, work program and budget approval, investment decision approval, voting rights in joint operating committees, amendments to permits and changes to joint arrangement participant holdings. Transactions which give Woodside control of a business are business combinations. If Woodside obtains joint control of an arrangement, judgement is also required to assess whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. If Woodside has neither control nor joint control, it may be in a position to exercise significant influence over the entity, which is then accounted for as an associate.",

OTHER ITEMS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## E.6 Joint arrangements (cont.)\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nJoint arrangements are arrangements in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractual agreed sharing of control of the arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements are classified as either a joint operation or joint venture, based on the rights and obligations arising from the contractual obligations between the parties to the arrangement.\n\nTo the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the individual assets and obligations arising from the joint arrangement, the arrangement is classified as a joint operation, and as such the Group recognises its:\n\n- \u00b7  assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;\n- \u00b7  liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;\n- \u00b7  revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation;\n- \u00b7  share of revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and\n- \u00b7  expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.\n\nTo the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the investment is classified as a joint venture and accounted for using the equity method.\n\nJoint arrangements acquired which are deemed to be carrying on a business are accounted for applying the principles of AASB 3 Business Combinations . Joint arrangements which are not deemed to be carrying on a business are treated as asset acquisitions.\n\n## E.7 Parent entity information\n\n|                                             | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab US/dollar.tabm                   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab US/dollar.tabm                |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Woodside Petroleum Ltd:                     |                                                                    |                                                                  |\n| Current assets                              | /four.tab/five.tab/six.tab/space.tab                               | /four.tab/four.tab/four.tab/space.tab                            |\n| Non-current assets                          | /one.tab/zero.tab/comma.tab/zero.tab/three.tab/seven.tab/space.tab | /one.tab/zero.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/five.tab/seven.tab/space.tab |\n| Current liabilities                         | (/three.tab/five.tab/seven.tab)                                    | -                                                                |\n| Non-current liabilities                     | (/three.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab)                                     | (/five.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab)                                   |\n| Net assets                                  | /nine.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/three.tab/six.tab/space.tab          | /one.tab/zero.tab/comma.tab/one.tab/two.tab/two.tab/space.tab    |\n| Issued and fully paid shares                | /nine.tab/comma.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab/space.tab           | /nine.tab/comma.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/seven.tab/space.tab         |\n| Shares reserved for employee share plans    | (/three.tab/zero.tab)                                              | (/two.tab/three.tab)                                             |\n| Employee benefits reserve                   | /one.tab/one.tab/two.tab/space.tab                                 | /one.tab/one.tab/seven.tab/space.tab                             |\n| Foreign currency translation reserve        | /two.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/space.tab                                | /two.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/space.tab                              |\n| Distributable profits reserve               | /five.tab/eight.tab/space.tab                                      | /four.tab/six.tab/two.tab/space.tab                              |\n| Retained earnings                           | (/nine.tab)                                                        | (/two.tab/seven.tab)                                             |\n| Total shareholders equity                   | /nine.tab/comma.tab/eight.tab/three.tab/six.tab/space.tab          | /one.tab/zero.tab/comma.tab/one.tab/two.tab/two.tab/space.tab    |\n| Profit of parent entity                     | /one.tab/eight.tab/space.tab                                       | /eight.tab/five.tab/two.tab/space.tab                            |\n| Total comprehensive income of parent entity | /one.tab/eight.tab/space.tab                                       | /eight.tab/five.tab/two.tab/space.tab                            |\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWoodside Petroleum Ltd and Woodside Energy Ltd (a subsidiary company) are parties to a Deed of Cross Guarantee as disclosed in Note E.8.

OTHER ITEMS\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## E.9 Other accounting policies\n\n## (a) Summary of other significant accounting policies\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nThe parent and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities have elected to enter a tax consolidation, with Woodside Petroleum Ltd as the head entity of the tax consolidated group. The members of the tax consolidated group are identified in Note E.8(a).\n\nThe tax expense/benefit, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary di/fferences of the members of the tax consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements of the members of the tax consolidated group, using the stand-alone approach.\n\nEntities within the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax sharing agreement with the head entity. Under the tax funding agreement, Woodside Petroleum Ltd and each of the entities in the tax consolidated group have agreed to pay or receive a tax equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax liability or current tax asset of the entity.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax consolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities, should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.\n\n## (b)  New and amended accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet e/ffective\n\nA number of new standards, amendments of standards and interpretations have recently been issued but are not yet e/ffective and have not been adopted by the Group as at the financial reporting date.\n\nThe Group has reviewed these standards and interpretations and has determined that none of the new or amended standards will significantly a/ffect the Group's accounting policies, financial position or performance.\n\n## (c) New and amended accounting standards and interpretations adopted\n\nThe Group adopted AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform as of 1 January 2021.\n\nThe amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting e/ffects when an interbank o/ffered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free interest rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical expedients:\n\n- \u00b7  practical expedients when accounting for changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7  reliefs from discontinuing hedge relationships;\n- \u00b7  temporary relief from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement when a RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component; and\n- \u00b7  additional AASB 7 Financial Instruments disclosures.\n\nThese amendments did not impact the financial statements of the Group other than additional required disclosures (refer to Note D.6). The Group intends to use the practical expedients in future periods when existing IBORs are replaced by RFRs.\n\nA number of other new standards are also e/ffective from 1 January 2021 but they do not have a material e/ffect on the Group's financial statements.",

Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.\n\n## 1. Restoration obligations\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group has recognised provisions for restoration obligations relating to onshore and offshore assets of $2,218 million.\n\nAs disclosed in Note D.5, the calculation of r estoration provisions is conducted by specialist engineers and requires judgemental assumptions to be made by the Group regarding removal date, compliance with environmental legislation and regulations, the extent of restoration activities required, the engineering methodology for estimating cost, f uture removal technologies in determining the removal cost, and liability-specific discount rates to determine the present value of these cash flows.\n\nThe judgements and estimates in respect of restoration provisions are based on conditions existing at 31 December 2021 including key assumptions related to certain items composed of steel, or steel and concrete, with\n\nhydrocarbons removed remaining in-situ. Australian regulator approval for these items remaining in-situ will only be provided towards the end of field life and accordingly at 31 December 2021, there is uncertainty whether the Australian regulator will approve plans for t hese items to be decommissioned in-situ.\n\nSignificant assumptions and estimates outlined above are inherently subjective. Changes in these assumptions can lead to significant changes in the restoration provision. In this context, the disclosures in the financial report provide particularly important information about the assumptions made in the calculation of the restoration provision and uncertainties at 31 December 2021. As a result, we consider the restoration provision calculation and the related disclosures in the financial report to be a key audit matter. For the same reasons, we consider it important to draw attention to the information in Note D.5.\n\nWe assessed the restoration obligation provisions prepared by the Group, evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used and t he estimates made.\n\nOur audit procedures included the following:\n\n- \u25ba evaluating the Group's process for identifying legal and regulatory obligations for restoration and testing the completeness of operating locations included in the restoration provision and the completeness and accuracy of data used within the Group's estimates;\n- \u25ba compared current year cost estimates to those of the prior year and considered management's explanations where t hese changed;\n- \u25ba in conjunction with our environmental specialists, we evaluated the restoration cost estimates based on the relevant current legal and regulatory requirements;\n- \u25ba compared the timing of the future cash outflows against the anticipated end of field life, cross-checking these dates were consistent to the Group's reserves estimates and impairment calculations;\n- \u25ba evaluated the appropriateness of management's methodology for estimating future costs. For a sample of locations within the Group, we assessed the reasonableness of key assumptions in the estimation of future costs;\n- \u25ba evaluated the appropriateness of the discount rates used to calculate the present value of the provision;\n- \u25ba assessed the competence, capability and objectivity of the Group's internal experts used in the determination of the restoration provision;\n- \u25ba t ested the mathematical accuracy of the restoration provision calculations and the sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe also considered the adequacy and completeness of the f inancial report disclosure of the assumptions, key estimates and judgements applied by the Group.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

Carrying value of oil and gas properties\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAustralian Accounting Standards require an entity to assess throughout the reporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, or that reversal of a previously recognised impairment may be required. If any such indication exists, an entity shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset .\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group concluded t hat there were impairment/impairment reversal indicators for the Pluto-Scarborough, NWS Gas, NWS Oil and Wheatstone cash generating units (CGUs). Impairment testing was undertaken as outlined in Note B.4, resulting in an impairment reversal of $1,058 million relating to Pluto-Scarborough and NWS Gas CGUs. No impairment/impairment reversal was recognised in respect to the NWS Oil and Wheatstone CGUs.\n\nKey assumptions, judgements and estimates, used in the formulation of the Group's impairment testing of the oil and gas properties are disclosed in Note B.4.\n\nThe assessment of indicators of impairment and reversal of impairment and the impairment t esting process are complex and highly judgemental and are based on assumptions which are impacted by expected future performance and market conditions. Accordingly, this matter was considered to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated the Group's consideration of internal and external sources of information in assessing whether indicators of impairment or reversal of impairment existed.\n\nWhere impairment or impairment reversal indicators were present and impairment testing was conducted by the Group, we evaluated the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group and the estimates made in conducting this testing. In particular, we considered those judgements and estimates related to the determination of CGUs, the forecast cash flows and the inputs used to formulate those cash flows such as commodity prices, discount rates, reserves, inflation rates, operating costs and f oreign exchange rates.\n\nWe involved our valuations, modelling and economics specialists to assist in t he impairment assessment for the audit. Our audit procedures were undertaken across the CGUs for which impairment and impairment reversal indicators were identified.\n\nSpecifically, we evaluated the discounted cash flow models and other data supporting the Group's assessment. In doing so, we:\n\n- \u25ba considered future production profiles compared to reserves, current approved budgets and historical production, and t ested variations were in accordance with our expectations based upon other information obtained throughout the audit;\n- \u25ba evaluated discount rates, inflation rates and foreign exchange rates with reference to market prices (where available), market indices, broker consensus and historical performance;\n- \u25ba evaluated commodity prices with reference to contractual arrangements, market prices (where available), broker consensus, analyst views and historical performance;\n- \u25ba compared future operating and development expenditure to current sanctioned budgets, historical expenditure and t ested variations were in accordance with our expectations based upon other information obtained throughout the audit;\n- \u25ba assessed whether the reversal of impairment charge recorded in the financial statements agreed to the underlying impairment testing models;\n- \u25ba evaluated how the Group's response to climate risk has been reflected in the assessment of the recoverable amount of t he CGUs;\n- \u25ba assessed the impact of changes to key assumptions on the recoverable amount of the CGUs; and\n- \u25ba t ested the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow models and the sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe reviewed the calculation of the extent of the original cost impaired adjusted for depreciation for the Pluto-Scarborough and NWS Gas CGUs at 31 December 2021 to test the amount recorded did not exceed the carrying value of the CGU if the prior year impairments were not initially recorded.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

This included understanding the reserve estimation processes carried out, the Group's internal certification process f or technical and commercial experts who are responsible for reserves, the design of the Group's Petroleum Resources Management procedures and its alignment with the guidelines prepared by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. We also examined the competence and objectivity of the Group's internal and external experts and the scope and appropriateness of their work. We involved our oil and gas reserves engineering specialists in the assessment of the reserves estimation methodology and to test significant revisions.\n\nWe also considered the adequacy of the financial report disclosures regarding the assumptions, key estimates and judgements applied by management for the Group's impairment assessments, and in respect of sensitivity analysis disclosed. These disclosures are included in Note B.4.\n\n## Information other than the financial report and auditor's report thereon\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if , individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u25ba Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25ba Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u25ba Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If  we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u25ba Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions t aken t o eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

We have done this on the basis that such information, if disclosed, would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to Woodside (for example, because the information is premature, commercially sensitive, confidential or could give a third party a commercial advantage). The omitted information relates to our internal budgets, forecasts and estimates, details of our business strategy, and LNG contractual pricing.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements, including statements of current intention, statements of opinion and expectations regarding Woodside's present and future operations, possible future events and future financial prospects. Such statements are not statements of fact and may be a/ffected by a variety of known and unknown risks, variables and changes in underlying assumptions or strategy that could cause Woodside's actual results or performance to di/ffer materially from the results or performance expressed or implied by such statements. There can be no certainty of outcome in relation to the matters to which the statements relate, and the outcomes are not all within the control of Woodside.\n\nFurther information on some important factors that could cause actual results or performance to di/ffer materially from those projected in such statements is contained in the 'Risk' section on pages 51-54. Woodside makes no representation, assurance or guarantee as to the accuracy or likelihood of fulfilment of any forward-\n\nlooking statement or any outcomes expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. The forward-looking statements in this report reflect expectations held at the date of this report. Except as required by applicable law or the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules, Woodside disclaims any obligation or undertaking to publicly update any forward-looking statements, or discussion of future financial prospects, whether as a result of new information or of future events.\n\n## Emissions data\n\nAll greenhouse gas emissions data in this report are estimates, due to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring or quantifying greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWoodside 'greenhouse gas' or 'emissions' information reported are Scope 1 GHG emissions, Scope 2 GHG emissions, and Scope 3 GHG emissions. For more information on emissions data refer to Climate Report 2021 and the Sustainable Development 2021.\n\n## Other important information\n\nThis report also contains references to the proposed combination of Woodside and BHP Group Limited's oil and gas business (Proposed Transaction). The Proposed Transaction remains subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent including shareholder and regulatory approvals. Completion is targeted in early June 2022, with an e/ffective date of 1 July 2021. There is no certainty or assurance that the Proposed Transaction will complete on the intended schedule or at all. Information in this report regarding the Proposed Transaction must be read subject to that uncertainty. For more information, refer to the announcement 'Woodside and BHP to create a global energy company' by Woodside dated 22 November 2021, available at https:// www.woodside.com.au/media-centre/announcements.",

Comparative financial information prior to 2016 has not been restated for AASB 15.\n- 2.  2019 includes the adoption of AASB 16 Leases.\n- 3.  2019 amounts have been restated for the application of reporting on a LNG Portfolio basis. Comparative financial information prior to 2018 has not been restated.\n- 4.  The calculation for EBITDA has been updated to exclude impairment, impairment reversals and amortisation of licence acquisition costs. 2012 to 2013 EBITDA numbers have been restated to reflect this change in calculation. EBIT is calculated as a profit before income tax, PRRT and net finance costs.\n- 5.  Earnings per share has been calculated using the following weighted average number of shares (2021: 962,604,811; 2020: 951,113,086; 2019: 935,833,092; 2018: 921,165,018; 2017: 866,201,877; 2016: 835,011,896; 2015: 822,943,960; 2014: 822,771,118; 2013:822,983,715; 2012: 814,751,356).\n- 6.  The calculation for ROACE has been revised in 2014 to use EBIT as the numerator, in addition to a change in the composition of capital employed. ROACE for 2012 to 2013 has been restated to include this change.\n- 7. Finding cost methodology is in accordance with SEC industry standard. The 2020 outcome excludes the impact of Greater Pluto (WA-404-P) Proved (1P) Undeveloped Reserves of 91 MMboe being reclassified to Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources, resulting from impairment of Pluto (WA-404-P).",
