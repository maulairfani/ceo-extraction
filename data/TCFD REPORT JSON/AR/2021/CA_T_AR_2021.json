In 2021, we achieved all four of our consolidated financial targets. Our financial results reflected strong mobile and fixed customer growth and improved margins within mobility\n\nand fixed data services, along with a larger contribution from DLCX, while we continued to invest strategically to enhance our network leadership position and digitization strategy. See Section 1.4 in the MD&A for a detailed description of our results.\n\n## Caution regarding forward-looking statements summary\n\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements including statements relating to our 2022 targets, environmental and sustainability targets, expected performance and plans for powering our success, including expected financial results of TELUS Agriculture, and multi-year dividend growth program. By their nature, forward-looking statements do not refer to historical facts and require the Company to make assumptions and predictions, and are subject to inherent risks. There is significant risk that the forward-looking statements will not prove to be accurate and there can be no assurance that TELUS will achieve its targets or performance goals or maintain its multi-year dividend growth program. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as a number of factors (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory developments and government decisions, the competitive environment, technological substitution, supply chain disruption and dependence on a limited number of suppliers, economic performance in Canada, our earnings and free cash flow, and our capital expenditures) could cause actual future performance and events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, this document is subject to the disclaimer and qualified by the assumptions (including assumptions on which our 2022 annual targets and guidance are based and regarding semi-annual dividend increases through 2022), qualifications and risk factors as set out in Management's discussion and analysis in this report, especially Sections 9 and 10, and in other TELUS public disclosure documents and filings with securities commissions in Canada (on SEDAR at sedar.com ) and in the United States (on EDGAR at sec.gov ). Except as required by law, TELUS disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, and reserves the right to change, at any time at its sole discretion, its current practice of updating annual targets and guidance. Statements regarding our 2022 targets are presented for the purpose of assisting our investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected 2022 financial results, as well as our objectives, strategic priorities and business outlook. Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6 /bullet.ss01",

Even as we experienced more relaxed public health measures, our innovative digital My TELUS app, virtual call centres and touchless install, repair and fulfilment processes remained our primary means of interacting with customers. Similarly, our business clients capitalized on our expertise in digital connectivity to enable the productivity of their employees. In addition, we shared best practices for supporting the mental wellness of their teams and ensuring their own customers could do business safely. Moreover, through our #StandWithOwners campaign, we invited Canadians to support local entrepreneurs and celebrate small business heroes as they worked to sustain their companies through the pandemic.\n\nImportantly, our team assisted with COVID-19 vaccine efforts in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Your Company enabled the largest vaccine roll-out program in B.C.'s history, booking seven million vaccination appointments while accelerating the province's timelines and ensuring our most vulnerable citizens were given access to vaccines expeditiously. At the same time, our team offered support to citizens across the country facing other challenges, including flooding and wildfires, reinforcing that when things are at their worst, our customers and communities can count on TELUS to be at our best.\n\n## Acce/l.ss08erat/i.ss01ng /i.ss01nvestments /i.ss01n our wor/l.ss08d-/l.ss08ead/i.ss01ng broadband networks\n\nOur team is driven by our collective desire to leverage our technological and human innovation to enable vital connectivity for Canadians.

Through TELUS Mobility for Good, we offer a free smartphone and fully subsidized data plan to youth transitioning out of foster care, eligible lowincome senior citizens and Indigenous women at risk or surviving violence. TELUS Tech for Good provides differently abled Canadians facing challenges using smartphones and tablets with assistive technology and training that help them live more independently.

Altogether, we are providing more than 80,000 people living in Indigenous communities with vital access to our PureFibre network.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our Indigenous Reconciliation and Connectivity Report detailing the many ways your Company is working collaboratively with Indigenous partners to support long-term prosperity in communities around the country. Building on our long-standing, respectful and productive relationships with Indigenous Peoples, we engaged Elders, leaders and TELUS team members to create our Reconciliation Commitment and five-year Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan.\n\nCentral to our Reconciliation Commitment is the desire to support the diverse needs of Indigenous Peoples to build relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous businesses, helping to grow the economy and enabling prosperity for Indigenous Peoples. In this regard, we were proud to stand in solidarity with residential school survivors and their families through our $ 8 million commitment in 2021 toward Indigenous-led entrepreneurs, projects and initiatives. This includes a $ 1 million gift to digitize, promote and distribute the Witness Blanket (see sidebar), as well as investments from the TELUS Pollinator Fund in Indigenousled businesses, and grants from the TELUS Community Boards and TELUS Friendly Future Foundation (TFFF).\n\n## Tak/i.ss01ng accountab/i.ss01/l.ss08/i.ss01ty to /i.ss01nvest /i.ss01n susta/i.ss01nab/l.ss08e bus/i.ss01nesses and char/i.ss01tab/l.ss08e organ/i.ss01zat/i.ss01ons\n\nThe TELUS Pollinator Fund - one of the world's largest social impact investing funds - celebrated its first",

These businesses are focused on social innovation that drives better health outcomes, sustainable food systems, inclusive communities and a greener planet.\n\nLikewise, the TFFF marked its third year and, in 2021, committed more than $ 8.7 million in cash donations to 500 charitable organizations, while fundraising more than $ 3 million. The TFFF has contributed over $ 25 million to our communities since its inception, supporting the incredible work of our TELUS Community Boards.

Indeed, as the pandemic continued throughout 2021, we remained committed to the health and mental wellness of our team members. In alignment with the National Standard for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace, we introduced our TELUS Mental Health Commitment to reinforce the role we all play in promoting healthy practices and offer meaningful solutions and support to colleagues. These included the creation of our team member-led mental health first aid network and a customized training program to help team members identify and address potential mental health issues.\n\nIn 2021, your Company again earned a world-leading team member engagement score of 84 per cent, placing TELUS in the top 10 per cent of all employers globally. This result, which would be impressive in a normal year, was extraordinary considering the highly dynamic environment that characterized 2021.\n\nIn keeping with our belief that a diverse work environment facilitates a broader exchange of ideas and elasticity of thought, helping us to better understand and support the needs of our stakeholders, your Company progressed our diversity and inclusion strategy across our TELUS family. This included launching a new TELUS Resource Group to support Black team members, and implementing an enhanced Board diversity policy that has enabled us to achieve 46 per cent female representation and 23 per cent of independent directors who represent a visible minority or are Indigenous.\n\n## Exemp/l.ss08/i.ss01fy/i.ss01ng the symb/i.ss01ot/i.ss01c re/l.ss08at/i.ss01onsh/i.ss01p between do/i.ss01ng good /i.ss01n our commun/i.ss01t/i.ss01es and do/i.ss01ng we/l.ss08/l.ss08 /i.ss01n bus/i.ss01ness\n\nUndeniably, our culture of caring was displayed throughout 2021 as our highly engaged team offered its support to those who needed us most.

Across TELUS technology solutions (TTech), we generated industry-leading results in 2021. Overall, TTech revenue was $ 15 billion, while Adjusted EBITDA was $ 5.5 billion. Our team drove leading operational and financial results in our fixed portfolio, including data services revenue growth of more than 12 per cent.\n\nThese results were bolstered by our highly differentiated and potent asset mix geared towards high-growth, technologyoriented verticals, including TELUS International (TI), TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture (TAG). When looking at TELUS' two-year performance through the pandemic period, from 2019 to 2021, our total revenue and EBITDA growth of close to 18 and seven per cent, respectively, as well as our more than 1.7 million net new total customer additions, represented industry-leading performance by a substantial margin and demonstrates the significant economic value we are creating through our superior product portfolio.\n\nTI continues to generate strong, double-digit revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA growth, concluding their first year as a public company with impressive results that surpassed their financial targets for 2021. These robust results reinforce TI's position as the partner of choice for premier digital customer experiences, as clients around the world look to TI to design, build and deliver end-to-end next-generation digital solutions and services, including a unique and unparalleled mix of content moderation and artificial intelligence capabilities.\n\nSimilarly, TELUS Business Solutions contributed to TELUS' strong performance and is expected to continue delivering robust outcomes with the expansion of 5G, Internet of Things and new industry-based solutions. For example, we launched a strategic alliance with GM Canada, the first of its kind in Canada, leveraging our world-leading 5G network to enable an unparalleled experience to keep millions of citizens safe and connected.\n\n## We/l.ss08com/i.ss01ng a h/i.ss01stor/i.ss01c number of new mob/i.ss01/l.ss08e and f/i.ss01xed customers\n\nIn 2021, TELUS' operational excellence was again characterized by the consistent combination of industryleading and profitable customer growth, with an all-time\n\nrecord 960,000 total new client additions - ranking TELUS number one in the industry for new customer growth, driven by industry-best mobile and fixed wireline additions.\n\nIn mobile, TELUS achieved industry-leading customer growth of 705,000 net additions. This included 367,000 mobile phone and 338,000 connected device net new customers, representing an all-time record high for connected devices for your Company. Mobile network revenue increased three per cent, reflective of our focus on high-quality customer growth, underpinned by an exceptional service experience, leading customer loyalty and strong base management. Moreover, postpaid mobile churn of 0.74 per cent improved by four basis points over 2020, representing our eighth consecutive year of industry-leading customer loyalty, with postpaid churn below one per cent.\n\nNotably, we earned a record 255,000 new TV, internet, voice and security customers, reflecting the potency of our expansive PureFibre network capabilities, as well as our superior bundled offerings and success in driving higher product intensity with our customers. Indeed, during a year fraught with anxiety and ambiguity, TELUS SmartHome Security and TELUS Secure Business provided increased peace of mind for consumers and businesses. As a result, we welcomed our 800,000th security client by the end of 2021, reflecting our innovation in virtual and do-it-yourself installations, and capacity for acquiring and integrating new assets, nationally.\n\n## Answer/i.ss01ng the wor/l.ss08d/quoteright.ss01s most press/i.ss01ng soc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 cha/l.ss08/l.ss08enges /i.ss01n hea/l.ss08thcare and agr/i.ss01cu/l.ss08ture\n\nOur leading results were supported by our high-growth verticals, which once again reflected the strength of our digital capabilities.

Indeed, our rebranded virtual care services, TELUS Health MyCare for consumers and our employer-subscribed TELUS Health Virtual Care, as well as our Home Health Monitoring and Virtual Visit services, enabled healthcare providers to safely support patients virtually throughout the pandemic. Similarly, our team launched TELUS Health LivingWell Companion on Apple Watch, becoming the first company in Canada to offer personal emergency response service through Apple Watch. This service enables Canadians with health issues or who may be at risk of falling with improved safety and peace of mind with 24/7 emergency monitoring. Notably, by year-end 2021, we covered more than 20 million lives through our health solutions, an increase of nearly 22 per cent, year-over-year, completed over 550 million digital health transactions and earned more than one million new virtual healthcare members, representing a 65 per cent",

Moreover, in early 2022, our team launched TELUS Health Virtual Pharmacy, providing Canadians with fast and reliable online access to prescription medications and refills.\n\nFurthermore, through our ongoing efforts to scale and integrate our unique TAG business, we generated doubledigit revenue growth across our three lines of business agribusiness; food, beverage and consumer goods; and animal health - concluding the year with annual revenue of over $ 400 million. These results are illustrative of the efforts of our skilled team of innovators at TAG who are working diligently toward the creation of a fully connected producerto-consumer value chain, improving the quality, safety, distribution and sustainability of food and consumer goods.

Throughout another challenging year, your Company returned significant capital to shareholders, while maintaining a robust balance sheet and making ongoing generational investments in innovative broadband technologies.\n\nIndeed, through our accelerated broadband investment program, we advanced approximately $ 1.5 billion of incremental capital expenditures into 2021 and 2022. Investing from a position of strength and leadership, these transformational investments bolster TELUS' superior competitive position, including connecting thousands of additional homes and businesses to our PureFibre network, enhancing the speed and coverage of our 5G capabilities and amplifying the digital customer experience. Furthermore, as part of this accelerated broadband build, we are advancing our copper-to-fibre migration program. In this regard, our team exceeded our copper-to-fibre migration target in 2021 and is on track to substantially complete the migration by the end of 2022.\n\nImportantly, these generational investments, combined with the accelerated decommissioning of legacy copper infrastructure, will fuel enhanced customer growth and improved connectivity, alongside significant operating\n\nefficiencies and positive cash flow benefits as our expedited broadband build nears completion. By advancing our world-leading networks, we are generating improved social and economic outcomes in the communities we serve.\n\nAdditionally, as a result of the pull-forward of our broadband investments, commencing in 2023, we are targeting a significant decline in our annual capital expenditures to $ 2.5 billion, or less. Free cash flow will be strengthened by the expected capex decline of approximately $ 1 billion over 2022, in addition to strong ongoing EBITDA expansion. Importantly, this initiative will support the sustained advancement of our operational and financial performance well into the future, strengthening our confidence in the robust outlook for our business, amplified by strong anticipated future growth in our emerging growth businesses.\n\nOur consistently strong results, supported by transformational investments in communities across Canada, underpin your Company's ability to create unparalleled long-term value for our shareholders. Since the beginning of 2000 through December 31, 2021, TELUS has generated a total shareholder return of 700 per cent. This result is 357 points higher than the return for the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX Composite Index (TSX) of 343 per cent and 694 percentage points higher than the return from the MSCI World Telecom Services Index of six per cent. Moreover, over the past five, 10 and 15 years, TELUS has surpassed the TSX return by an average of 87 percentage points.\n\n## Bu/i.ss01/l.ss08d/i.ss01ng va/l.ss08ue for Canad/i.ss01ans through our /i.ss01ndustry-/l.ss08ead/i.ss01ng d/i.ss01v/i.ss01dend growth program\n\nImportantly, we anticipate that our accelerated broadband investment initiative, coupled with your Company's ongoing, leading operational and financial performance, will augment the long-term sustainability of our industryleading dividend growth program, now in its 12th year. In 2021, we announced our 21st dividend increase, raising our annual dividends declared by 7.3 per cent over 2020. Notably, since 2004, TELUS has returned $ 21 billion to shareholders, including $ 15.7 billion in dividends and $ 5.2 billion in share purchases, representing over $ 15 per share.\n\nThrough individual holdings, mutual funds and pension plans, as well as our own TELUS team members who collectively represent our fourth largest shareholder, TELUS investors are our neighbours, friends and colleagues. Undeniably, when our team puts our customers and communities first, the resulting prosperity enables us to improve the outcomes of Canadian families, retirees and pensioners who invest in TELUS.",

This sustainable financing structure ties the effective interest rate to the achievement of our longterm, impactful operational greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction target, specifically, a 46 per cent reduction in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions over 2019 levels by 2030, in addition to becoming net carbon neutral in our operations by 2030 or sooner.\n\nSimilarly, embracing tax morality is a means of investing in our communities. Since 2000, your Company has paid circa $ 51 billion in total tax and spectrum remittances to our federal, provincial and municipal governments in Canada, consisting of corporate income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, employer portion of payroll taxes and various regulatory fees. These funds support public works projects, education, healthcare, cultural pursuits and other initiatives that improve the social and economic well-being of our communities.\n\n## Evo/l.ss08v/i.ss01ng our brand prom/i.ss01se to Let/quoteright.ss01s make the future fr/i.ss01end/l.ss08y\n\nFor 20 years, we have been guided by our brand promise, the future is friendly, as we leverage the power of technology to create positive experiences and meaningful social outcomes for people around the world. The pandemic and social injustices have prompted us to reflect on what is truly important, including the values we hold dear. Our refreshed brand promise, Let's make the future friendly , welcomes everyone to join us as we strive to make the world a better place.\n\nYour Company was recognized as one of Strategy Magazine's 2021 Brands of the Year for our leadership in social capitalism. We meaningfully integrated purpose into marketing communications across all customer touchpoints, increasing socially responsible perceptions of TELUS by 30 per cent and reaching more than 10 million customers. In addition, TELUS enabled our team members to share our social purpose messaging on their own social networks.\n\n## Tak/i.ss01ng /l.ss08eadersh/i.ss01p /i.ss01n 2022 through /i.ss01nsp/i.ss01r/i.ss01ng soc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 and f/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 targets\n\nLeveraging the momentum gained over the long term, in concert with the power of our globally leading networks, our high-performing team anticipates an equally successful 2022, as exemplified through our new community giving, social impact and financial targets.\n\nAs we continue to empower citizens to lead healthier, safer, more connected lives, our social impact and giving targets for 2022 include: inspiring our TELUS family to contribute 1.4 million hours of volunteerism, improving the economic and health outcomes for a cumulative 320,000 low-income Canadians through our Connecting for Good programs, contributing $ 90 million to charitable and community organizations, inspiring $ 3.3 million in fundraising and stewardship for the TFFF and launching a new signature national student bursary program, and investing $ 20 million to support new socially responsible businesses through our TELUS Pollinator social impact investment fund.\n\nIn terms of our sustainability goals, we anticipate that 100 per cent of our electricity requirements will come from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2025, our operations will be net carbon neutral by 2030 or earlier, we will become a zero waste company by 2030, and energy efficiency will improve by 50 per cent over 2019 levels by 2030. As signatories to the United Nations Global Compact, we take action and share progress in respect of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption practices, reinforcing our commitment to creating stronger, more sustainable communities.\n\nFinancially, our targets for 2022 include growth in both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of eight to 10 per cent, capital expenditures of approximately $ 3.4 billion, and robust free cash flow of $ 1 billion to $ 1.2 billion. Notably, when compared to 2019, our targets for 2022 represent 25 to 27 per cent revenue growth, and 15 to 17 per cent EBITDA growth, versus the pre-pandemic period.\n\n## Thank/i.ss01ng you for your ongo/i.ss01ng support\n\nIn 2021, our TELUS family passionately demonstrated the power of our purpose, driving positive outcomes for the many stakeholders we serve. Throughout 2022, you can count on our 100,000 TELUS team members and retirees, globally, to leverage that same passion and purpose to put our customers first and to drive the operational and financial results that allow us to invest in our philanthropy, the expansion of our networks and the success of our team, our communities, and you, our shareholders.\n\nTogether, we are making the future friendly and I remain grateful for your ongoing support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDarren Entwistle Proud member of the TELUS team for more than two decades February 18, 2022",

Visit telus.com/purpose for more information.\n\n## Connect/i.ss01ng those who need us most\n\nIn 2021, we continued to extend our Mobility for Good\u00ae program, offering free or subsidized mobile phone rate plans and devices to all youth aging out of foster care and to lowincome seniors across Canada. During the year, we added 7,000 Canadians to the program, helping them stay connected to vital support networks and resources. Importantly, more than 28,000 Canadians have benefited since the program began in 2017.\n\nIn October, we launched Mobility for Good for Indigenous Women at Risk, providing free smartphones and data plans to Indigenous women at risk of or surviving violence. In partnership with grassroots Indigenousled organizations, the program offers a vital lifeline to the critical services and\n\nresources they need for their health, safety and wellness.\n\nIn May, we expanded Tech for Good\u2122 nationally through a partnership with March of Dimes Canada. Launched in 2019, this newly expanded program will empower more Canadians living with disabilities to use their smartphones and tablets independently and improve their quality of life with customized support, training and assistive technology. At the end of 2021, more than 4,600 Canadians had participated in the program and/or benefited from the TELUS accessibility discount for people living with disabilities.\n\nOur Internet for Good\u00ae program also continued to grow in 2021, providing close to 12,000 low-income families, youth aging out of foster care and people living with disabilities with vital access to low-cost, high-speed internet service. By the end of 2021, 106,000 Canadians had benefited from low-cost internet since the program began in 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The program provides primary care, mental health and addiction support services to individuals experiencing homelessness in 14 communities across the country. Through our mobile health clinics, we supported 35,000 patient visits in 2021 and administered more than 9,000 COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nOur innovative virtual care offerings also continued to grow to meet the increasing demand and evolving healthcare needs of Canadians. In April, we introduced TELUS Health Virtual Care and became the first digital health provider in Canada to integrate an employer-focused virtual care platform with electronic medical records (EMRs). With TELUS Health Virtual Care, critical patient health information from virtual care sessions can be shared securely, with consent, with any of the 34,000 health professionals who are using our EMR solutions across Canada.\n\nIn June, we expanded TELUS Health MyCare to provide Canadians with a robust suite of physical and mental health and well-being services, including in-person clinics and advanced digital health tools, as well as greater access to physicians, counsellors and dietitians.

As an example, we have enhanced our Bring-It-Back\u00ae device program, enabling customers to receive credit for returning used mobile devices. We then use those devices to support programs like Mobility for Good, which ensures connectivity for vulnerable citizens. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have donated more than 14,000 refurbished mobile devices and free rate plans to help isolated seniors, hospital patients and vulnerable Canadians stay connected.\n\n## Comm/i.ss01tted to good governance\n\nWe are strongly committed to high standards in corporate governance.

We recognize that, in all areas of our business, different perspectives and experiences bring innovative ways of thinking that enable us to deliver better insights, decisions and solutions.\n\nIn late 2020, we updated our Board diversity targets, establishing specific goals of having women and men each represent at least one-third of independent directors and at least two directors who represent a visible minority or are Indigenous by the annual meeting in 2023. In May 2021, we surpassed these targets two years early, with our Board including six independent directors (46 per cent) who are women and three directors who represent a visible minority or are Indigenous.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our sixth TELUS resource group (TRG), called Reach, to advance diverse representation in decision-making and to shine light on systemic issues that disproportionately and uniquely affect the Black community. The other five TRGs have been established over time to support women, Indigenous team members, team members with varying abilities, new immigrants and multicultural team members, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2+) team members. Since the first group was launched in 2006, our TRGs have grown to more than 7,000 members worldwide.\n\nWe appreciate and celebrate every team member's unique talents, voice and abilities, and encourage everyone to always bring their whole selves to work. To measure our progress in cultivating an inclusive culture, we introduced an inclusion index in 2021 as part of our annual engagement survey and achieved a score of 85 per cent, indicating",

Developed with guidance from Indigenous voices and Indigenous-led frameworks of reconciliation, the Plan is based on four pillars where we believe we can drive meaningful change - connectivity, enabling social outcomes, cultural responsiveness and relationships, and economic reconciliation. For more information, visit telus.com/reconciliation .\n\nWe continue to collaborate with Indigenous governments and organizations to deliver advanced broadband connectivity to Indigenous communities within our servicing area.

The course is narrated and translated in 11 languages and is available to approximately 90,000 team members around the world.\n\nWe continue to provide an EthicsLine for anonymous and confidential questions or complaints on internal control and other issues related to integrity. Calls are handled by an independent agency, offering multi-language services to internal and external callers 24 hours a day. For the 19th consecutive year, none of the calls reported to the Ethics Office in 2021 involved officers or team members with a significant role in internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Best pract/i.ss01ces /i.ss01n corporate governance\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Say-on-pay vote\n- /bullet.ss01 Ma/j.ss01or/i.ss01ty vot/i.ss01ng po/l.ss08/i.ss01cy\n- /bullet.ss01 C/l.ss08awback po/l.ss08/i.ss01cy\n- /bullet.ss01 Board d/i.ss01vers/i.ss01ty po/l.ss08/i.ss01cy\n- /bullet.ss01 Shareho/l.ss08der engagement po/l.ss08/i.ss01cy\n- /bullet.ss01 Ins/i.ss01der trad/i.ss01ng po/l.ss08/i.ss01cy\n- /bullet.ss01 Code of eth/i.ss01cs and conduct and Eth/i.ss01csL/i.ss01ne\n- /bullet.ss01 Pr/i.ss01vacy management program framework\n- /bullet.ss01 Enterpr/i.ss01se r/i.ss01sk governance and overs/i.ss01ght\n- /bullet.ss01 Board recru/i.ss01tment process and or/i.ss01entat/i.ss01on programs\n- /bullet.ss01 Mandatory educat/i.ss01on sess/i.ss01ons for the Board\n- /bullet.ss01 Board and comm/i.ss01ttee success/i.ss01on p/l.ss08ann/i.ss01ng\n- /bullet.ss01 CEO success/i.ss01on p/l.ss08ann/i.ss01ng\n- /bullet.ss01 Independent th/i.ss01rd-party eva/l.ss08uat/i.ss01ons of the Board\n- /bullet.ss01 D/i.ss01rector term /l.ss08/i.ss01m/i.ss01ts\n- /bullet.ss01 Share ownersh/i.ss01p gu/i.ss01de/l.ss08/i.ss01nes for d/i.ss01rectors and execut/i.ss01ves\n- /bullet.ss01 Extens/i.ss01ve and transparent d/i.ss01sc/l.ss08osure/period.ss01\n\n<!-- image -->",

Forward-looking statements include any statements that do not refer to historical facts. They include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our objectives and our strategies to achieve those objectives, our plans and expectations regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it, our expectations regarding trends in the telecommunications industry including demand for mobile data and ongoing internet subscriber base growth, and our financing plans including our multi-year dividend growth program. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words assumption, goal, guidance, objective, outlook, strategy, target and other similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as aim , anticipate , believe , could , expect , intend , may , plan , predict , seek , should , strive and will . These statements are made pursuant to the 'safe harbour' provisions of applicable securities laws in Canada and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\n\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action. These assumptions may ultimately prove to have been inaccurate and, as a result, our actual results or events may differ materially from expectations expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our general outlook and assumptions for 2022 are presented in Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings in this Management's discussion and analysis (MD&A).\n\nRisks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein and in other TELUS filings include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Regulatory decisions and developments including: changes to our regulatory regime (the timing of announcement or implementation of which are uncertain) or the outcomes of proceedings, cases or inquiries relating to its application, including but not limited to those set out in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings in this MD&A, such as the potential for government to allow consolidation of competitors in our industry or conversely for government intervention intended to further increase competition, for example, through mandated wholesale access; the potential for additional government intervention on pricing, including the March 2020 announcement by the federal government targeting a 25% price reduction over a two-year period by the national mobile carriers in postpaid mobile bring-your-own-device plans using between 2 to 6 GB of data; federal and provincial consumer protection legislation and the possible re-introduction by the federal government of privacy legislation to give consumers new privacy rights and to impose new monetary penalties for noncompliance; amendments to existing federal legislation; potential threats to unitary federal regulatory authority over communications in Canada; potential threats to the CRTC's ability to enforce the Wholesale Code , which aims to ensure the fair treatment by vertically integrated firms of rival broadcasting distributors and programming services; regulatory action by the Competition Bureau or other regulatory agencies; spectrum and compliance with licences, including our compliance with licence conditions, changes to spectrum licence fees, spectrum policy determinations such as restrictions on the purchase, sale, subordination, use and transfer of spectrum licences, the cost and availability of spectrum and timing of spectrum allocation, and ongoing and future consultations and decisions on spectrum licensing and policy frameworks, auctions and allocation; the impact on us and other Canadian telecommunications carriers of government or regulatory actions with respect to certain countries or suppliers, including U.S. federal regulations pertaining to certain technology transactions deemed to constitute national security risks and the imposition of additional licence requirements on the export, re-export and transfer of goods, services and technology to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and its non-U.S. affiliates, and decisions of other foreign governments, which could result in a general shortage of chipsets and other equipment; restrictions on non-Canadian ownership and control of the common shares of TELUS Corporation (Common Shares) and the ongoing monitoring of and compliance with such restrictions; unanticipated changes to the current copyright regime; and our ability to comply with complex and changing regulation of the healthcare and medical devices industry in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including as an operator of health clinics. The jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the contracts that we enter into (particularly contracts entered into by TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (TELUS International or TI)), require us to comply with or facilitate our clients' compliance with numerous, complex and sometimes conflicting legal regimes, both domestically and internationally. See TELUS International's financial performance which impacts our financial performance below.\n- /bullet.ss01 The COVID-19 pandemic including its impacts on our customers, suppliers and vendors, our team members and our communities, as well as changes resulting from the pandemic to our business and operations, including changes to the demand for and supply of the products and services that we offer and the channels through which we offer them.\n- /bullet.ss01 Competitive environment including: our ability to continue to retain customers through an enhanced customer service experience that is differentiated from our competitors, including through the deployment and operation of evolving network infrastructure; intense competition, including the ability of industry competitors to successfully combine a mix of new service offerings and, in some cases, under one bundled and/or discounted monthly rate, along with their existing services;\n\nthe success of new products, services and supporting systems, such as home automation, security and Internet of Things (IoT) services for internet-connected devices; continued intense competition across all services among telecommunications companies, cable companies, other communications companies and over-the-top (OTT) services, which, among other things, places pressures on current and future average billing per subscriber per month (ABPU), average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU), cost of acquisition, cost of retention and churn rates for all services, as do market conditions, government actions, customer usage patterns, increased data bucket sizes or flat-rate pricing trends for voice and data, inclusive rate plans for voice and data and availability of Wi-Fi networks for data; consolidation, mergers and acquisitions of industry competitors; subscriber additions, losses and retention volumes; our ability to obtain and offer content on a timely basis across multiple devices on mobile and TV platforms at a reasonable cost as content costs per unit continue to grow; vertical integration in the broadcasting industry resulting in competitors owning broadcast content services, and timely and effective enforcement of related regulatory safeguards; TI's ability to compete with professional services companies that offer consulting services, information technology companies with digital capabilities, and traditional contact centre and business process outsourcing companies that are expanding their capabilities to offer higher-margin and higher-growth digital services; in our TELUS Health business, our ability to compete with other providers of electronic medical records and pharmacy management products, claims adjudicators, systems integrators and health service providers including those that own a vertically integrated mix of health services delivery, IT solutions and related services, global providers that could achieve expanded Canadian footprints, and in the provision of virtual healthcare services, preventative health services and personal emergency response services; and in our TELUS Agriculture business, our ability to compete with focused software and IoT competitors.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Challenges to our ability to deploy technology including: high subscriber demand for data that challenges wireless networks and spectrum capacity levels and may be accompanied by increases in delivery cost; our reliance on information technology and our ability to streamline our legacy systems; the roll-out, anticipated benefits and efficiencies, and the evolution of wireless broadband technologies and systems, including video distribution platforms and telecommunications network technologies (broadband initiatives, such as fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP), wireless small-cell deployment, 5G wireless and availability of resources and our ability to build out adequate broadband capacity); our reliance on wireless network access agreements, which have facilitated our deployment of mobile technologies; our choice of suppliers and those suppliers' ability to maintain and service their product lines, which could affect the success of upgrades to, and evolution of, technology that we offer; supplier limitations and concentration and market power for products such as network equipment, TELUS TV\u00ae and mobile handsets; our expected longterm need to acquire additional spectrum capacity through future spectrum auctions and from third parties to address increasing demand for data, and our ability to utilize spectrum we acquire; deployment and operation of new fixed broadband network technologies at a reasonable cost and the availability and success of new products and services to be rolled out using such network technologies; network reliability and change management; and our deployment of self-learning tools and automation, which may change the way we interact with customers.\n- /bullet.ss01 Technological substitution including: reduced utilization and increased commoditization of traditional fixed voice services (local and long distance) resulting from impacts of OTT applications and mobile substitution; a declining overall market for TV services, including as a result of content piracy and signal theft, a rise in OTT direct-to-consumer video offerings and virtual multichannel video programming distribution platforms; the increasing number of households that have only mobile and/or internet-based telephone services; potential declines in ABPU and ARPU as a result of, among other factors, substitution by messaging and OTT applications; substitution by increasingly available Wi-Fi services; and disruptive technologies, such as OTT IP services, including software-defined networks in the business market, that may displace or cause us to reprice our existing data services, and self-installed technology solutions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Capital expenditure levels and potential outlays for spectrum licences in auctions or purchases from third parties affect and are affected by: our broadband initiatives, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to fibre; our ongoing deployment of newer mobile technologies, including wireless small cells to improve coverage and capacity; investments in network resiliency and reliability, including to address changes in usage resulting from restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the allocation of resources to acquisitions and future spectrum auctions held by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), including the announcement of a second consultation on the auctioning of the 3800 MHz spectrum, which the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry stated is expected to take place in 2023, and the millimetre wave spectrum auction, which is expected to commence in 2024. Our capital expenditure levels could be impacted if we do not achieve our targeted operational and financial results or by changes to our regulatory environment.\n- /bullet.ss01 Operational performance and business combination risks including: our reliance on legacy systems and our ability to implement and support new products and services and business operations in a timely manner; our ability to manage the requirements of large enterprise deals; our ability to implement effective change management for system replacements and upgrades, process redesigns and",

Examples of these initiatives are: our operating efficiency and effectiveness program to drive improvements in financial results; business integrations; business product simplification; business process automation and outsourcing; offshoring and reorganizations; procurement initiatives; and real estate rationalization.\n- /bullet.ss01 Business continuity events including: our ability to maintain customer service and operate our network in the event of human error or human-caused threats, such as cyberattacks and equipment failures that could cause various degrees of network outages; technical disruptions and infrastructure breakdowns; supply chain disruptions, delays and rising costs, including as a result of government restrictions or trade actions; natural disaster threats; extreme weather events; epidemics; pandemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); political instability in certain international locations; information security and privacy breaches, including loss or theft of data; and the completeness and effectiveness of business continuity and disaster recovery plans and responses.\n- /bullet.ss01 Foreign operations and our ability to successfully manage operations in foreign jurisdictions, including managing risks such as currency fluctuations and exposure to various economic, international trade, political and other risks of doing business globally. See also TELUS International's financial performance which impacts our financial performance .\n- /bullet.ss01 TELUS International's financial performance which impacts our financial performance. Factors that may affect TI's financial performance are described in TI's public filings available on SEDAR and EDGAR and may include: intense competition from companies offering similar services; attracting and retaining qualified team members to support its operations; TI's ability to grow and maintain profitability if changes in technology or if client expectations outpace service offerings and internal tools and processes; TI maintaining its culture as it grows; effects of economic and geopolitical conditions on its clients' businesses and demand for its services; a significant portion of TI's revenue being dependent on a limited number of large clients; continued consolidation in many of the verticals in which TI offers services could result in the loss of a client; adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on TI's business and financial results; TI's business being adversely affected if certain independent contractors were classified as employees, and the costs associated with defending, settling or resolving any future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the independent contractor classification; TI's ability to successfully identify, complete, integrate and realize the benefits of acquisitions and manage associated risks; cyberattacks or unauthorized disclosure resulting in access to sensitive or confidential information and data of its clients or their end customers, which could have a negative impact on its reputation and client confidence; TI's business not developing in ways it currently anticipates due to negative public reaction to offshore outsourcing, proposed legislation or otherwise; ability to meet client expectations regarding its content moderation services being adversely impacted due to factors beyond its control and its content moderation team members suffering adverse emotional or cognitive effects in the course of performing their work; and TI's short history operating as a separate, publicly traded company. TELUS International's primary functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the contribution to our consolidated results of positive results in our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segment may be offset by any strengthening of the Canadian dollar (our reporting currency) compared to the U.S. dollar. The price of the subordinate voting shares of TI (TI Subordinate Voting Shares) may be volatile and is likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond its control, including actual or anticipated changes in profitability; general economic, social or political developments; changes in industry conditions; changes in governance regulation; inflation; low trading volume; the general state of the securities markets; and other material events. TI may choose to publicize targets or provide other guidance regarding its business and it may not achieve such targets. Failure to do so could also result in a reduction in the trading price of the TI Subordinate Voting Shares. A reduction in the trading price of the TI Subordinate Voting Shares due to these or other factors could result in a reduction in the fair value of TI multiple voting shares held by TELUS.\n- /bullet.ss01 Human resource matters including: recruitment, retention and appropriate training in a highly competitive industry (including retention of team members leading recent acquisitions in emerging areas of our business), the level of our employee engagement and impact on engagement or other aspects of our business or any unresolved collective agreements, our ability to maintain our unique culture as we grow, the risk that certain independent contractors in our business could be classified as employees, unanticipated reaction to our COVID-19 vaccine policy or the reopening of our administrative offices and the health of our team.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Financing and debt requirements including: our ability to carry out financing activities, refinance our maturing debt, lower our net debt to EBITDA ratio to our objective range given the cash demands of spectrum auctions, and/or our ability to maintain investment grade credit ratings in the range of BBB+ or the equivalent. Our business plans and growth could be negatively affected if existing financing is not sufficient to cover our funding requirements.\n- /bullet.ss01 Taxation matters including: interpretation of complex domestic and foreign tax laws by the relevant tax authorities that may differ from our interpretations; the timing and character of income and deductions, such as tax depreciation and operating expenses; tax credits or other attributes; changes in tax laws, including tax rates; tax expenses being materially different than anticipated, including the taxability of income and deductibility of tax attributes or retroactive application of new legislation; elimination of income tax deferrals through the use of different tax year-ends for operating partnerships and corporate partners; and changes to the interpretation of tax laws, including those resulting from changes to applicable accounting standards or the adoption of more aggressive auditing practices by tax authorities, tax reassessments or adverse court decisions impacting the tax payable by us.\n- /bullet.ss01 Lower than planned free cash flow could constrain our ability to invest in operations, reduce leverage or return capital to shareholders, and could affect our ability to sustain our dividend growth program through 2022 and any further dividend growth programs. This program may be affected by factors such as the competitive environment, fluctuations in the Canadian economy or the global economy, our earnings and free cash flow, our levels of capital expenditures and spectrum licence purchases, acquisitions, the management of our capital structure, regulatory decisions and developments, and business continuity events. Quarterly dividend decisions are subject to assessment and determination by our Board of Directors based on our financial position and outlook. Common Shares may be purchased under our normal course issuer bid (NCIB) when and if we consider it opportunistic, based on our financial position and outlook, and the market price of our Common Shares. There can be no assurance that our dividend growth program or our NCIB will be maintained, unchanged and/or completed.\n- /bullet.ss01 Litigation and legal matters including: our ability to successfully respond to investigations and regulatory proceedings; our ability to defend against existing and potential claims and lawsuits (including intellectual property infringement claims and class actions based on consumer claims, data, privacy or security breaches and secondary market liability), or to negotiate and exercise indemnity rights or other protections in respect of such claims and lawsuits; and the complexity of legal compliance in domestic and foreign jurisdictions, including compliance with competition, anti-bribery and foreign corrupt practices laws.\n- /bullet.ss01 Economic growth and fluctuations including: the state of the economy in Canada, which may be influenced by economic and other developments outside of Canada, including potential outcomes of yet unknown policies and actions of foreign governments and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as public and private sector responses to the pandemic; expectations regarding future interest rates; inflation; unemployment levels; effects of fluctuating oil prices; effects of low business spending (such as reducing investments and cost structure); pension investment returns and factors affecting pension benefit obligations, funding and solvency discount rates; fluctuations in exchange rates of the currencies in the regions in which we operate; sovereign credit ratings and effects on the cost of borrowing; the impact of tariffs on trade between Canada and the United States; and global implications of the dynamics of trade relationships among major world economies.\n- /bullet.ss01 Health, safety and the environment including: lost employee work time resulting from illness or injury; public concerns related to radio frequency emissions; environmental issues affecting our business, including climate-related risk (such as extreme weather events and other natural hazards), waste and waste recycling, risks relating to fuel systems on our properties, changing government and public expectations regarding environmental matters and our responses; and challenges associated with epidemics or pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic and our response to it, which may add to or accentuate these factors.\n- /bullet.ss01 Energy use including: our ability to identify and implement solutions to reduce energy consumption and adopt cleaner sources of energy; our ability to identify and make suitable investments in renewable energy, including in the form of power purchase agreements; our ability to continue to realize significant absolute reductions in energy use and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations (including as a result of programs and initiatives focused on our buildings and network); and other risks associated with achieving our goals to achieve carbon neutrality and reduce our GHG emissions by 2030.\n\nThese risks are described in additional detail in Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings and Section 10 Risks and risk management in this MD&A.

The generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that we use are International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Canadian GAAP. In this MD&A, the term IFRS refers to these standards. In our discussion, we also use certain non-GAAP and other specified financial measures to evaluate our performance, monitor compliance with debt covenants and manage our capital structure. These measures are defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measures, as required by National Instrument 52-112, Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure , in Section 11.1 . All currency amounts are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise specified.\n\nAdditional information relating to the Company, including our Annual Information Form and other filings with securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in Canada, is available on SEDAR ( sedar.com ). Our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, including Form 40-F, are available on EDGAR ( sec.gov ). Additional information about our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (TELUS International or TI) subsidiary, including discussion of its business and results, can be found in its public filings available on SEDAR and EDGAR.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure. This MD&A and the Consolidated financial statements were reviewed by our Audit Committee and authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) for issuance on February 10, 2022.\n\nIn this MD&A, unless otherwise indicated, results for the year ended December 31, 2021 are compared with results for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nEffective January 1, 2021, our segmented reporting structure was retrospectively re-cast. This change arose from continually increasing technological convergence pushing the difference between mobile and fixed access further from the core network and closer to the customer point of access, the increasing significance of digitally-led customer experience services and the evolution of information regularly reported to our chief operating decision-maker for purposes of allocating capital resources and assessing performance. See Section 5.1 General for additional details.\n\n## 1/period.ss012 The env/i.ss01ronment /i.ss01n wh/i.ss01ch we operate\n\nThe success of our business and the challenges we face can best be understood with reference to the environment in which we operate, including broader economic factors that affect our customers and us, and the competitive nature of our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in the first quarter of 2020, continued to have a pervasive global impact throughout 2021. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have focused relentlessly on keeping Canadians connected and on the health, safety and well-being of our team members, customers and communities. Our Executive Team continues to be guided by advice from our Emergency Management Operating Committee (EMOC) and the TELUS Medical Advisory Council (MAC).\n\nWe expect the pandemic to continue to affect our operations until at least 2023. Whether this occurs will depend on both domestic and international factors, including rates of vaccination and the potential proliferation of COVID-19 variants of concern.\n\nWe are committed to prioritizing the health and safety of team members and customers and the significant majority of team members have continued to work remotely during the pandemic. During the third quarter of 2021, we announced our COVID-19 vaccination policy for all Canadian team members. We currently plan to reopen our Canadian administrative offices in April 2022 at the earliest, based on an assessment of the public health and safety guidance at that time. When our team members return to the office, they will have an opportunity to participate in the next evolution of our Work Styles program. Originally launched in 2006, Work Styles provides team members with flexible work options to accommodate their work preferences and the ability to connect and collaborate seamlessly no matter where they are.",

        "page_content": "With respect to TELUS International's operations, the intent is for team members to return to traditional work environments in offices when it has been deemed safe to do so by local governments and healthcare officials. However, this varies significantly by geography and each region's vaccination progress.\n\n## Canadian telecommunications industry\n\nAfter almost two years of operating within the COVID-19 environment, the pandemic continues to highlight the essential nature of connectivity in enabling Canadians to participate in the digital economy. The telecommunications industry remains a key lifeline for Canada's economic and social survival during the pandemic, and facilities-based operators continue to invest in building additional capacity and upgrading infrastructure. We estimate that Canadian telecommunications industry revenues (including TV revenue and excluding equipment and media revenue) grew by approximately 3% in 2021, with mobile network revenue growth of approximately 2.7%. Mobile revenues continued to account for the largest portion of telecommunications sector revenues and Canadians are using ever-increasing amounts of data through both fixed internet and mobile services. We estimate that the Canadian mobile phone industry added approximately 0.9 million net new subscribers in 2021 as compared to approximately 1.1 million in 2020. With respect to fixed products and services, we estimate the Canadian consumer high-speed internet penetration rate grew by approximately 2 percentage points to 90% in 2021, and subscriber growth is expected to continue. More Canadians are subscribing to internet services, and during the pandemic, Canadians relied on their internet service for remote work, education\n\nand entertainment, and for access to news and information, while the shift from the traditional television landscape to internet-based television continued. Competitive pressures continued in both the fixed products and services consumer and business markets, while declines in higher-margin legacy voice services were ongoing, mainly attributable to technological substitution. (See Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings , Section 10.4 Competitive environment and Section 10.16 The economy .)\n\n## Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX)\n\nTechnology is transforming the way businesses interact with their customers at an accelerating pace and scale and, across industries, customer experience has become a critically important competitive differentiator. DLCX clients and their customers have more information and more choices than ever before and their expectations surrounding brand experiences and the speed at which companies must process and respond to customer interactions are changing rapidly. The proliferation of mobile devices, social media platforms and other methods of digital interaction has enabled customers to access information 24/7 and engage with companies through multiple digital channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the use of digital channels as the first, and sometimes only, points of customer interaction. Customers value a consistent and personalized experience across channels when interacting with the companies that serve them. Businesses face pressure to engage with their customers across digital and human channels, and seek to do so by combining technology with authentic human experience that is capable of demonstrating a sincere commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\n## Economic estimates\n\nOur estimates regarding our environment, including economic growth, unemployment and housing starts, form an important part of the assumptions on which our targets are based. The extent of the impact these estimates will have on us and the timing of that impact will depend upon the actual experience of specific sectors of the Canadian economy.\n\n|         | Economic

        "page_content": "## 1/period.ss013 H/i.ss01gh/l.ss08/i.ss01ghts of 2021\n\n## TELUS International IPO\n\nOn February 5, 2021, TELUS Corporation and TELUS International, our DLCX subsidiary, announced the closing of the upsized TI initial public offering (IPO) of 42.55 million TI subordinate voting shares at a price of US$25.00 per share, which included 5.55 million TI subordinate voting shares purchased upon the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option to purchase additional TI subordinate voting shares from TELUS Corporation and Baring Private Equity Asia (Baring), the selling shareholders. The offering generated aggregate gross proceeds to TI, TELUS Corporation and Baring of approximately $1.4 billion (US$1.1 billion), including the exercise of the over-allotment option in full. The net proceeds to TI totalled approximately $0.6 billion (US$0.5 billion), which was used to repay outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. TI did not receive any proceeds from the TI subordinate voting shares sold by the selling shareholders. The TI subordinate voting shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on February 3, 2021 under the ticker 'TIXT'. The offering represented the largest tech IPO in TSX history and the fifth largest by proceeds raised at the time. TI's initial market capitalization of $8.5 billion at the time of its IPO surpassed TELUS' market capitalization in 2000. With its differentiated portfolio of integrated digital IT and customer experience (CX) solutions spanning the design, build and deliver lifecycle, TI has a strategic position in the digital transformation ecosystem and is poised to benefit from the acceleration of digital adoption across various sectors of the global economy.\n\n## Strategic alliance with Google\n\nOn February 9, 2021, we announced a strategic alliance with Google Cloud to co-innovate on new services and solutions that support digital transformation within key industries, including communications technology, healthcare, agriculture, security and connected home. The 10-year collaboration is intended to accelerate our IT and network modernization initiatives, enabling further operational agility and supporting improved customer experiences.\n\n## Equity offering\n\nOn March 25, 2021, we announced an equity offering pursuant to which a syndicate of underwriters agreed to purchase from TELUS, on a boughtdeal basis, and sell to the public, 51 million common shares of TELUS Corporation (Common Shares) at a price of $25.35 per Common Share for gross proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. On March 31, 2021, we announced the closing of the offering. Proceeds are being used to capitalize on a unique strategic opportunity to accelerate our broadband capital investment program through 2021 and 2022, including substantial advancement of the build-out of our TELUS PureFibre infrastructure in Alberta, B.C. and Eastern Quebec, as well as an accelerated roll-out of our 5G network. These planned accelerated capital investments are over and above our previous capital expenditures target originally announced on February 11, 2021.\n\n## Long-term debt issue, inaugural sustainability-linked bond and early redemption of 2022 Notes\n\nOn April 5, 2021, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured 4.10% Notes, Series CAE, which will mature on April 5, 2051. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the repayment upon maturity of the Series 3, 10.65% debentures of TELUS Communications Inc. due June 2021, the repayment of commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.\n\nOn June 28, 2021, we announced the successful closing of our inaugural sustainability-linked bond, the first of its kind in Canada. The $750 million of senior unsecured 2.85% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAF, will mature on November 13, 2031, and were issued pursuant to our sustainability-linked bond framework announced on June 14, 2021 (see Section 3 for additional details). As part of this framework, we have committed to reducing our absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 46% from 2019 levels by 2030 (our sustainability performance target). If we fail to achieve this target by December 31, 2030, the interest payable on these notes will increase by 1.00% in the final year of maturity. We will report annually on our performance against the sustainability performance target and will also obtain an annual independent and external verification of our performance against the target.\n\nOn August 17, 2021, we early redeemed all of our $1 billion 2.35% Notes, Series CT, due March 28, 2022. The long-term debt prepayment premium recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2021 was $10 million before income taxes ($0.01 per share after income taxes). Subsequent to this early redemption, there are no TELUS Corporation notes maturing in 2022.\n\n## Our Board of Directors\n\nAt our 2021 annual general meeting held on May 7, 2021, the nominees listed in the TELUS 2021 information circular were elected as directors of TELUS, including two new nominees, Hazel Claxton and Sean Willy.\n\nHazel is a corporate director. She served as Executive Vice-President and Chief Human Resources Officer with LifeWorks Inc. (formerly Morneau Shepell Inc.) from 2013 to 2018. Prior to that, Hazel spent 29 years at PwC Canada where she held several leadership roles including Canadian Leadership Group member, Human Capital leader, and Partner within the Corporate Advisory and Restructuring Group, an area she practiced in for 20 years. Hazel holds a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) from Queen's University and the ICD.D designation from the Institute of Corporate Directors. She is a Chartered Professional Accountant.\n\nSean is President and Chief Executive Officer of Des Nedhe Development, the economic development entity for English River First Nation, which includes a broad portfolio of businesses and investments that range from construction and mining to retail and communications, a role he has held since August 2017, and prior thereto he was a Vice-President of Des Nedhe Development since June 2016. Sean holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the Edwards School of Business of the University of Saskatchewan.\n\nOur Board diversity policy includes separate diversity targets of having (i) at least two directors who represent a visible minority or are Indigenous and (ii) women and men each represent at least one-third of the independent directors. With the appointment of directors at our May 2021 annual meeting, we surpassed both targets.\n\n## 3500 MHz spectrum auction developments\n\nInnovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) held its 3500 MHz band spectrum auction from June 15, 2021, through July 23, 2021. We acquired 142 licences equating to 16.4 MHz of spec trum for a total purchase price of $1.95 billion. Combined with the spectrum we acquired privately ahead of the auction, we now hold 25 MHz of spectrum in the 3500 MHz spectrum band nationally and 40 MHz within key markets, at an average price of $2.53 per MHz-pop (where pop refers to the population in a licence area). In accordance with the terms",

        "page_content": "of the auction, 20% ($389 million) was remitted to ISED on its due date, August 13, 2021. On September 22, 2021, ISED sought further consult ation on the Standard Radio Systems Plan (SRSP)-520 affecting the deployment of 3500 MHz spectrum and advised that it would issue the 3500 MHz spectrum licences after determining whether amendments were needed to SRSP-520. ISED also notified prospective 3500 MHz licensees that the final auction payments and issuance of licences, originally scheduled for October 4, 2021, were delayed until December 17, 2021, at which time we made the final payment.\n\n## Blacksmith Applications acquisition\n\nOn September 22, 2021, we acquired 100% ownership of Blacksmith Applications Holdings Inc., a provider of management, optimization and analytics to food, beverage and consumer goods providers. The acquisition is complementary to, and was made with a view to growing, our existing smart data solutions business.\n\n## Sale of financial solutions business\n\nOn December 6, 2021, we announced the disposition of our financial solutions business for $500 million. Net proceeds from the transaction will be used to support strategic growth investments, including connecting more homes and businesses to our TELUS PureFibre network and advancing our 5G network build and investments to support enhancing new areas of growth, including our offerings to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as in TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture. Proceeds will also support debt retirement.\n\n## Business acquisition - subsequent to 2021\n\nOn January 1, 2022, we acquired 100% ownership of Fully Managed Inc. for cash and contingent consideration of approximately $137 million. Fully Managed Inc. provides managed information technology support, technology strategy and network management. This investment was made with a view to growing our end-to-end capabilities to support small and medium-sized business customers.\n\n## Consolidated highlights\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ millions, except footnotes and unless noted otherwise)       | 2021    | 2020    | Change     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Consolidated statements of income                                                       |         |         |            |\n| Operating revenues and other income                                                     | 17,258  | 15,463  | 11.6 %     |\n| Operating income                                                                        | 3,074   | 2,482   | 23.9 %     |\n| Income before income taxes                                                              | 2,278   | 1,711   | 33.1 %     |\n| Net income                                                                              | 1,698   | 1,260   | 34.8 %     |\n| Net income attributable to Common Shares                                                | 1,655   | 1,207   | 37.1 %     |\n| Adjusted Net income/one.numr                                                            | 1,430   | 1,361   | 5.1 %      |\n| Earnings per share (EPS) ($)                                                            |         |         |            |\n| Basic EPS                                                                               | 1.23    | 0.95    | 29.5 %     |\n| Adjusted basic EPS/one.numr                                                             | 1.07    | 1.06    | 0.9 %      |\n| Diluted EPS                                                                             | 1.22    | 0.94    | 29.8 %     |\n| Dividends declared per Common Share ($)                                                 | 1.2710  | 1.18495 | 7.3 %      |\n| Basic weighted-average Common Shares outstanding (millions)                             | 1,346   | 1,275   | 5.6 %      |\n| Consolidated statements of cash flows                                                   |         |         |            |\n| Cash provided by operating activities                                                   | 4,388   | 4,574   | (4.1) %    |\n| Cash used by investing activities                                                       | (5,466) | (6,165) | (1 1 .3) % |\n| Acquisitions                                                                            | (468)   | (3,205) | (85.4) %   |\n| Capital expenditures/two.numr                                                           | (3,498) | (2,775) | 26.1 %     |\n| Cash provided by financing activities                                                   | 953     | 1,904   | (49.9) %   |\n| Other highlights                                                                        |         |         |            |\n| Subscriber connections/three.numr (thousands)                                           | 16,887  | 15,943  | 5.9 %      |\n| Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization/one.numr (EBITDA) | 6,290   | 5,494   | 14.5 %     |\n| EBITDA margin/one.numr (%)                                                              | 36.4    | 35.5    | 0.9 pts.   |\n| Restructuring and other costs                                                           | 186     | 259     | (28.2) %   |\n| Adjusted EBITDA/one.numr                                                                | 6,069   | 5,701   | 6.4 %      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin/one.numr (%)                                                     | 36.0    | 37.0    | (1.0) pt.  |\n| Free cash flow/one.numr                                                                 | 777     | 1,435   | (45.9) %   |\n| Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs/one.numr (times)           | 3.17    | 3.45    | (0.28)     |\n\nNotations used in MD&A: n/m - not meaningful; pts. - percentage points.\n\n- 1 These are non-GAAP and other specified financial measures.

TTech service revenue growth of $685 million was driven by growth in internet and data service revenues, as well as smart food-chain technology and other fixed data services revenues; higher mobile network revenue; and growth in health services revenue. Increased DLCX revenues were due to business acquisitions, and organic growth from both new clients and expanded services for existing customers.\n\nEquipment revenues increased by $239 million in 2021, reflecting higher-value smartphones in the sales mix, higher handset upgrade volumes and greater collectability of mobile device balances.\n\nOther income increased by $298 million in 2021, largely due to a $410 million gain arising from the disposition of our financial solutions business in the fourth quarter of 2021, as described earlier in this section within Highlights of 2021 .\n\nFor additional details on Operating revenues and other income, see Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment and Section 5.5 Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment .\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Operating income increased by $592 million in 2021. In addition to the gain on sale of our financial solutions business, this increase was driven by growth in network revenue; growth in mobile equipment margins; growth in internet and data service margins, as well as other fixed data service margins; an increased contribution from DLCX; and lower bad debt expense. This was partly offset by higher employee benefits expense and lower legacy fixed voice and legacy fixed data services. This growth also reflects lower non-labour restructuring and other costs related to the pandemic, partly offset by the dilutive lingering impacts of the pandemic, including reduced roaming margins related to travel restrictions. (See Section 5.3 Consolidated operations for additional details.)\n\nEBITDA, which includes restructuring and other costs, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business and a gain on a retirement of a provision arising from business acquisition-related written put options within DLCX, increased by $796 million in 2021.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes restructuring and other costs, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business and a gain on a retirement of a provision arising from business acquisition-related written put options within DLCX, increased by $368 million in 2021, reflecting the factors mentioned in the Operating income discussion above. (See Section 5.3 Consolidated operations for additional details.)\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Income before income taxes increased by $567 million in 2021 as a result of higher Operating income, partly offset by increased Financing costs. The increase in Financing costs in 2021 largely resulted from the cessation of capitalized long-term debt interest costs in the first quarter of 2021 for 600 MHz spectrum licences that are now being deployed. (See Financing costs in Section 5.3 .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Income tax expense increased by $129 million in 2021. The effective income tax rate decreased from 26.3 to 25.5% in 2021, largely due to the non-taxable portion of the gain on the disposition of our financial solutions business partially offset by lower adjustments to prior period income taxes.\n- /bullet.ss01 Net income attributable to Common Shares increased by $448 million in 2021, resulting from the after-tax impacts of higher Operating income offset by higher Financing costs.\n\nAdjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, long-term debt prepayment premium, the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business, and a gain on a retirement of a provision arising from business acquisition-related written put options within DLCX. Adjusted Net income increased by $69 million or 5.1% in 2021.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Basic EPS increased by $0.28 or 29.5% in 2021 as a result of the after-tax impacts of higher Operating income and higher Financing costs, which were partially offset by the effect of a higher number of Common Shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted basic EPS excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, long-term debt prepayment premium, the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business, and a gain on a retirement of a provision arising from business acquisition-related written put options within DLCX. Adjusted basic EPS increased by $0.01 or 0.9% in 2021.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Dividends declared per Common Share were $1.2710 in 2021, an increase of 7.3% from 2020. Consistent with our target of increasing dividends between 7 to 10% in the near term, the Board declared a first quarter dividend of $0.3274 per share on our issued and outstanding Common Shares, payable on April 1, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2022. The first quarter dividend increased by $0.0162 per share or 5.2% from the $0.3112 per share dividend declared one year earlier, consistent with our multi-year dividend growth program described in Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources\n- /bullet.ss01 During 2021, our total subscriber connections increased by 944,000. This reflected an increase of 4.1% in mobile phone subscribers, 18.8% in connected device subscribers, 6.2% in internet subscribers, 4.1% in TV subscribers and 13.7% in security subscribers, partly offset by a decline of 3.5% in residential voice subscribers. (See Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment for additional details.)\n\n## Liquidity and capital resource highlights\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $186 million in 2021, largely attributable to other working capital changes, as well as higher income taxes paid related to the disposition of our financial solutions business. (See Section 7.2 Cash provided by operating activities .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash used by investing activities decreased by $699 million in 2021, largely attributable to a reduced number of business acquisitions and the proceeds received upon the disposition of our financial solutions business. This was partially offset by the cash payments for the 3500 MHz spectrum acquired for $1.95 billion in the most recent spectrum auction and higher cash payments for capital assets. Acquisitions decreased by $2.7 billion in 2021, as we made larger cash payments for business acquisitions in 2020, primarily Competence Call Center (CCC) (since rebranded as TELUS International Northern Europe or TINE and comprised substantially of CCC), Mobile Klinik\u00ae, AFS Technologies Inc., EQ Care and Lionbridge AI. Capital expenditures increased by $723 million in 2021, due to accelerated investments in our 5G network, our broadband build, enhanced product development and digitization to increase system capacity and reliability, in addition to strong security subscriber growth and the advanced purchase of customer equipment to mitigate supply chain risks and support subscriber growth.

The proceeds from equity issuance in the first quarter of 2021 were lower than the proceeds from equity issuance in the first quarter of 2020, as we issued approximately 6 million fewer Common Shares. As well, cash payments for dividends were also higher in 2021. (See Section 7.4 Cash provided by financing activities .)\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio was 3.17 times at December 31, 2021, an improvement from 3.45 times at December 31, 2020, as the effect of the increase in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs exceeded the effect of the increase in net debt, notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic impacts that have reduced EBITDA. As at December 31, 2021, the acquisition of spectrum licences increased the ratio by approximately 0.49 and business acquisitions over the past 12 months increased the ratio by approximately 0.05, while business dispositions over the same period decreased the ratio by approximately 0.26. (See Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources and Section 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Free cash flow decreased by $658 million in 2021, driven by: higher capital expenditures as previously noted; higher lease principal payments; higher income taxes paid; and the net impact of increased customer additions and the timing related to device subsidy repayments and associated revenue recognition and our TELUS Easy Payment device financing program; partly offset by higher EBITDA. The increase in capital expenditures was announced on March 25, 2021 to advance our fibre build and 5G coverage which utilized pro ceeds from our first quarter 2021 equity offering. Our definition of free cash flow, for which there is no industry alignment, is unaffected by accounting changes that do not impact cash, such as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.\n\n## 1/period.ss014 Performance targets (key performance measures)\n\nIn 2021, we achieved all four of our consolidated financial targets. Our original targets were announced on February 11, 2021. On May 7, 2021, we updated the financial targets for free cash flow and capital expenditures\n\nbased on our March 25, 2021 announcement that we intended to strategically bring forward transformational capital investments in broadband connectivity, including fibre and 5G, to enhance our industry-best customer experience, leading networks and competitive position.\n\nWe exceeded our consolidated revenue target and met the target when excluding the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business. Growth in our mobile phone and connected devices subscriber bases contributed to the revenue achievement, as well as higher-value smartphones in the sales mix and higher handset upgrade volumes. We also experienced increased fixed data service revenues resulting from increased internet and data services and smart food chain technology, as well as increased health services revenues, partly offset by the ongoing decline in legacy fixed voice revenue. Additionally, DLCX operating revenues increased, reflecting both business acquisitions and organic growth.\n\nWe achieved our Adjusted EBITDA target largely from growth in internet and data services margins. Fixed data services margins also improved, driven by a growing customer base and expanded services. Mobile network revenue and improved mobile equipment margins supported the achievement of the target, as well as increased contribution from DLCX. These factors were partly offset by declines in legacy fixed voice and legacy fixed data services and higher Employee benefits expense.\n\nOur free cash flow target was met, attributable to EBITDA growth and strong cash flow management, including our disciplined focus on profitable loading and effective inventory management to drive strong customer net additions growth.\n\nOur capital expenditures in 2021 met our consolidated target, as we advanced our investments in our broadband build, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to our fibre-optic infrastructure, enabling us to significantly expand our broadband footprint. In addition, investments in our 5G network build allowed us to expand coverage to 70% of the Canadian population at December 31, 2021. Other capital investments enabled us to support continuing subscriber growth, deliver on our digitization strategy, and enhance our systems reliability and operational efficiency.\n\nOur capital structure financial policies and report on financing and capital structure management plans are included in Section 4.3 .\n\nThe following scorecard compares TELUS' performance to our consolidated 2021 targets.\n\n| SCORECARD                                          | 2021 PERFORMANCE                         | 2021 PERFORMANCE               | 2021 PERFORMANCE   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                    | Consolidated targets/one.numr and growth | Actual results and growth      | Result             |\n| Revenues and other income                          | An increase of 8 to 10%                  | $17.26 billion/two.numr  11.6% |                    |\n| Net income/three.numr                              | n/a                                      | $1.70 billion  34.8%           | n/a                |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                    | An increase of 6 to 8%                   | $6.07 billion  6.4%            |                    |\n| Cash provided by operating activities/three.numr   | n/a                                      | $4.39 billion  (4.1)%          | n/a                |\n| Free cash flow                                     | Approximately $750 million/one.numr a    | $777 million                   |                    |\n| Capital expenditures (excluding spectrum licences) | Approximately $3.5 billion/one.numr b    | $3.50 billion                  |                    |\n\n- 1 Reflects the 2021 revised targets that were announced on May 7, 2021 to reflect our capital acceleration program.\n- a.

Our original assumptions for 2021 economic growth in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec were 4.5%, 4.5%, 4.4%, 4.8% and 4.6%, respectively.\n\nIn our first quarter 2021 MD&A, we revised our 2021 economic growth assumptions in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 5.9%, 5.7%, 5.6%, 5.7% and 5.8%, respectively. In our third quarter 2021 MD&A, we further revised our 2021 economic growth assumptions in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 5.4%, 5.6%, 6.0%, 5.1% and 6.1%, respectively.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 With respect to annual unemployment rates, our original assumptions for 2021 in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec were 7.8%, 6.9%, 9.9%, 8.0% and 6.9%, respectively.\n\nIn our first quarter 2021 MD&A, we revised our 2021 annual unemployment rate assumptions in Canada, B.C., and Alberta to 7.7%, 6.7% and 9.6%, respectively. In our third quarter 2021 MD&A, we further revised our 2021 annual unemployment rate assumptions in Canada, B.C., Alberta and Quebec to 7.6%, 6.6%, 8.7% and 6.3%, respectively.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 With respect to the pace of housing starts, our original assumptions for 2021 on an unadjusted basis in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec were 202,000 units, 35,000 units, 24,000 units, 77,000 units and 48,000 units, respectively.\n\nIn our first quarter 2021 MD&A, we revised our 2021 assumptions for the pace of housing starts on an unadjusted basis in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 232,000 units, 39,000 units, 28,000 units, 82,000 units and 60,000 units, respectively. In our third quarter 2021 MD&A, we further revised our 2021 assumptions for the pace of housing starts on an unadjusted basis in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 270,000 units, 47,000 units, 32,000 units, 96,000 units and 72,000 units, respectively.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Our assumption for 2021 Depreciation and Amortization of intangible assets was approximately $3.25 billion to $3.35 billion. Actual Depreciation and Amortization of intangible assets was $3.22 billion.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our assumption for 2021 restructuring and other costs was approximately $150 million. Our actual 2021 restructuring and other costs were $186 million, as we incurred higher than expected costs for continuing operational effectiveness initiatives, with margin enhancement initiatives to mitigate pressures related to intense competition, technological substitution, repricing of our services, increasing subscriber growth and retention costs, and integration costs associated with business acquisitions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our assumption for 2021 net Cash interest paid was approximately $755 million to $805 million. Actual net Cash interest paid was $727 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our assumption was for continued stabilization in the average Canadian dollar: U.S. dollar exchange rate, which was $1.34 in 2020. The average Canadian dollar: U.S. dollar exchange rate was $1.25 in 2021 and closed at $1.27 on December 31, 2021, compared to $1.27 on December 31, 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our assumption for 2021 income taxes was computed at an applicable statutory rate of 25.3 to 25.9%, and cash income tax payments of approximately $540 million to $620 million. In our third quarter 2021 MD&A, our cash income tax payments assumption was revised downward to a range of $480 million to $560 million, primarily due to a refund received upon conclusion of a prior year income tax audit. Our actual results were at a statutory income tax rate of 25.8% and cash income tax payments in respect of net income of $563 million, which includes $61 million for the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business.\n\n## Confirmed:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued intense mobile products and services competition and fixed products and services competition in both consumer and business markets.\n- /bullet.ss01 No material adverse regulatory rulings or government actions. See Section 9.4 for further information.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued increase in mobile phone penetration of the Canadian market.\n- /bullet.ss01 Mobile products and services revenue growth resulting from improvements in subscriber loading, with continued competitive pressure on blended ARPU. Roaming revenue remained at levels similar to the latter half of 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 Ongoing subscriber adoption of, and upgrades to, data-intensive smartphones, as customers seek more mobile connectivity to the internet.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued pressure on mobile products and services acquisition and retention expenses, dependent on gross loading and customer renewal volumes, competitive intensity and customer preferences, as well as continued connected devices growth.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued erosion of residential voice revenues, resulting from technological substitution and greater use of inclusive long distance.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued growth in fixed products and services data revenue, reflecting an increase in internet, TV subscribers and security subscribers, speed upgrades, rate plans with larger data buckets or endless data usage, and expansion of our broadband infrastructure, healthcare solutions and home and business security offerings.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued growth of TI revenue and EBITDA generated by expanded services for existing and new clients and strategic business acquisitions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Employee defined benefit pension plans assumptions for 2021: current service costs of approximately $107 million recorded in Employee benefits expense and interest expense of approximately $25 million recorded in Financing costs; a rate of 2.50% for discounting the obligation and a rate of 2.70% for current service costs for employee defined benefit pension plan accounting purposes; and defined benefit pension plan funding of approximately $51 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued focus on our customers first initiatives and maintaining our customers' likelihood-to-recommend.\n\nActual results were: $107 million recorded in Employee benefits expense for current service costs, $6 million recorded in Employee benefits expense for past service costs and interest expense of $26 million recorded in Financing costs; a rate of 2.95% for discounting the obligation and a rate of 2.70% for current service costs for employee defined benefit pension plan accounting purposes; and defined benefit pension plan funding of $53 million.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued deployment of access-agnostic technology in our network.\n- /bullet.ss01 Participation in ISED's 3500 MHz band spectrum auction in June to July 2021. We acquired 142 licences in B.C., Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, which equate to a national average of 16.4 MHz.\n- /bullet.ss01 Small and medium-sized businesses (SMB) continued to be negatively impacted by lockdown measures.\n- /bullet.ss01 Government funding programs to support consumers' ability to pay bills eased in the latter half of 2021.",

We will ensure every connection is a promise to help create a better future for Canadians.\n- /bullet.ss01 Each year, we conduct a Pulsecheck engagement survey to gather confidential team member feedback about TELUS as a place to work in order to measure our progress in creating a high-performance culture. Following each survey, leaders share results with team members and use fair process to build and refine action plans focused on high-priority areas where improvement is required based on Pulsecheck results. In 2021, we achieved an engagement score of 84%, which is an encouraging accomplishment against the backdrop of the highly competitive and dynamic environment in which we work and reinforces the strength of the culture our team members have built together.

By taking continuous strides to evolve our small-cell technology concurrent with the evolution of network technologies to LTE-A pro (i.e. 4.5G), in 2017, we became the first operator in Canada to introduce licensed assisted access (LAA) small cells for both outdoor and indoor environments, capable of speeds of up to 970 Mbps. In 2019, we continued advancing LAA technology with speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps, and we have deployed more than 400 LAA sites to date.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2019, we progressed the virtualization of our core network infrastructure with the voice core, providing a stepping stone into 5G service readiness. The network virtualization improves our network scalability, resiliency and cost efficiency.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2018, we became the first operator globally to introduce LTE FDD massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) 32TRx technology on the 2600 MHz band as part of the LTE-A pro technology evolution, and in 2020, we introduced dual-band massive MIMO technology in the 1900 MHz and AWS bands, also a global first. This technology further enhances the capacity of our wireless infrastructure, enables a stronger customer experience and helps to sustain our long-term wireless leadership.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2020, we launched our 5G technology capable of speeds of up to 1.7 Gbps, and by December 31, 2021, our 5G network covered 70% of Canada's population. In 2021, we increased the speeds of our 5G network, capable of up to 1.9 Gbps, through the deployment of incremental 5G spectrum. Our 5G coverage is foundational, as it will enable the advancement of new 5G capabilities such as network slicing, multi-access edge computing (MEC) and low-latency critical communications. A key enhancement to our 5G network in 2021 is the beginning of the deployment of the 3.5 GHz spectrum with MIMO technology.",

Notwithstanding this target, dividend decisions will continue to be subject to our Board's assessment and the determination of our financial position and outlook on a quarterly basis. Our long-term Common Share dividend payout ratio guideline is 60 to 75% of free cash flow on a prospective basis. (See Section 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures .) There can be no assurance that we will maintain a dividend growth program or that it will be unchanged through 2022. (See Caution regarding forward-looking statements - Lower than planned free cash flow could constrain our ability to invest in operations, reduce leverage or return capital to shareholders, and could affect our ability to sustain our dividend growth program through 2022 and any further dividend growth programs and Section 10.14 Financing, debt and dividends .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Our dividend reinvestment and share purchase (DRISP) plan trustee acquired shares from Treasury for the DRISP plan, rather than acquiring Common Shares in the stock market. We may, at our discretion, offer Common Shares at a discount of up to 5% from the market price under the DRISP. Effective with the dividends paid beginning on October 1, 2019, we offered Common Shares from Treasury at a discount of 2%. During 2021, our DRISP plan trustee acquired from Treasury approximately 24 million dividend reinvestment Common Shares for $620 million. For the dividends paid on January 4, 2022, the DRISP participation rate, calculated as the DRISP investment of $156 million (including the employee share purchase plan) as a percentage of gross dividends, was approximately 35%.\n- /bullet.ss01 Dividends declared in 2021 totalled $1.2710 per share, an increase of $0.08605 per share or 7.3% compared to the dividends declared in 2020. On February 9, 2022, the Board elected to declare a first quarter dividend of $0.3274 per share, payable on April 1, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2022. The first quarter dividend for 2022 reflects a cumulative increase of $0.0162 per share or 5.2% from the $0.3112 per share dividend declared one year earlier.\n- /bullet.ss01 TELUS International intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of its business.\n\n## Purchase Common Shares\n\n- /bullet.ss01 In June 2021, we received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) for a new 2021 normal course issuer bid (NCIB) to purchase and cancel up to 16 million Common Shares for an aggregate purchase price of up to $250 million over a 12-month period, from June 4, 2021, to June 3, 2022, through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange and alternative Canadian trading platforms, or as otherwise permitted by applicable securities laws. TELUS will purchase Common Shares only when and if we consider it opportunistic, subject to any purchases that may be made under automatic share purchase plans (ASPP). As of February 10, 2022, we have not completed any transactions pursuant to our 2021 NCIB.\n- /bullet.ss01 We may also enter into ASPP with a broker for the purpose of permitting us to purchase our Common Shares under our NCIB at times when we would not be permitted to trade in our shares, including regularly scheduled quarterly blackout periods. Such purchases will be determined by the broker in its sole discretion based on parameters that we have established prior to any blackout period, in accordance with TSX rules and applicable securities laws. The ASPP has been approved by the TSX and may be implemented from time to time in the future.\n\n## Use proceeds from securitized trade receivables (Short-term borrowings), bank facilities and commercial paper as needed, to supplement free cash flow and meet other cash requirements\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Our issued and outstanding commercial paper was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$1.5 billion), compared to $731 million (US$574 million) at December 31, 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 Proceeds from securitized trade receivables were $100 million at December 31, 2021, unchanged from December 31, 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 Net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) on the TI credit facility were US$854 million at December 31, 2021, compared to US$1.4 billion at December 31, 2020.

The net effect of business dispositions and business acquisitions increased the ratio. Given the cash demands of the 2019 600 MHz, the recent 2021 3500 MHz and upcoming spectrum auctions, as well as the inability to predict impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the assessment of the guideline and return to the objective range remains to be determined; however, it is our intent to return to a ratio below 2.70 times in the medium term (following the recent 2021, and upcoming 2023 and 2024, spectrum auctions), consistent with our long-term strategy.

The pandemic prevents us, our customers and our suppliers from operating in traditional manners of business in certain areas. While we expect the pandemic to continue to affect our operations until at least 2023, we have adapted, and continue to adapt, to future modes of operating.\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in consolidated revenue reflects TTech growth, including: (i) fixed data services growth in internet revenues, TV revenues, home and business security revenues, smart food-chain technology revenues and other advanced application offerings; (ii) mobile network revenue generated from growth in our subscriber base, as well as the acceleration of Internet of Things (IoT)\n\nconnections, largely offset by COVID-19 pandemic impacts such as lower roaming revenue related to travel restrictions and customers reducing their general shopping habits in retail outlets commencing from the temporary closure of approximately 90% of our retail outlets beginning in March 2020 through a majority of the second quarter of 2020; and (iii) certain health revenues, including health benefits management, collaborative health records, pharmacy management and virtual pharmacy solutions, as well as TELUS Health Virtual Care. All of these areas have been partly offset by moderating equipment revenue growth that can be attributed to the abovementioned change in customers' general shopping habits in retail outlets, which more recently has seen suppressed handset upgrade volumes throughout 2020 manifest in increased demand in the first half of 2021, as well as other pandemic",

Increased internet and data services and TV service revenues are being generated by subscriber growth and higher internet revenue per customer. There has also been increased customer adoption of our home and business security services and smart food-chain technology. For additional information on mobile and fixed revenue and subscriber trends, see Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment .\n\nYear-over-year increases in consolidated revenue also reflect growth in DLCX revenue from a combination of business acquisitions, including Competence Call Center (CCC) (since rebranded as TELUS International Northern Europe or TINE and comprised substantially of CCC) on January 31, 2020, and Lionbridge AI on December 31, 2020, which was subsequently rebranded as TELUS International AI Data Solutions (TIAI), and organic external customer growth.\n\nOperat/i.ss01ng revenues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in Goods and services purchased reflects increased expenses to support growth in our DLCX business, our subscriber base and business acquisitions; increased fixed data product costs of sales associated with a growing subscriber base; higher mobile equipment expenses associated with higher-value smartphones in the sales mix; and higher operating costs associated with growth related to scaling our health offerings and our digital capabilities. TIAI utilizes contracted labour in servicing its customers as compared to solely utilizing employees, and these contracted services have contributed to year-over-year increases in Goods and services purchased throughout 2021.\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in net Employee benefits expense reflects increases in the number of employees related to busine ss acquisitions, including those supporting the growth of DLCX revenue, health offerings, smart food-chain technology business and our other complementary businesses. This was partly offset by moderating salaries expense resulting from reductions in the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) domestic employees, excluding business acquisitions, related in part to absorbed vacancies. We experienced year-over-year increases in net Employee benefits expense in 2021 related to merit-based compensation increases, including an April 2021 compensation program increase.\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in Depreciation and amortization reflects increases related to capital assets acquired in business acquisitions; growth in capital assets, in support of the expansion of our broadband footprint, including our generational investment to connect homes and businesses to TELUS PureFibre and 5G technology coverage; and growth in internet, TV and security subscriber loading. The investments in our fibre-optic technology also support our technology strategy to improve coverage and capacity, including the ongoing build-out of 5G, as we launched the first wave of our 5G network in June 2020.\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in Financing costs reflects an increase in long-term debt outstanding, mainly associated with our investments in spectrum, fibre and mobile technology, as well as business acquisitions. Financing costs include a long-term debt prepayment premium of $10 million in the third quarter of 2021 and $18 million in the second quarter of 2020. Moreover, Financing costs are net of capitalized interest related to spectrum licences acquired during the 600 MHz spectrum auction, which we commenced deploying into our existing network in 2021, and during the 3500 MHz spectrum auction. Financing costs also include Interest accretion on provisions (asset retirement obligations and written put options) and Employee defined benefit plans net interest. Additionally, for the eight periods shown, Financing costs include varying amounts of foreign exchange gains or losses and varying amounts of interest income.\n\nThe trend in Net income reflects the items noted above, as well as non-cash adjustments arising from substantively enacted changes in income tax and adjustments recognized in the current periods for income taxes of prior periods. Historically, the trend in basic EPS has reflected trends in Net income.\n\nNet /i.ss01ncome\n\n($ millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

TTech service revenue growth of $227 million was driven by (i) increased internet and data service revenues, as well as smart food-chain technology and other fixed data services revenues, driven by higher revenue per customer resulting from internet speed upgrades, subscriber base growth, business acquisitions and expanded services; (ii) higher mobile network revenue from growth in our mobile phone and connected devices subscriber bases and higher ARPU; and (iii) growth in health services revenues. This was partly offset by continued declines in legacy fixed voice and legacy fixed data service revenues. Growth in DLCX operating revenues resulted from business acquisitions, as well as organic growth from both new clients and expanded services for existing customers.\n- /bullet.ss01 Equipment revenues were $656 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $4 million, driven by higher-value smartphones in the sales mix, despite an increased mix of certified pre-owned device sales. Additionally, industry-wide mobile handset inventory constraints resulted in lower revenues from mobile handset upgrade volumes.\n- /bullet.ss01 Other income was $411 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $412 million, largely reflecting a $410 million gain arising from the disposition of our financial solutions business in the fourth quarter of 2021, as described in Section 1.3 .\n- /bullet.ss01 Consolidated operating expenses were $3,820 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $307 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 Goods and services purchased were $1,882 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $116 million, due to: (i) higher operating, contracted labour and administrative costs associated with business acquisitions, organic DLCX revenue growth and scaling of our health offerings, including virtual care adoption; (ii) higher product and service costs in supporting growth across our subscriber connections, including TV subscribers; (iii) higher advertising and promotional costs relative to subdued marketing activity in 2020; (iv) higher mobile equipment sales expense, driven by higher-value smartphones in the sales mix, partly offset by lower mobile handset upgrades; and (v) growth in business operations related to scaling of our digital capabilities. These increases were partly offset by lower non-labour-related restructuring costs, lower bad debt expense, and lower commissions expense associated with an increased mix of digital sales and lower contracted volume.\n- /bullet.ss01 Employee benefits expense was $1,108 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $150 million, largely due to: (i) higher compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees related to business acquisitions and organic DLCX revenue growth; and (ii) merit-based compensation increases. These employee benefits expense increases were partly offset by higher capitalized labour costs.\n- /bullet.ss01 Depreciation was $545 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $6 million, primarily due to growth in capital assets over the past 12 months, including our expanded broadband footprint and business acquisitions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Amortization of intangible assets was $285 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $35 million, arising from business acquisitions and higher expenditures associated with the intangible asset base over the past 12 months.\n- /bullet.ss01 Financing costs were $192 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $2 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 Income tax expense was $197 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $111 million. The effective tax rate decreased from 24.1 to 22.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the non-taxable portion of the gain on the disposition of our financial solutions business partially offset by lower adjustments to prior period income taxes.\n- /bullet.ss01 EBITDA, which includes restructuring and other costs, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business, was $1,882 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $546 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes restructuring and other costs, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business, was $1,517 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $108 million or 7.6%.",

The pandemic prevents us, our customers, and our suppliers from operating in the normal course of business in certain areas and we expect the pandemic to continue to affect our operations until at least 2023. For example, with the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 variants and government and land border restrictions, consumer and business travel levels are uncertain, which negatively impacts roaming revenues. As well, our business customers who use our services are faced with reduced and/or closed operations. Additionally, our health services offerings are impacted, as TELUS Health Care Centres were unable to provide their full suite of core services in 2020 and operated at reduced volumes in 2021. Impacts directly associated with the pandemic, such as the reduction of roaming revenue, may be temporary in nature and have the potential to return to pre-pandemic levels once the pandemic has subsided or ended.\n\nThe historical trend over the past eight quarters in mobile network revenue reflects growth in our mobile phone subscriber base, as well as the acceleration of IoT connections. This is partly offset by declining mobile phone ARPU, primarily due to: (i) the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on international travel and international roaming revenues; (ii) carriers offering larger allotments of data, as well as rate plans that include bonus data, unlimited data plans and data sharing; and (iii) consumer behavioural response to more frequent customer data usage notifications and offloading of data traffic to increasingly available Wi-Fi hotspots, including within the home as a result of the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "This decline in growth has been partly offset by an increased mix of higher-value rate plans and an increased proportion of higher-value customers in the subscriber mix. As a result of changing industry dynamics, customers have been able to gain access to higher network speeds and larger allotments of data included for a given price point, further limiting mobile phone ARPU expansion, as customers are continuing to obtain plans with a lower cost per gigabyte.\n\nMobile equipment revenue growth has been moderating, largely due to the impacts of various waves of the pandemic on our retail traffic, in terms of both mandated health restrictions and customer behaviour, in addition to global chipset constraints in our supply chain that became more prominent across the industry in the third quarter of 2021. This has been partly offset by our digital and other direct fulfilment channels, suppressed handset upgrade volumes throughout 2020 manifesting in increased demand in the first half of 2021, and our efforts to moderate supply constraints by leveraging certified pre-owned device inventory, our Bring-it-Back device program and device repair businesses, including Mobile Klinik. Over the past eight quarters, an increase of higher-value smartphones in the sales mix and improved collectability of device balances have been offset by a lower volume of new contracts due to: (i) the improving durability and increasing cost of popular devices that result in customers deferring upgrades; (ii) growing adoption of device financing arrangements, which provide transparency of full device costs and result in customers deferring device upgrades; and (iii) most recently, the effects of the pandemic on customers, the industry, global chipset constraints in our supply chain and methods of distribution, and the Canadian economy.\n\nThe general trend of year-over-year increases in mobile phone subscriber net additions resulted from: (i) the success of our promotions, including the bundling of our mobility and home services, and the leveraging of our digital sales channels; (ii) the effects of market growth arising from a growing population, changing population demographics and an increasing number of customers with multiple devices; (iii) continuous improvements in the speed and quality of our network; and (iv) our low churn rate, which reflects our customers first efforts, upgrade volume programs and focus on building, maintaining and enhancing our high-quality network. Additionally, the pandemic has caused customers to change their behaviour, such as reducing travel and making fewer visits to retail outlets, thereby reducing churn and renewal traffic.\n\nOur connected device subscriber base has been growing primarily as a result of our expanded IoT offerings, partly offset by our strategic decision to reduce loading of low or negative-margin tablets. Our spectrum investments and capital expenditures on network improvements increase capacity and coverage, allowing us to grow revenue through net additions of mobile phone and connected devices subscribers.\n\nWe expect ongoing internet subscriber base growth as we continue our investments in expanding our fibre-optic infrastructure, supplemented with our low customer churn rate. The total number of TV subscribers has increased (in contrast to market-reported declines in traditional television viewing habits) as a result of healthy net additions in response to our diverse and flexible product offerings, combined with our low customer churn rate. Security subscriber base growth is increasing as a result of organic growth and business acquisitions. Home services growth has also been attributable to the adoption of\n\nthe TELUS Whole Home bundle and the bundling of our mobility and home services to meet the demand for multiple services per home. Adoption increases our services per home and positively impacts churn for most products, in addition to the effectiveness of our self install and virtual install models. Residential voice subscriber losses continue to reflect the ongoing trend of substitution to mobile and internet-based services, but were partly mitigated by the success of our bundled service offerings and lower-priced offerings.\n\nThe trend of growing fixed data services revenues (excluding smart food-chain technology, which is described separately below) is due to the continued appetite for faster internet speeds and larger bandwidth, as well as our diverse suite of TV, home and business security, and other advanced application offerings, which are enabled by investments in our fibre-optic footprint. The trend of declining legacy fixed voice revenues is due to technological substitution and intensification of competition in the small and medium-sized business market; however, our rate of decline has been moderating with our utilization of bundled product offerings and successful retention efforts. The migration of business product and service offerings to IP services and the introduction of new competitors have yielded inherently lower margins compared to some legacy business product and service offerings; however, we are continually refining and diversifying our innovative suite of business offerings, including our Software as a Service (SaaS)-based solutions.\n\nThe trend of digitization has propelled the adoption of our health offerings, including virtual care solutions, collaborative health records, health benefits management and personal health monitoring solutions. In health, we are well positioned to improve the lives and outcomes for Canadians. Our competencies and assets in health, combined with the trend in digitization and automation, position us well to bolster the Canadian healthcare system in a complementary fashion. With our technology heritage, we see the trend moving the healthcare system to improved efficiency and improved outcomes through better insights. We also believe Canadians will have greater control of their healthcare outcomes through the integration of disparate data (better flow of information across the system) and consent-based management. While the pandemic has disrupted the operations of our TELUS Health Care Centres since March 2020, our diversified virtual care offerings continue to grow to meet the healthcare needs of Canadians and drive better health outcomes, including the accelerated adoption of virtual consultations, as reflected in our growing virtual care members. Our health benefits management solution is influenced by the number of lives covered and the number of benefit claims, which were disrupted by the pandemic. We expect the demand for these services to resume in correspondence with the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations and higher employment rates.\n\nThe trend of greater use of digital solutions within the agriculture industry is due to increased demand for data and analytical insights to drive more effective and agile decision-making to address changing consumer demands and improve profitability. We are committed to providing solutions to create a better flow of information across the value chain, improving the safety and sustainability of our food system. Within the verticals of agri-business; food, beverage, and consumer goods; and animal agriculture, we are expanding our solutions and customer base worldwide through acquisitions and organic growth.",

Industry-wide inventory shortages due to global supply chain challenges had an impact on competitive activity in the second half of 2021. However, we mitigated these challenges by leveraging certified pre-owned device inventory, our Bring-it-Back device program and device repair businesses, including Mobile Klinik, in addition to our compelling rate plan offers.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our mobile phone churn rate was 0.91% in 2021, compared to 0.96% in 2020, reflecting the impacts of industry-wide inventory shortages arising from global supply chain challenges that became more prominent in the third quarter of 2021, which had an impact on customer switching activity. These relatively low churn rates in the current and comparative period reflect the impacts of the pandemic, with customers reducing their general shopping habits in retail outlets since the start of the pandemic, along with mandated capacity restrictions. Churn continues to benefit from our successful bundling of mobility and home services, our focus on executing customers first initiatives and upgrade volume programs, and our leading network quality.\n- /bullet.ss01 Mobile phone net additions were 367,000 in 2021, an increase of 87,000, demonstrating improvements in retail traffic compared to the prior year, albeit still below our pre-pandemic baseline, our strong execution in digital sales and expanded channels, and our successful efforts to drive high-value customer net additions, inclusive of our consistently low customer churn, as discussed above.\n- /bullet.ss01 Mobile phone ARPU was $57.07 in 2021, a decrease of $0.34 or 0.6%, largely due to lower chargeable usage revenues as customers continue to adopt larger data allotments in their rate plans, the impact of the competitive environment putting pressure on base rate plan prices in the current and prior periods, and lower roaming revenues as declines in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a pre-pandemic baseline exceeded the sequential, modest roaming recoveries experienced in the final nine months of 2021, as reflected in ARPU growth in the fourth quarter. These factors were partly offset by higher monthly recurring charges caused by a greater mix of highvalue customer additions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Mobile phone ABPU was $69.83 in 2021, a decrease of $0.66 or 0.9%, largely reflecting the same items noted above for mobile phone ARPU in addition to a greater mix of bring-your-own device customer additions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Connected device net additions were 338,000 in 2021, an increase of 81,000, largely due to increased demand for IoT net additions and a lower churn rate for tablets.",

See TTech trends and seasonality for further details.\n- /bullet.ss01 Digital health transactions were 551.1 million in 2021, an increase of 16.2 million, largely driven by a higher number of adjudication, eClaims, transport, and collaborative health transactions from a business acquisition as plan members resume the utilization of elective health services with pandemic restrictions easing.\n\n| Operating revenues and other income - TTech segment         | Operating revenues and other income - TTech segment   | Operating revenues and other income - TTech segment   | Operating revenues and other income - TTech segment   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)                     | 2021                                                  | 2020                                                  | Change                                                |\n| Mobile network revenue                                      | 6,208                                                 | 6,030                                                 | 3.0 %                                                 |\n| Mobile equipment and   other service revenues               | 2,124                                                 | 1,867                                                 | 13.8 %                                                |\n| Fixed data services                                         | 4,421                                                 | 3,939                                                 | 12.2 %                                                |\n| Fixed voice services                                        | 843                                                   | 912                                                   | (7.6) %                                               |\n| Fixed equipment and   other service revenues                | 411                                                   | 408                                                   | 0.7 %                                                 |\n| Health services                                             | 521                                                   | 448                                                   | 16.3 %                                                |\n| Operating revenues (arising from  contracts with customers) | 14,528                                                | 13,604                                                | 6.8 %                                                 |\n| Other income                                                | 420                                                   | 19                                                    | n/m                                                   |\n| External Operating revenues   and other income              | 14,948                                                | 13,623                                                | 9.7 %                                                 |\n| Intersegment revenues                                       | 18                                                    | 13                                                    | 38.5 %                                                |\n| TTech Operating revenues   and other income                 | 14,966                                                | 13,636                                                | 9.8 %                                                 |\n\nTTech Operating revenues and other income increased by $1,330 million in 2021.\n\n| TTech Operat/i.ss01ng revenues  (ar/i.ss01s/i.ss01ng from contracts w/i.ss01th customers)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ($ millions)                                                                                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2021 | 14,528   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2020 | 13,604   |\n\nMobile network revenue increased by $178 million or 3.0% in 2021, due to growth of 6.3% in the mobile phones and connected devices subscriber base over the past 12 months, partly offset by lower mobile phone ARPU, as described above.\n\nMobile equipment and other service revenues increased by $257 million in 2021, reflecting higher-value smartphones in the sales mix, higher handset upgrade volumes and greater collectability of mobile device balances. Handset upgrades were significantly impacted by the pandemic in 2020, including the temporary closure of approximately 90% of our retail outlets from March 2020 through most of the second quarter, and customers reducing their general shopping habits in retail outlets since the start of the pandemic, which resulted in lower contracted volume and accessory sales. In 2021, handset upgrade volumes increased as a result of the successful execution of our customers first initiatives, including the enhanced capabilities of our digital footprint, suppressed handset upgrade volumes throughout 2020 manifesting in increased demand in the first half of 2021 and fewer retail locations due to the pandemic.",

The increase was driven by: (i) increased internet and data service revenues, reflecting higher revenue per customer resulting from internet speed upgrades, larger allotted data internet rate plans and rate changes, in addition to a 6.2% increase in our internet subscribers over the past 12 months; (ii) increased revenues from smart food-chain technology, driven by business acquisitions; (iii) higher TV revenues, reflecting subscriber growth of 4.1% over the past 12 months; and (iv) increased revenues from home and business security driven by expanded services and customer growth of 13.7% over the past 12 months. This growth was partly offset by the ongoing decline in legacy data service revenues.\n\nFixed voice services revenues decreased by $69 million in 2021, reflecting the ongoing decline in legacy voice revenues resulting from technological substitution and price plan changes. Declines were mitigated by the success of our bundled product offerings and retention efforts and the migration from legacy to IP services offerings The decline in residential voice subscribers over the past 12 months was 3.5%,\n\ncompared to a 3.3% decline in residential voice subscribers for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2020.\n\nFixed equipment and other service revenues increased by $3 million in 2021, reflecting a higher volume of home and business security equipment sales and data equipment sales.\n\nHealth services revenues increased by $73 million in 2021, driven by: (i) business acquisitions; (ii) increased in-clinic services in our reopened TELUS Health Care Centres, whereas clinics were impacted by mandated lockdowns last year; (iii) higher revenues from the continued adoption of our virtual care solutions; and (iv) growth in health benefits management services with plan members resuming the use of elective health services.\n\nOther income increased by $401 million in 2021, largely related to the $410 million gain on disposition of our financial solutions business as described in Section 1.3 and lower equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, partly offset by the non-recurrence of 2020 gains on sale of certain assets.\n\nIntersegment revenues represent services provided to the DLCX segment that are eliminated upon consolidation, together with the associated DLCX expenses.\n\n## Direct contribution - TTech segment\n\n|                                                             | Mobile products and services/one.numr   | Mobile products and services/one.numr   | Mobile products and services/one.numr   | Fixed products and services/one.numr   | Fixed products and services/one.numr   | Fixed products and services/one.numr   | Total TTech   | Total TTech   | Total TTech   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)                     | 2021                                    | 2020                                    | Change                                  | 2021                                   | 2020                                   | Change                                 | 2021          | 2020          | Change        |\n| Revenues                                                    |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                        |                                        |                                        |               |               |               |\n| Service                                                     | 6,297                                   | 6,096                                   | 3.3 %                                   | 5,928                                  | 5,444                                  | 8.9 %                                  | 12,225        | 1 1 ,540      | 5.9 %         |\n| Equipment                                                   | 2,042                                   | 1,809                                   | 12.9 %                                  | 261                                    | 255                                    | 2.4 %                                  | 2,303         | 2,064         | 11.6 %        |\n| Operating revenues (arising from  contracts with customers) | 8,339                                   | 7,905                                   | 5.5 %                                   | 6,189                                  | 5,699                                  | 8.6 %                                  | 14,528        | 13,604        | 6.8 %         |\n| Expenses                                                    |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                        |                                        |                                        |               |               |               |\n| Direct expenses                                             | 2,802                                   | 2,652                                   | 5.6 %                                   | 1,771                                  | 1,555                                  | 13.8 %                                 | 4,572         | 4,208         | 8.7 %         |\n| Direct contribution                                         | 5,537                                   | 5,253                                   | 5.4 %                                   | 4,418                                  | 4,144                                  | 6.6 %                                  | 9,956         | 9,396         | 6.0 %         |\n\nThe direct expenses included in the direct contribution calculations in the preceding table represent a component of the Goods and services purchased and Employee benefits expense totals included in the table below and have been calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the totals presented in the financial statements.

TTech Adjusted EBITDA increased by $299 million or 5.7% in 2021, reflecting an increase in direct contribution, as mentioned above, and lower bad debt expense. These impacts were partially offset by higher employee benefits expense, operating and administrative costs related to business acquisitions and growth in business operations, in addition to higher advertising and promotional costs relative to subdued marketing activity in 2020.\n\n## TTech Ad/j.ss01usted EBITDA\n\n($ millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EBIT - TTech segment\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)   | 2021    | 2020    | Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| EBITDA                                    | 5,735   | 4,976   | 15.2 %   |\n| Depreciation                              | (1,982) | (1,973) | 0.5 %    |\n| Amortization                              | (912)   | (795)   | 14.7 %   |\n| EBIT/one.numr                             | 2,841   | 2,208   | 28.7 %   |\n\n- 1 See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n\nTTech EBIT increased by $633 million in 2021. Depreciation and amortization increased in 2021 due to business acquisitions and growth in capital assets over the past 12 months, including our expanded fibre footprint and 5G network roll-out, partially offset by lower depreciation on right-of-use lease assets. The depreciation increase in 2021 was partially offset by the effect of accelerated depreciation in the first quarter of 2020 from asset retirement activity.",

As our service delivery centres are located in multiple geographic regions, the varying degrees of severity and recovery efforts from the pandemic in the countries we operate has required us to evolve our business operations. As of the date of this report, the majority of our team members continue to work remotely, as they have since the onset of the pandemic, and in some cases we have thoughtfully and strategically returned team members to delivery locations. Over the past few quarters in 2021, we were able to largely mitigate the negative impact on our financial condition, financial performance and operating cash flows by taking steps to strategically grow our client base and contain costs. The pandemic prevents us and our clients from operating in the normal course of business in certain areas, and we are unable to quantify with precision the impact that the pandemic has had or will have on our revenue. We expect the pandemic to continue to affect our operations into at least the first half of 2022.\n\nThe trend over the past eight quarters of increases in DLCX revenue reflects both the growth in our organic customer base, as well as the scale-up of new service programs provided to existing external customers. The higher revenue also includes revenue from internal services provided to the TTech segment and revenue growth from business acquisitions, including our acquisitions of CCC (since rebranded as TELUS International Northern Europe or TINE and comprised substantially of CCC) on January 31, 2020, and Lionbridge AI on December 31, 2020, which was subsequently rebranded as TELUS International AI Data Solutions (TIAI).\n\nGoods and services purchased and Employee benefits expense have increased in correspondence with increases in our team member base as a result of business acquisitions and to service growing volumes from both our existing and new customers (including the expansion of our service offerings), increases in external labour to support the growth in our digital business, increases in our software licensing costs associated with our growing team member base, and increases in administrative expenses to support growth in the overall business and business acquisitions.\n\nDepreciation and amortization have increased due to growth in capital assets, which is supporting the expansion of our sites required to service customer demand and growth in intangible assets recognized in connection with our business acquisitions.\n\n## DLCX operating indicators\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)   | 2021   | 2020   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Operating revenues   by industry vertical |        |        |          |\n| Tech and games                            | 1,256  | 840    | 49.5 %   |\n| Communications and media                  | 674    | 656    | 2.7 %    |\n| eCommerce and fintech                     | 324    | 233    | 39.1 %   |\n| Travel and hospitality                    | 78     | 73     | 6.8 %    |\n| Healthcare                                | 59     | 49     | 20.4 %   |\n| Other/one.numr                            | 363    | 302    | 20.2 %   |\n|                                           | 2,754  | 2,153  | 27.9 %   |\n| Operating revenues   by geographic region |        |        |          |\n| Europe                                    | 1,153  | 864    | 33.4 %   |\n| North America                             | 629    | 472    | 33.3 %   |\n| Asia-Pacific                              | 575    | 460    | 25.0 %   |\n| Central America                           | 397    | 357    | 11.2 %   |\n|                                           | 2,754  | 2,153  | 27.9 %   |\n\nRevenue from our tech and games industry vertical increased by $416 million to $1,256 million in 2021. This represented 46% of Operating revenues for 2021, compared to 39% in 2020. This growth is partly attributable to the acquisition of Lionbridge AI and continued growth within our existing clients and the addition of new clients, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates. Revenue generated from the eCommerce and fintech industry vertical grew by $91 million to $324 million in 2021, which was primarily attributable to new clients and growth within our existing client base, partly offset by the effect of foreign exchange rates.\n\nWe serve our clients, who are primarily domiciled in North America, from multiple delivery locations across four geographic regions. In addition, our TIAI clients are largely supported by crowdsourced contractors that are globally dispersed and not limited to the physical locations of our delivery centres. The table above presents the revenue generated in each geographic region, based on the location of our delivery centre or where the services were provided from, for the periods presented.",

The remainder of the growth was organic, coming from growth in services provided to existing clients, as well as new clients added since the prior year. This growth was offset, in part, by foreign exchange impacts in 2021 driven by the strengthening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar, the primary operating currency of DLCX.\n\nOther income decreased by $103 million in 2021, related to the non-recurrence of the comparative period's decrease and subsequent retirement of a provision arising from business acquisition-related written put options to acquire the remaining non-controlling interest of an acquired subsidiary, Xavient, which was settled in the second quarter of 2020.\n\n## DLCX Operat/i.ss01ng revenues (ar/i.ss01s/i.ss01ng from contracts w/i.ss01th customers)\n\n($ millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntersegment revenues represent services provided to the TTech segment, including those from the TELUS master services agreement.

While Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2021, Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 2.4 percentage points. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2021 was due to the impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on the liability-accounted share-based compensation units associated with an increase in the share price of TELUS International and the expense recognition on new equity-accounted awards granted in 2021, and foreign exchange impacts on revenues as a result of the strengthening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EBIT - DLCX segment\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)   | 2021   | 2020   | Change     |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| EBITDA                                    | 555    | 518    | 7.3 %      |\n| Depreciation                              | (144)  | (134)  | 7.5 %      |\n| Amortization                              | (178)  | (110)  | 61.8 %     |\n| EBIT/one.numr                             | 233    | 274    | ( 1 5.0) % |\n\n- 1 See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n\nDLCX EBIT decreased by $41 million in 2021.

Additionally, in the first quarter of 2021, we acquired 3500 MHz spectrum licences in the urban cores of Edmonton, Guelph/Kitchener, London, Ottawa and Winnipeg, as well as in East Kootenay and Whistler. In the second quarter of 2021, we acquired a 2500 MHz licence in the urban core of Calgary.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2021, we made cash payments for Blacksmith Applications Holdings Inc. as noted in Section 1.3 , as well as other individually immaterial business acquisitions that are complementary to our existing lines of business. This is compared to a higher number of business acquisitions in 2020 that included Competence Call Center (CCC) (since rebranded as TELUS International Northern Europe or TINE and comprised substantially of CCC), Mobile Klinik, AFS, EQ Care and Lionbridge AI, in addition to other individually immaterial business acquisitions complementary to our existing lines of business.\n- /bullet.ss01 Advances to, and investment in, real estate joint ventures and associates represented a net change of $54 million, predominantly related to higher investments in the first quarter of 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 Proceeds on disposition increased by $422 million in 2021 primarily due to the disposition of our financial solutions business described in Section 1.3 , partly offset by the non-recurrence on the sale of certain assets in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nCap/i.ss01ta/l.ss08 expend/i.ss01tures (exc/l.ss08ud/i.ss01ng spectrum /l.ss08/i.ss01cences)\n\n($ millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capital expenditure measures\n\n| Years ended December 31   ($ millions, except capital intensity)          | 2021   | 2020   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Capital expenditures/one.numr                                             |        |        |          |\n| TELUS technology solutions   (TTech) segment                              | 3,372  | 2,675  | 26.1 %   |\n| Digitally-led customer experiences -  TELUS International (DLCX)  segment | 126    | 100    | 26.0 %   |\n| Consolidated                                                              | 3,498  | 2,775  | 26.1 %   |\n| TTech segment capital   expenditure intensity/two.numr (%)                | 23     | 20     | 3 pts.   |\n| DLCX segment capital   expenditure intensity/two.numr (%)                 | 5      | 4      | 1 pt.    |\n| Consolidated capital   expenditure intensity/two.numr (%)                 | 20     | 18     | 2 pts.   |\n\nConsolidated capital expenditures increased by $723 million in 2021.\n\nTTech drove $697 million of the increase in 2021, primarily due to accelerated investments in our 5G network, broadband build, enhanced product development, and digitization to increase system capacity and reliability as announced on March 25, 2021. In addition, we saw strong security subscriber growth, and advanced the purchase of customer equipment to mitigate supply chain risks and support subscriber growth. This was partly offset by reduced spend resulting from efficiencies in our 4G network. With our investments, we are advancing the mobile speeds and coverage of our expanding 5G network, continuing to connect additional homes and businesses directly to our fibre-optic technology, enhancing products, and supporting system reliability and operational efficiency and effectiveness efforts. These investments also support our internet, TV and security subscriber growth, address our customers' demand for faster internet speeds, and extend the reach and functionality of our business, as well as our healthcare and agriculture solutions. By December 31, 2021, our 5G network covered over 26.2 million Canadians, representing 70% of the population.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, we announced that we intended to accelerate up to $750 million of capital spending in 2021. $708 million of accelerated capital had been invested throughout 2021, to advance our fibre build and 5G coverage. This spend has enabled: (i) additional premises to be connected to our fibre network; (ii) acceleration of our copper to fibre migration program; (iii) expansion of the number of communities we are bringing fibre to, including many rural and Indigenous communities; (iv) advancement of our 5G network build, which covered 70% of the Canadian population at December 31, 2021; and (v) progress in the implementation of our digital strategy and enhancing products that will bolster both top-line revenue growth and operating expense efficiency.",

This is compared to 58 million Common Shares issued at a price of $26.00 in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n## Dividends paid to holders of Common Shares\n\nOur dividend reinvestment and share purchase (DRISP) plan trustee acquired shares from Treasury for the DRISP plan, rather than acquiring Common Shares in the stock market. Effective with the dividends paid on October 1, 2019, we offered Common Shares from Treasury at a discount of 2%. Cash payments for dividends increased by $115 million in 2021, which reflected higher dividend rates under our dividend growth program (see Section 4.3 ) and an increase in the number of shares outstanding. This was partly offset by a higher discounted DRISP issuance. During 2021, our DRISP plan trustee acquired Common Shares for $620 million.\n\nIn January 2022, we paid dividends of $293 million to the holders of Common Shares and the trustee acquired dividend reinvestment Common Shares from Treasury for $156 million, totalling $449 million.\n\n## Issue (repayment) of short-term borrowings, net\n\nThere were no material draws or repayments in the current or previous year, with the exception of the first quarter of 2020, when we drew down and repaid $200 million advanced to us from an arm's-length securitization trust.\n\n## Long-term debt issued and redemptions and repayment of long-term debt\n\nIn 2021, long-term debt issued increased by $9 million, while redemptions and repayment of long-term debt increased by $1,109 million. These changes were primarily composed of:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 A net increase in commercial paper outstanding, including foreign exchange effects, of $372 million to a balance of $1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) at December 31, 2021, from a balance of $731 million (US$574 million) at December 31, 2020. Our commercial paper program, when utilized, provides low-cost funds and is fully backstopped by the revolving credit facility (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ).\n- /bullet.ss01 A decrease in net draws on the TELUS International (TI) credit facility, including foreign exchange effects, of $742 million. As at December 31, 2021, net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) were US$854 million, whereas as at December 30, 2020, net draws were US$1,428 million. The reduction in TI credit facility indebtedness was facilitated by the net proceeds of the TI initial public offering (IPO) (see Note 28(c) of the Consolidated financial statements). The TI credit facility is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation.\n- /bullet.ss01 The April 5, 2021 issue of $500 million of senior unsecured 4.10% Notes, Series CAE, due April 5, 2051. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the repayment upon maturity of the Series 3, 10.65% debentures of TELUS Communications Inc. (TCI) due June 2021, the repayment of commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.\n- /bullet.ss01 The June 28, 2021 issue of $750 million of our inaugural senior unsecured 2.85% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAF, due November 13, 2031. The net proceeds were used for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness, including the repayment of commercial paper, and for other general corporate purposes.\n- /bullet.ss01 The repayment upon maturity of Series 3, 10.65% debentures of TCI due June 2021.\n- /bullet.ss01 The early full redemption of $1 billion of 2.35% Notes, Series CT, due March 28, 2022. The long-term debt prepayment premium recorded in the three-month period ended September 30, 2021 was $10 million before income taxes.\n\nIn comparison, in 2020, long-term debt issued decreased by $2,823 million while redemptions and repayment of long-term debt decreased by $1,398 million. These changes were primarily composed of:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 A net decrease in commercial paper outstanding, including foreign exchange effects, of $284 million from a balance of $1,015 million (US$781 million) at December 31, 2019.\n- /bullet.ss01 An increase in net draws on the TI credit facility, including foreign exchange effects, of $1,373 million. As at December 31, 2019, net draws were US$336 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 The May 29, 2020 issues of $600 million of senior unsecured 2.35% Notes, Series CAC, due January 27, 2028, and $400 million through the re-opening of the 3.95% Notes, Series CAB, due February 16, 2050. The net proceeds of this offering were used for the early full redemptions of the $400 million 3.60% Notes, Series CM, due January 26, 2021 and the $500 million 3.20% Notes, Series CO, due April 5, 2021, as well as for general corporate purposes. The total long-term debt prepayment premium for the $400 million Series CM and $500 million Series CO notes redemptions was $18 million before income taxes.",

Additionally, the weighted average cost of our long-term debt (excluding commercial paper, the revolving component of the TI credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt) was 3.72% at December 31, 2021, a decrease from 3.80% at December 31, 2020.\n\nWe/i.ss01ghted average /i.ss01nterest rate on /l.ss08ong-term debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShares of subsidiary issued and sold to non-controlling interests, net In connection with the TI IPO described in Section 1.3 , we received net cash proceeds of $827 million in the first quarter of 2021 (see Note 28(c) of the Consolidated financial statements). Also in 2020, TI issued shares to non-controlling interests related to its acquisitions of CCC and Lionbridge AI.\n\n## Other\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we incurred debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of 4.10% Notes, Series CAE and 2.85% Sustainability-Linked Notes, Series CAF. In connection with our issuance of 51 million Common Shares in the first quarter of 2021, we incurred certain equity issuance costs. In the first quarter of 2020, we also incurred certain equity issuance costs in connection with our issue of 58 million Common Shares.\n\n## 7/period.ss01 5 L/i.ss01qu/i.ss01d/i.ss01ty and cap/i.ss01ta/l.ss08 resource measures\n\nNet debt was $20.5 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $709 million compared to one year earlier, resulting mainly from an increase in commercial paper outstanding, and the second quarter 2021 issuances of $500 million of Series CAE notes and $750 million of Series CAF Sustainability-Linked Notes as described in Section 7.4 as well as lower Cash and temporary investments. These factors were partially offset by the early redemption of Series CT notes described in Section 7.4 , and the repayment upon maturity of Series 3, 10.65% debentures of TCI.\n\nFixed-rate debt as a proportion of total indebtedness , which excludes lease liabilities and other long-term debt, was 87% as at December 31, 2021, down from 89% one year earlier. This was mainly due to: (i) an increase in commercial paper outstanding, which is classified as floatingrate debt in this calculation; (ii) the early redemption of Series CT notes; and (iii) the repayment upon maturity of Series 3, 10.65% debentures of TCI. These factors were partially offset by: (i) a decrease in net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) on the TI credit facility, which is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation; and (ii) the second quarter 2021 issuances of $500 million of Series CAE notes and $750 million of Series CAF Sustainability-Linked Notes.\n\nNet debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio was 3.17 times, as measured at December 31, 2021, down from 3.45 times one year earlier. Our long-term objective for this measure is within a range of 2.20 to 2.70 times, which we believe is consistent with maintaining investment grade credit ratings in the range of BBB+, or the equivalent, and providing reasonable access to capital. As at December 31, 2021, this ratio remains outside of the long-term objective range resulting from prior issuances of incremental debt, primarily due to business acquisitions and the acquisition of spectrum licences, partially offset by growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs. Fiscal 2021 EBITDA growth was reduced by impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. As at December 31, 2021, the acquisition of spectrum licences increased the ratio by approximately 0.49 and business acquisitions over the past 12 months increased the ratio by approximately 0.05, while business dispositions decreased the ratio by approximately 0.26. Our recent acquisitions of spectrum licences have increased our national spectrum holdings and represent an investment to extend our network capacity to support continuing data consumption growth, as well as growth in our mobile subscriber base. Given the cash demands of the 2019 600 MHz, the recent 2021 3500 MHz and upcoming spectrum auctions, as well as the inability to predict impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the assessment of the guideline and return to the objective range remains to be determined; however, it is our intent to return to a ratio below 2.70 times in the medium term (following the recent 2021, and upcoming 2023 and 2024, spectrum auctions), consistent with our long-term strategy. While this ratio exceeds our long-term objective range, we are well in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant in our credit facilities, which states that we may not permit our leverage ratio to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 at September 30, 2021 (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ).\n\n<!-- image -->",

An increase in income before borrowing costs and income taxes increased the ratio by 0.7; the gain on the disposition of our financial solutions business in the fourth quarter of 2021 contributed to EBITDA growth.\n\nEBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage ratio for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2021 was 8.4 times, up from 7.3 times one year earlier. Growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs increased the ratio by 0.9 and a decrease in net interest costs increased the ratio by 0.2.\n\nCommon Share dividend payout ratios: Actual Common Share dividend payout decisions will continue to be subject to our Board's assessment of our financial position and outlook, as well as our long-term Common Share dividend payout objective range of 60 to 75% of prospective free cash flow. So as to be consistent with the way we manage our business, our Common Share dividend payout ratio is presented as a historical\n\nmeasure calculated as the sum of the most recent four quarters' dividends declared for Common Shares, as recorded in the financial statements, net of dividend reinvestment plan effects, divided by the sum of the most recent four quarters' free cash flow amounts for interim reporting periods. For fiscal years, the denominator is annual free cash flow. The historical measure for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2021 is presented for illustrative purposes in evaluating our target guideline. As at December 31, 2021, the ratio was outside of the objective range, primarily due to: (i) our planned accelerated capital expenditures program to support our broadband capital investments, the build-out of our TELUS PureFibre infrastructure and the acceleration of our 5G network roll-out; and (ii) the fiscal 2021 impact of the pandemic. Excluding the effects of our accelerated capital expenditures program, as at December 31, 2021, the ratio was 73%.\n\nTI intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of its business.",

        "page_content": "## 7/period.ss01 6 Cred/i.ss01t fac/i.ss01/l.ss08/i.ss01t/i.ss01es\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $850 million of liquidity available from the TELUS revolving credit facility and $833 million of liquidity available from the TI credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation). In addition, we had $500 million available under our trade receivables securitization program (see Section 7.7 Sale of trade receivables ). We are well within our objective of generally maintaining at least $1.0 billion of available liquidity.\n\n## TELUS revolving credit facility\n\nWe have a $2.75 billion (or U.S. dollar equivalent) unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions, expiring April 6, 2026. The revolving credit facility is used for general corporate purposes, including the backstop of commercial paper, as required.\n\n## TELUS revolving credit facility at December 31, 2021\n\n| ($ millions)                       | Expiry        | Size   | Drawn   | Outstanding  undrawn letters  of credit   | Backstop for  commercial  paper program   |   Available  liquidity |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Revolving credit facility/one.numr | April 6, 2026 | 2,750  | -       | -                                         | ( 1 ,900)                                 |                    850 |\n\nOur revolving credit facility contains customary covenants, including a requirement that we not permit our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 and that we not permit our consolidated coverage ratio to be less than 2.00 to 1.00 at the end of any financial quarter. As at December 31, 2021, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.17 to 1.00 and our consolidated coverage ratio was 8.38 to 1.00. These ratios are expected to remain well within the covenants. There are certain minor differences in the calculation of the leverage ratio and coverage ratio under the revolving credit facility, as compared with the calculation of Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs and EBITDA excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage. Historically, the calculations have not been materially different. The covenants are not impacted by revaluation, if any, of Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets or Goodwill for accounting purposes. Continued access to our credit facilities is not contingent on maintaining a specific credit rating\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nTELUS Corporation has an unsecured commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our revolving credit facility, enabling us to issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount at any one time of $1.9 billion equivalent (US$1.5 billion maximum) as at December 31, 2021. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency risk arising from issuing commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars. The commercial paper program is to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, capital expenditures and investments. Our ability to reasonably access the commercial paper market in the U.S. is dependent on our credit ratings (see Section 7.8 Credit ratings ).\n\n## TELUS International credit facility\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, TELUS International (Cda) Inc. had a credit facility, secured by its assets, expiring on January 28, 2025, with a syndicate of financial institutions and, joined in 2020, by TELUS Corporation. The TI credit facility is comprised of US$620 million (TELUS Corporation as an approximately 7.5% lender) and US$230 million (TELUS Corporation as a 12.5% lender) revolving components and amortizing US$600 million (TELUS Corporation as 12.5% lender) and US$250 million term loan components. The TI credit facility is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation. The outstanding revolving components and term loan components had a weighted average interest rate of 1.88% as at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe term loan components are subject to an amortization schedule which requires that 5% of the principal advanced be repaid each year of the term of the agreement, with the balance due at maturity and December 22, 2022, for the US$250 million component, respectively.\n\n## Other letter of credit facilities\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $193 million of letters of credit outstanding issued under various uncommitted facilities; such letter of credit facilities are in addition to the ability to provide letters of credit pursuant to our committed bank credit facility. Available liquidity under various uncommitted letters of credit facilities was $117 million at December 31, 2021. Further, we had arranged $359 million of incremental letters of credit to allow us to participate in Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada's 3500 MHz band spectrum auction that was held in June-July 2021, as further described in Note 18(a) of the Consolidated financial statements. Concurrent with funding the purchase of the spectrum licences, these incremental letters of credit were extinguished.\n\n## Other long-term debt\n\nOther liabilities bear interest at 3.19%, are secured by the AWS-4 spectrum licences associated with these other liabilities and a real estate holding, and are subject to amortization schedules, so that the principal is repaid over the periods to maturity, the last period ending March 31, 2035.\n\n## 7/period.ss017 Sa/l.ss08e of trade rece/i.ss01vab/l.ss08es\n\nTCI, a wholly owned subsidiary of TELUS, is a party to an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust associated with a major Schedule I Canadian bank, under which it is currently able to sell an interest in certain trade receivables for an amount up to a maximum of $600 million. The agreement is in effect until December 31, 2024, and available liquidity was $500 million as at December 31, 2021. (See Note 22 of the Consolidated financial statements.) Sales of trade receivables in securitization transactions are recognized as collateralized Short-term borrowings and thus do not result in our de-recognition of the trade receivables sold.\n\nTCI is required to maintain a credit rating of at least BB by DBRS Ltd. or the securitization trust may require the sale program to be wound down prior to the end of the term. The minimum credit rating was exceeded as of February 10, 2022.",

Excluding the TI credit facility and including cash and temporary investments of $723 million, we had available liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021 (see Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures ). This adheres to our objective of generally maintaining at least $1 billion of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings contribute to reasonable access to capital markets.\n\nRefer to Note 4 of the Consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our financial instruments.",

See Section 7.11 Transactions between related parties .\n\n## Claims and lawsuits\n\nA number of claims and lawsuits (including class actions and intellectual property infringement claims) seeking damages and other relief are pending against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers. As well, we have received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims (including intellectual property infringement claims) against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers. (See the related risk discussion in Section 10.17 Litigation and legal matters .)\n\nIt is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims and lawsuits due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; an incomplete factual record; uncertainty concerning legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and the appeal levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nHowever, subject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, with the exception of the items disclosed in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements. This is a significant judgment for us (see Section 8.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgments ).\n\n## Indemnification obligations\n\nIn the normal course of operations, we provide indemnification in conjunction with certain transactions. The terms of these indemnification obligations range in duration. These indemnifications would require us to compensate the indemnified parties for costs incurred as a result of failure to comply with contractual obligations, or litigation claims or statutory sanctions, or damages that may be suffered by an indemnified party. In some cases, there is no maximum limit on these indemnification obligations. The overall maximum amount of an indemnification obligation will depend on future events and conditions and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, an indemnification obligation is recorded as a liability. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the related transactions, historically we have not made significant payments under these indemnifications.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, we had no liability recorded in respect of our indemnification obligations.\n\n## 7/period.ss0110 Outstand/i.ss01ng share /i.ss01nformat/i.ss01on\n\n| Outstanding shares (millions)           | December 31,  2021   | January 31,  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Common Shares                           | 1,370                | 1,376               |\n| Common Share options                    | 3                    | 3                   |\n| Restricted share units - equity-settled | 8                    | 8                   |",

Total compensation expense for key management personnel was $99 million in 2021, compared to $62 million in 2020. The increase in compensation expense for key management personnel was primarily due to greater share-based compensation, which was largely related to liability-accounted awards that increased in value in the first quarter of 2021 and decreased in value in the comparative 2020 period and pension plan past service costs recorded in 2021. See Note 30(a) of the Consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\n## 8 Account/i.ss01ng matters\n\n## 8/period.ss011 Cr/i.ss01t/i.ss01ca/l.ss08 account/i.ss01ng est/i.ss01mates and /j.ss01udgments\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect: the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts and classification of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting estimates and significant judgments are generally discussed with the Audit Committee each quarter.\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates, including examples of the significant estimates and judgments that we make, and their relative significance and degree of difficulty, as illustrated in the graphic included in Note 1 .\n\n## Transactions with defined benefit pension plans\n\nWe provided management and administrative services to our defined benefit pension plans. Charges for these services were on a cost recovery basis and were immaterial.\n\n## Transactions with real estate joint venture and associates\n\nIn 2021, we had transactions with the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture, which is a related party to us, as set out in Note 21 of the Consolidated financial statements. The new-build tower was completed in 2020.\n\nFor the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture, commitments and con tingent liabilities include construction financing ($342 million, with Canadian financial institutions as 66/two.numr//three.dnom% lender and TELUS as 33/one.numr//three.dnom% lender) under a credit agreement maturing August 31, 2023. We have entered into lease agreements with the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture; for lease accounting purposes, the first lease commenced during the three-month period ended June 30, 2019.\n\n## General\n\n- /bullet.ss01 In determining our critical accounting estimates, we consider trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that we reasonably expect to materially affect our methodology or assumptions. Our statements in this MD&A regarding such consideration are made subject to the Caution regarding forward-looking statements .\n- /bullet.ss01 In the normal course, we make changes to assumptions underlying all critical accounting estimates so that they reflect current economic conditions, updated historical information used to develop the assumptions, and changes in our credit ratings, where applicable. Unless indicated otherwise in the discussion below, we expect that no material changes in overall financial performance and financial statement line items would arise either from reasonably likely changes in material assumptions underlying the estimate or from selection of a different estimate from within a range of valid estimates.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our critical accounting estimates affect the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, and the Consolidated statements of financial position, as follows:\n\n## Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income\n\n| Consolidated statements of financial position   | Operating                  | Operating expenses             | Operating expenses          | Operating expenses   | Operating expenses                  |                  |                                                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                 | revenues and  other income | Goods and  services  purchased | Employee  benefits  expense | Depreciation         | Amortization  of intangible  assets | Financing  costs | Employee defined  benefit plans   re-measurements/one.numr |\n| Intangible assets, net, and Goodwill, net       |                            |                                |                             |                      | X/two.numr                          |                  |                                                            |\n| Employee defined benefit pension plans          |                            |                                | X                           | X/three.numr         | X/three.numr                        | X                | X                                                          |\n| Property, plant and equipment, net              |                            |                                |                             | X                    |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Provisions for asset retirement obligations     |                            | X                              |                             | X                    |                                     | X                |                                                            |\n| Provisions related to business combinations     | X                          |                                |                             |                      |                                     | X                |                                                            |\n| Investments                                     | X                          |                                |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Accounts receivable                             |                            | X                              |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Contract assets                                 | X                          | X                              |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Inventories                                     |                            | X                              |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n\n- 1 Other comprehensive income - Item never subsequently reclassified to income.\n- 2 Accounting estimate, as applicable to Intangible assets with indefinite lives relates to spectrum holdings.\n- 3 Accounting estimate impact due to internal labour capitalization rates.",

        "page_content": "- /bullet.ss01 All critical accounting estimates are uncertain at the time an estimate is made and affect the following Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income line items: Income taxes (except for estimates about Goodwill) and Net income. Similarly, all critical accounting estimates affect the following Consolidated statements of financial position line items: Current assets (Income and other taxes receivable), Current liabilities (Income and other taxes payable), Deferred income taxes and Common equity (retained earnings) and Non-controlling interests. The discussion of each critical accounting estimate does not differ between our two segments, TELUS technology solutions (TTech) and digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX), unless explicitly noted.\n\n## Intangible assets, net; Goodwill, net; and Property, plant and equipment, net\n\n## General\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The Intangible assets, net, line item represents approximately 36% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 (35% as at December 31, 2020). Included in Intangible assets are spectrum licences, which represent approximately 25% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 (23% as at December 31, 2020).\n- /bullet.ss01 The Goodwill, net, line item represents approximately 15% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 and approximately 17% of Total assets as at December 31, 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 The Property, plant and equipment, net, line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position represents approximately 33% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 and approximately 35% of Total assets as at December 31, 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 If our estimates of the useful lives of assets were incorrect and/or our estimates of the acquisition-date fair value of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets acquired in business combinations were incorrect, we could experience increased or decreased charges for amortization or depreciation in the future. If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to materially decrease, we could potentially experience future material impairment charges in respect of our Property, plant and equipment assets, Intangible assets or Goodwill. If Intangible assets with indefinite lives were determined to have finite lives at some point in the future, we could experience increased charges for amortization of Intangible assets. Such charges in and of themselves do not result in a cash outflow and would not immediately affect our liquidity.\n\n## The recoverability of Intangible assets with indefinite lives; the recoverability of Goodwill\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The carrying values of Intangible assets with indefinite lives and Goodwill are periodically tested for impairment, and this test represents a significant estimate for us.\n- /bullet.ss01 The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets have been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. There is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets, given the necessity of making key economic assumptions about the future. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation uses future cash flows and growth projections; associated economic risk assumptions and estimates of the likelihood of achieving key operating metrics and drivers; estimates of future generational infrastructure capital expenditures; and the future weighted average cost of capital.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 See Note 18(f) of the Consolidated financial statements for further discussion of methodology and sensitivity testing.\n\n## The estimated useful lives of assets; the recoverability of tangible assets\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The estimated useful lives of most assets are determined by a continuing program of asset life studies. The recoverability of assets with finite lives is significantly impacted by the estimated useful lives of assets.\n- /bullet.ss01 Assumptions underlying the estimated useful lives of assets include the timing of technological obsolescence, competitive pressures and future infrastructure utilization plans.\n\n## Employee defined benefit pension plans\n\nCertain actuarial and economic assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, accrued pension benefit obligations and pension plan assets\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We review industry practices, trends, economic conditions and data provided by actuaries when developing assumptions used in the determination of defined benefit pension costs and accrued pension benefit obligations. Pension plan assets are generally valued using market prices; however, some assets are valued using market estimates when market prices are not readily available. Actuarial support is obtained for interpolations of experience gains and losses that affect the employee defined benefit plan actuarial gains and losses and accrued pension benefit obligations. The discount rate used to determine the accrued benefit obligation is based upon the yield on long-term, high-quality, fixed-term investments. The discount rate is set annually at the end of each calendar year, at a minimum, based upon yields on long-term corporate bond indices in consultation with actuaries. Future increases in compensation are based upon the current benefits policies and economic forecasts. We have examined our respective pension obligation and current service cost durations and observed an approximate 10-year difference in duration. As individual discount rates more accurately reflect the obligation and current service cost, commencing in 2016, we applied a dual discount rate methodology.\n- /bullet.ss01 On an annual basis, at a minimum, the defined benefit pension plan assumptions are assessed and revised as appropriate. Assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, accrued pension benefit obligations and pension plan assets include life expectancy, discount rates, market estimates and rates of future compensation increases. Material changes in overall financial performance and financial statement line items would arise from reasonably likely changes in the material assumptions underlying this estimate, since certain assumptions may have been revised to reflect updated historical information and updated economic conditions. See Note 15 of the Consolidated financial statements for further analysis.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate related to employee defined benefit pension plans is in respect of components of the Operating expenses line item, Financing costs line item and Other comprehensive income line item on our Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. If the future were to adversely differ from our best estimate of assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, defined benefit obligations accrued and pension plan assets, we could experience future increased (or decreased) defined benefit pension expense, financing costs and charges to Other comprehensive income.",

Income tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of a position will result in the related benefit being realizable; however, this does not mean that tax authorities cannot challenge these positions. Income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount that is expected to be realized or incurred upon ultimate settlement with taxation authorities. Such assessments are based upon the applicable income tax legislation, regulations, interpretations and jurisprudence, all of which in turn are subject to change and interpretation.\n- /bullet.ss01 Current income tax assets and liabilities are estimated based upon the amount of income tax that is calculated as being owed to taxation authorities, net of periodic instalment payments. Deferred income tax liabilities are composed of the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as the income tax effect of undeducted income tax losses. The timing of the reversal of temporary differences is estimated and the income tax rate substantively enacted for the periods of reversal is applied to the temporary differences. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are based upon the amounts recorded in the financial statements and are, therefore, subject to accounting estimates that are inherent in those balances. The tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as the amount of undeducted income tax losses, is based upon the assessment and measurement of tax positions, as noted above. Assumptions as to the timing of reversal of temporary differences include expectations about the future results of operations and future cash flows. The composition of income tax liabilities is reasonably likely to change from period to period because of changes in the estimation of these significant uncertainties.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of material asset and liability line items on our Consolidated statements of financial position comprising less than 1% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and approximately 9% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2021 and 2020. If the future were to adversely differ from our best estimate of the likelihood of tax positions being sustained, the amount of tax expected to be incurred, the future results of operations, the timing of reversal of deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences, and the tax rates applicable to future years, we could experience material current income tax adjustments and deferred income tax adjustments. Such current and deferred income tax adjustments could result in an increase or acceleration of cash outflows at an earlier time than might otherwise be expected.\n\n## Provisions for asset retirement obligations\n\n## Certain economic assumptions used in provisioning for asset retirement obligations\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Asset retirement obligation provisions are recognized for statutory, contractual or legal obligations, normally when incurred, associated with the retirement of Property, plant and equipment (primarily certain items of outside plant and mobile site equipment) when those\n- obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation of the assets. The obligations are measured initially at fair value, determined using present value methodology, and the resulting costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying value of the related asset.\n- /bullet.ss01 On an annual basis, at a minimum, assumptions underlying the provisions for asset retirement obligations include expectations about inflation, discount rates and any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying future cash flows, which may span numerous decades. Material changes in financial position would arise from reasonably likely changes in the material assumptions underlying this estimate, since certain assumptions may have been revised to reflect updated historical information and updated economic conditions. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated on the same basis as the related asset, and the discount accretion is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of the asset retirement obligations component of the Provisions line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, and this component comprises approximately 1% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2021 (2% as at December 31, 2020). If the provisions for asset retirement obligations were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Goods and services purchased in the future. A charge for an inadequate asset retirement obligation provision would result in a cash outflow proximate to the time that the asset retirement obligation is satisfied.\n\n## Provisions related to business combinations\n\n## Provisions for written put options\n\n- /bullet.ss01 In connection with certain business acquisitions, we have established provisions for written put options in respect of non-controlling interests. We provide written put options to the remaining selling shareholders under which they could put the remaining non-controlling interests at, or after, a specified date. The acquisition-date fair values of the puttable shares held by the non-controlling shareholders are recorded as provisions.\n- /bullet.ss01 On an annual basis, at a minimum, the provisions for written put options are assessed and revised as appropriate. The provisions for written put options have been determined based on the net present values of estimated future earnings results; there is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of future earnings results, given the necessity of making significant economic assumptions about the future. The amounts of provisions for written put options are reasonably likely to change from period to period because of changes in the estimation of future earnings and foreign exchange rate movements.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of the provisions for written put options related to the non-controlling interests component of the Provisions line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, and this component comprises less than 1% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2021 and 2020. If the provisions for written put options were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Other income in the future. A charge for an inadequate written put option provision would result in a cash outflow proximate to the time that the written put option is exercised.",

The recoverability of investments is assessed on a specific-identification basis, taking into consideration expectations about future performance of the investments and comparison of historical results to past expectations.\n- /bullet.ss01 The most significant assumptions underlying the recoverability of long-term investments are related to the achievement of future cash flow and operating expectations. Our estimate of the recoverability of long-term investments could change from period to period due to the recurring nature of the recoverability assessment and due to the nature of long-term investments (we do not control the investees).\n- /bullet.ss01 Investments are included in the Other long-term assets line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which itself comprises approximately 4% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 (2020 - 3%). If the allowance for recoverability of long-term investments were to be inadequate, we could experience an increased charge to Other income or Other comprehensive income depending on the financial asset classification. Such a provision for recoverability of long-term investments does not result in a cash outflow.\n\n## Accounts receivable\n\n## General\n\n- /bullet.ss01 When determining our allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider the business area that gave rise to the Accounts receivable, conduct a statistical analysis of portfolio delinquency trends and perform specific account identification.\n- /bullet.ss01 These accounting estimates are in respect of the Accounts receivable line item and the Unbilled customer finance receivables line within the Other long-term assets line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which together comprise approximately 7% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 (6% as at December 31, 2020). If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimates of the fair value of the residual cash flows and the allowance for doubtful accounts, we could experience an increase in doubtful accounts expense in the future. Such doubtful accounts expense in and of itself does not result in a cash outflow.\n\n## The allowance for doubtful accounts\n\n- The estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts could materially change from period to period because the allowance is a function of the balance and composition of Accounts receivable, which can vary on a month-to-month basis. The variability of the balance of Accounts receivable arises from the variability of the amount and composition of Operating revenues and other income and from the variability of Accounts receivable collection performance. /bullet.ss01\n\n## Contract assets\n\n## General\n\n- We maintain allowances for lifetime expected credit losses related to contract assets. Current economic conditions, historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), and the line of business from which the contract asset arose are all considered when determining impairment allowances. The same factors are considered when determining whether to write off amounts charged to the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets. /bullet.ss01\n\n## The impairment allowance\n\n- These accounting estimates are in respect of the Contract assets line items on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which comprise approximately 2% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 and 2020. If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimates of the fair value of the residual cash flows and the impairment allowance for contract assets, we could experience an increase in the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets in the future. Such impairment allowance in and of itself does not result in a cash outflow. /bullet.ss01\n\n## Inventories\n\n## The allowance for inventory obsolescence\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We determine our allowance for inventory obsolescence based upon expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, and current and future expectations with respect to product offerings.\n- /bullet.ss01 Assumptions underlying the allowance for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends and offerings and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future offerings. Our estimate of the allowance for inventory obsolescence could change materially from period to period due to changes in product offerings and the level of consumer acceptance of those products.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of the Inventories line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which comprises approximately 1% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Mobile and data services continue to drive ongoing industry growth. Additionally, consumer communications and data consumption behaviours continue to demonstrate a strong preference for data-rich applications and data-intensive devices, including smartphones and tablets. However, this year and similar to 2020, revenue growth across the telecommunications industry was limited by the impacts of the global pandemic and in particular roaming revenue due to travel restrictions and changing consumer behaviour related to travelling.\n\nTELUS reported Operating revenues arising from contracts with customers of $16.8 billion, with TELUS technology solutions (TTech) representing 86% of our total Operating revenues arising from contracts with customers, while our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) operating segment represented the remaining 14%. Within TTech, mobile products and services represented 57% of total TTech external Operating revenues arising from contracts with customers. With respect to our fixed products and services, growth in internet and data services, health and agriculture services, home and business security, and TV, all inclusive of acquisitions, more than offset the decline in demand for legacy voice and legacy data services. Within DLCX, we saw strong growth across industry verticals driven by acquisitions, as well as robust organic growth from services provided to existing customers, as well as new clients added since the prior year. Revenue from our largest tech and games vertical increased by 50% from 2020 and represented 46% of DLCX Operating revenues and other income.\n\n## Mobile products and services\n\nWe estimate that in 2021, the Canadian mobile industry experienced mobile network revenue growth of approximately 2.7%, which we believe was attributable to ongoing growth and a general recovery after the first year of the pandemic. We estimate that the Canadian mobile industry added approximately 0.9 million net new subscribers in 2021 (inclusive of TELUS' mobile phone additions), compared to approximately 1.1 million in 2020 for the industry (inclusive of TELUS' mobile phone additions). This was supported by immigration and population growth; the trend toward multiple devices, including tablets; the expanding functionality of data and related applications; and the ongoing adoption of mobile devices and services, including connected devices. Various forms of public health measures during the global health crisis in 2020, including the temporary closure of retail stores, led to pent-up demand in 2021. We estimate that the mobile phone penetration rate increased to approximately 99% in Canada in 2021, with further increases in penetration expected in 2022. By comparison, the mobile phone penetration rate in the U.S. is well over 100%, while in Europe and Asia it is even\n\nhigher, suggesting an opportunity for continued growth in Canada. TELUS' mobile network revenue increased by 3.0%, and TELUS mobile products and services direct contribution increased by 5.4%.\n\nThe 2021 mobile market in Canada continued to face challenges from the pandemic. Growth in blended average revenue per subscriber unit per month (ARPU) had been moderating as carriers migrated their customer bases to unlimited data plans. However, ARPU moderation was exacerbated by the pandemic, as mobile industry roaming revenue significantly declined from customers' reduced travel activity, which has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, with large numbers of the workforce working from home during the pandemic, there were associated declines in chargeable data usage from workers offloading their mobile device traffic onto Wi-Fi. The Canadian mobile market continued to experience increased levels of competition nationally. This high level of competition has led to continued declines in chargeable data usage and larger allotments of data, in addition to other factors, such as: the popularity of data sharing plans; more frequent customer-friendly data usage notifications; and an evolving shift in the customer mix towards non-traditional mobile devices and tools such as video chats. These factors, combined with increases in overall data usage, which is expected to increase dramatically with the ongoing commercialization of 5G, led to widespread adoption and promotion of unlimited data plans and device financing plans by all national carriers. The build-out of 5G network infrastructure accelerated in 2021, with 5G covering approximately 70% of the Canadian population by the national carriers at the end of 2021. For TELUS, our accelerated 5G investments are underpinned by our accelerated broadband build program, which was pre-funded by our equity offering in March 2021 and will continue into 2022. Our long-standing commitment to network excellence is reflected in multiple independent third-party awards and recognition received in 2021, including from U.K.-based Opensignal and U.S.-based Ookla, each for five consecutive years, and from Canadian-based Tutela, for three years in a row.\n\nWe continue to work diligently to better monetize robust growth in data services, while simultaneously delivering a strong value-for-money proposition and leading customer service to our customers. To this end, we are focusing intensely on profitable customer growth and strong ARPU performance through our consistent strategic execution of premium smartphone loading, which includes driving higher-value data and share plan adoption, as well as flexible product offerings, including bundling our mobility and home services. Moreover, we are also focusing on the other levers available to us in an environment of moderating ARPU growth and expanding 5G network infrastructure, to ensure we continue to deliver on our TTech EBITDA growth objectives, including:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Evolving our approach to mobile plans and device sales, through the simultaneous launch of our Peace of Mind endless data rate plans, TELUS Easy Payment device financing and TELUS Family Discount offerings, which have resulted in simplification for both customers and team members, while supporting growth in digital transactions and improved recovery of handset costs\n- /bullet.ss01 Continuing to drive volume growth through high-quality loading on the back of strong ongoing industry growth\n- /bullet.ss01 Seeking new sources of wireless revenue, such as Internet of Things (IoT) or Internet of Everything, machine-to-machine (M2M) and",

Physical distancing requirements impacted traditional fixed installations, as installers were not entering customers' premises. Conversely, with large numbers of workers and students working and learning from home, demand for fixed products and services surged, with traffic levels reaching historic levels during the pandemic. Although the consumer high-speed internet market is maturing, with a penetration rate of approximately 89% in Western Canada and 90% across Canada at the end of 2021, subscriber growth is expected to continue over the coming years. The four major cable-TV companies had an estimated 7.37 million internet subscribers at the end of 2021 (49% market share), up 2.9% from approximately 7.17 million at the end of 2020. Meanwhile, telecommunications companies had approximately 7.56 million internet subscribers (50% market share), up 4% from approximately 7.25 million at the end of 2020. We continue to make gains in market share as a result of the ongoing expansion of our TELUS PureFibre infrastructure and the pull-through of subscribers from our IP-based TELUS TV services (Optik TV and Pik TV), including bundling of our mobility and home services, as well as significant growth in home security and automation. Our ongoing focus on fibre to the premises or home (FTTP/FTTH) has allowed us to connect 2.7 million households and businesses in B.C., Alberta and Eastern Quebec as of December 31, 2021 to our TELUS PureFibre technology. Similar to our accelerated 5G investments, our investments to expand our fibre footprint are supported by our accelerated broadband build program, which commenced in 2021 and will continue into 2022 before capital expenditures on a consolidated basis are expected to decline significantly in 2023. Additionally, we received recognition from PCMag as the fastest internet service provider (ISP) in Canada among major ISPs for the second consecutive year.\n\nWhile Canadians still watch conventional TV, digital platforms are playing an increasingly important role in the broadcasting industry and in respect of content. Popular online video services are providing Canadians with more choice about where, when and how to access video content. In 2021, Canadian IP TV providers increased their subscriber base by an estimated 4% to 3.2 million, or 32% of market share, up from 30% at the end of 2020, as a result of expanded network coverage, enhanced differentiated service and bundled offerings, and marketing and promotions focused on IP TV. Despite this IP TV growth, the combined cable-TV and satellite-TV subscriber penetration rate was unchanged. We estimate that the four major cable-TV companies\n\nhad approximately 4.7 million TV subscribers or a 48% market share at the end of 2021, flat compared to 48% at the end of 2020.\n\nIn recent years, three of the largest Canadian cable-TV companies have launched new TV services based on the Comcast X1 TV platform, including Shaw, Rogers and Quebecor's Videotron brand. Our IP-based Optik TV platform continues to offer numerous service advantages over this cable platform, including: flexible pricing plans and packaging available to all customers; picture clarity and quality; content depth and breadth; and the number of ways customers can access content, including wireless set-top boxes, Restart TV, higher-capacity PVR and the Optik TV app, which offers more than twice as many live TV channels at home or on the go compared to our largest Western Canadian cable competitor. The TELUS PureFibre network was named the number one network for streaming Netflix for 17 consecutive months prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (based on the Netflix ISP Speed Index rankings for Canadian providers released monthly, as of March 2020) and we are the only Canadian carrier to achieve the highest ratings for each month from August 2020 to December 2021 for the newly revamped index. We continue to offer more on-demand content and more over-the-top (OTT) content with Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video (included in the Amazon Prime membership), hayu, TED Talks and the National Film Board of\n\nCanada, and we are the multicultural content leader in Western Canada.\n\nThe national Canadian telecom providers continue to acquire and develop capabilities in home security and automation. Through various acquisitions, including ADT Security Services Canada, Inc., in 2019 and smaller tuck-ins in 2020, we have furthered our commitment to leverage the power of technology to bring state-of-the-art convenience, control and safety into the lives, homes and businesses of more Canadians to become Canada's leading security and home automation provider. Security also provides opportunities to offer attractive bundled solutions and advance our connected home strategy while accelerating our entry into the market for smart home and automation and physical and cybersecurity business solutions. Our SmartHome Security and TELUS Secure Business service offerings complement our industry-leading customer service and build on our strategy and commitment to leverage our world-leading wireless and PureFibre network, enabling us to enhance connected home, business, security, IoT, cybersecurity, smart buildings, smart cities and health services for customers in Canada.\n\nCanada's four major cable-TV companies had an estimated base of approximately 3.2 million telephony subscribers at the end of 2021. This represents a national consumer market share of approximately 43%, relatively flat compared to 2020. Telecommunications companies had an estimated 3.6 million telephony subscribers at the end of 2021, representing approximately 48% of market share, relatively flat compared to 2020. Technological substitution by mobile services is continuing to erode the number of residential voice subscribers and associated local and long distance revenues, as expected.\n\n## TELUS Health\n\nIn 2021, we continued to drive strong growth within our industry-leading health business, driven by the ongoing adoption of our unique and innovative portfolio of health offerings across the healthcare ecosystem. Health services revenue increased by 16.3% to $521 million. The Canadian healthcare industry is expected to continue to realize strong growth in future years, based on an aging population in Canada, an increasing emphasis on chronic disease management, and the potential benefits that technology can deliver in terms of efficiency and effectiveness within the sector. Prior to the pandemic, the healthcare industry saw an",

Since the COVID-19 lockdown measures were first put into place in 2020, adoption of healthcare technology has accelerated, as clinicians have adapted to primarily virtual and tele-medicine-based practices, resulting in the overall Canadian healthcare technology market growing at a double-digit pace and beyond what was initially predicted at the beginning of 2020. The digitization of everyday functions within the healthcare ecosystem, combined with increased and pervasive broadband network connectivity, provides a unique opportunity to support the development and delivery of even more advanced health applications to benefit Canadians and improve health outcomes.\n\n## TELUS Agriculture\n\nThe global agriculture industry and global food industry are estimated to be valued at approximately $2.5 trillion and $8 trillion, respectively (World Economic Forum). It is estimated that global food supplies will need to increase by as much as 70% over the next 30 years, simply to keep pace with the world's growing population. Subsequently, farmers are managing more acres, equipment and suppliers than ever before; and streamlined digital access to data insights and features can translate into significant time and cost savings. Increasingly, farmers and producers across the globe are leveraging digital technologies to efficiently manage their operations and harness valuable data insights to optimize production and output to take advantage of the growing industry and demand. TELUS continues to grow its position to transform the agriculture industry by targeting the pressing needs across the entirety of the agriculture value chain through our TELUS Agriculture business. Our unique and differentiated seed-to-table approach encompasses strong capabilities from agri-business, to food and beverage, to herd management and animal health.\n\n## DLCX\n\nIn 2021, TI continued to win business with both new and existing clients, driving solid organic growth, supported by strategic acquisitions (see Section 3 Scaling our innovative digital capabilities in TELUS International to build an asset of consequence for further details). TI partners with major global and disruptive brands, fuelling all stages of company growth. TI is also exposed to verticals that are experiencing high growth themselves, such as tech and games, enhancing TI's position for continued success. TI's solutions and services are relevant across multiple markets, including information technology services for digital transformation of customer experience systems (DX), digital customer experience management (DCXM) and adjacent new economy services. With its end-to-end digital capabilities, TI is uniquely well-positioned to serve these growing markets, including fast-growing areas such as content moderation and artificial intelligence (AI) data services. The necessity of moderating content on digital platforms has prompted enterprises to seek specialized services to accommodate changes in the dynamic, uncertain, and often highly regulated environment. The demand for AI data services historically has been driven by large technology companies; however, demand is growing from other enterprises as AI adoption increases.\n\n## 9/period.ss012 Te/l.ss08ecommun/i.ss01cat/i.ss01ons /i.ss01ndustry genera/l.ss08 out/l.ss08ook and trends\n\n## Mobile products and services\n\nMobile growth continues to be driven by increasing data usage and adoption, including: higher-value smartphones, unlimited data offerings, shared family data plans and tablets, and growth in IoT and M2M devices. In addition, consumers continue to replace fixed access with mobile access and related data services. These trends are expected to continue to drive a growing demand for mobile data services for the foreseeable future. Industry ARPU is expected to continue growing at a more moderate rate as compared to periods prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile LTE and LTE advanced (LTE-A) technologies increase download speeds, encourage data usage and improve the customer experience, growth in data traffic poses challenges to mobile access technology. To better manage this data traffic, Canadian providers continue to evolve their networks and deploy spectrum to support the evolution to 5G. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) held its 3500 MHz spectrum auction in June to July 2021. We expect the 3800 MHz and millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum auctions to commence in 2023 and 2024, respectively, which will be important to the expansion of 5G networks.\n\nM2M and IoT technologies connect communications-enabled remote devices via wireless technologies, allowing them to exchange key information and share processes. Advanced platforms and networks are already in place in industries such as healthcare, utilities, agriculture and fleet management, with deployment ongoing in other industries, including smart cities, vehicle insurance, retail, food services, consumer utilities, and connected and autonomous vehicles. These and other industries are looking to IoT, combined with other applications, to generate value from their connections. IoT represents a meaningful opportunity for growth in mobility products and services, with secure connectivity, customer value, productivity and efficiency. While M2M applications generally have lower ARPU when sold as a stand-alone product, they tend to generate high service volumes with low or no subsidy costs, thereby supporting both revenue growth and margins. In 2021, we added 338,000 connected devices, bringing our connected device subscriber base to more than 2.1 million, up 18.8% from 2020.\n\n5G has begun to play a mainstream role in technology evolution and innovation globally, and is an important component of meeting Canada's and TELUS' social impact-oriented efforts to further bridge the digital divide and connect rural Canadians. Investing in 5G will drive capital expenditure savings by allowing us to provide high-speed internet services over wireless in less urban areas, as well as improved cost savings and innovative services in industrial automation, transportation and telehealth. Driven by significantly faster speeds, lower latencies, improved reliability and attractive economics, 5G will enable a host of new applications: for businesses, 5G will create opportunities for enhanced productivity, virtual work and profitability; for industries, 5G will enable remote operations, industrial control and manufacturing automation; for consumers, home automation, autonomous vehicles, and wireless-to-the-home connectivity with speeds comparable to fixed access technologies; and for healthcare, converged solutions for hospitals, clinics and remote patient monitoring and even medical procedures. 5G is essential to the future of a global digital economy, including that of Canada's, and is expected to generate significant innovation, growth and productivity. 5G wireless technology is up to 100 times faster than",

        "page_content": "4G LTE technology. As 5G evolves, it will move from a non-stand-alone core, based on the existing 4G LTE infrastructure, to a stand-alone core, which makes use of cloud-based technology, enabling new functionality through the capacity to support more connected devices and ultralow latency.\n\nEnabling a robust and reliable 5G experience for Canadians will require complementary spectrum bands to support the needs of a diverse subscriber base and consist of a portfolio of low, mid and high-band spectrum. Low-band spectrum, such as 600 MHz, covers wide areas and penetrates well into buildings, thus improving coverage in urban and suburban areas. This low-band spectrum will play a vital role in bringing 5G to Canadians and as such, it is an important resource for Canada as wireless operators build out 5G in rural areas. High-band spectrum, such as mmWave, can enable speeds up to 100 times faster than 600 MHz spectrum; however, it does not have the same coverage characteristics to penetrate well into buildings or cover wide areas. This high-bandwidth spectrum and the associated faster connection speeds will help unlock new technologies such as virtual and augmented reality and provide a fibre-like experience for fixed wireless access. Mid-band spectrum, such as the 3500 MHz auctioned and acquired by carriers in 2021, is important to the 5G ecosystem as it balances both speed and coverage characteristics. This spectrum will be integral to low-latency communications services, including autonomous monitoring, fixed wireless access and vehicle-to-everything communication. Trials have shown 3500 MHz to be key for broader 5G coverage and is increasingly being used globally for 5G coverage. The 3500 MHz and 3800 MHz spectrum bands are globally recognized as key for 5G networks. All of the national carriers in Canada commenced rolling out their initial 5G services in 2020 and accelerated the roll-out in 2021, and are expected to continue in the years ahead as spectrum is auctioned and deployed, along with the roll-out of new 5G technologies. See Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings for further details on upcoming spectrum auctions.\n\n## Fixed products and services\n\nThe fixed telecommunications market is expected to remain very competitive in 2022, as technology substitution - such as the broad deployment of higher-speed internet; the use of email, messaging and social media as alternatives to voice services; and the growth of mobile and VoIP services - continues to replace higher-margin legacy voice revenues. In our incumbent operating areas of B.C. and Alberta, it is estimated that, in 2021, 60% of households no longer had a fixed line and 37% of households no longer had a broadcast TV service. We are a key provider of these substitution services and the decline in this legacy business is continuing as expected, although residential voice losses continued to slow in 2021, reflecting our success in bundling our home solutions and services. Our long-standing growth strategy remains focused on mobile, data and IP-centric fixed capabilities.\n\nThe popularity of viewing TV and on-demand content anywhere, particularly on handheld devices, is expected to continue to grow as customers adopt services that enable them to view content on multiple screens. Streaming media providers continue to enhance OTT and direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services in order to compete for a share of viewership, as viewing habits and consumer demand evolve. Studies suggest that there were more than 25 million paid OTT video service subscriptions in Canada at the end of 2021, up 9.0% from 2020. The launch of streaming TV services is expected to continue in Canada.\n\nConventional TV content providers are monitoring OTT developments and evolving their content and market strategy to compete with these\n\nnon-traditional offerings. Bell Media offers a content streaming service through its expanded Crave offering. We view OTT as an opportunity to add further capabilities to our linear and on-demand assets, providing customers with flexible options to choose the content they want and encourage greater customer use of TELUS high-speed internet and wireless services and to limit customer frustration by needing to have a multitude of subscriptions, and continue to partner with and offer services from a wide range of OTT providers.\n\nConsistent with facilities-based competition, telecommunications companies continue to make significant capital investments in broadband networks, with a focus on FTTP to maintain and enhance their ability to support enhanced IP-based services and higher broadband speeds. Cable-TV companies continue to evolve their cable networks with DOCSIS-related bandwidth enhancements and node splitting. Although this platform increases speed in the near term and is cost-efficient, it does not offer the same advanced capabilities as FTTP over the longer term, such as fast symmetrical upload and download speeds. At the end of 2021, our fibre-optic infrastructure was available to more than 2.7 million homes and businesses. Advances in LTE mobile technology and our extensive LTE infrastructure also allow us to target otherwise underserved areas with a fixed mobile solution, and 5G is expected to enhance these capabilities.\n\nOur broadband investments, including the build-out of our FTTP broadband network and our premium differentiated IP-based Optik TV service, as well as lower-cost Pik TV service, home security and automation and integrated bundled service offerings, which also encompass mobility, consumer healthcare and cybersecurity, continue to enhance our competitive position relative to our competitors. Our bundled offerings drive higher product intensity with our customers and lead to improved customer loyalty results.\n\nIn the business market (enterprise and small and medium-sized businesses, or SMB), the convergence of IT and telecommunications, facilitated by the ubiquity of IP, continues to shape the competitive environment, with non-traditional providers increasingly blurring the lines of competition and business models. Cable-TV companies continue to make investments to better compete in the highly contested SMB space. Telecommunications companies like TELUS are providing networkcentric managed applications that leverage their significant FTTP investments, while IT service providers are bundling network connectivity with their proprietary software as service offerings. While our business-to-business (B2B) line of business was dilutive to our EBITDA growth in 2020, we aggressively pursued opportunities in 2021 to stabilize this business; however, the pandemic continued to negatively impact our SMB customer base.\n\nThe development of IP-based platforms providing combined IP voice, data and video solutions creates potential cost efficiencies that compensate, in part, for the loss of margins resulting from the migration from legacy to IP-based services. New opportunities exist for integrated solutions, as well as business process and IT outsourcing, that could have a greater business impact than traditional telecommunications services. Data security represents both a challenge and an opportunity for TELUS to provide customers with our data security solutions. Increasingly, businesses are looking to partner with their communications service provider to address their business goals and challenges, and to tailor cloud-based solutions for their needs that leverage telecommunications in ways not imagined a decade ago. Cloud computing is changing service delivery to always-on and everything-as-a-service, and strong",

        "page_content": "growth is expected in this area. TELUS offers Network-as-a-Service capabilities for businesses with the option of an IT network as a service over the internet, mirrored across multiple locations, based on a self-serve platform that reduces deployment cycles and reliance on IT specialists. Our home and business security offerings are powered by our broadband network and integrate the latest smart devices to improve the lives of Canadians.\n\nAs the industry evolves to 5G mobile technologies in the coming years, we expect to be operating on, and providing services over, a more converged network. The lines between fixed access and mobile access will continue to blur, as the way we deliver services to customers - and the way our customers use those services - continues to evolve. As our broadband network continues to expand and 5G is further commercialized in the coming years, we expect to benefit from the flexibility of being able to select the most efficient way to deliver services across our footprint. We do not expect to have to build fibre to every home; instead, we believe that there will be opportunities to deliver services to some areas within our broadband footprint wirelessly with 5G.\n\n## TELUS Health\n\nThrough TELUS Health, we are leveraging our position as the leading end-to-end provider of digital healthcare in Canada and our expanding broadband network technologies such as fibre and 5G to increase access, integration and effectiveness of innovative healthcare tools and applications across the primary care ecosystem in order to continue positioning ourselves for anticipated strong continued growth. These solutions include virtual care applications, personal health records to empower self-management of healthcare data, electronic drug prescriptions with online insurance validation by the physician, and home health monitoring devices and data capture with caregiver oversight. Operating under TELUS Health Virtual Care, our national, employerfocused virtual care services allow patients 24/7 bilingual and unlimited access to healthcare practitioners for the mental and physical care they need, from anywhere in the country. In 2021, we enhanced our TELUS Health Virtual Care offering with the launch LifeJourney, a modernized employee assistance program designed to address various personal and employment-related issues that can compromise an employee's ability to perform at work, including mental health support. Our TELUS Health MyCare application revolutionized consumer access to healthcare. With innovative AI-powered preventative health app features (available in English and French) such as the Symptom Checker, Monitor and Health Check, users can get information about their health and, if required, speak directly with a licensed physician from the convenience of a smartphone, in multiple languages across B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. In 2020, TELUS Health MyCare also launched two physical clinics in B.C. to augment our digital first approach. Together, these virtual care solutions and capabilities are empowering Canadians to better manage their health and get the care and information they need when it's convenient for them - a huge step forward in the evolution of Canada's healthcare system and the current status quo. In 2020, TELUS Health enabled Canadian practitioners to conduct virtual visits with their patients by integrating patient videoconferencing into its electronic medical records (EMR) across Canada, and by the end of December 2021, more than 557,000 consultations had been conducted through the TELUS EMR Virtual Visit solution. This capability has been augmented by the acquisition of InputHealth Systems Inc. and its Collaborative Health Record (CHR) - a cloud-based solution that strengthens the physicianpatient relationship with a full suite of tools for collaboration, patient\n\nengagement, automation and data optimization. Since the onset of the pandemic, these virtual care solutions experienced accelerated adoption, easing pressure on the healthcare system, and strong growth in virtual care is expected to continue. Market activities and trends throughout the year have validated TELUS Health's long-standing presence in the healthcare market and assumptions about the business' main growth areas and path forward, reinforcing our focus on employee health and virtual care. In the first quarter of 2021, we acquired a digitally enabled central dispensing pharmacy to make the pharmacy experience more personal, convenient and accessible, as well as easier for users to manage, and in January 2022, we launched TELUS Health Virtual Pharmacy. In 2022 and beyond, aligned with our passionate commitment to social capitalism, TELUS Health will leverage these and other digital health tools to continue to expand access to care and improve health outcomes for Canadians across the country, with the ongoing commercialization of 5G expected to significantly bolster our capabilities with innovative new health care applications taking advantage of higher speeds and lower latency.\n\n## TELUS Agriculture\n\nWith the official launch of TELUS Agriculture in 2020, a business initially built on eight acquisitions throughout 2019 and 2020, we positioned ourselves to become a major global player in the promising and rapidly growing agriculture technology market. With the addition of two companies in 2021, Conservis and Blacksmith Applications, as well as acquiring the assets of Herdtrax, we continued our ongoing growth strategy. TELUS Agriculture is dedicated to creating the best producer-to-consumer outcomes. We deliver digital insights that empower and connect customers, from producers to consumers, around the world, improving the quality, safety, distribution and sustainability of food and consumer goods - both today and for the future. We also provide digitizing activities across a complex and fragmented supply chain to create actionable, integrated solutions. It is estimated that global food supplies will need to increase by as much as 70% over the next 30 years, simply to keep pace with the world's growing population. Increasingly, farmers and producers across the agriculture, food and consumer goods supply chains are leveraging digital technologies to efficiently manage their operations and harness valuable data insights to optimize production and output. With an ever-expanding world population, and increased demand for food and consumer goods, streamlined digital access to data insights and features can translate into significant resource, time and cost savings.\n\nTELUS has established meaningful digital technology and data insight positions in three key segments of the agriculture, food and consumer goods value chain: (i) agri-business, which enables the flow of business data between manufacturers such as farm machinery, seed and chemical suppliers, distributors, retailers and farms; as well as farm solutions, which enable precision agriculture and farm management; (ii) food, beverage and consumer goods, which enables food and consumer goods traceability from producer to consumer and aids efficient promotional activity across industry stakeholders such as food manufacturers, grocers, restaurants and consumers; and (iii) animal health, which supports the safe and efficient development of protein sources through technology and consultative expertise. We offer leading software solutions across the value chain and address complex data management challenges and data silos to digitally transform, protect and improve the global food system by improving the efficient production, transportation, quality and safety of our food and consumer goods.",

        "page_content": "## DLCX\n\nSince its inception 17 years ago, TI has grown exponentially in size, scope and geographic diversity to deliver digital customer experience solutions for clients from delivery centres in North and Central America, Europe and Asia. In recent years, TI added significant scale and diversity through the January 2020 acquisition of Competence Call Center (since rebranded as TELUS International Northern Europe or TINE and comprised substantially of CCC), a leading provider of higher-value-added business services with a focus on customer relationship management and content moderation. In December 2020, TI further advanced its digital transformation strategy with the acquisition of Lionbridge AI, a marketleading global provider of crowd-based training data and annotation platform solutions used in the development of AI algorithms to power machine learning. Lionbridge AI's advanced technology innovation, combined with human ingenuity, improves data functionality to deliver significantly enhanced, customized and high-quality outcomes for customers. In July 2021, TI acquired Playment, a leader in data annotation and computer vision tools and services specialized in 2D and 3D image, video and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Lionbridge AI and Playment now operate as TELUS International AI Data Solutions (TIAI), helping companies test and improve machine learning models through a global AI community of over one million data annotators and linguists. These acquisitions added substantial scale and diversity to TI, as its size, scope and reach grew to encompass over 62,000 highly engaged team members globally at the end of 2021. Armed with deeper end-to-end digital capabilities, TI now provides integrated solutions and services that span digital strategy, innovation, consulting and design, digital transformation and IT lifecycle solutions, data annotation and intelligent automation, and omnichannel CX solutions, including content moderation, trust and safety solutions and other managed solutions, with back-office support in almost 50 languages from 53 delivery locations across over 25 countries. Looking ahead, TI is extremely well-positioned to continue growing with and adding to its over 600 global clients. These clients span a number of high-growth target verticals, including tech and games, e-Commerce and fintech, communications and media, healthcare, and travel and hospitality. The clients TI serves are a diverse group that includes digital native technology companies that need help continuing to grow and scale their businesses, and also well-established companies that require help with their digital transformation strategy and execution. TI's continued focus on providing premium, complex, technologycentric solutions, thoughtfully executed by highly skilled, empathetic engaged team members, positions TI favourably for ongoing success in the growing market.\n\nIn February 2021, TI successfully completed its initial public offering (see Section 1.3 for additional details). In September 2021, TI successfully completed a public secondary offering (see Section 10.2 and Section 3 Scaling our innovative digital capabilities in TELUS International to build an asset of consequence for additional details), further positioning the organization for continued growth in the years to come.\n\nAs technology continues to change our industry rapidly, customer demand continues to evolve and grow, and Canada shifts to a more digital economy, we are committed to evolving our business and offering innovative and reliable services and thought leadership in core future growth areas that are complementary to our current operations. This, along with the constant focus of our highly engaged team on leadership in delivering an enhanced customer experience, over world-leading networks, positions us for continued differentiation and growth in the years ahead.\n\n## 9/period.ss013 TELUS assumpt/i.ss01ons for 2022\n\nIn 2022, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have impacts on our business, primarily in the first half of the year, attributable to economic factors such as continued travel advisories and border restrictions, business and consumer travel not yet at pre-pandemic levels, which continue to impact our roaming revenues, global supply chain challenges, subsequent business lockdowns and disruptions, including staffing shortages, and/or reduced scope of operations impacting our retail and health operations. We expect the pandemic impacts in 2022 to be smaller in scale than in 2021, primarily due to the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations in the general population, allowing for the re-opening of the global economy in areas where we conduct business. We expect growth in EBITDA, driven by continued demand for data in our mobile and fixed products and services and contributions from new business acquisitions; roaming revenue improvement corresponding with a reduction in pandemic restrictions; continued significant ongoing investments in our leading fibre broadband network and growing 5G deployment; our strategic efforts to enhance operational simplicity and efficiency; and our constant focus on an enhanced customer experience across all areas of our operations, with the objective of simplifying our customers' interaction with us while reducing our overall cost structure.\n\nOur assumptions in support of our 2022 outlook are generally based on industry analysis, including our estimates regarding economic and telecom industry growth, as well as our 2021 results and trends discussed in S ection 5 .\n\nOur key assumptions include the following:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Estimated economic growth rates in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec of 4.3%, 4.2%, 4.4%, 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively.\n- /bullet.ss01 Estimated annual unemployment rates in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec of 6.1%, 5.2%, 7.1%, 6.1% and 5.3%, respectively.\n- /bullet.ss01 Estimated annual rates of housing starts on an unadjusted basis in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec of 224,000 units, 39,000 units, 30,000 units, 83,000 units and 55,000 units, respectively.\n- /bullet.ss01 No material adverse regulatory rulings or government actions against TELUS.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued intense mobile products and services competition and fixed products and services competition in both consumer and business markets.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued increase in mobile phone industry penetration of the Canadian market.\n- /bullet.ss01 Ongoing subscriber adoption of, and upgrades to, data-intensive smartphones, as customers seek more mobile connectivity to the internet at faster speeds.\n- /bullet.ss01 Mobile products and services revenue growth resulting from improvements in subscriber loading, with continued competitive pressure on blended ARPU. Roaming revenue from business and consumer travel will improve from levels seen in 2021, with the easing of travel advisories and border restrictions, including those in Canada and the U.S. A full recovery is estimated closer to the end of 2022 at the earliest.\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued pressure on mobile products and services acquisition and retention expenses, arising from gross loading and customer renewal volumes, including potential impacts related to deferred device upgrades during the global health pandemic, competitive intensity and customer preferences.

These assumptions may ultimately prove to have been inaccurate. Events or our actual results may differ materially from expectations expressed in or implied by this outlook due to these assumptions having been incorrect or as a result of risks such as those described in detail in Section 10 Risks and risk management .\n\n## 9/period.ss014 Commun/i.ss01cat/i.ss01ons /i.ss01ndustry regu/l.ss08atory deve/l.ss08opments and proceed/i.ss01ngs\n\nOur telecommunications, broadcasting and radiocommunication services are regulated under federal laws by various authorities, including the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), ISED, Canadian Heritage and the Competition Bureau.\n\nThe following is a summary of certain significant regulatory developments and proceedings relevant to our business and our industry. This summary is not intended to be a comprehensive legal analysis or description of all of the specific issues described. Although we have indicated those issues for which we do not currently expect the outcome of a development or proceeding to be material to us, there can be no assurance that the expected outcome will occur or that our current assessment of its likely impact on us will be accurate. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\n## Radiocommunication licences and spectrum-related matters\n\nISED regulates, among other matters, the allocation and use of radio spectrum in Canada and licenses radio apparatus, frequency bands and/ or radio channels within various frequency bands to service providers and private users. The department also establishes the terms and conditions that may attach to such radio authorizations, including restrictions on licence transfers, coverage obligations, research and development obligations, annual reporting, and obligations concerning mandated roaming and antenna site sharing with competitors.\n\n## 3500 MHz spectrum auction to support 5G\n\nOn July 29, 2021, ISED released the provisional results of its auction of spectrum in the 3500 MHz band. We acquired 142 licences equating to 16.4 MHz of spectrum at a price of approximately $1.95 billion. Combined with the spectrum we acquired privately in advance of the auction, we now hold an average of 25 MHz of spectrum in the 3500 MHz band nationally. The auction framework included a 50 MHz set-aside in all markets where 50 MHz or more spectrum was available. This was on top of the competitive imbalance that was already introduced by ISED's 2019 transition decision for the band. That decision left nearly 90 MHz of the 200 MHz band in the hands of band incumbents.\n\nOn August 26, 2021, we brought an application in Federal Court for judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry to permit Videotron to bid on set-aside blocks of spectrum in B.C., Alberta and Manitoba in the 3500 MHz auction. In the application, we argue that Videotron did not meet the eligibility test set out by ISED in the auction framework, and thus should not have been permitted to bid on a portion of the set-aside spectrum that it eventually won. Bell has also brought a similar application. Additionally, on September 21, 2021,",

        "page_content": "we brought a motion for an interim order enjoining the Minister from releasing the impugned spectrum to Videotron until our application for judicial review is decided. Our motion for an injunction was dismissed on October 22, 2021. Our application for judicial review is scheduled to be heard in February 2022.\n\nWe continue to review the results of the auction, including the amounts acquired by our competitors, to determine the impact of the auction on us.\n\n## Consultation on amendments to SRSP-520, Technical requirements for fixed and/or mobile systems, including flexible use broadband systems, in the band 3450-3650 MHz\n\nIn August 2021, ISED issued a consultation on Standard Radio System Plan (SRSP) 520 to examine technical specifications on the use of 3500 MHz spectrum. In the consultation, ISED identified a concern that 5G equipment operating on 3500 MHz spectrum may have the potential to cause interference with altimeters on aircraft. ISED proposed new restrictions on 3500 MHz spectrum, including a ban on its use in large areas around major airports. Though the consultation closed in August 2021, on September 22, 2021, ISED announced that it was re-opening its consultation to give additional time for parties to comment and made public technical studies that it relied upon to formulate its proposals. ISED also notified prospective 3500 MHz licensees that their final auction payments and issuance of licences, originally scheduled for October 4, 2021, would be delayed until December 17, 2021. On November 18, 2021, ISED issued its decision on amendments to the 3500 MHz technical requirements, which remain effectively as proposed; limiting use in areas around major airports and restricting the transmission of energy above the horizon. ISED projected next steps including a future consultation, should Canadian or global developments and studies merit further changes to the technical rules as it relates to the radio altimeter protection issue. There is a risk that this decision could have a material impact on TELUS depending on how long they remain in application.\n\n## mmWave and 3800 MHz spectrum auctions to support 5G\n\nOn June 5, 2019, ISED released its Decision on Releasing Millimetre Wave Spectrum to Support 5G , repurposing several tranches of mmWave spectrum for mobile use. ISED will consult on a licensing framework (i.e., auction rules and conditions of licence) for these mmWave bands in the future. ISED formerly projected that the mmWave auction would commence in 2021, but has now revised its forecast to the first quarter of 2024. There is a risk that the auction rules may favour certain carriers over us and impact our ability to acquire an adequate quantity of mmWave spectrum.\n\nThe 3800 MHz spectrum band is seen as an extension to the 3500 MHz band. ISED released the first of two consultations on August 27, 2020. This first consultation featured proposals from ISED and from Telesat, the Canadian satellite spectrum licensee of 3700 to 4200 MHz spectrum, on how to repurpose existing spectrum. On May 21, 2021, ISED released its Decision on the Technical and Policy Framework for the 3650-4200 MHz Band and Changes to the Frequency Allocation of the 3500-3650 MHz Band , which will make 250 MHz of spectrum available for auction in the first quarter of 2023. ISED's decision rejects Telesat's proposal for private auction and early clearing of the band. The 3800 MHz spectrum will only be cleared and available by March 2025 in urban areas and March 2027 in many rural areas. Certain rural areas (in the territories and northern parts of B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador) are still\n\ndeemed satellite-dependent areas and this spectrum will not be\n\navailable for mobile use in these areas. Many important issues (such as auction format or competitive measures) are subject to the second consultation on an auction framework for the 3800 MHz band. There is a risk that the auction rules will favour certain carriers over us and impact our ability to acquire an adequate quantity of 3800 MHz\n\nband spectrum.\n\n## Regulatory and federal government reviews\n\nThe CRTC and the federal government have initiated public proceedings to review various matters. A number of key proceedings are discussed below.\n\n## Proposed acquisition of Shaw by Rogers\n\nIn March 2021, Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc. announced their agreement for Rogers Communications Inc. to acquire Shaw Communications Inc. In addition to approval by shareholders of Shaw Communications Inc., the acquisition will require approvals by the Competition Bureau, the CRTC and ISED. It is possible that the parties to the transaction will agree to merger remedies that could negatively affect us, or that the CRTC, ISED or other governmental authorities could make (or decline to make) other regulatory changes, or impose behavioural remedies, that could materially affect us directly or affect the industry as a whole. It is also possible that this acquisition could trigger further consolidation in the industry. Until the governmental authorities complete their reviews and make a determination on whether to allow the acquisition and, if so, under what conditions, it is too early to determine the impact of these reviews on us.\n\n## Review of mobile wireless services\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the CRTC released its decision in the Wireless Regulatory Framework Review . The CRTC determined that Bell, Rogers, TELUS and SaskTel must provide wholesale mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) access to facilities-based regional wireless providers in areas where those providers hold a mobile wireless spectrum licence. MVNO access is based on commercially negotiated rates and will be phased out after seven years. In addition, the CRTC has requested that Bell, Rogers, TELUS and SaskTel provide certain low-cost and occasional-use plans, which we have now implemented. We are working to implement the new MVNO and other requirements. The impact of this decision on us will be dependent on the commercial rates that are negotiated for MVNO access.\n\nOn May 4, 2021, Data on Tap Inc. brought a petition to the Governor in Council to vary the CRTC's decision in the Wireless Regulatory Framework so as to mandate and set rates for full MVNO access. On September 22, 2021, we filed our response opposing this petition. The impact of this petition will not be known unless and until the Governor in Council issues a decision. The Governor in Council has until April 14, 2022, to do so.\n\nWe have also been granted leave to appeal two determinations from this decision to the Federal Court of Appeal: (i) the requirement for the national mobile carriers, including us, to offer seamless roaming as an additional condition under which the existing mandated wholesale roaming service must be offered; and (ii) the ruling that sections 43 and 44 of the Telecommunications Act do not provide the CRTC with jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving mobile wireless transmission facilities. If we are successful on appeal, we anticipate it will be easier for us to deploy our 5G infrastructure, in particular on municipal property.",

        "page_content": "## Wireline wholesale services follow-up\n\nOn July 22, 2015, the CRTC released Review of wholesale wireline services and associated policies , Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-326 (TRP 2015-326). The major component of this decision was that the CRTC ordered the introduction of a disaggregated wholesale high-speed access (HSA) service for ISP competitors. This includes access to FTTP facilities.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, the CRTC released Call for comments - Appropriate network configuration for disaggregated wholesale high-speed access services , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-187 (TNC 2020-187), where it is examining the appropriate network and service configurations for the disaggregated wholesale HSA service regime for all wholesale HSA service providers across the country. This process, which took the place of the previous follow-up proceedings, is now closed. Until the CRTC issues its decision, it is too early to determine the impact of this proceeding on us.\n\n## Final rates for aggregated wholesale internet access services\n\nOn August 15, 2019, the CRTC released Telecom Order CRTC 2019-288, which finalized rates for the aggregated wholesale internet services of the ILEC and incumbent cable companies. The final rates were considerably lower than the interim rates, and the CRTC ordered the rates to apply retroactively to October 6, 2016. The financial impact of this decision was not material to us.\n\nOn September 13, 2019, Bell Canada and affiliated companies and a group of cable companies filed separate applications with the Federal Court of Appeal to seek leave to appeal Telecom Order CRTC 2019-288. Bell Canada and the cable companies also sought a stay of the order. On November 22, 2019, the Federal Court of Appeal allowed both leave applications and granted a stay pending the disposition of the appeal. On September 10, 2020, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals on their merits, thereby upholding the CRTC's decision. On February 25, 2021, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed applications for leave to appeal the Federal Court of Appeal decision brought by Bell Canada and the group of cable companies.\n\nSeparately, on November 13, 2019, we filed a petition to the Governor in Council seeking to refer back to Telecom Order CRTC 2019-288 for redetermination of the rates and seeking to vary Telecom Order CRTC 2019-288 on the basis that the rates and retroactive component of the order will threaten future investment. Bell Canada and a group of cable companies filed similar petitions on the same day. On August 15, 2020, the Governor in Council issued an Order in Council dismissing the petitions. However, the Order in Council, as well as an accompanying statement from the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, recognized that the rates set out in Telecom Order CRTC 2019-288 would, in some instances, undermine investment in high-quality networks.\n\nOn May 27, 2021, following separate applications requesting the CRTC to review and vary Telecom Order 2019-288 filed by each of TELUS, Bell Canada and a group of cable carriers, the CRTC issued Telecom Decision CRTC 2021-181. In this decision, the CRTC largely reversed Telecom Order 2019-288, meaning that we do not have to implement the rates ordered in Telecom Order CRTC 2019-288 or issue significant retroactive refunds to wholesale customers. Given that Telecom Decision 2021-181 essentially maintains the rates that have been in place since 2016, the decision does not have a material effect on us.\n\nOn May 28, 2021, TekSavvy Solutions Inc. brought a petition to the Governor in Council to vary the decision. On July 15, 2021, the\n\nCompetitive Network Operators of Canada brought a similar petition. On August 25, 2021, National Capital Freenet Inc. also filed a petition to the Governor in Council. On June 28, 2021, TekSavvy Solutions Inc. sought leave to appeal Telecom Decision CRTC 2021-181 to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal on September 15, 2021. We are not filing responding submissions in the petitions or the appeal.\n\n## 5G security review - Public Safety Canada\n\nIn September 2018, the federal government announced a review of national cybersecurity requirements for Canada's 5G networks. The stated objective of the reviews was to provide policy clarity on what security controls or restrictions the government intends to impose on 5G networks in Canada and to which foreign vendors such controls and restrictions would apply. The timelines for the conclusion of this review were never released by the federal government, which has also not announced its intentions regarding 5G cybersecurity requirements. Following the September 20, 2021 federal election, on September 28, 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated: 'We will look forward to sharing a decision on many different issues, including telecommunications and Huawei, in the coming weeks,' indicating that the government is still weighing some decisions, but is nearing a final decision. Given the range of potential government or regulatory action that may result from this review, the impact on us, and on Canadian mobile service providers in general, cannot be reliably predicted.\n\n## International security developments\n\nOn May 16, 2019, an executive order entered into force permitting the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to block certain technology transactions deemed to constitute national security risks. The U.S. Department of Commerce subsequently established a list of entities, including Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and its global affiliates, to whom the export, re-export or transfer (in-country) of certain restricted technologies was prohibited unless specifically authorized under licence.\n\nIn a unanimous vote on July 13, 2021, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission authorized a US$1.9 billion subsidy program to enable telecommunications companies with fewer than 10 million subscribers to replace Huawei and ZTE equipment.\n\nGiven the range of potential government or regulatory actions by foreign governments with respect to Huawei, the impact on us, and on Canadian mobile service providers generally, cannot currently be predicted.\n\n## CRTC proceeding regarding potential barriers to the deployment\n\nof broadband-capable networks in underserved areas in Canada On December 10, 2019, the CRTC issued Call for comments regarding potential barriers to the deployment of broadband-capable networks in underserved areas in Canada , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2019-406. In this proceeding, the CRTC sought comment on barriers that service providers and communities face in building new facilities, or interconnecting to or accessing existing facilities, and in extending networks into underserved areas in order to offer universal service objective-level services. The CRTC has specifically identified access to affordable transport services and efficient use of support structures as potential barriers. The record of the proceeding is now closed and we anticipate a decision in early 2022. It is too early to determine the impact of the proceeding on us.",

        "page_content": "## CRTC proceeding regarding access to poles owned by Canadian carriers\n\nOn October 30, 2020, the CRTC issued Call for comments regarding potential regulatory measures to make access to poles owned by Canadian carriers more efficient , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-366. The CRTC commenced the proceeding further to comments in the proceeding initiated by Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2019-406 that untimely and costly access to poles owned by Canadian carriers has negative impacts on broadband deployment, particularly in areas with limited or no access to broadband-capable networks. In the most recent proceeding, the CRTC is considering, among other issues, authorization delays, make-ready costs, spare capacity reservations, joint use agreements and the potential for improved dispute resolution. We are participating fully in the proceeding. It is too early to determine the impact of the proceeding on us.\n\n## Government mobile wireless pricing election commitment\n\nAhead of the 2019 federal election, the Liberal Party of Canada made a commitment to reduce wireless prices by 25%. On March 5, 2020, the Liberal government clarified its expectation that we, Bell, and Rogers (including flanker brands) lower mobile prices for postpaid, bring-yourown-device plans in the 2 to 6 GB range by 25% over a two-year period. To track progress, the government is reporting quarterly on wireless pricing. Although the required price reductions were reported as met in the latest quarterly report which covered the period from October to December 2021, the two-year period to reduce wireless prices is due to end in March 2022, following the initial announcement made in March 2020 to track wireless prices. In light of the fact that the two-year reporting period continues and the government's statement that wireless services are still too expensive, we are unable to determine the full impact of this commitment at this time. The announcement or implementation of specific regulations or other actions intended to reduce cell phone plan prices could precipitate a material reduction in operating expenditures and capital expenditures to ameliorate this impact.\n\n## CRTC review of rate setting for wholesale telecommunications services\n\nOn April 24, 2020, the CRTC issued Call for comments - Review of the approach to rate setting for wholesale telecommunications services , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-131. In this proceeding, the CRTC is seeking comment on whether to change its methodology of setting wholesale rates and, if so, how. The CRTC has stated its intent to use the proceeding to establish a more transparent and efficient ratesetting process. We are participating fully in all stages of the proceeding. It is too early to determine the impact of the proceeding on us.\n\n## CRTC review of deadlines for transition to next-generation 9-1-1 service\n\nOn June 14, 2021, the CRTC issued Telecom Decision CRTC 2021-199, Establishment of new deadlines for Canada's transition to next-generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1), where the CRTC stipulated revised implementation for NG9-1-1 service in Canada. The CRTC directed NG9-1-1 network providers, including us, to establish their NG9-1-1 networks, complete all NG9-1-1 production onboarding activities, and be ready to provide NG9-1-1 voice service by transiting live NG9-1-1 traffic, wherever public safety answering points have been established in a particular region, by March 1, 2022. We will work to comply with the directives from this decision, including our recent application proposing to introduce NG9-1-1 and the associated service agreements filed on November 1, 2021. The impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.\n\n## Amendments to Quebec's public and private sector privacy law\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the Quebec National Assembly passed , which received assent the same day. Extensive new requirements governing the collection, use and disclosure of the personal\n\nAn Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information information of individuals in Quebec will be phased in over three years. The Act also creates a new enforcement regime with significant criminal fines and administrative monetary penalties for certain infractions and a private right of action with minimum statutory punitive damages. The full impact of the Act is not yet known because some key provisions, such as those relating to AI, have to be further elaborated through government regulations and interpretive guidance from the regulator. The materiality of the change cannot be fully assessed at this time.\n\n## Proposed subsidy increases for Northwestel\n\nOn November 2, 2020, the CRTC initiated a review of its regulatory framework for Northwestel Inc. and the state of telecommunications services in Canada's North in Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-367. On January 20, 2021, a number of interveners proposed large subsidy increases to Northwestel and other companies providing service in the North. The proceeding is ongoing. The impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.\n\n## Broadcasting-related issues\n\n## Review of the Telecommunications Act, the Radiocommunication Act and the Broadcasting Act\n\nOn January 29, 2020, the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel released its final report entitled Canada's Communications Future: Time to Act . The report contains 97 recommendations to update legislation governing broadcasting, telecommunications and radiocommunication for the Government of Canada to consider. Further to the report, on November 3, 2020, the government introduced legislation to amend the Broadcasting Act . Bill C-10 would have: brought streaming services that operate over the internet expressly within the scope of the Broadcasting Act ; provided the CRTC with new and expanded regulatory powers to implement a modernized regulatory framework that addresses declining levels of support for Canadian content over the past several years; and provided a more sustainable source of support going forward. On June 21, 2021, Bill C-10 passed third reading at the House of Commons, but its debate in the Senate was cut short upon the proroguing of parliament and the calling of the federal election. On September 20, 2021, the Liberals were re-elected with a minority government, and may either attempt to reinstate Bill C-10 to the progress it had reached under the previous session, or alternatively, introduce a new bill to reform the Broadcasting Act and the entire legislative review process would start anew. It is too early to determine if proposed amendments, as well as any other potential legislative changes arising as a result of the report, will have a material impact on us.\n\n## Review of the Copyright Act and Copyright Board reforms\n\nThe Copyright Act 's statutorily mandated five-year review was due in 2017, and a process for conducting the review via parliamentary committee was announced in December 2017. The House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, with the assistance of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, completed the review early in 2019, and both committees presented reports to the House of Commons in May and June of 2019.",

        "page_content": "To date, no legislation has been proposed as a result of the parliamentary review, although it has led to further government consultations to explore specific issues raised during the review, such as how to modernize the copyright framework for online intermediary liability, AI and IoT. The timeline for potential changes to the Copyright Act is uncertain, although government officials have signaled that copyright reform legislation may be tabled in early 2022. The policy approach for copyright has traditionally been based on a balance of interests of creators and consumers, and as a result, the impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.\n\nOn April 14, 2021, ISED announced the launch of a consultation to modernize the copyright framework for online intermediaries. The consultation builds on the work done in 2018 and 2019 as part of the parliamentary review of the Copyright Act . ISED has sought comments on a broad range of issues, including the role of intermediaries in policing online copyright infringement, how to remunerate rights holders for the use of their content on online platforms, and what types of enforcement tools (such as website-blocking orders) should be available against intermediaries. We participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on May 31, 2021. Among other things, the comments advocated for a continuation of existing government policy that provides ISPs with unconditional safe harbour protection for the potentially infringing activities of their customers. It is too early to tell whether this consultation will have a material impact on us.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, the government announced a consultation to modernize the copyright framework applicable to AI and IoT. The government's objectives were to support innovation and investment in AI and other digital and emerging technologies, support Canada's cultural industries and preserve the incentive to create and invest provided by the economic rights set out in the Act, and support competition and marketplace needs regarding IoT devices and other software-enabled products. We participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on September 17, 2021. Among other things, the joint comments advocated that no changes should be made to the Copyright Act that would unduly burden or create potential liability risks for ISPs. Similar to the broader Copyright Act review, the impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.\n\n## Legal challenge to the CRTC's ability to regulate affiliation agreements\n\nThe CRTC's ability to regulate affiliation agreements between broadcasting distributors and programming services was challenged by a vertically integrated broadcasting entity before the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court of Appeal heard the case on May 18, 2021, and released its decision on July 28, 2021. We were granted leave to intervene in the case and appeared at the hearing, where we defended the CRTC's jurisdiction. The Federal Court of Appeal's decision confirmed that the CRTC has jurisdiction to govern economic aspects of disputes between programming services and distributors, and generally supported our competitive position by reinforcing the validity of competitive safeguards put in place by the CRTC to protect non-vertically integrated companies in the broadcasting sector. On September 29, 2021, the vertically integrated company filed an application for leave to appeal the Federal Court of Appeal's decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. On November 25, 2021, we filed a response opposing the application for leave to appeal. It is too early to determine the impact this application for leave to appeal might have on our broadcasting distribution activities.\n\n## Consultation on the government's proposed approach to address harmful content online\n\nOn July 29, 2021, the government launched a consultation on its proposed approach to address harmful content online. The government's proposals largely target social media and content platforms, but a few proposals would also have impacted ISPs. Accordingly, we participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on September 25, 2021. Among other things, the joint comments advocated that the legal framework for addressing harmful online content should not create undue obligations or liability for telecommunications carriers, and that requirements to block access to content online or to provide subscriber information should continue to require judicial orders. The impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.",

Risk oversight and management processes are integral elements of our risk governance and strategic planning practices.\n\n## Risk governance, oversight and culture\n\nWe maintain strong risk governance and oversight practices, with risk oversight responsibilities outlined in the policy manual for our Board of Directors (Board). Our Board is responsible for ensuring that material risks to our business are identified, and for overseeing the implementation of systems and processes that effectively identify, monitor and manage material risks.\n\nOur risk governance culture starts with clear risk management leadership and transparent communications, supported by our Board and Executive Team. In our approach to risk governance, accountability for the management of risks and reporting of risk information is clearly defined. Training and awareness programs, appropriate resources and risk champions help to ensure that we have the risk management competencies necessary to support effective decision-making across the organization. Ethics are integral to our risk governance culture, and our code of ethics and conduct directs team members to meet the highest standards of integrity in all business decisions and actions.\n\n## Responsibilities for risk management\n\nWe take a multi-step approach to managing risks, sharing responsibility across the organization and recognizing that agile and effective risk management is integral to the achievement of our strategic and operational objectives. The first line of assurance is executive and operating management, and these team members are expected to integrate risk management into core decision-making processes (including strategic planning processes) and day-to-day operations. We have risk management and compliance functions across the organization, in areas that include Finance, Legal, Data and Trust (which includes Privacy), Security and other business operational areas, and these form the second line of assurance. These teams establish policies, provide guidance and expertise, and work collaboratively with management to monitor the design and operation of controls. Internal Audit is the third line of assurance, providing independent assessments of the effectiveness and efficiency of risk management and controls across all areas of our business.\n\n## Risk and control assessment process\n\nEvents within and outside of TELUS present us with both risks and opportunities. We strive to avoid taking on undue risk and we work to ensure alignment of risks with business strategies, objectives, values and risk tolerances; we also seek to take advantage of opportunities that may emerge and, in so doing, consider the impacts of our decisions on our multiple stakeholders. We strive to proactively mitigate our risk exposures through performance planning, operational management and risk response strategies, which can include mitigating, transferring, retaining and/or avoiding risks.\n\nTELUS enterpr/i.ss01se r/i.ss01sk governance and management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have in place multi-level enterprise risk and control assessment processes that solicit and incorporate insights from leaders across all areas of TELUS and enable us to track multi-year trends in key risks and the control environment. A comprehensive annual risk and control assessment is conducted with leaders and an annual assessment is completed by Board members to provide perspective on key enterprise risks. Results of the assessments are shared with senior management, our Board of Directors and Audit Committee, and inform the development of our risk-focused internal audit program. These risk assessments are also incorporated into our strategic planning, operational risk management and performance management processes. In addition, key enterprise risks are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to capture and communicate any changes, and detailed risk assessments are conducted for various risk management, strategic and operational initiatives throughout the year.\n\n## 10/period.ss012 Pr/i.ss01nc/i.ss01pa/l.ss08 r/i.ss01sks and uncerta/i.ss01nt/i.ss01es\n\nThis section describes our principal risks and uncertainties.

        "page_content": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the novel coronavirus associated with COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. Due to the wide range of possible COVID-19 pandemic outcomes and the uncertainty with regard to the duration and impact of the pandemic, government policies implemented to limit its spread and the ongoing development and distribution of effective vaccines and treatments, we cannot accurately forecast the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future operations, financial performance, financial position or cash flows. Throughout 2021, successive waves of the pandemic continued to have a material impact on our customers and on our business. Restrictions on travel continued to reduce our revenue from mobile roaming and lockdowns have led to decreased foot traffic which has impacted loading across in-person channels. Our global operations have also been impacted depending on the geographical regions where we and our customers operate, and other international, regional and local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, temporary site closures enforced across our delivery sites. In response, we have made significant investments to adapt to these challenges, ensuring that our workforce is equipped to be flexible when restrictions are imposed. While high vaccination rates have enabled the reopening of many areas of the economy, successive waves of COVID-19 cases have resulted in restrictions being introduced and continue to affect customer behaviour, for example by driving a demand for online shopping.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our customers, suppliers and vendors, our team members and our communities, and this has led to changes in our business and operations, including the levels of demand for, and supply of, the products and services that we offer and the channels through which we offer them. Risks and uncertainties that could affect our business results and the market prices of our debt and equity securities, including those of our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary, and that could also be heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic or by any future pandemic or similar event include, but are not limited to, the risks described in Section 10 .\n\nAlthough we believe the measures we take to identify and mitigate risks are reasonable, there can be no expectation or assurance that they will effectively mitigate or fully address the risks described, or that new developments and risks will not materially affect our operations or financial results. Despite our efforts to implement controls in our domestic and international operations, there can be no assurance that these controls will prove to be effective in all instances. Forward-looking statements in this section and elsewhere in this MD&A are based on the assumption that our risk mitigation measures and controls will be effective.

        "page_content": "## 10/period.ss013 /R.ss04egu/l.ss08atory matters\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nThe regulatory regime under which we operate, including the laws, regulations, and decisions in regulatory proceedings and court cases, reviews, appeals, policy announcements and other developments, such as those described in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings , imposes conditions on the products and services that we provide and the ways in which we provide them. The regulatory regime sets forth, among other matters, rates, terms and conditions for the provision of telecommunications services, licensing of broadcast services, licensing of spectrum and radio apparatus, and restrictions on ownership and control by non-Canadians.\n\nThe allocation and use of spectrum in Canada are governed by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), which establishes spectrum policies, determines spectrum auction frameworks, issues licences and sets radio authorization conditions.\n\nCanadian ownership and control requirements, including restrictions on the ownership of the common shares of TELUS Corporation (Common Shares) by non-Canadians, are imposed by the Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations under the Telecommunications Act (collectively, the Telecommunications Regulations) and the Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) , as ordered by the Governor in Council pursuant to the Broadcasting Act (the Broadcasting Direction).\n\nWith our Internet of Things (IoT), business, health, agriculture and international footprint, our operations must also comply with the laws, regulations and decisions in effect in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These jurisdictions, as well as the contracts that we enter into (particularly those of our TI and TELUS Agriculture subsidiaries), require us to comply with, or facilitate our customers' and clients' compliance with, numerous complex and sometimes conflicting legal regimes, both domestically and internationally. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including anti-corruption, internal financial control and disclosure obligations, data privacy and protection, wages-and-hours-of-work standards, employment and labour relations, trade protections and restrictions, import and export control, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, usergenerated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, team member and third-party complaints, telemarketing regulations, telephone consumer regulations, government affairs and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. Our customers and clients are also located around the world, and the laws and regulations that apply include, among others, U.S. federal laws and regulations; state laws on third-party administration services, utilization review services, data privacy and protection telemarketing services; and state laws on debt collection in the United States, collectively enforced by numerous federal and state government agencies and attorneys general; as well as similar consumer protection laws in other countries in which our international subsidiaries' clients are based. Failure to provide services in a manner that complies with any such requirements could result in breaches of contracts with our international subsidiaries' clients. The application of these laws and regulations to our international subsidiaries' clients is often unclear, and laws and regulations of different jurisdictions may at times conflict. The global nature of our operations increases the difficulty of compliance. For example, in many foreign countries, particularly in\n\nthose with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us or our international subsidiaries' clients, including Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . We cannot provide assurance that our international subsidiaries' clients or their customers will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or Canadian or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be further challenged by the shift to remote working arrangements that was initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to continue in the near term. For example, payment card industry and Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act guidance is evolving in light of these remote working arrangements globally, and thus there is uncertainty over additional costs and our ability to comply with these evolving standards.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and entered into new areas in the health sector, including virtual care and digital pharmacy services, that are highly regulated and that also involve risk related to the quality of care. The operations of our health business are subject to various federal and provincial laws and regulations, as well as policies, guidelines and directives issued by regulatory and administrative bodies, such as medical associations, provincial colleges of physicians and other associations governing the practice of the health professionals (the holders of licences and permits to provide healthcare services) that we engage for the delivery of our services. In the case of virtual care, in addition to the laws and regulations applicable to the provision of 'insured' services (including temporary billing codes adopted by each provincial government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are determined by each province and are not uniform across Canada), the related laws, regulations, policies, guidelines and directives are still evolving and thus are subject to being interpreted and applied in different ways.\n\nIn Canada, federal and provincial privacy laws are changing, with a trend toward more stringent requirements and greater enforcement powers. The province of Quebec recently passed amendments to the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector . Over three years, the amendments will phase in major changes and new regulatory requirements in areas such as notice, consent, data breach notification and the use of automated decision systems. In September 2023, the amendments will implement a new enforcement regime, which includes substantial fines, administrative monetary penalties and a private right of action with minimum statutory damages. The federal government may also re-introduce privacy reform legislation that will increase the regulatory burden, as described in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings . Similarly, provinces such as British Columbia and Ontario are considering privacy reforms that risk fragmenting the regulatory landscape in Canada.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nChanges to the regulatory regime under which we operate, including changes to laws and regulations and ownership rules or the enactment of laws or regulations by provinces or municipalities that threaten unitary federal regulatory authority over telecommunications in Canada, could materially and adversely affect our business. These changes may increase our costs, restrict or impede the way we provide our services, limit the range of services we provide, and otherwise cause us to reduce our capital and operational expenditures, including investment in network technologies, and alter customer perceptions of our operations. The further regulation of our broadband, mobile and other operations and any related regulatory decisions could also restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve",

Such changes may not be anticipated or, when they are anticipated, our assessment of their impact on us and our business may not be accurate.\n\nOur ability to provide competitive services, including our ability to enhance our current services and offer new services on a timely basis, is also dependent on our ability to obtain access to new spectrum licences at a reasonable cost as they are made available. The revocation of, or a material limitation on obtaining, spectrum licences could have a material adverse effect on our business and our operations, including the quality and reliability of our network and service offerings, as well as our financial condition.\n\nGovernment or regulatory actions with respect to certain countries or suppliers may also impact us, and other Canadian telecommunications carriers generally, and may have material non-recurring incremental cost consequences for us.\n\nChanges to the regulatory regime under which we operate our health business, including enactment of laws, regulations and policies, guidelines or directives by regulatory and administrative bodies, such as medical associations, provincial colleges of physicians and other associations governing health professionals, could adversely affect the reputation, brand, financial results and operations of our health business. As it relates to our virtual care business, uncertainty regarding the regulatory regime, including the temporary measures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with the anticipated regulatory changes that may be enacted by provincial governments, could have adverse effects on our business if they result in the revocation of, or significant limitations on, our ability to provide and charge for the provision of virtual care services to our customers.\n\nOverall, compliance with laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions globally may involve significant costs, consume significant time and resources or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. We may also face burdensome and expensive governmental investigations or enforcement actions regarding our compliance. Non-compliance could result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our team members, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, damage to our reputation, restrictions on our ability to process information, allegations by our customers that we have not satisfied our contractual obligations, or other unintended consequences. In addition, we are required under various laws to obtain and maintain accreditations, permits and/or licences for the conduct of our business in all jurisdictions in which we have operations and, in some cases, where our customers receive our services, including the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. If we do not maintain our accreditations, licences or other qualifications to provide our services, or if we do not adapt to changes in legislation or regulation, we may have to cease operations in the relevant jurisdictions and may not be able to provide services to existing customers or attract new customers. Our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nSignificant regulatory developments and proceedings by the Government of Canada, and its various agencies, continued through 2021. Certain significant regulatory developments and proceedings relevant to our business and industry are highlighted in Section 9.4 . These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The issuance of the CRTC's decision in its review of the regulatory framework for mobile wireless services\n- /bullet.ss01 Continued cybersecurity review of international suppliers of 5G network equipment and technologies to evaluate potential risks involved in the development of 5G networks in Canada\n- /bullet.ss01 The CRTC's revisions to its 2019 decision, in which it had significantly reduced wholesale internet service rates charged by incumbent local exchange carriers for wholesale digital subscriber services and cable companies' third-party internet access services to competitor internet service providers\n- /bullet.ss01 The expectation set out by the federal government that we, BCE Inc. and Rogers (including respective flanker brands) lower mobile prices for postpaid, bring-your-own-device plans in the 2, 4 and 6 GB range by 25% by March 2022\n- /bullet.ss01 The award of spectrum licenses in the 3500 MHz band, including the award of set-aside licenses in B.C., Alberta and Manitoba to Videotron, and our application for judicial review of that decision\n- /bullet.ss01 The agreement under which Rogers would acquire Shaw Communications Inc. (Shaw) requires approvals from the Competition Bureau, the CRTC and ISED. The governmental reviews of this transaction are underway and will continue into 2022.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe advocate at all levels of government, including: our participation in CRTC and federal government proceedings, studies, reviews and other consultations; representations before provincial and municipal governments pertaining to telecommunications issues; legal proceedings impacting our operations at all levels of the courts; and other relevant inquiries (such as those relating to the exclusive federal jurisdiction over telecommunications), as described in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings .\n\nWe will continue to monitor regulatory developments and may need to reconsider our investment decisions with a view to generating a necessary return on capital. Our risk mitigation strategies for investment decisions may include, but are not limited to, reducing capital and operational expenditures and reducing employment.\n\nWe continue to strive to comply with all radio authorization and spectrum licence and renewal conditions, and we plan to participate in future spectrum auctions. We continue to advocate with the federal government for fair spectrum auction rules, so that companies like TELUS can bid on an equal footing with other competitors for spectrum blocks available at auction and can purchase spectrum licences available for sale from competitors. We also continue to strongly advocate that preferential treatment is not required and is not in the best interests of Canadians, especially rural Canadians, for regional carriers, including for 5G services, most notably carriers that are currently part of established, sophisticated and well-financed cable companies.\n\nAs it relates to our health business, we monitor new and amended regulations, policies, guidelines and directives to stay ahead and plan for new and changing requirements. In addition, we have put in place internal governance to ensure oversight of clinical practice across all healthcare operations, to manage compliance with licensing requirements and to ensure quality of care. We also advocate with the federal and provincial governments for reasonable regulations, in part by participating in market studies and other consultations.\n\nThe Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations require us to monitor and control the level of non-Canadian ownership of our Common Shares. These powers have been incorporated into our Articles and extended to ensure compliance under the Broadcasting Act .",

        "page_content": "## 10/period.ss014 Compet/i.ss01t/i.ss01ve env/i.ss01ronment\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nAs the telecommunications industry continues to evolve, we have expanded our offerings beyond the delivery of traditional voice and data services for consumer and business customers. We offer services in security and home automation, next-generation digitally-led customer experiences, healthcare and agriculture, both inside and outside Canada (see Competition overview in Section 4.1 ). We face intense competition in our traditional voice and data services, as well as in all sectors of our business operations and in all geographic markets.\n\nMobile markets are characterized by aggressive competition from established players and regional carriers, with competitors using aggressive promotional offers to attract and retain customers.\n\nIn the consumer market, cable companies and other competitors continue to offer a mix of residential local voice over IP (VoIP), long distance, internet access and, in some cases, mobile services under one bundled and/or discounted monthly rate, along with their existing broadcast or satellite-based TV services. Some of our competitors own and continue to acquire broadcast content assets, and we continue to source content from them for our broadcasting services.\n\nIn the business market, traditional facilities-based competitors continue to compete based on network footprint and reliability, while hyperscalers such as Microsoft (Teams, Skype) and other IP voice/ collaborative service providers such as Zoom emphasize price, flexibility and convenience. These service providers do not invest in, or own, networks or other infrastructure but compete directly with video, voice and messaging services across both the consumer and business market segments.\n\nTl is a leading digital customer experience innovator with a focus on customer experience and transformation innovation that designs, builds and delivers next-generation digital solutions, including artificial intelligence (AI) and content moderation. TI competes with professional services companies that offer consulting services, information technology companies with digital capabilities, AI and data labelling providers, and traditional contact centre and business process outsourcing companies that are expanding their capabilities to offer higher-margin and higher-growth digital services. In addition, the continued expansion of the digital services offered by TI and the markets in which it operates will also introduce it to new and different competitors, many of which may have significantly greater market recognition than TI in the markets it is entering, as well as increased competition from existing competitors that are also expanding their services to include digital capabilities. From time to time, TI's clients that are currently using services may determine that they can provision these services in-house. As a result, TI faces competitive pressure to continually offer services in a manner that will be viewed by its clients as better and more cost-effective than the in-house provision of those services.\n\nTELUS Health competes with other providers of virtual and clinical care, electronic medical records (EMR) and pharmacy management products, claims adjudicators, systems integrators and health service providers, including those that own a vertically integrated mix of health services delivery, IT solutions and related services, as well as global providers. With consumer-facing health products, we compete in the provision of virtual healthcare services (with access to general practitioners, nurse practitioners, mental health therapists and dieticians through virtual consultations), preventative health services, and personal emergency response services.\n\nTELUS Agriculture is a global data science and digital technology business leveraging technology innovation, ingenuity and AI to optimize agricultural production and the global and local food and consumer goods supply chain. While we maintain a broad solution set as compared to other agriculture technology providers, we compete with focused software and IoT competitors.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur customers' loyalty and their likelihood to recommend TELUS both depend on our ability to provide a service experience that meets or exceeds their expectations, a range of relevant products and services, and reliable state-of-the-art networks.\n\nIntense competition from mobile competitors, traditional telephony, data, IP and IT service providers and VoIP-focused competitors in both the consumer and business markets, along with various promotional offers, inclusive bundles and rate plans, places pressures on average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU), average billing per subscriber per month (ABPU), churn rates and costs of acquisition and retention. In addition, technological substitution and technological advances across all key business lines and market segments have blurred the boundaries between broadcasting, internet service and telecommunications sectors (see Section 10.5 Technology ).\n\nIf TI is unable to compete successfully against companies that offer similar services and offer its clients a compelling alternative to the in-house provision of services, the results could include higher client churn rates, revenue loss, pressures on recruitment and retention of team members, service price reductions, and increased marketing and promotional expenses, as well as reduced operating margins, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe also face intense competition in agriculture, health and digital technologies from companies that offer similar services. If we are unable to effectively differentiate our offerings in these sectors, our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted, and we may not achieve the benefits of the significant investments that we have made in acquiring, integrating and growing these businesses.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOn March 15, 2021, Shaw and Rogers announced an agreement under which Rogers would purchase all of Shaw's issued and outstanding Class A and Class B shares for $40.50 per share, representing a transaction value of approximately $26 billion (including approximately $6 billion in Shaw debt). While this transaction is subject to regulatory review by the CRTC, ISED and the Competition Bureau (including if approved, potential requirements for remediation), regardless of outcome, a business combination of this size has significant competitive implications across the telecommunications landscape in Canada. As of February 10, 2022, those reviews have yet to be concluded.\n\nIn October 2021, the flanker market (all carriers) aligned to meet\n\nthe ISED recommended 25% price reduction on 2, 4 and 6GB rate plans. These plans are available across all flanker brands for 4G service with bring-your-own-phone only, effectively increasing the financed entry point to $50 across all regions in the flanker market.\n\nIn October 2020, the CRTC approved the application from Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX Starlink) to provide low-earth orbit satellite internet to rural Canadians. Starlink did not complete its beta testing as expected in 2021, although the size of the beta test continues to grow with reports that Starlink now has over 140,000 customers",

However, as of February 10, 2022, these companies do not yet have approval to provide services in Canada.\n\nCanadian cable competitors are licensing next-generation TV platforms while continuing to increase the speed of their internet offerings and their roll-out of Wi-Fi services in metropolitan areas. Over-the-top (OTT) services, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Disney+, Netflix and YouTube, are also competing for share of viewership, which may accelerate the disconnection of traditional paid TV services or affect subscriber and revenue growth in our TV and entertainment services.\n\nErosion of our residential voice service and the decline of highermargin legacy voice revenues are expected to continue, due to ongoing technological substitution by mobile and VoIP and competition. This decline has been partially offset by growth in demand and/or migration of customers to IP-based platforms.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has driven an accelerated adoption of cloud-based solutions (IP voice, collaboration and network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings) and expedited the shift from legacy business solutions to next-generation technologies, as businesses adopted solutions that enable remote working arrangements.\n\nNon-traditional competitors such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are entering the business market and are able to leverage their global scale to offer low-cost data storage and cloud computing services. In addition, rapidly evolving technologies, such as software-defined networks (SDNs) and virtualized network functions (VNFs), enable the layering of new services in cloud-centric solutions.\n\nDigital health adoption, including virtual care, is accelerating, prompting rapid expansion of competitor offerings and the emergence of new players in the market, capitalizing on increased demand and available government funding. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, non-traditional healthcare companies, such as Google, Amazon Web Services and Apple, also entered the healthcare space.\n\nWithin the Canadian digital health market specifically, several of TELUS Health's long-standing competitors announced significant investments or acquisitions that mirror the activities of U.S.-based or international companies. The overall trend sees competitors quickly expand product offerings through partnerships or acquisitions. In several cases, some of our competitors are now working together, such as Loblaw Companies Ltd. and Maple Corporation, or Sun Life Financial and Dialogue Technologies Inc. However, we believe no other digital health provider spans the Canadian healthcare ecosystem with breadth or depth comparable to TELUS Health.\n\nIn the markets TI competes in, competitors are actively building scale through consolidation (e.g. Sitel Group acquisition of Sykes Enterprises, Inc.) and enhancing digital capabilities through niche acquisitions. There was also a steep rise in employee attrition and labour rates in 2021, in particular at global IT companies, with demand for skilled talent generally driving higher wages worldwide.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur top corporate priority is putting customers first and earning industry leadership in likelihood to recommend. In fact, 60% of our 2021 internal corporate scorecard is weighted to team member engagement and customer experience. To enhance customer experience, we continue\n\nto invest in our products and services, system and network reliability, team members, and system and process improvements. Additionally, with our product life cycle management processes, we endeavour to introduce innovative products and services through both research and development and acquisition, enhance our current services with integrated bundled offers, and invest in customer-focused initiatives to bring greater transparency and simplicity to our customers, all in order to differentiate ourselves from our competition.\n\nOur 4G technology covers approximately 99% of Canada's population, which has enabled us to establish and maintain a strong position in smartphone and data device selection and expand roaming capability to more than 225 global destinations. To compete effectively across customer segments, we offer a wide range of services through our TELUS, Koodo and Public Mobile brands. Each brand has a unique value proposition and web-based channel (see Our capabilities in Section 4.1 and Our major brands and distribution channels in Section 4.2 ). TELUS' 5G network has been deployed across most major tier 1 and tier 2 areas in Canada, and covered 70% of Canada's population as at December 31, 2021. As we expand our 5G coverage, we will continue to offer a network that is reliable, fast and built in full compliance with all of the Health Canada safety guidelines in order to provide our customers with faster speeds, increased capacity and near-instantaneous responsiveness, while also enabling applications such as remote surgery and autonomous cars and the creation of truly smart cities (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nWe are continuing to make significant investments in our broadband infrastructure, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to our fibre-optic network. At December 31, 2021, more than 2.7 million households and businesses in B.C., Alberta and Eastern Quebec were connected with fibre-optic cable, which provides these premises with immediate access to our fibre-optic infrastructure. This is up from approximately 2.5 million households and businesses at December 31, 2020. Our broadband investments extend the reach and functionality of our IP TV services and business and healthcare solutions, and are also enabling a more efficient and timely evolution to a converged 5G network (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nOur IP TV and OTT multimedia initiatives support the next generation of IP TV and, importantly, tie our OTT environment to a single platform, which allows us to be agile in the delivery of OTT services, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Disney+, Netflix and YouTube, while also strengthening our leadership position in Western Canada in the provision of high-definition linear channels, video-on-demand services and ultra-high definition 4K HDR content. Our strategy is to aggregate and integrate content and applications and make them accessible for our customers' enjoyment, on a timely basis across multiple devices. We have demonstrated that it is not necessary to own content in order to make it accessible to customers on an economically attractive basis, provided there is timely and strict enforcement of the CRTC's regulatory safeguards. In addition, as more OTT service providers launch services and offer higher-resolution video over the internet, we continue to make investments in our network. As of January 2022, TELUS PureFibre is still the leader in Canada in the Netflix Internet Service Provider (ISP) Speed Index, a measure of prime-time Netflix performance delivered by a specific group of ISPs around the world, as well as being ranked as the fastest ISP in Canada among major ISPs by U.S.-based PCMag. In 2021, we were ranked first in network coverage, speed, reliability or experience by Opensignal, Ookla and Tutela.",

        "page_content": "Our SmartHome Security and Secure Business solutions offerings further leverage our infrastructure investments and our proven customer experience capabilities to enhance our suite of services with video surveillance and analytics, home and business automation and related safety and security monitoring. These services leverage smartphone applications and our leading PureFibre and wireless networks, while also generating multi-service bundling and retention profiles.\n\nWe continue to add to our capabilities in the business market through product development, acquisitions and partnerships and investments in SDN, unified communications and IoT. By acquiring and combining six companies (bluArc, BroadConnect Canada, Infra-Solutions, Netrium, Radiant and Ubity), TELUS created GoCo, a fully integrated organization that quickly became one of Canada's leading providers of some of the market's fastest-growing solutions, such as SD-WAN and unified communication.\n\nTo meet our customer expectations, TI provides an experience that is not only personalized and empathetic, but also consistent and integrated across omni-channel touchpoints. To quickly capture, evaluate and adapt to customer feedback on a global scale, we have team members with expertise in advanced analytics, AI, machine learning and data analysis, together with leading digital technologies. We have also built an agile delivery model with global scale with substantially all of our delivery locations connected through a carrier-grade infrastructure backed by cloud-based technologies, enabling globally distributed and virtualized teams. However, our primary competitive differentiator is our unique workplace culture, which makes people and a shared set of values a priority in everything we do. We continue to build on this culture of care, ensuring the full engagement of the individuals we choose to join our team, the clients we choose to work with and the manner in which we build and run our business. TI is focused on organic growth, accelerating digital adoption for all solutions offered, with an emphasis on collaborative innovation. We also continue to consider inorganic mergers and acquisitions in executing our growth strategy, adding scale and digital capabilities. In the current evolving labour market, the ability to attract and retain talent is key to TI's business. We continue to adapt our models and practices by assessing the regional conditions of the markets we operate in, and by offering proactive compensation and talent programs.\n\nThrough TELUS Health, we have leveraged our systems, proprietary solutions and third-party solutions to extend our footprint in healthcare and benefit from the investments in eHealth being made by governments and employers. With the introduction of healthcare products and services for Canadians, we are seeing evidence of a positive shift in perception, driving overall interest and sales of our services, and differentiating us from our competitors.\n\nOver the course of two and a half years, we completed a number of key acquisitions in order to assemble a suite of agriculture industry assets. In November 2020, TELUS Agriculture was launched to help companies improve the reliability of their supply chain, protect their brands, and drive efficiency and profitability. As one of the few service providers with a perspective that spans the full value chain, we expect to be able to differentiate ourselves from more narrowly focused competitors.\n\nWe are continuing our disciplined long-term strategy of investing in our growth areas and delivering on our customers first priority. We intend to continue to market and distribute innovative and differentiated services; offer bundled services across our product portfolio; invest in our extensive network and systems to support customer service; evolve technologies; invest in our distribution channels, including our digital capabilities; and acquire the use of spectrum to facilitate service\n\ndevelopment and the expansion of our subscriber base, as well as to address the accelerating growth in demand for data usage.\n\n## 10/period.ss015 Techno/l.ss08ogy\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nWe are a technology-enabled company and we maintain short-term and long-term strategies to optimize our selection, costs and use of technology, minimize risks and uncertainties and diversify our product and service offerings. Our 5G technology, 4G LTE technology, LTE advanced (LTE-A) and TELUS PureFibre infrastructure are foundational to our future growth (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nAn accentuation of a paradigm shift involving customer adoption of alternative technologies, such as video and voice OTT offerings (e.g. Netflix and FaceTime), IP voice and collaboration services, NaaS, and increasingly available Wi-Fi networks, could negatively affect our revenue streams. For example, Wi-Fi networks are being used to deliver entertainment services to customers outside the home, while OTT content providers are competing for a share of entertainment viewership. OTT technology may also impact the business by enabling capabilities that in the past were associated with telecommunications service providers (e.g. cloud-based services and roaming). The proliferation of low-power wide-area (LPWA) IoT networks and services also presents challenges arising from low bandwidth usage, which may put additional pressure on our revenue streams. In addition, we are constantly focused on advances in cybersecurity, in order to identify any opportunities they may offer.\n\nThrough TI, we are a digital customer experience innovator that designs, builds and delivers high-tech, high-touch next-generation solutions, including artificial intelligence and content moderation.\n\nThrough TELUS Health's services - such as pharmacy management, EMRs (including mobile EMRs), electronic health records, personal health records, clinical information systems, remote patient monitoring, virtual care offerings and online claims settlement management software solutions, including the online renewal of prescriptions, e-prescribing services and MedDialog - TELUS Health facilitates the integration of electronic health records from the home to the doctor's office to the hospital, making critical health information available to healthcare providers over our broadband network.\n\nOur TELUS Agriculture technology solutions meaningfully impact primary production and sustainability across the food value chain, by empowering value chain participants with solutions that leverage advanced data systems and AI to streamline operations, improve food traceability, and provide consumers with fresher and healthier food.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur mobile business depends on deploying technology and maintaining sufficient access to spectrum to deliver services. Rising data traffic levels and the fast pace of data device innovation present challenges to providing adequate capacity and maintaining high service levels at competitive cost structures.\n\nOur growth and profitability and the diversity of our revenue sources will depend on our ability to develop and adopt new technologies that help us expand our existing offerings, proactively identify new revenue streams and improve cost efficiencies in our operations, all while meeting rapidly evolving customer expectations. We may not always be successful in anticipating or responding to our customers' expectations and interests when we adopt evolving technology solutions",

        "page_content": "and integrate these solutions into our offerings, and we may not achieve the intended enhancements or cost reductions in our operations. New services and technologies offered by our competitors may make our service offerings uncompetitive. Our failure to innovate, maintain technological advantages or respond effectively and in a timely manner to changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe demand for mobile data services continues to grow rapidly. According to the 2021 Communications Market Report, the average data usage per subscriber increased by 27.6% in 2020 over the 2019 average, while mobile data revenue grew by less than 1% over the same period.\n\nIn July 2021, ISED completed its auction of 3500 MHz spectrum, which has become the primary band for 5G mobile coverage globally. TELUS secured 16.4 MHz of 3500 MHz spectrum at the auction, and together with the spectrum acquired privately in January 2021, this brings our national 3500 MHz spectrum holdings to 25 MHz, averaging 40 MHz in our key markets. The limited amount of spectrum available at auction creates a risk that we may not be able to compete equally in the provision of higher network speeds and 5G capacity in all of the markets we serve.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, our 4G LTE access technology covered 99% of Canada's population, and our LTE-A access technology covered 97%, while our 5G access technology covered 70%. Our ongoing investments in 4G LTE technology, including LTE-A technology and new 5G capabilities, allow us to manage data capacity demands by more effectively utilizing our spectrum holdings. The evolution to 5G technologies is supported by our investments in our core network, IP network, IP/fibre back-haul to cell sites, including our small-cell infrastructure, as well as our softwareupgradeable radio infrastructure. The 5G expansion is expected to further increase network capacity and speed, reduce delivery costs per megabyte, deliver a superior subscriber experience, and enable new innovative applications for consumers and businesses.\n\nMobile network infrastructure investments will increasingly be directed to systems based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV), which offers greater capacity for computing and storage, higher levels of resiliency and more flexible software design. Our large-scale move to national, geographically distributed private cloud-based facilities that use commercial off-the-shelf computing and storage solutions enables the deployment of broad-scale NFV and SDN technologies. This will allow us to virtualize much of our infrastructure and will also facilitate a common control plane for coordination of our virtualized and non-virtualized network assets. The architecture of our intelligence and content capabilities is located at the edge of our network, close to our customers. The distributed smaller-scale computing power and storage deliver services faster while managing the ongoing need to continually scale the IP/fibre core network infrastructure.\n\nRapid growth of data volumes requires efficient utilization of all our spectrum. We have extensively deployed our 4G spectrum holdings, and we began operationalizing our 5G spectrum in 2020, including spectrum in the 600 MHz band. Further, we expect to continue operationalizing our recently acquired 3500 MHz spectrum through early 2022. The spectrum licences previously used for our CDMA access technology have been repurposed for use with LTE and 5G technologies. Our deployment of small-cell technology is helping us achieve a more efficient utilization of our spectrum holdings and mitigate any potential speed and capacity disadvantages created by 3500 MHz availability.\n\nSince early 2014, we have also worked with numerous businesses and many major sports and entertainment venues as we continue to expand our public Wi-Fi infrastructure. This public Wi-Fi service is a part of our network strategy of deploying small cells that integrate seamlessly with our 4G and 5G wireless access technology, automatically shifting our smartphone customers to Wi-Fi and offloading data traffic from our wireless spectrum. Integrated public Wi-Fi infrastructure build-out activity also extends service and channel opportunities with small and medium-sized businesses and improves customers' likelihood to recommend. Integration of home Wi-Fi increases the propensity for higher data usage on smartphones within and outside the home, helping to drive the uptake of our internet service. In addition to the availability of our Wi-Fi service, our IoT portfolio is also growing, with the addition of services such as GEOTrac and TELUS Alert and Assist, as well as a wide variety of IoT solutions, combined with seamless global IoT connectivity across more than 200 countries and networks. We are also capitalizing on advanced self-learning technologies and automation (e.g. AI and robotic process automation), which will change the way we manage our operations and support customer experience innovation, as well as presenting new revenue opportunities. In addition, we are maintaining a constant focus on cybersecurity solutions, recognizing that cybersecurity, as an ecosystem of technologies and processes working together, may provide greater visibility of risks and guide better security decisions for organizations across Canada.\n\nOngoing investments in fibre-to-the-premises, along with our copperto-fibre migration program and copper decommissioning within our fibre footprint, should support the further evolution of IP-based telephony, and as those services evolve, we will continue to assess opportunities to further consolidate separate technologies within a single voice service environment. The overall convergence of mobile and fixed services provides opportunities for cost savings and for the rapid development and deployment of new and advanced services. To support this convergence within a common IP-based application environment, we are leveraging modular architectures, lab investments and employee trials. We are partnering with system integrators where appropriate, purchasing hardware that is common to most other North American IP-based technology deployments and introducing virtualization technologies, where feasible. We are also active in a number of standard-setting bodies, such as the Metro Ethernet Forum, in order to advocate for a new IP infrastructure strategy that leverages standards-based functionality, which could allow us to further simplify our network.\n\n## 10/period.ss016 Supp/l.ss08/i.ss01ers\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nWe rely on, and have relationships with, multiple vendors, including large suppliers such as Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung, which are important in supporting our network and service evolution plans and our delivery of services to our customers. Our suppliers and vendors may experience business difficulties or privacy and/or security incidents, and may face external challenges such as epidemics or pandemics, global supply chain shortages or global shipping and port disruptions, as well as government or regulatory pressures. They may restructure their operations, be consolidated with other suppliers, discontinue or cease to provide support or updates for certain products or sell their operations or products to other vendors. In addition, various suppliers may sell products or services directly to our customers rather than selling those products and services through us.",

In addition, government or regulatory actions with respect to certain countries or suppliers may affect our relationship with certain vendors and our future use of their products and services.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur agility in the delivery of products and services is directly linked to our ability to engage or replace a supplier or vendor on a timely basis and without incurring additional cost. Reliance on certain manufacturers may increase their market power and adversely affect our ability to purchase certain products at an affordable cost. Consequently, the success of upgrades and the evolution of technology that we offer our customers, including our IP TV solutions and the roll-out and evolution of our broadband technologies and systems, may be impacted, as well as the cost of acquisition or the time required to deploy certain technologies and systems.\n\nThere is no guarantee that our vendor strategies and agreements will not be impacted by vendor operational difficulties or government/ regulatory pressures, or that we will not incur additional costs or delays in continuing to provide services or in deploying our technologies and systems.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on many of our suppliers, the pandemic-related challenges affecting manufacturing operations have largely been managed effectively. The continued pandemic-related reduction in commercial air traffic has eliminated the accompanying air cargo capacity, resulting in a rising demand for ocean freight. This has put pressure on the availability of both shipping vessels and ports, as well as domestic road and rail transportation capacities. The widely reported global supply chain shortages have had a particular impact on technology products, beginning with a shortage of silicon wafers and extending to the chipsets and circuit boards that are embedded in almost all of the products TELUS purchases. These shortages have resulted in both longer lead times and higher costs. These combined logistics and supply chain challenges are expected to continue until the end of 2022.\n\nFollowing the restrictions placed on its access to U.S.-based technologies, Huawei has exited the mobile phone business. As part of our 5G network upgrade, we have also chosen to replace many of the Huawei products in other layers of our network with enhanced equipment from the suppliers of our 5G network (either Ericsson, Samsung or Nokia). During the transition phase, components removed from the network will be used as replacements, as required on the remaining network, thus ensuring a supply of necessary materials.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe value our relationships with our suppliers because they help us achieve our business objectives and contribute to our success. We work closely with key strategic suppliers to ensure appropriate timing in the manufacturing, delivery and warehousing of their products so that our needs will be met regardless of changing conditions. We strive to award business to suppliers that have demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainable development by adopting ethical, labour, health and safety, and environmental principles and compliance practices that align with our expectations and support the well-being of their employees, contractors and communities.\n\nIn response to the impact of the pandemic and global supply chain challenges, our supply operations, in collaboration with our product development and marketing teams, have extended future forecasts and increased purchase order quantities to help maintain our fulfilment capabilities in the context of longer lead times. In addition, we continue to seek alternative devices or sources of supply, and where possible, we refurbish equipment in the form of certified pre-owned devices, including smartphones from our Bring-it-Back program and our Mobile Klinik business, to support sustainability.\n\nAs a leading network aggregator, we partner with several network equipment suppliers and work with numerous international and domestic vendors to deliver the best possible experience for our customers across our business operations. We consider possible vendor strategies and/ or restructuring outcomes when planning for our future growth, as well as the maintenance and support of existing equipment and services. We have reasonable contingency plans for different scenarios, including working with multiple vendors, maintaining ongoing strong vendor relationships with periodic reviews of vendor performance, and working closely with other product and service users to influence vendors' product or service development plans. With continued international focus on telecom suppliers, business continuity plans have been formalized to ensure availability of supply in compliance with U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List restrictions. For our 5G network build, we have announced partnerships with Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung, consistent with our multi-vendor strategy.\n\nIn addition, we regularly monitor the risk profiles of our key vendors and review the applicable terms and conditions of our agreements to determine whether additional contractual safeguards are required. We also promote our supplier code of conduct, which is based on generally accepted standards of ethical business conduct.\n\nIn respect of supplier market power, we offer and promote alternative devices to provide greater choice for consumers and to help limit our reliance on a few key suppliers.\n\nAdditional information on supply chain sustainability can be found in our sustainability report at telus.com/sustainability .\n\n## 10/period.ss017 Organ/i.ss01zat/i.ss01ona/l.ss08 change\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nWe will partner, acquire and divest as necessary to accelerate the implementation of our growth strategy. Through the partnerships and acquisitions we pursue, we may seek opportunities to expand the scope of our existing services, add new customers or enter new markets around the world. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable candidates in the future for partnerships, for strategic transactions at acceptable prices or at all, or be able to complete any such transactions.\n\nAs we have implemented this strategy, we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our operations into new business sectors and geographic markets, and the number of our team members has increased significantly over the past several years. We expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the locations where we operate in order to address the anticipated continued growth of our business. We are also continuing to look for delivery locations, service offerings and organizations outside of our current geographic operating regions in order to limit the risks of operating from a limited number of countries and/or expand our capabilities and customer value",

We may not, however, be able to effectively manage our infrastructure and team member expansion, establish additional delivery locations or hire skilled team members as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our customers and clients and to maintain our current growth trajectory, and we may not be able to develop or improve our internal systems. We also need to manage cultural differences between our team member populations, which may increase the risk for employment law claims. Our inability to execute our growth strategy, to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion, capital and other resources effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nA substantial majority of the assets and operations of our DLCX and TELUS Agriculture lines of business are located outside of Canada and the United States. In addition, the business strategies of DLCX and TELUS Agriculture may involve expanding or developing their business operations in emerging market regions, including Europe and AsiaPacific. Due to the international nature of our business, we are exposed to various economic, political and other risks of doing business globally.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nBusiness combination transactions add complexity to our corporate structure, product and service offerings, and operational systems and processes. If pre-acquisition due diligence is insufficient or ineffective, our investments may not realize potential synergies or generate strategic growth.\n\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, complete, integrate and realize the benefits of acquisitions or manage the associated risks. Consequently, any acquisition we complete may not result in anticipated or long-term benefits or synergies to us, and we may not be able to further develop the acquired business in the manner we anticipated.\n\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including diversion of management's attention from operating our business, developing our relationships with customers and seeking new revenue opportunities; failure to retain key personnel of acquired companies; legal risks and liabilities relating to the acquisition or the acquired entity's legacy operations that may be unknown or undisclosed and for which we may not be indemnified fully or at all; failure to integrate the acquisition in a timely manner; and in the case of potential acquisitions, our ability to finance the acquisitions on attractive terms or at all, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows. Future acquisitions may also require that we incur indebtedness or issue equity securities.\n\nWe could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to execution, integration or underperformance relative to prior expectations. Post-acquisition activities include the review and alignment of team member cultures, accounting policies, treasury policies, corporate policies such as ethics and privacy policies, team member transfers and moves, information systems integration, optimization of service offerings and the establishment of control over new operations. Such activities may not be conducted efficiently and effectively. Our management may not be able to successfully integrate any future acquired business into our operations and culture on the anticipated timeline or at all, or maintain our standards, controls and policies, which could negatively impact the experience of our customers and clients, the optimization of our service offerings and our control over operations, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance,\n\nfinancial condition and cash flows. Consequently, acquisitions may not result in anticipated or long-term benefits or synergies for us, and we may not be able to further develop the acquired business in the manner we anticipated.\n\nThe risks to which we are exposed by doing business globally and in emerging markets may impede the execution of our strategy by limiting the countries and regions in which we are able to expand. The impacts of these risks may also only emerge after we have begun preparations and made investments to provide services in a new country or region. Our exposure to such risks may cause us to incur additional costs to mitigate the impact of these risks on our business. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on the nature and extent of any such impacts and our ability to anticipate, respond to and effectively manage these impacts. Finally, international trade and political disputes can adversely affect the operations of multinational corporations like TELUS by limiting or disrupting trade and business activity between countries or regions. For example, we may be required to limit or halt operations, terminate customer or client relationships or forgo profitable opportunities in countries which may, in the future, be subject to sanctions or other restrictions on the business activity of corporations such as TELUS, by U.S. or Canadian legislation, executive order or otherwise. Some TI clients have been targeted by, and may in the future be subject to, such sanctions. Additionally, trade disputes between countries may also lead to unexpected operating difficulties in certain countries, including heightened regulatory scrutiny, greater difficulty transferring funds or negative impacts on currency exchanges. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and prospects.\n\nGiven the rapid rate of technological change, we may also look to partner and invest in emerging opportunities that may not yet be fully viable and established. These investments may require high levels of initial funding and experience low levels of initial adoption, growth and returns, all of which could impact our financial position in the short term.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOver the course of 2021, we made a number of acquisitions to support our growth strategy. Please refer to Note 18 of the Consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nTo support ongoing investment in leading-edge and innovative technology, we have diversified our approach to allow for varied levels of commitment, which we determine based on the relative maturity of a technology in its life cycle, its alignment with our strategy and its linkage with our value proposition. Our TELUS Ventures investments include more than 50 active companies, and we continue to build on our commitment to help develop exciting new technologies with the potential to deliver benefits for our customers, stakeholders and shareholders. In addition, we continue to engage in partnerships that can conduct research and development of leading-edge innovative technology and services in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture and entertainment.\n\nOver the course of time, we have built a disciplined corporate development and ventures expertise, with due diligence and postacquisition integration planning rigour, reinforced by a well-defined process and governance approach to evaluating investments and acquisitions. Where a larger-scale business combination is contemplated, our teams follow a well-established and collaborative due-diligence review process, with oversight by our senior leadership and Board.",

Regulatory decisions may also limit our ability to invest in our customer experience.\n\nOur corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives are an important part of our organizational culture and are key factors in attracting and retaining customers and employees and differentiating us from our competitors. If we are unable to meet or exceed the evolving expectations of our customers in these areas or implement high-quality corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives on a timely basis, and effectively communicate them to our customers, our reputation may suffer, which may negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\n\nOur TI business has derived a significant portion of its revenue from a limited number of large clients, and we believe this will continue in the near term. A leading social media company was TI's largest external client in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and accounted for approximately 18% and 16%, respectively, of its revenue in those periods. Additionally, the volume of work performed for specific clients of TI or the revenue it generates can vary from year to year. For example, a client may demand price reductions, change its customer engagement strategy or begin to provision services in-house, and continued consolidation in many of the verticals in which TI offers services could result in the loss of a client. In light of the foregoing, a major client in one year may not provide the same level of revenue in any subsequent year.\n\nAny significant reduction in, or elimination of, the use of the services TI provides as a result of client consolidation or our removal from a key client's provider network would reduce TI's revenue and could negatively affect our business. In addition, such consolidation may encourage TI's\n\nclients to apply more pressure on TI to lower the prices it charges for its solutions. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial performance and prospects.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe global pandemic has had widespread effects on many areas of service delivery. These include significant constraints on our interactions with our customers; a major acceleration of our transformation into a digital-first organization; and the proliferation of self-serve capabilities to help our customers. These impacts have affected our team around the world, requiring us to be agile in enabling our team members to work efficiently from home or from alternative locations, as well as virtually with customers through our virtual technician model (VTM) and do-it-yourself (DIY) capabilities.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nContinued simplification and digitization, including our ongoing work on conversational interactive voice response and enhanced call-back capabilities, have improved first-time interaction experiences by reducing the number of call transfers and shortening customer wait times. We continue to enhance the reliability and functionality of our websites and applications, while promoting digital engagement to minimize effort for our customers and reduce the volume of calls related to basic transactions, interactions and other concerns.\n\nTo ensure minimal disruption of our ability to deliver on our service promise during any further lockdown scenarios, we quickly developed a robust capacity to ramp our virtual repair and installation program up or down at a community level in response to outbreak data, maximizing value and safety. This is in conjunction with our focus on further developing our DIY installation and repair program and our VTM, which will generate further internal cost savings and provide greater choice for our customers. We have also invested in our work-from-home capabilities around the world, including additional virtual private network (VPN) capacity, allowing more than 90% of our global workforce to work from home or from alternative locations for the foreseeable future and serve our customers safely. The work of our EMOC also helps us track outbreaks and coordinate responses to keep our customers and team members safe.\n\nOur TI subsidiary was created with an intense focus on customer service excellence, continuous improvement and a values-driven culture with the goal of better serving a growing portfolio of global clients. Through TI, customer care and business services are delivered from within a unified TELUS-wide culture by a flexible team of over 62,000 team members in over 25 countries, minimizing business disruptions. Competence Call Center (CCC) (since rebranded as TELUS International Northern Europe or TINE and comprised substantially of CCC) and Lionbridge AI were acquired during 2020, with the latter's business subsequently rebranded as TELUS International AI Data Solutions (TIAI); these acquisitions help extend the reach of TI's customer service capabilities by diversifying its service offerings. The acquired CCC capabilities have enabled higher-value-added business services with a focus on trust and safety, including content moderation, while TIAI's solutions help improve data functionality and deliver secure, compliant, scalable and high-quality solutions for our TI subsidiary's clients.\n\nWithin TELUS Health, we have developed virtual care delivery options, including the capability to perform virtual health assessments from our local care centres. We have also introduced a 'virtual first' approach to implementation of our software solutions. Virtual training and onboarding are being delivered to new physician and pharmacist clients, incorporating rigorous practices that ensure the safety of our customers and team members when on-site visits are required.

        "page_content": "functionality into our EMR service offering across Canada allows clinicians to support their own roster of patients virtually while maintaining continuity of care and fully up-to-date health records. As of December 31, 2021, more than 950,000 consultations have been conducted through our various virtual care solutions, including TELUS MyCare, TELUS Health Virtual Care and TELUS EMR Virtual Visit.\n\nAs a social capitalism company, we are also committed to making a difference by building stronger, healthier communities and ensuring that the most vulnerable among us are not left behind. Our Internet for Good program is focused on connecting Canadians in need by providing low-cost high-speed internet access for low-income families, young people leaving foster care and people with disabilities, as well as empowering schools across Alberta and B.C. to extend the offer directly to families in need. In addition, our Mobility for Good program provides subsidized smartphones and plans for young people leaving foster care, low-income seniors and, new in 2021, Indigenous women at risk, helping them stay in touch with loved ones, maintain vital support networks and build new lives. We believe these initiatives increase our customers' loyalty and likelihood to recommend, and are key factors in differentiating us from our competitors. Additional information on our sustainability and environmental governance practices and related disclosure is included in Section 10.12 Our environment .\n\nWe continue to be ranked favourably in third-party reports based on customer and network experience. In 2021, we were ranked first in network coverage, speed, reliability or experience by Opensignal, Ookla and Tutela, as well as being ranked as the fastest ISP among major ISPs in Canada by U.S.-based PCMag. This successful performance was the result of continuing to evolve our coverage across Canada, increasing the accessibility of our network, and working to better understand the emerging network methodologies that can enhance coverage and LTE availability, all of which earned TELUS recognition for providing the best network coverage among our competitors.\n\n## 10/period.ss019 Our systems and processes\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nWe are a key provider of essential telecommunications services, as well as security and health services in Canada. Through TELUS International, we provide digital customer experience services to global brands, and through TELUS Health, we ensure optimal care is made possible by combining the power of technology and data with the provision of market-leading experiences. Within TELUS Agriculture, we leverage technology and data to improve the flow of information across the agricultural, food and consumer goods production industries in Canada and internationally. Our success depends on our ability to deliver reliable and continuous services to all our customers.\n\nWe have a large number of interconnected operational and business support systems. Acquisitions, business combinations and the development and launch of new services typically require significant systems development and integration efforts. Acquisitions may also pose potential cybersecurity, privacy and brand risks. As next-generation services are introduced, they must work with next-generation systems, frameworks and IT infrastructures, while also being compatible with legacy services and support systems. In addition, our large enterprise deals and our TI subsidiary's client contracts may involve complex and multi-faceted customer-specific enterprise requirements, including customized systems and reporting requirements in support of service delivery.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur network, technology, infrastructure, supply chain, team members and operations may be materially impacted by disruptions in the functioning of critical infrastructure due to intentional threats (see Section 10.10 Security and data protection ), labour disruptions (see Section 10.11 Our team ), climate-related risks and natural hazards or unintentional threats (see Section 10.12 Our environment ), health threats (such as epidemics or pandemics), competitive threats and geopolitical pressures. Any of these risks or hazards may lead to the disruption of our ability to deliver services to our customers and may also make it difficult or impossible for team members to reach or work in our business locations. Damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could adversely affect our reputation, our relationships with our customers and our leadership team's ability to administer and supervise our business, and could also cause us to incur substantial additional expenditures to repair or replace damaged equipment or sites. We may also be liable to our customers for any service disruption resulting from such damage or destruction. Our resiliency provisions and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to support continuity and reliability of service during disruptions or reduce the duration and impact of service outages. While we currently have commercial liability insurance, our insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not provide coverage at all for certain events. Furthermore, we may be unable to secure such insurance coverage at premiums acceptable to us in the future, or such insurance may become unavailable. Core expertise and competencies in all areas of our organization are in high demand worldwide and our operations and continued growth depend on our ability to hire, retain and develop highly skilled leaders and key personnel. Any of the above factors may adversely affect our business.\n\nAs the complexity of our systems increases, our system stability and availability may be affected. There can be no assurance that any of our proposed IT systems or process change initiatives will be implemented successfully, that they will be implemented in accordance with anticipated timelines, or that sufficient numbers of skilled team members will be available to complete such initiatives and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. If we fail to implement and maintain appropriate IT systems on a timely basis, fail to create and maintain an effective governance and operating framework to support the management of our teams, or fail to understand and streamline our significant number of legacy systems and proactively meet constantly evolving business requirements, we could experience an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nExpansion of our work-from-home programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased requirements on our VPN systems.\n\nIT services are increasingly delivered by cloud-based vendors as either Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and our reliance upon these third-party cloud-based computing services is growing. While this can result in benefits for our speed to market, reliability, performance and agility, it requires adjustments to our operations and may increase the potential for service disruptions. Operational support processes and vendor negotiations must now take into account that the delivery of hardware and software services may occur outside of our own infrastructure, and therefore controls need to be incorporated into our operational support processes and tools.\n\nIn addition, we routinely have numerous integration activities, complex system and process change initiatives, and development projects underway.",

        "page_content": "## Mitigation\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our VPN capacity in order to ensure stability, productivity and security for team members working from home and from alternative locations, and we accelerated the purchase and deployment of a new VPN system, improving connection capacity and reliability while enhancing security measures. For our TI subsidiary's clients, to the extent possible, we were able to redistribute customer volumes from facilities impacted by local government-mandated temporary site closures to locations that were less impacted. We have also equipped the majority of our customer-serving TI team members to provide remote support to our clients, as they have since the onset of the pandemic, and in some cases we have thoughtfully and strategically had team members return to work on-site. In addition, the TIAI business utilizes the services of a crowd-sourced provider base that is geographically dispersed across the globe.\n\nIn line with industry best practice, our approach is to separate business support systems (BSS) from operational support systems (OSS) and underlying network technology. Our aim is to decouple the introduction of new network technologies from the services we sell to customers so that both can evolve independently. This allows us to optimize network investments while limiting the impact on customer services, and also facilitates the introduction of new services. In addition, due to the maturing nature of telecommunications vendor software, we adopt industry-standard software for BSS/OSS functions, leverage SaaS and IaaS capacities, and avoid custom development where possible. This enables us to leverage vendor knowledge and industry practices acquired through the installation of those platforms at numerous global telecommunications companies. We have established a next-generation BSS/OSS framework to ensure that, as new services and technologies are developed, they are part of the next-generation framework that will ease the retirement of legacy systems in accordance with TeleManagement Forum's next-generation operations systems and software program. As part of our ongoing fibre roll-out, we have invested in new operational support systems that are consolidating our legacy systems and simplifying our current environment. Concurrent with our fibre roll-out, we are also migrating customers from our legacy copper network to our fibre network and beginning to decommission the copper network within our fibre footprint. This will improve our ability to support and maintain our systems with newer, more resilient technology and improve the customer experience. We also continue to make significant investments in system resiliency and reliability in support of our ongoing customers first initiatives.\n\nFor each new large enterprise deal, we look to leverage systems and processes developed for previous contracts while incorporating others as required, using a controlled methodology to draft a new custom solution and following standard industry practices for project management and systems support. We have release and change management policies, processes and controls in place that are based on industry best practices. In general, we strive to ensure that system development and process changes are prioritized, and we apply a project management approach to such initiatives that includes appropriate risk identification and contingency planning, scope and change control, and resource and quality management. We conduct reasonable functional, performance and revenue assurance testing, as well as capturing and applying any lessons learned. Where a change involves major system and process conversions, we often shift our business continuity planning and emergency management operations centre to a heightened state of readiness in advance of the change.\n\nConsistent with best practice, we continue to make smart investments in mitigating risk in older technology, modernizing key platforms and capabilities for greater flexibility and reliability, and securing the benefits and capabilities that cloud-based operations can offer. We continue to make progress in modernizing and improving our systems and critical applications by leveraging proven, state-of-the-art, cloud-based technologies and capabilities. Over the past two years, we have augmented our teams with additional digitization and cloud expertise so they can play a leading role, today and into the future. We are leveraging our 10-year partnership with Google Cloud to supplement our in-house expertise and experience as we extend the digitization of TELUS by harnessing the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform, as well as other partners and cloud-based service providers.\n\nWe have adopted a post-acquisition stabilization period for the SmartHome Security and automation line of business to deeply assess any risks, vulnerabilities and exposures, and consider the mitigation of key risks, before integrating common elements into our core systems and critical applications.\n\nWe conduct ongoing monitoring of our systems and critical applications. Risk-based disaster recovery capabilities are leveraged to help prevent outages and limit impacts on our customers and operations. In addition, enterprise-wide business continuity programs are in place to support monitoring, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery. However, there can be no assurance that specific events, or a combination of events, will not disrupt our operations.\n\n## 10/period.ss0110 Secur/i.ss01ty and data protect/i.ss01on\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nAs a national provider of information and communications services, we have a perspective extending beyond that of individual organizations. We leverage this insight and understanding to monitor and identify security-related trends as they evolve in the wider threat landscape. The risks outlined below reflect both our experience and the trends we have observed in the wider ecosystem.\n\nWe have a number of assets that may be exposed to risks involving intentional threats. These include physical assets that may be exposed to terrorist attacks, vandalism and/or theft, including (but not limited to) cellular towers, distributive copper cable, corporate stores, network and telephone switch centres, and elements of corporate infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, we operate data centres and collect and manage data in our business and on behalf of our customers (including, in the case of TELUS Health, sensitive personal health information) that may move across our interconnected operational and business support systems and networks. Depending on the nature of the data, it may be restricted for use within Canada or leveraged by our teams or outsourcing partners in Canada or abroad. Our systems and networks may also be subject to cyberattacks. Personal health information in particular is known to be a prime target for these attacks.\n\nA number of TI's service contracts provide for high or unlimited liability for the benefit of its clients related to damages resulting from breaches of privacy or data security in connection with the provision of its services.\n\nAlthough our network security measures and our authentication of customer credentials are designed to protect against unauthorized disclosure, alteration and destruction of, and access to, data on our networks, it is impossible for such security measures to be perfectly effective. There can be no assurance that such measures will function",

        "page_content": "as expected or will be sufficient to protect our network infrastructure against certain attacks, and there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent or mitigate service interruptions or other security-related incidents. All network infrastructure is vulnerable to rapidly evolving cyberattacks, and our user data and corporate systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties (including malicious cyberattacks), team member error, malfeasance, internal bad actors, a combination of these, or other circumstances. A breach may allow an unauthorized party to obtain access to or exfiltrate our data or our users', customers' or clients' data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce team members, users, customers or clients to install malicious software, disclose sensitive information or access credentials, or take other actions that may provide access to our data or our users', customers' or clients' data. Because networking and computing environments are increasing in complexity and the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, become more sophisticated over time, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and thus may not be identified until deployed against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security measures occurs (or a breach of a third-party vendor's, customer's or client's security that can be attributed to our failure or is perceived to be our fault), the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users, customers and clients. Security breaches also expose us to risk involving loss of information, class action or other litigation brought both by customers and clients and by individuals whose information was compromised; or to remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, and potential liability.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nPhysical security threats can place both our team members and our infrastructure, systems and networks at risk of incurring significant harm, including personal injury, destruction of property and loss of service and/or data. The risks and consequences of cyberattacks on our assets could surpass the risks and consequences of physical attacks, due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats.\n\nWe and our partners may also be subject to software, equipment or other system malfunctions that could result in unauthorized access to, or change, loss or destruction of, our data. These malfunctions could compromise the privacy of individuals, including our customers, team members and suppliers, and could expose other sensitive information.\n\nA successful disruption of our systems, networks and infrastructure, or those of third parties, including our suppliers, vendors and partners, may prevent us from providing reliable service, impact the operations of our networks, or lead to the unauthorized interception, destruction, use or dissemination of our information or our customers' information. Such disruption, whether physical or digital, or unauthorized access to our data could cause us to lose customers or revenue, incur expenses, or experience reputational and goodwill damages. Additionally, such damages could result in TELUS incurring costs arising from investigation efforts, replacement or restoration of assets and potential civil lawsuits or fines imposed by regulatory bodies.\n\nWhile we believe our team members receive appropriate training, if any person, including any of our team members, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are required to comply in relation to a customer's data, or otherwise\n\nmismanages or misappropriates that data, or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs, we could be subject to significant liability to customers, our TI subsidiary's clients or its clients' customers for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or for permitting access to personal information subject to privacy laws, as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer, client or team member data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, team member negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and clients and result in liability to individuals whose information was compromised.\n\nSimilarly, unauthorized access to or through our information systems and networks or those we develop or manage for our customers and clients, whether by our team members or third parties, could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, clients or business, class action or other litigation, costly regulatory investigations and other potential liability.\n\nFrom a TELUS Health perspective, breaches involving personal health information have proven to be the most expensive to remediate; such a breach can have a significant impact on trust and reputation, and may also affect future health outcomes.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nTwo major trends evident in the cybersecurity threat landscape in 2021 were supply chain attacks and the use of ransomware in cyberattacks. Supply chain attacks are attractive to cybercriminals since they can have a significant impact on downstream organizations, which adds to the pressure on the primary target and could permit the cybercriminals to leverage that pressure against the downstream organizations and make further demands. Ransomware has been increasingly used in attacks, according to a report from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in August 2021, which noted a 62% increase in ransomware incidents and a 20% increase in ransomware losses reported between January and July 2021, compared to the same period in 2020.\n\nWith our perspective and our monitoring capabilities, we have observed that the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks continue to increase, with attack techniques evolving in parallel with trends in technology. These attacks may involve a variety of techniques that include the targeting of individuals and the use of sophisticated malicious software and hardware, or a combination of both, to evade the technical and administrative safeguards that are in place (including firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, active monitoring and other measures).\n\nCyberattacks penetrating the network security of our data centres, or any unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, confidential information and data of our customers and clients or their end customers, could have a negative impact on our reputation and customer confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur security program addresses risk through a number of mechanisms, including:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Security awareness programs\n- /bullet.ss01 Controls based on policies, standards and methodologies that are aligned with recognized industry frameworks and practices\n- /bullet.ss01 Monitoring of external activities by potential attackers\n- /bullet.ss01 Incident response",

Our technical capabilities help us identify security-related events, respond to possible threats and adjust our security posture appropriately. Additionally, our approach to cyber-hygiene includes regular vulnerability assessments and the prioritization and remediation of any identified exposure through patching or other mechanisms. Our security office also works with law enforcement and other agencies to address ongoing threats and disruptions, and provides awareness training to our team members to help them better recognize and report threats.\n\n## 10/period.ss0111 Our team\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur success depends on the abilities, experience, well-being and engagement of our team members, as well as our ability to attract and retain the talent upon which our service offerings depend. Each year, we launch a number of unique initiatives that are intended to improve our productivity and competitiveness. These may include acquisitions, operational business integrations, efficiency programs, business process automation and/or outsourcing, offshoring and reorganizations. Since keeping team members healthy is critical to keeping them engaged and productive, our well-being strategy provides an array of resources and initiatives to support optimal health and well-being for our team.\n\nWe believe that our unique customers first, inclusive and caring culture has contributed to our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled, engaged and motivated workforce, which in turn has driven strong customer and client retention. It may become more difficult for us to maintain a culture that supports our success as we continue to evolve our products and services, enter new geographic areas, open new delivery locations, increase the number of team members and acquire new businesses. Current thought-leadership suggests that the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic has altered many shared values and expectations; there is a significant amount of concern regarding a surge in voluntary turnover rates, given the difficulties many people have faced during this trying time and their renewed perspectives moving into the future. If our unique culture is not maintained, our ability to attract and retain highly skilled team members, customers and clients across our core verticals may be adversely impacted, and our operational and financial results may be negatively affected.\n\nOur business could also be adversely affected if individuals providing their data annotation services through TIAI's crowdsourcing solutions were classified as employees. The classification of certain individuals who provide their services through third-party digital platforms as independent contractors is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and many other countries where our TIAI business uses the services of\n\nindependent contractors. Similarly, some of our healthcare practitioners who are supporting our virtual care business in TELUS Health may be classified as employees instead of independent contractors by decision-makers in certain jurisdictions. We generally believe that most individuals who provide their data annotation services through TIAI's crowdsourcing solution and those healthcare practitioners who support our virtual care business are independent contractors. Since, among other things, independent contractors can choose whether, when, and where to provide services, and for data annotation professionals they are free to provide services on competitors' platforms, and they use their own equipment. In the case of healthcare practitioners, they are free to provide services in other non-virtual healthcare settings. We may not be successful in defending the independent contractor classification in the jurisdictions where we operate or where such classification is challenged. The costs associated with defending, settling or resolving any future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the independent contractor classification could be material to our business.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nLost work time resulting from team member illness or injury can negatively affect organizational productivity and employee benefit costs. The loss of key team members through short-term and long-term disability (including absences resulting from mental health concerns), attrition and retirement, the inability to attract and retain team members with essential or evolving skills, including familiarity with legacy systems, or, in the case of team members leading recent acquisitions in emerging areas of our business, specialized knowledge of such businesses, or any deterioration in overall team member morale and engagement resulting from organizational changes, unresolved collective agreements or ongoing cost reduction initiatives, could have an adverse impact on our growth, business and profitability and our efforts to enhance the customer experience. In addition, changes in technology are shifting the set of skills needed by our team and driving competition for resources among global players.\n\nOur corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives are also important to our team members, as is our ability to offer resources and services to maintain optimal health and well-being. Our failure to meet or exceed our team members' evolving expectations in these areas could have adverse impacts on our ability to attract and retain team members.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause heightened uncertainty in many of our lives, resulting in more stress and anxiety and waning resiliency among our team members. Long before March 2020, when we began adopting stricter measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, 500,000 Canadians per week were citing mental health symptoms or illnesses as the reason they were unable to work. Many Canadian workers - our team members included - are still working from home, isolated from peers and extended family members and friends, and juggling multiple competing priorities. More than 90% of our domestic team members (excluding field technicians and retail store representatives) and over 80% of our TI team members continue to work from home or from alternative work locations.\n\nGlobal events and ongoing efforts from marginalized communities to achieve equality and social justice have also focused attention on the discrimination and racial injustice that continue to affect many communities.",

Our culture is anchored in our TELUS leadership values, which were set out by our team nearly two decades ago. These values affirm that:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We embrace change and initiate opportunity\n- /bullet.ss01 We believe in spirited teamwork\n- /bullet.ss01 We have a passion for growth\n- /bullet.ss01 We have the courage to innovate.\n\nOur objective is to attract, develop and retain talented employees in Canada and internationally. We achieve this objective by investing in our people throughout their careers, and by offering diverse and inclusive employment prospects and development opportunities.\n\nTo support team members' overall well-being and to achieve a positive effect on absenteeism in the workplace, we take a holistic and proactive approach to health that involves risk prevention, early intervention, team member and family assistance, mental health training, engaging social and educational well-being initiatives, assessment and support services, disability management, and accommodation and return-to-work services. Our well-being strategy encourages our team members to develop optimal personal health across five dimensions of well-being: physical, psychological, financial, social and environmental. To promote safe work practices, we offer training and orientation programs for team members and contractors who have access to our facilities.\n\nHaving teams that are engaged leads to a better team member experience, which in turn drives an improved customer service experience - our customers are more satisfied, resulting in a lower churn rate for our products and services.\n\nThrough our annual Pulsecheck engagement surveys, we continue to assess our team's health and well-being and gather their insights about our work environment, including changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key highlights included team members confirming their belief that their safety is a priority for their leaders; that their leaders are providing the support they need during this extraordinary time; and that their work arrangements allow them to collaborate productively to meet the needs of customers. TELUS is the most engaged organization globally among organizations of our size and composition according to Kincentric, our survey provider.\n\nIn 2021, reinforcement of our culture continued to focus on Diversity and Inclusion, human capital development and team member engagement, through:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Leveraging our strong culture with a focus on listening to team members;\n- /bullet.ss01 Putting customers first and leaders engaging their teams through our fair process engagement model; and\n- /bullet.ss01 Utilizing Pulsecheck feedback including our Inclusion index results to build and create action plans for improvements.\n\nAt TELUS, we believe that honouring the diversity of our team, customers and communities opens up new perspectives and enables us to connect for good and deliver remarkable outcomes for everyone.\n\nBuilding on our initiatives in 2020 to encourage team members across TELUS to share our stance against racism and all forms of systemic bias and reaffirm our commitment to standing united in our pursuit of equity, fairness, social justice and systemic change, we continue to drive our renewed D&I strategy.\n\nWe appreciate and celebrate every team member's unique talents, voice and abilities, and we encourage them to always bring their whole selves to work. To promote diversity and inclusion at TELUS with a focus\n\non both behavioural and structural change, we developed a new inclusive leadership model, along with an inclusion index in our Pulsecheck survey, to measure our progress in fostering an inclusive culture. We achieved a score of 85%, indicating a strong sense of inclusion and belonging among team members.\n\nBuilding on our commitment to Indigenous Peoples on which our long-standing, respectful and productive relationships, we formalized our commitment to reconciliation in 2021 and launched a five-year Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan, setting us on a path that will bring our commitment to life. Developed with guidance from Indigenous voices and frameworks for reconciliation, the plan is based on four pillars on which we believe we can drive meaningful change - connectivity, enabling social outcomes, cultural responsiveness and relationships, and economic reconciliation.\n\nWe aim to attract and retain key team members through both monetary and non-monetary approaches. Our compensation and benefits program is designed to support our high-performance culture and is both market-driven and performance-based. Where required, we implement targeted retention solutions for employees with critical skills or talents that are scarce in the marketplace, and we have a succession planning process in place to identify top talent for seniorlevel positions.\n\nWe focus on and manage organizational change through a formal business transformation function that leverages the expertise, key learnings and effective practices developed in recent years during the implementation of mergers, business integrations and efficiencyrelated reorganizations.\n\nWe have a post-acquisition integration team that works with our business units and the operations they acquire, applying an integration model based on learnings from previous integrations, while also focusing on the unique attributes and employee cultures of the acquired companies, which advances the standardization of our business processes and is intended to preserve the unique qualities of each acquired operation.\n\nAdditionally, we continuously strive to raise the level of our team members' engagement. We believe that our strong team member engagement continues to be driven by our focus on the customer and team member experience, our success in the marketplace and our social purpose. We plan to continue our focus on other non-monetary factors that are supportive of team member engagement, including performance development, career opportunities, learning and development, recognition, diversity and inclusiveness, well-being resources and initiatives, our leading-edge Work Styles program (enabling team members to work where and how they will be most effective and equipping them with robust digital collaboration tools to stay connected), and our community volunteerism, including TELUS Days of Giving. Additional information on our programs can be found in our sustainability report at telus.com/sustainability .\n\n## 10/period.ss0112 Our env/i.ss01ronment\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur operations, infrastructure and team members are exposed to climate-related physical risks, which include extreme weather events and other natural hazards. We may also be exposed to transition risks related to climate change, such as the impact of changes in policy or the deployment of lower-emission technology.",

        "page_content": "Our data and voice communications infrastructure, including TI delivery locations in Central America, India, Europe and the Philippines, may be damaged or disrupted as a result of natural disasters or extreme weather events, including those resulting from or exacerbated by climate change, such as earthquakes, floods, volcano eruptions, heavy rains, winter storms, extreme heat waves, tsunamis and cyclones; epidemics or pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; technical disruptions and infrastructure breakdowns, including damage to, or interruption of, electrical grids, transportation systems, communication systems or telecommunication cables; issues with information technology systems and networks, including computer glitches, software vulnerabilities and electronic viruses or other malicious code; accidents and other events, such as fires, floods and failures of fire suppression and detection, heating, ventilation or air conditioning systems; or other events, such as protests, riots, labour unrest, security threats and terrorist attacks. Any of these events may lead to the disruption of information systems and telecommunications services for sustained periods and may create delays and inefficiencies in providing services to clients and potentially result in closure of our operating sites. They also may make it difficult or impossible for team members to reach or work in our business locations. Some locations may not be well-suited to work-from-home approaches to providing client services due to connectivity, infrastructure or other issues.\n\nCertain areas of our operations are subject to environmental considerations, such as the construction of telecommunications infrastructure, handling and disposing of waste, electronic waste or other residual materials, managing our water use, and responding to spills and releases. Some areas of our operations are also subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal, provincial and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations impose requirements with respect to matters such as the release of certain substances into the environment, corrective and remedial action concerning such releases, protection of sensitive ecosystems and associated wildlife habitat, and the proper handling and management of certain substances, including wastes.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nEvolving public expectations and increasingly stringent laws and regulations could result in increased costs of compliance, while failure to recognize and adequately respond to them could result in penalties, regulatory scrutiny or damage to our reputation and brand.\n\nDamage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could adversely affect our reputation and our relationships with our customers and clients, and could also cause us to incur additional expenditures to repair or replace damaged equipment or sites. Our resiliency provisions and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to support continuity and reliability of service during disruptions or reduce the duration and impact of service outages. While we currently have commercial liability insurance, our insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not provide coverage at all for certain events. Furthermore, we may be unable to secure such insurance coverage at premiums acceptable to us in the future, or such insurance may become unavailable. Prolonged disruption of our services could also entitle our customers and clients to terminate their contracts with us or require us to pay penalties or damages. Any of the above factors may materially adversely affect our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our operations and team members throughout 2021.\n\nAlong with the continued and widely shared concerns about climaterelated and other environmental impacts on our business operations, there are growing expectations regarding the disclosure of environmental and sustainability governance strategies, targets, and risk management practices, including climate-related scenario analysis. In its 2021 Status Report, the TCFD stated that the number of organizations expressing support for TCFD had grown to more than 2,600 globally, with many companies having begun to implement TCFD recommendations. Our disclosure aligned with these recommendations can be found in our 2021 Annual Information Form.\n\nPotential impacts associated with low levels of non-ionizing radio frequency (RF) emissions from mobile phones and cell towers continue to be a matter of public concern, and will remain a public concern as we deploy 5G technology, with the number of small cells in our infrastructure expected to increase as we continue to upgrade our network.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe have in place widely recognized and award-winning business continuity and disaster recovery programs that encompass provisions for monitoring and preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery. These programs enhance the safety of our team members, minimize the potential impact of threats to our facilities, infrastructure and business operations, support the maintenance of service to our customers and help keep our communities connected.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our Corporate Business Continuity Office convened a cross-functional working group in January 2020, and in March 2020, our EMOC was activated. In 2021, EMOC continued to meet regularly to coordinate strategic management of the COVID-19 pandemic and advise on tactical issues such as doorto-door activities, retail safety measures, and technician safety in the field. COVID-19 case counts are closely monitored so that we can align our operations with public health measures within individual public health agency jurisdictions. These actions are likely to continue in 2022.\n\nWe also assembled a Medical Advisory Council (MAC), composed of leading medical professionals from across the country, along with other key leaders from within TELUS. The MAC meets regularly, advises on the Company's COVID-19 pandemic policy, and makes recommendations for specific health and safety measures, which are incorporated into our corporate infectious disease playbook and other guidance. These documents are continuously updated and provide foundational governance for all other pandemic-related playbooks for specific business functions.\n\nThe Corporate Business Continuity Office convened the EMOC an additional two times in 2021 to manage the impacts on TELUS of wildfires and flooding in British Columbia.\n\nWe are committed to following sustainable and responsible business practices and making decisions that balance economic growth with social and environmental benefits. We have implemented award-winning sustainability and environmental governance practices and related disclosure. The Corporate Governance Committee of our Board is responsible for oversight of corporate social responsibility and climate-related risks. Our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Team exercise oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities and provide approval of the overall strategic direction of our sustainability programs. Our Sustainability and Environmental Compliance team prepares quarterly reports for the Corporate Governance Committee, as well as other updates for the Board as required, on risks, targets and other key performance metrics related to climate change and the environment.",

Included are approaches to assessing impacts of these risks using scenario analysis, as well as strategies for addressing impacts of these risks, risk management practices pertaining to these risks, and the metrics and targets used to manage them. Scenario analysis in 2021 included a consideration of risks and opportunities under a low-carbon adoption scenario and an extreme global warming scenario. Additionally, we have established corporate targets with respect to operational net carbon neutrality, renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste reduction. Included in these are science-based targets, approved by the Science-based Targets initiative, for our scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Related action plans include having executed multiple power purchase agreements for renewable energy.\n\nAn ISO 14001:2015 certified environmental management system is in place to identify and control environmental impacts associated with our operations and to support compliance with regulatory requirements. We continue to identify new ways to reduce our environmental impact.\n\nSee our climate-related financial disclosure in Section 5.2 of our 2021 Annual Information Form. Additionally, a detailed report of our environmental risk mitigation activities and details with respect to our targets can be found in our sustainability report at telus.com/sustainability .\n\nCanada's federal government is responsible for establishing safe limits for human exposure to RF electromagnetic fields. We are confident that the mobile handsets and devices we sell, and our cell towers and other associated devices, comply, in all material respects, with all applicable Canadian and U.S. government safety standards. We continue to monitor new published studies, government regulations and public concerns about the health impacts of RF exposure. Stakeholder engagement also continues as part of the regulatory process concerning the installation of new cell towers.\n\n## 10/period.ss0113 /R.ss04ea/l.ss08 estate matters\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur real estate properties (owned or leased) include administrative office spaces, mixed-use office, commercial and residential properties, all of which may be developed through joint ventures, as well as other real estate development projects that advance our social purpose, work centres and space for telecommunications equipment. Some buildings are constructed on leasehold land and the majority of wireless radio antennae are on towers that are situated on lands or are on buildings held under leases or licences with varying terms. We currently participate in two real estate joint ventures.\n\nInvestments in real estate property development, including return on investment and benefits realization, may be impacted by local economies, changes in construction costs and timelines, financing costs and partnership agreements. Our current and future investments in real estate may also be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as we continue to take precautionary measures and follow public health guidelines and restrictions to minimize the spread of the virus to our team members, tenants and the communities in which we operate.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nRisks associated with our real estate investments include possible financing risks and uncertainty of future demand, occupancy and rental rates especially during the pandemic. There can be no assurance that future\n\nreal estate developments will be completed on budget or on time or will obtain lease commitments as planned. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk of loss on investment and loan amounts should a project's business plan not be successfully realized.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOver the course of 2021, we have:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Renegotiated and executed two agreements with external global real estate experts for property management and the maintenance and repair of our real estate assets and subject to performance measures overseen by us\n- /bullet.ss01 Entered into binding joint venture development agreements with an external real estate development firm for the redevelopment of two surplus real estate sites\n- /bullet.ss01 Started executing on our real estate future mode of operation, which involves consolidation of a number of large office holdings throughout the country representing roughly a floor area reduction of 25% of our office space and have undertaken a floor and building hibernation program during the COVID-19 lockdowns to mitigate real estate operating costs\n- /bullet.ss01 Downsized our critical network infrastructure in existing network buildings and reduced required equipment space through customer migrations from copper to fibre-based services.\n\nTELUS Sky has completed its development phase and additional office and residential leasing is underway. TELUS Ocean in Victoria, B.C. has received all required municipal planning approvals and commencement of construction and pre-leasing is planned for 2022.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nFor our construction projects (residential and commercial) in progress, budget overrun risks have been mitigated with fixed-price supply contracts and expert project management oversight. Costs for the real estate projects are monitored through our capital gating and approval processes and we aim to mitigate leasing risk of vacant space by arranging pre-lease agreements with prospective tenants prior to construction completion.\n\nOn new deals, joint venture partners and developers are compensated partially on a performance basis that encourages projects to meet timing and budget objectives and we engage independent third-party consultants to verify key assumptions such as market rental rates, construction costs and management costs. We also rely on our internal and external legal teams to ensure that contracts, partnerships and procurements with third parties are created to ensure our interests are represented.\n\nWe plan in advance our lease strategy for those properties that are not directly owned including quarterly reviews for continued requirement/ demand, lease expiry risk, rental rate risk, landlord risk and physical risk (such as poor building condition or flooding).\n\n## 10/period.ss0114 F/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01ng/comma.ss01 debt and d/i.ss01v/i.ss01dends\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nRisk factors, such as fluctuations in capital markets, the economic environment or regulatory requirements pertaining to bank capitalization, lending activity or changes in the number of Canadian chartered banks, may impact the availability of capital and the cost of capital for investment-grade corporate issuers, including us.",

        "page_content": "The market price of our Common Shares may be affected by various factors, such as TELUS Corporation's continued access to bank credit facilities, trade receivables securitization and public debt markets, as well as the continuation of the dividend growth plan outlined in our multi-year objectives.\n\nThe trading price may also be affected by TI factors, such as:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The market price of TI subordinate voting shares\n- /bullet.ss01 Actions taken or statements made by TELUS, TI or others concerning our relationship with TI\n- /bullet.ss01 TI's access to banks and public markets\n- /bullet.ss01 Factors affecting the performance of TI, that may impact TI's financial performance and subsequently our financial performance.\n\nOur financial instruments, and the nature of the credit risks, liquidity risks and market risks to which they may be subject, are described in Section 7.9 Financial instruments, commitments and contingent liabilities .\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur business plans and growth could be negatively affected if current financing is not sufficient to cover funding requirements. External capital market conditions could potentially affect our ability to make strategic investments or meet ongoing capital funding requirements, and may prohibit the roll-over of commercial paper at low rates.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings. Given the cash demands of the 3500 MHz spectrum auction held in 2021 and upcoming spectrum auctions, we may be unable to lower our net debt to EBITDA ratio to our objective range in the medium term, which could eventually have a negative impact on our credit ratings. Our cost of capital could increase and our access to capital could be affected by a reduction in the credit ratings of TELUS and/or TELUS Communications Inc. (TCI). A reduction in our ratings from the current BBB+ or equivalent could result in an increase in our cost of capital.\n\nWhile future free cash flows and sources of capital are expected to be sufficient to meet current requirements, our intention to return capital to shareholders could constrain our ability to invest in our operations for future growth.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nAt December 31, 2021, our senior unsecured debt was approximately $17.8 billion (see the Senior unsecured debt principal maturities chart in Section 4.3 ). We operate a commercial paper program (maximum of US$1.5 billion) that currently provides access to low-cost funding. As at December 31, 2021, we had $1.9 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$1.5 billion). When we issue commercial paper, it must be refinanced on an ongoing basis in order to realize the cost savings relative to borrowing on the $2.75 billion credit facility.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe may finance future capital funding requirements with internally generated cash flows, including the possible monetization of non-core assets and cash-generating working capital initiatives, borrowings under the unutilized portion of our bank credit facilities, use of securitized trade receivables, use of commercial paper and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities. We have a shelf prospectus in effect until June 2023, under which we can offer up to $2.75 billion of debt or equity securities as of the date of this MD&A. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings, coupled with our efforts to maintain a constructive relationship\n\nwith banks, investors and credit rating agencies, continue to provide reasonable access to capital markets.\n\nTo enable us to meet our financial objective of generally maintaining $1.0 billion of available liquidity, we have a $2.75 billion credit facility that expires on April 1, 2026 ($850 million available at December 31, 2021), as well as availability under other bank credit facilities (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ). In addition, our TCI subsidiary has an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust, ending December 31, 2024, under which it is able to sell an interest in certain of its trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million, of which $500 million was available at December 31, 2021 (see Section 7.7 Sale of trade receivables ).\n\nWe successfully completed a number of debt transactions in 2020 and 2021 (see Section 7.4 ). As a result, the average term to maturity of our long-term debt (excluding commercial paper, the revolving component of the TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility (TI credit facility), lease liabilities and other long-term debt) was 12.5 years at December 31, 2021 (compared to 12.2 years at December 31, 2020), and the average cost of our long-term debt was 3.72% (excluding commercial paper, the revolving component of the TI credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt). Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency risk arising from the issuance of commercial paper and substantially all long-term, fixed-term debt denominated in U.S. dollars. Our commercial paper program is fully backstopped by our $2.75 billion credit facility.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, TELUS International (Cda) Inc. had a credit facility consisting of US$850 million of revolving components and US$850 million of amortizing term loan components. For further details on the TI credit facility, see Section 7.6 Credit facilities .\n\nWe manage our capital structure and adjust it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our business and telecommunications infrastructure. We have financial policies in place that are reviewed annually and are intended to help maintain our existing investment grade credit ratings in the range of BBB+ or the equivalent. Four credit rating agencies currently have ratings that are in line with this target. Access to our $2.75 billion credit facility would be maintained, even if our ratings were reduced to below BBB+.\n\nFunding for future spectrum licence purchases, defined benefit pension plan obligations and any increases in corporate income tax rates will reduce the after-tax cash flow otherwise available to return to our shareholders. Should actual results differ from our expectations, there can be no assurance that we will not change our financing plans, including our intention to pay dividends according to our payout policy guidelines and to maintain our multi-year dividend growth program. No shares were purchased in 2021 under the normal course issuer bid (NCIB) program. In June 2021, we received approval for an NCIB to purchase and cancel up to 16 million Common Shares (to a maximum of $250 million) from June 4, 2021, to June 3, 2022, which would allow us to purchase our Common Shares if and when we consider it advantageous, based on our financial position and outlook, and the market price of our Common Shares. For further details on our multiyear dividend growth program and NCIB program, see Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources .\n\nOur Board of Directors reviews and approves the declaration of a dividend each quarter, and the amount of the dividend, based on a number of factors, including our financial position and outlook. This assessment is subject to various assumptions and the impact of various risks and uncertainties, including those described here in Section 10 .",

        "page_content": "## 10/period.ss0115 Tax matters\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nWe collect and pay significant amounts of indirect taxes, such as goods and services taxes, harmonized sales taxes, provincial sales taxes, sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, to various tax authorities. As our operations are complex and the related tax interpretations, regulations, legislation and jurisprudence that pertain to our activities are subject to continual change and evolving interpretation, the final determination of the taxation of many transactions is uncertain. Moreover, the implementation of new legislation in itself has its own complexities, including those of execution where multiple systems are involved and the interpretation of new rules as they apply to specific transactions, products and services.\n\nTELUS, along with TI and TELUS Agriculture, operates in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, India, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, which increases our exposure to multiple forms of taxation. Generally, each jurisdiction has taxation peculiarities in the forms of taxation imposed (e.g. value-added tax, gross receipts tax, stamp and transfer tax, and income tax), and differences in the applicable tax base and tax rates, legislation and tax treaties, as well as currency and language differences. In addition, the telecommunications industry faces unique issues that lead to uncertainty in the application of tax laws and the division of tax between domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nWe are subject to the risk that income and indirect tax amounts, including tax expense, may be materially different than anticipated, and that a general tendency by domestic and foreign tax collection authorities to adopt more stringent interpretations and aggressive auditing practices could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe have significant current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax expenses and cash tax payments. Income tax amounts are based on our estimates, applying accounting principles that recognize the benefit of income tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of a position will result in the related benefit being realized. The assessment of the likelihood and amount of income tax benefits, as well as the timing of realization of such amounts, can materially affect the determination of net income or cash flows. We expect the income taxes calculated at applicable statutory rates to range between 25.2 to 25.8% in 2022 (compared to 25.8% in 2021). These expectations can change as a result of changes in interpretations, regulations, legislation or jurisprudence.\n\nThe timing of the monetization of deferred income tax amounts is uncertain, as it is dependent upon our future earnings and other events. The amounts of deferred income tax liabilities are also uncertain, as the amounts are based on substantively enacted future income tax rates that were in effect at the time of deferral, which can be changed by tax authorities. As well, the amounts of cash tax payments and current and deferred income tax liabilities are also based on our anticipated mix of revenues among the jurisdictions in which we operate, which is also subject to change.\n\nThe audit and review activities of tax authorities affect the ultimate determination of the actual amounts of indirect taxes payable or receivable, income taxes payable or receivable, deferred income tax liabilities, taxes on certain items included within capital and income tax expense. Therefore, there can be no assurance that taxes will be payable as anticipated and/or that the amount and timing of receipt or use of the tax-related assets will be as currently expected.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nGlobal and local tax policies are subject to continual change, which increases the complexity of taxation.\n\nCanada, together with approximately 140 other countries comprising the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), approved in principle in 2021 model Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules. These proposals introduced a form of 15% global minimum tax which is intended to be effective in 2023. Similar proposals were introduced by the European Commission in December 2021. These proposals, together with related changes to domestic laws and tax treaties, may result in an increase to our effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe follow a comprehensive tax strategy that has been adopted by our Board. This strategy outlines the principles underlying and guiding the roles of team members, their responsibilities and personal conduct, the method of conducting business in relation to tax law and the approaches to working relationships with external tax authorities and external advisors. This strategy recognizes the requirement to comply with all relevant tax laws. The components necessary to manage tax risk are outlined in the strategy.\n\nIn giving effect to this strategy, we maintain an internal Taxation department composed of professionals who stay current on domestic and foreign tax obligations, supplemented where appropriate with external advisors. This team reviews systems and process changes for compliance with applicable domestic and international taxation laws and regulations. Its members are also responsible for the specialized accounting required for income taxes.\n\nMaterial transactions are reviewed by our Taxation department so that transactions of an unusual or non-recurring nature are assessed from multiple risk-based perspectives. As a matter of regular practice, large transactions are reviewed by external tax advisors, while other third-party advisors may also be engaged to express their views as to the potential for tax liability. We continue to review and monitor our activities, so that we can take action to comply with any related regulatory, legal and tax obligations. In some cases, we also engage external advisors to review our systems and processes for tax-related compliance. The advice provided and tax returns prepared by such advisors and counsel are reviewed for reasonableness by our internal Taxation department.\n\n## 10/period.ss0116 The economy\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nRisks to the Canadian economy include: fluctuations in oil prices, potential rises in interest rates and levels of consumer and mortgage debt, an acceleration in inflation, fluctuations in the housing market, the timing and rate of economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertainty related to trade issues, including the ongoing imposition of tariffs, supply chain disruption and climate change.",

        "page_content": "In addition, as we expand our international operations through acquisitions, such as those within our TI and TELUS Agriculture businesses, we become more susceptible to global market conditions. Meanwhile, trade disputes between countries, as well as other economic and political uncertainties and developments outside of Canada, may have global implications, as supply chains have become increasingly integrated.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nEconomic uncertainty may cause consumers and business customers to reduce or delay discretionary spending, impacting new service purchases, volumes of use and substitution by lower-priced alternatives.\n\nGlobally, some countries may require financial support, sovereign credit ratings may continue to decline, and there may be a default on the sovereign debt obligations of certain countries. Any of these economic outcomes may increase the cost of borrowing and cause credit to become more limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial performance and cash flows. Economic and political uncertainty could undermine business confidence and cause potential new clients of TI to delay engaging TI, and could also cause existing clients to reduce or defer spending on TI's services or reduce or eliminate spending under existing contracts with TI.\n\nFluctuations in the Canadian economy could adversely impact growth in our customer base revenue, profitability and free cash flow, and could potentially require us to record impairments in the carrying values of our assets, including, but not limited to, our intangible assets with indefinite lives (spectrum licences and goodwill). Impairments in the carrying values of our assets would result in a charge to earnings and a reduction in owners' equity, but would not affect cash flow. Rising inflationary expectations could lead to increases in input costs such as labour, which may not be offset by revenue increases. In addition, ongoing international supply chain disruptions may make it difficult to source key components (such as handsets) in sufficient quantities and at reasonable prices.\n\nFluctuations in the global economy could affect different industry verticals in different ways. Counter-cyclical industries such as agriculture and logistics should remain reasonably unaffected, as food producers, distributors and retailers would continue to operate. Healthcare, particularly products and services related to logistics or vaccines, should do well as vaccines are rolled out, and hospitals and healthcare providers in certain countries could perform well. Cyclical industries such as retail, travel and hospitality, and others will continue to be negatively affected as consumers alter their behaviour because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWith certain acquisitions, operating costs and revenues, including TI's revenues, denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-Canadian dollar currencies, fluctuations in the Canadian dollar exchange rate may impact our financial and operating results.\n\nEconomic and capital market fluctuations could also adversely affect the investment performance, funding and expense associated with our defined benefit pension plans, as obligations are based on certain actuarial assumptions related to expected plan asset returns, salary escalation, retirement ages, life expectancy, the performance of financial markets and future interest rates.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nIn 2021, both the Canadian and the global economy continued to perform at suboptimal levels relative to their performance prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were indications of a recovery in the fourth quarter of 2021, as high vaccination rates appeared to be lessening the impact of the fourth wave in Canada compared to many other western countries. However, the emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2021 (which has continued into early 2022) has rekindled economic uncertainty with respect to 2022. The opening of the U.S.-Canada border in the fourth quarter of 2021 was expected to lead to improved roaming revenue in the first few months of 2022; however, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant is having a negative impact and there is no assurance that the border will remain open or that international travel will increase. Meanwhile, new COVID-19 variants (in addition to Omicron) may impact consumer behaviour, including international travel, and may lead to a delayed recovery in roaming revenue. We expect that the pandemic will continue to present challenges to both the Canadian and global economy throughout 2022, notwithstanding that vaccines have been developed and are being administered widely, including school-age children.\n\nInterest rates are now expected to rise in 2022 and 2023, with several central banks around the world making specific mention of this monetary tool to combat rising inflation. If monetary bodies raise interest rates more quickly and further than the economy can absorb, there is a risk that both the Canadian and the global economy could slide into a recession later in the year or in 2023.\n\nThe Canadian dollar exchange rate with the U.S. dollar remained the same at $1.27 at the end of 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe employee defined benefit pension plans, in aggregate with the application of the asset ceiling, were in a $190 million deficit position at December 31, 2021 (compared to a $913 million deficit position at the end of 2020). The solvency position, as determined under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 , was estimated to be a surplus of $1,366 million at the end of 2021 (compared to a $375 million surplus at the end of 2020).\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWhile economic risks cannot be completely mitigated, our top priority of putting customers first and pursuing global leadership in the likelihood of our customers recommending our products, services and people also supports our efforts to acquire and retain customers through the economic fluctuations that affect them and us. We also continue to pursue cost reduction and efficiency initiatives across our business operations. See Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources for our capital structure financial policies and plans.\n\nAn increase in our revenue denominated in U.S. dollars may help to mitigate currency risk, as our revenue base has been primarily in Canadian dollars.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and currency options are leveraged to fix the exchange rates on U.S. dollar-denominated transactions, commitments, commercial paper and U.S. Dollar Notes in order to help mitigate risks related to exchange rate fluctuations, and we seek to mitigate pension risk through the application of policies and procedures for managing exposure to investment risk and through ongoing monitoring of our funding position. Our best estimate of cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2022 is $32.0 million ($50.6 million in 2021).",

The expansion of our product and service offerings into areas such as managed services, security, healthcare and agriculture technology, and the initial public offering of shares by TI in February 2021 have also added to our compliance requirements, the risk of litigation and the possibility of damages, sanctions and fines. We may also be the target of class actions due to our millions of customer relationships. In addition, like other public companies, we may be subject to civil liability for misrepresentations in written disclosure and oral statements, and liability for fraud and market manipulation.\n\nThe intellectual property and proprietary rights of owners and developers of hardware, software, business processes and other technologies may be protected under statute, such as patent, copyright and industrial design legislation, or under common law, such as trade secrets. Significant damages may be awarded in intellectual property infringement claims and defendants may incur significant costs to defend or settle such claims.\n\nPotentially material certified and uncertified class actions, intellectual property litigation and other claims against us are detailed in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nWith operations in foreign jurisdictions, we are required to comply not only with Canadian laws and regulations, but also with local laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations may differ substantially from Canadian laws and add to our regulatory, legal and tax exposures. We continue to extend our business and our operations into additional jurisdictions, and expand our product and service offerings in such jurisdictions, and this may also add to our regulatory, legal and tax exposure. In certain cases, laws with extraterritorial application may also impose obligations on us. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\n## Potential impact\n\nIt is not currently possible to predict the outcome of such legal matters due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; incomplete factual records; the uncertain nature of legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and appellate levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nWe are typically required to process, and sometimes collect and/or store sensitive data, including, but not limited to, personal data regulated by data protection and privacy legislation, where applicable, including the General Data Protection Regulation , the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act , California Consumer Privacy Act , the California Invasion of Privacy Act , Personal Data Protection Bill of 2018 , and the Data Privacy Act of 2012 . The adoption and enforcement by governments of increasingly stringent privacy legislation may increase our exposure to risks related to compliance and liability. A successful class action lawsuit or intellectual property infringement claim, by its nature, could result in a sizeable damages award that could negatively affect a defendant's financial or operating results.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our financial or operating results will not be negatively impacted by any of these factors.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nAs our TELUS Health team and medical clinics offer new services (such as virtual care and electronic prescriptions), including in some cases to consumers and in other cases through third-party\n\npartnerships, new risks arise from parameters such as dependence on third-party suppliers for legal compliance and/or compliance with medical professional standards, as well as a heightened possibility of political intervention.\n\nAs we add to our offerings in agriculture technology (such as animal health and management) and the jurisdictions in which we offer them, we face increased risks with respect to regulatory compliance and data security and privacy.\n\nWith the growth and development of technology-based industries, the value of intellectual property and proprietary rights has increased. Due to trends in awards for damages, costs to defend and the likelihood of settlements, property rights holders may be encouraged to aggressively pursue infringement claims. Given the vast array of technologies and systems that we use to deliver products and services, and the rapid change and complexity characteristic of such technologies, the number of disputes over intellectual property and proprietary rights can reasonably be expected to increase.\n\nThe Province of Quebec has made amendments to the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector , as noted in Section 10.3 . Over three years, the amendments will phase in major changes and new regulatory requirements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe believe that we have in place reasonable policies, controls, processes and contractual arrangements, as well as insurance coverage, intended to enable compliance and reduce our exposure to any related risks. We have a designated Chief Data and Trust Officer, whose role is to work across the enterprise to ensure that TELUS has in place appropriate processes and controls in order to facilitate legal compliance and to report on compliance to the Audit Committee.\n\nOur team of legal professionals advise on and manage risks related to claims and possible claims, vigorously defend class actions and other claims, pursue settlements in appropriate cases, regularly assess our business practices and monitor legal developments that may impact risk. They seek and obtain contractual protections consistent with standard industry practices to help mitigate the risks of intellectual property infringements and work to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation and other means.\n\nWe have a corporate disclosure policy that restricts disclosure by team members, defines the role of Company spokesperson, provides a protocol for communicating with investment analysts, investors and others, and outlines our communications approach.\n\nWe rely on our team members, officers, Board of Directors, key suppliers and other business partners to demonstrate behaviour consistent with applicable legal and ethical standards in all jurisdictions within which we operate. We have an anti-bribery and corruption policy, a comprehensive code of ethics and conduct for our team members and Board of Directors, and mandatory annual integrity training for all team members and identified contractors.\n\nSubject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and the information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability relating to existing investigations, claims and lawsuits, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, excepting the items disclosed herein and in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.",

As non-GAAP measures generally do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For certain financial metrics, there are definitional differences between TELUS and TELUS International reporting. These differences largely arise from TELUS International adopting definitions consistent with practice in its industry. Securities regulations require such measures to be clearly defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measure. Certain of the metrics do not have generally accepted industry definitions.\n\n## Reconciliation of adjusted Net income\n\n## Adjusted Net income and adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS):\n\nThese are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS-IASB and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures, long-term debt prepayment premium and other adjustments (identified in the following tables). Adjusted basic EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by the basic weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate performance at a consolidated level and exclude items that, in management's view, may obscure underlying trends in business performance or items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations. They should not be considered alternatives to Net income and basic EPS in measuring TELUS' performance.\n\n|                                                                                                                     | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| ($ millions)                                                                                                        | 2021                                | 2020                                | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Net income attributable to Common Shares                                                                            | 644                                 | 260                                 | 1,655                     | 1,207                     |\n| Add (deduct) amounts net of amount   attributable to non-controlling interests:                                     |                                     |                                     |                           |                           |\n| Restructuring and other costs                                                                                       | 43                                  | 65                                  | 170                       | 244                       |\n| Tax effect of restructuring and other costs                                                                         | (11)                                | (15)                                | (41 )                     | (62)                      |\n| Income tax-related adjustments                                                                                      | 3                                   | (23)                                | (16)                      | (26)                      |\n| Other equity losses related to real estate joint ventures                                                           | 1                                   | 2                                   | 3                         | 19                        |\n| Long-term debt prepayment premium                                                                                   | -

EBITDA is commonly reported and widely used by investors and lending institutions as an indicator of a company's operating performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income in measuring TELUS' performance, nor should it be used as a measure of cash flow. EBITDA as calculated by TELUS is equivalent to Operating revenues and other income less the total of Goods and services purchased expense and Employee benefits expense.\n\n## EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliations\n\nWe calculate EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs, as it is a component of the EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage ratio and the Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio.\n\nWe also calculate Adjusted EBITDA to exclude items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations and should not, in our opinion, be considered in a long-term valuation metric or should not be included in an assessment of our ability to service or incur debt.\n\nEBIT (earnings before interest and income taxes) is calculated for our operating segments because we believe it is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance as it represents our earnings from operations before costs of capital structure and income taxes.\n\n|                                                           | TTech   | TTech   | DLCX   | DLCX   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Fourth quarters ended December 31 ($ millions)            | 2021    | 2020    | 2021   | 2020   | 2021    | 2020    |\n| Net income                                                |         |         |        |        | 663     | 271     |\n| Financing costs                                           |         |         |        |        | 192     | 190     |\n| Income taxes                                              |         |         |        |        | 197     | 86      |\n| EBIT                                                      | 973     | 495     | 79     | 52     | 1,052   | 547     |\n| Depreciation                                              | 508     | 504     | 37     | 35     | 545     | 539     |\n| Amortization of intangible assets                         | 240     | 221     | 45     | 29     | 285     | 250     |\n| EBITDA                                                    | 1,721   | 1,220   | 161    | 116    | 1,882   | 1,336   |\n| Add restructuring and other costs included in EBITDA      | 36      | 39      | 8      | 32     | 44      | 71      |\n| EBITDA -

It should not be considered as an alternative to the measures in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow excludes certain working capital changes (such as trade receivables and trade payables), proceeds from divested assets and other sources and uses of cash, as found in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. It provides an indication of how much cash generated by operations is available after capital expenditures (excluding purchases of spectrum licences) that may be used to, among other things, pay dividends, repay debt, purchase shares or make other investments. We exclude impacts of accounting changes that do not impact cash, such as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. Free cash flow may be supplemented from time to time by proceeds from divested assets or financing activities.\n\n|                                                                                                                  | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| ($ millions)                                                                                                     | 2021                                | 2020                                | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| EBITDA                                                                                                           | 1,882                               | 1,336                               | 6,290                     | 5,494                     |\n| Deduct gain on disposition of financial solutions business                                                       | (410)                               | -

Compared to ARPU, this measure provides management with a view of average monthly cash receipts from mobile services subscribers by reversing impacts of allocation of revenue to upfront performance obligations due to IFRS 15, in addition to device financing receipts, and is used to evaluate historical trending of an equivalent metric prior to the application of IFRS 15 and introduction of the device financing program.\n\n## Calculation of mobile phone ABPU\n\n|                                                                                               | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                                               | 2021                                | 2020                                | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Numerator                                                                                     |                                     |                                     |                           |                           |\n| Mobile network revenue ($ millions)                                                           | 1,591                               | 1,515                               | 6,208                     | 6,030                     |\n| Re-payments of the outstanding device balance   owing from customers on contract ($ millions) | 350                                 | 342                                 | 1,389                     | 1,374                     |\n|                                                                                               | 1,941                               | 1,857                               | 7,597                     | 7,404                     |\n| Denominator - Simple average number   of subscribers during the period/one.numr (millions)    | 9.234                               | 8.880                               | 9.070                     | 8.752                     |\n| Annual average of billing per subscriber unit ($)                                             | 210                                 | 209                                 | 838                       | 846                       |\n| Divide by number of months during the period                                                  | 3                                   | 3                                   | 12                        | 12                        |\n| Mobile phone ABPU  ($)                                                                        | 70.09                               | 69.70                               | 69.83                     | 70.49                     |\n\n## Mobile phone average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU)\n\nis calculated as network revenue derived from monthly service plan, roaming and usage charges; divided by the average number of mobile phone subscribers on the network during the period, and is expressed as a rate per month.\n\nNet debt: We believe that net debt is a useful measure because it represents the amount of Short-term borrowings and long-term debt obligations that are not covered by available Cash and temporary investments. The nearest IFRS measure to net debt is Long-term debt, including Current maturities of Long-term debt. Net debt is a component of the Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio.\n\n## Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs:\n\nThis measure is defined as net debt at the end of the period divided by 12-month trailing EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice-president and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nBased on the assessment referenced in the preceding paragraph, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2021. In connection with this assessment, no material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting were identified by management as of December 31, 2021.\n\nDeloitte LLP, an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, audited the Company's Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, and as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, they have expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDoug French Executive Vice-president and Chief Financial Officer February 10, 2022\n\nDarren Entwistle President and Chief Executive Officer February 10, 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and its financial performance and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants February 10, 2022 Vancouver, Canada\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 10, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants February 10, 2022 Vancouver, Canada",

The generally accepted accounting principles that we apply are International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS-IASB), and Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require that we disclose the accounting policies we have selected in those instances in which we have been obligated to choose from among various accounting policies that comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In certain other instances, including those in which no selection among policies is allowed, we are also required to disclose how we have applied certain accounting policies. In the selection and application of accounting policies, we consider, among other factors, the fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful financial information, namely relevance and faithful representation.

In the normal course, we make changes to our assessments regarding materiality for presentation so that they reflect current economic conditions. Due consideration is given to the view that it is reasonable to expect differing opinions of what is, and is not, material.\n- /bullet.ss01 In respect of revenue-generating transactions, we must make judgments that affect the timing of the recognition of revenue, as set out following:\n- /bullet.ss01 We have millions of multi-year contracts with our customers and we must make judgments about when we have satisfied our performance obligations to our customers, either over a period of time or at a point in time. Service revenues are recognized based upon customers' access to, or usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure; we believe that this method faithfully depicts the transfer of the services, and thus the revenues are recognized as the services are made available and/or rendered. We consider our performance obligations arising from the sale of equipment to have been satisfied when the equipment has been delivered to, and accepted by, the end-user customers (see (e) following).\n- /bullet.ss01 Principally in the context of revenue-generating transactions involving mobile handsets, we must make judgments as to whether third-party re-sellers that deliver equipment to our customers are acting in the transactions as principals or as our agents. Upon due consideration of the relevant indicators, we believe that the decision to consider the re-sellers to be acting, solely for accounting purposes, as our agents is more representative of the economic substance of the transactions, as we are the primary obligor to\n\nthe end-user customers. The effect of this judgment is that no equipment revenue is recognized upon the transfer of inventory to third-party re-sellers.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We compensate third-party re-sellers and our employees for generating revenues, and we must make judgments as to whether such sales-based compensation amounts are costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers that should be capitalized (see Note 20 ). We believe that compensation amounts tangentially attributable to obtaining a contract with a customer, because the amount of such compensation could be affected in ways other than by simply obtaining that contract, should be expensed as incurred; compensation amounts directly attributable to obtaining a contract with a customer should be capitalized and subsequently amortized on a systematic basis, consistent with the satisfaction of our associated performance obligations.\n\nJudgment must also be exercised in the capitalization of costs incurred to fulfill revenue-generating contracts with customers. Such fulfilment costs are those incurred to set up, activate or otherwise implement services involving access to, or usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure that would not otherwise be capitalized as property, plant, equipment and/or intangible assets (see Note 20 ).\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The decision to depreciate and amortize any property, plant, equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) and intangible assets that are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis, as we believe that this method reflects the consumption of resources related to the economic lifespan of those assets better than an accelerated method and is more representative of the economic substance of the underlying use of those assets.\n- /bullet.ss01 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments that affect the financial statement disclosure of information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision-maker used to",

        "page_content": "make resource allocation decisions and to assess performance (segment information, Note 5 ). A significant judgment we have historically made is in respect of distinguishing between our wireless and wireline operations and cash flows (and this extends to allocations of both direct and indirect expenses and capital expenditures). The clarity of this distinction has been increasingly affected by the convergence and integration of our wireless and wireline telecommunications infrastructure technology and operations. Less than one-half of the operating expenses included in the segment performance measure reported to our chief operating decision-maker during the year ended December 31, 2020, were direct costs; judgment, largely based upon historical experience, was applied in apportioning indirect expenses that were not objectively distinguishable between our wireless and wireline operations.\n\nUntil recently, our judgment was that our wireless and wireline telecommunications infrastructure technology and operations had not experienced sufficient convergence to objectively make their respective operations and cash flows practically indistinguishable. The continued build-out of our technology-agnostic fibre-optic infrastructure, in combination with converged edge network technology, has significantly affected this judgment, as have the commercialization of fixed-wireless telecommunications solutions for customers and the consolidation of our non-customer facing operations.\n\nAs a result, it has become increasingly difficult and impractical to objectively and clearly distinguish between our wireless and wireline operations and cash flows, and the assets from which those cash flows arise. Our judgment as to whether these operations can continue to be judged to be individual components of the business and discrete operating segments has changed; effective January 1, 2020, we embarked upon the modification of our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to accommodate the technology convergence-driven cessation of the historical distinction between our wireless and wireline operations at the level of regularly reported discrete performance measures that are provided to our chief operating decision-maker. We transitioned to a new segment reporting structure during the first quarter of 2021 (see Note 5 ).\n\nThe impracticality of objectively distinguishing between our wireless and wireline cash flows, and the assets from which those cash flows arise, is evidence of their increasing interdependence, and this has resulted in the unification of the wireless cash-generating unit and the wireline cash-generating unit as a single telecommunications cash-generating unit, and the identification of the digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International cash-generating unit, for impairment testing purposes (see Note 18(f) ). As our business continues to evolve, new cash-generating units may also develop.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The view that our spectrum licences granted by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (including spectrum licences that have been subordinated to us) will likely be renewed; that we intend to renew them; that we believe we have the financial and operational ability to renew them; and thus, that they have an indefinite life, as discussed further in Note 18(e) .\n- /bullet.ss01 In connection with the annual impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, there may be instances in which we must exercise judgment in allocating our net assets, including shared corporate and administrative assets, to our cash-generating units when determining their carrying amounts. Historically, these\n\njudgments were necessary because of the convergence that our wireless and wireline telecommunications infrastructure technology and operations had experienced to date, and because of our continuous development. There were instances in which similar judgments were also necessary in respect of future capital expenditures in support of both wireless and wireline operations, which were a component of the determination of recoverable amounts used in the annual impairment testing, as discussed further in Note 18(f) . judgments were necessary because of the convergence that our wireless and wireline telecommunications infrastructure technology and operations had experienced to date, and because of our continuous development. There were instances in which similar judgments were also necessary in respect of future capital expenditures in support of both wireless and wireline operations, which were a component of the determination of recoverable amounts used in the annual impairment testing, as discussed further in Note 18(f) .\n\n- /bullet.ss01 In respect of claims and lawsuits, as discussed further in Note 29(a) , the determination of whether an item is a contingent liability or whether an outflow of resources is probable and thus needs to be accounted for as a provision. /bullet.ss01 In respect of claims and lawsuits, as discussed further in Note 29(a) , the determination of whether an item is a contingent liability or whether an outflow of resources is probable and thus needs to be accounted for as a provision.\n\n## (c) F/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 /i.ss01nstruments - recogn/i.ss01t/i.ss01on and measurement\n\nIn respect of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments, we have adopted the following policies:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Regular-way purchases or sales of financial assets or financial liabilities (purchases or sales that require actual delivery of financial assets or financial liabilities) are recognized on the settlement date. We have selected this method as the benefits of using the trade date method were not expected to exceed the costs of selecting and implementing that method.\n- /bullet.ss01 Transaction costs, other than in respect of items held for trading, are added to the initial fair value of the acquired financial asset or financial liability. We have selected this method as we believe that it results in a better matching of the transaction costs with the periods in which we benefit from those costs.\n\n## (d) Hedge account/i.ss01ng\n\n## General\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to the financial instruments used to establish designated currency hedging relationships for certain U.S. dollar-denominated future purchase commitments and debt repayments, as set out in Note 4(a) and (d) .\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe purpose of hedge accounting, in respect of our designated hedging relationships, is to ensure that counterbalancing gains and losses are recognized in the same periods. We have chosen to apply hedge accounting, as we believe that it is more representative of the economic substance of the underlying transactions.\n\nIn order to apply hedge accounting, a high correlation (which indicates effectiveness) is required in the offsetting changes in the risk-associated values of the financial instruments (the hedging items) used to establish the designated hedging relationships and all, or a part, of the asset, liability or transaction having an identified risk exposure that we have taken steps to modify (the hedged items). We assess the anticipated effectiveness of designated hedging relationships at inception and their actual effectiveness for each reporting period thereafter. We consider a designated hedging relationship to be effective if the following critical terms match between the hedging item and the hedged item: the notional amount of the hedging item and the principal amount of the hedged item; maturity dates; payment dates; and interest rate index (if, and as, applicable). As set out in Note 4(i) , any ineffectiveness, such as would result from a difference between the notional amount of the hedging item and the principal amount of the hedged item, or from a previously",

The net difference, if any, between the amounts recognized in the determination of net income and the amounts necessary to reflect the fair value of the designated cash flow hedging items recorded in the Consolidated statements of financial position is recognized as a component of Other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 .\n\n## (e) /R.ss04evenue recogn/i.ss01t/i.ss01on\n\n## General\n\nWe earn the majority of our TELUS technology solutions service revenues from access to, and usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure, including:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Mobile network (voice and data);\n- /bullet.ss01 Fixed data services (which include: internet protocol; television; hosting, managed information technology and cloud-based services; software, data management and data analytics-driven smart-food chain technologies; and home and business security);\n- /bullet.ss01 Fixed voice services; and\n- /bullet.ss01 Health services.\n\nThe majority of the balance of our TELUS technology solutions revenues (mobile equipment and other service; fixed equipment and other service) arises from providing services and products facilitating access to, and usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure. Our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment service revenues arise from the provision of digital customer experience solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management solutions.\n\nWe offer complete and integrated solutions to meet our customers' needs. These solutions may involve deliveries of multiple services and products (our performance obligations) that occur at different points in time and/or over different periods of time; as referred to in (b) , this is a significant judgment for us. As required, the performance obligations of these multiple element arrangements are identified and the transaction price for the entire multiple element arrangement is determined and allocated among the performance obligations based upon our relative stand-alone selling prices for each of them; our relevant revenue recognition policies are then applied, so that revenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations. To the extent that variable consideration is included in determining the minimum transaction price, it is constrained to the 'minimum spend' amount required in a contract with a customer. Service revenues arising from contracts with customers typically have variable consideration, because customers have the ongoing ability to both add and remove features and services, and because customer usage of our telecommunications infrastructure may exceed the base amounts provided for in their contracts.\n\nFor purposes of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , our contracts with customers are not considered to have a significant\n\nfinancing component. With the exception of both equipment-related upfront payments that may be required under the terms of contracts with customers and in-store 'cash and carry' sales of equipment and accessories, payments are typically due 30 days from the billing date. Billings are typically rendered on a monthly basis.\n\nMultiple contracts with a single customer are normally accounted for as separate arrangements. In instances where multiple contracts are entered into with a customer in a short period of time, the contracts are reviewed as a group to ensure that, as with multiple element arrangements, their relative transaction prices are appropriate.\n\nLease accounting is applied to an accounting unit if it conveys to a customer the right to use a specific asset but does not convey the risks and/or benefits of ownership.\n\nOur revenues are recorded net of any value-added and/or sales taxes billed to the customer concurrent with a revenue-generating transaction.\n\nWe use the following revenue accounting practical expedients provided for in IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers :\n\n- /bullet.ss01 No adjustment of the contracted amount of consideration for the effects of financing components when, at the inception of a contract, we expect that the effect of the financing component is not significant at the individual contract level.\n- /bullet.ss01 No deferral of contract acquisition costs when the amortization period for such costs would be one year or less.\n- /bullet.ss01 When estimating minimum transaction prices allocated to any remaining unfulfilled, or partially unfulfilled, performance obligations, exclusion of amounts arising from contracts originally expected to have a duration of one year or less, as well as amounts arising from contracts under which we may recognize and bill revenue in an amount that corresponds directly with our completed performance obligations.\n\n## Contract assets\n\nMany of our multiple element arrangements arise from bundling the sale of equipment (e.g. a mobile handset) with a contracted service period. Although the customer receives the equipment at contract inception and the revenue from the associated completed performance obligation is recognized at that time, the customer's payment for the equipment will effectively be received rateably over the contracted service period to the extent it is not received as a lump-sum amount at contract inception. The difference between the equipment revenue recognized and the associated amount cumulatively billed to the customer is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset and/or an unbilled customer finance receivable, depending upon the form of the contract.\n\nContract assets may also arise in instances where we give consideration to a customer. When we receive no identifiable, separable benefit for consideration given to a customer, the amount of the consideration is recognized as a reduction of revenue rather than as an expense. Such amounts are included in the determination of transaction prices for allocation purposes in multiple element arrangements.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Some forms of consideration given to a customer, effectively at contract inception, such as rebates (including prepaid non-bank cards) and/or equipment, are considered to be performance obligations in a multiple element arrangement. Although the performance obligation is satisfied at contract inception, the customer's payment associated with the performance obligation will effectively be",

The difference between the revenue arising from the satisfied performance obligation and the associated amount cumulatively billed to the customer is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Other forms of consideration given to a customer, either at contract inception or over a period of time, such as discounts (including prepaid bank cards), may result in us receiving no identifiable, separable benefit and thus are not considered performance obligations. Such consideration is recognized as a reduction of revenue rateably over the term of the contract. The difference between the consideration provided and the associated amount recognized as a reduction of revenue is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset.\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nAdvance billings are recorded when billing occurs prior to provision of the associated services; such advance billings are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services and/or equipment are provided (see Note 24 ). Similarly, and as appropriate, upfront customer activation and connection fees are deferred and recognized over the average expected term of the customer relationship.\n\n## Costs of contract acquisition and contract fulfilment\n\nCosts of contract acquisition (typically commissions) and costs of contract fulfilment are capitalized and recognized as an expense, generally over the life of the contract on a systematic and rational basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates. The amortization of such costs is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Goods and services purchased, with the exception of amounts paid to our employees, which are included as Employee benefits expense.\n\nThe total cost of mobile equipment sold to customers and advertising and promotion costs related to initial customer acquisition are expensed as incurred; the cost of equipment we own that is situated at customers' premises and associated installation costs are capitalized as incurred. Costs of advertising production, advertising airtime and advertising space are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Voice and data\n\nWe recognize revenues on an accrual basis and include an estimate of revenues earned but unbilled. Mobile and fixed service revenues are recognized based upon access to, and usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure and upon contract fees.\n\nAdvance billings are recorded when billing occurs prior to provision of the associated services; such advance billings are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services are provided. Similarly, and as appropriate, upfront customer activation and connection fees are deferred and recognized over the average expected term of the customer relationship.\n\nWe use the liability method of accounting for the amounts of our quality of service rate rebates that arise from the jurisdiction of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\n\nThe CRTC has established a mechanism to subsidize local exchange carriers, such as ourselves, that provide residential basic telephone service to high cost serving areas. The CRTC has determined the per\n\nnetwork access line/per band subsidy rate for all local exchange carriers. We recognize the subsidy on an accrual basis by applying the subsidy rate to the number of residential network access lines we provide in high cost serving areas, as discussed further in Note 7 . Differences, if any, between interim and final subsidy rates set by the CRTC are accounted for as a change in estimate in the period in which the CRTC finalizes the subsidy rate.\n\n## Other and mobile equipment\n\nWe recognize product revenues, including amounts related to mobile handsets sold to re-sellers and customer premises equipment, when the products are both delivered to, and accepted by, the end-user customers, irrespective of which supply channel delivers the product. With respect to mobile handsets sold to re-sellers, we consider ourselves to be the principal and primary obligor to the end-user customers. Revenues from operating leases of equipment are recognized on a systematic and rational basis (normally a straight-line basis) over the term of the lease. We recognize revenues that arise from the provision of software solutions in the accounting period in which they are provided.\n\nWe recognize revenues that arise from the provision of digital customer experience solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management solutions, in the accounting period in which they are provided, typically based upon per-productive hour or per transaction.\n\n## (f) Deprec/i.ss01at/i.ss01on/comma.ss01 amort/i.ss01zat/i.ss01on and /i.ss01mpa/i.ss01rment\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (lease terms for right-of-use lease assets) as determined by a continuing program of asset life studies. Depreciation includes amortization of leasehold improvements, which are normally amortized over the lesser of their expected average service lives or the terms of the associated leases. Intangible assets with finite lives (intangible assets subject to amortization) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as appropriate. As referred to in (b) , the use of a straight-line basis of depreciation and amortization is a significant judgment for us.\n\nEstimated useful lives for the majority of our property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                               | Estimated useful lives   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment (including right-  of-use lease assets) subject to depreciation |                          |\n| Network assets                                                                                |                          |\n| Outside plant                                                                                 | 17 to 40 years           |\n| Inside plant                                                                                  | 4 to 25 years            |\n| Mobile site equipment                                                                         | 5 to 7 years             |\n| Real estate right-of-use lease assets                                                         | 5 to 20 years            |\n| Balance of depreciable property, plant and   equipment and right-of-use lease assets          | 3 to 40 years            |\n| Intangible assets subject to amortization                                                     |                          |\n| Customer contracts and related customer relationships                                         | 4 to 15 years            |\n| Fixed subscriber base                                                                         | 25 years                 |\n| Software                                                                                      | 2 to 10 years            |\n| Access to rights-of-way, crowdsource assets and other                                         | 5 to 30 years            |",

        "page_content": "## Impairment - general\n\nImpairment testing compares the carrying values of the assets or cash-generating units being tested with their recoverable amounts (the recoverable amount being the greater of an asset's or a cashgenerating unit's value in use or its fair value less costs of disposal); as referred to in (b) , this is a significant estimate for us. Impairment losses are immediately recognized to the extent that the carrying value of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Should the recoverable amounts for impaired assets or cash-generating units subsequently increase, the impairment losses previously recognized (other than in respect of goodwill) may be reversed to the extent that the reversal is not a result of 'unwinding of the discount' and that the resulting carrying values do not exceed the carrying values which would have been the result if no impairment losses had been recognized previously.\n\n## Impairment - property, plant and equipment; intangible assets subject to amortization\n\nThe continuing program of asset life studies considers such items as the timing of technological obsolescence, competitive pressures and future infrastructure utilization plans; these considerations could also indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, in which case an impairment loss would be recognized.\n\n## Impairment - intangible assets with indefinite lives; goodwill\n\nThe carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are periodically tested for impairment. The frequency of the impairment testing is generally the reciprocal of the stability of the relevant events and circumstances, but intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill must, at a minimum, be tested annually; we have selected December as the time of our annual test.\n\nWe assess our intangible assets with indefinite lives by comparing the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units to their carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives allocated to a cash-generating unit, but excluding any goodwill allocated to a cashgenerating unit). To the extent that the carrying value of a cash-generating unit (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives allocated to the cash-generating unit, but excluding any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess amount would be recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\nSubsequent to assessing intangible assets with indefinite lives, we assess goodwill by comparing the recoverable amounts of our cashgenerating units (or group of cash-generating units) to their carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and any goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit(s)). To the extent that the carrying value of a cash-generating unit (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess amount would first be recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill and any remainder would be recorded as a reduction of the carrying values of the assets of the cash-generating unit on a pro-rated basis.\n\n## (g) Trans/l.ss08at/i.ss01on of fore/i.ss01gn currenc/i.ss01es\n\nTrade transactions completed in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the statement of financial position date, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs, as set out in Note 9 . Hedge accounting is applied in specific instances, as discussed further in (d) preceding.\n\nWe have foreign subsidiaries that do not have the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of these foreign subsidiaries' accounts into Canadian dollars are reported as a component of other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 .\n\n## (h) Income and other taxes\n\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes; as referred to in (b) , this is a significant estimate for us. Under this method, current income taxes are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and liabilities, and also for any benefits of losses and Investment Tax Credits available to be carried forward to future years for tax purposes that are more likely than not to be realized. The amounts recognized in respect of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based upon the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences or the usage of tax losses and the application of the substantively enacted tax rates at the time of reversal or usage.\n\nWe account for any changes in substantively enacted income tax rates affecting deferred income tax assets and liabilities in full in the period in which the changes are substantively enacted. We account for changes in the estimates of tax balances for prior years as estimate revisions in the period in which changes in the estimates arise; we have selected this approach, as its emphasis on the statement of financial position is more consistent with the liability method of accounting for income taxes.\n\nOur operations are complex and the related domestic and foreign tax interpretations, regulations, legislation and jurisprudence are continually changing. As a result, there are usually some tax matters in question that result in uncertain tax positions. We recognize the income tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of the position will result in that benefit being realized; however, this does not mean that tax authorities cannot challenge these positions. We accrue an amount for interest charges on current tax liabilities that have not been funded, which would include interest and penalties arising from uncertain tax positions. We include such charges in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n\nOur research and development activities may be eligible to earn Investment Tax Credits, for which the determination of eligibility is a complex matter. We recognize Investment Tax Credits only when there is reasonable assurance that the ultimate determination of the eligibility of our research and development activities will result in the Investment Tax Credits being received, at which time they are accounted for using the cost reduction method, whereby such credits are deducted from the expenditures or assets to which they relate, as set out in Note 10(c) .",

When share-based compensation vests in tranches (graded-vesting), we recognize the expense using the accelerated expense attribution method. An estimate of forfeitures during the vesting period is made at the date of grant of such share-based compensation; this estimate is adjusted to reflect actual experience.\n\n## Restricted share units\n\nIn respect of restricted share units with neither an equity settlement feature nor market performance conditions, as set out in Note 14(b) , we accrue a liability equal to the product of the number of vesting restricted share units multiplied by the fair market value of the corresponding Common Shares at the end of the reporting period. Similarly, we accrue a liability for the notional subset of our restricted share units without an equity settlement feature and with market performance conditions, using a Monte Carlo simulation-determined fair value. Restricted share units that have an equity settlement feature are accounted for as equity instruments. The expense for restricted share units that do not ultimately vest is reversed against the expense that was previously recorded in their respect.\n\n## Share option awards\n\nA fair value for share option awards is determined at the date of grant and that fair value is recognized in the financial statements. Proceeds arising from the exercise of share option awards are credited to share capital, as are the recognized grant-date fair values of the exercised share option awards.\n\nShare option awards that have a net-equity settlement feature, as set out in Note 14(d) , are accounted for as equity instruments. We have selected the equity instrument fair value method of accounting for the net-equity settlement feature, as it is consistent with the accounting treatment applied to the associated share option awards.\n\n## (/j.ss01) Emp/l.ss08oyee future benef/i.ss01t p/l.ss08ans\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nWe accrue amounts for our obligations under employee defined benefit plans and the related costs, net of plan assets. The cost of pensions and other retirement benefits earned by employees is actuarially determined using the accrued benefit method pro-rated on service and management's best estimates of both salary escalation and the retirement ages of employees. In the determination of net income, net interest for each plan, which is the product of the plan's surplus (deficit) multiplied by the discount rate, is included as a component of Financing costs, as set out in Note 9 .\n\nAn amount reflecting the effect of differences between the discount rate and the actual rate of return on plan assets is included as a component of employee defined benefit plan re-measurements within Other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 and Note 15 . We determine the maximum economic benefit available from the plans' assets on the basis of reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\nOn an annual basis, at a minimum, the defined benefit plan key assumptions are assessed and revised as appropriate; as referred to in (b) , these are significant estimates for us.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nWe use defined contribution accounting for the Telecommunication Workers Pension Plan and the British Columbia Public Service Pension Plan, which cover certain of our employees and provide defined benefits to their members. In the absence of any regulations governing the calculation of the share of the underlying financial position and plan performance attributable to each employer-participant, and in the absence of contractual agreements between the plans and the employer-participants related to the financing of any shortfall (or distribution of any surplus), we account for these plans as defined contribution plans, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits .\n\n## (k) Cash and temporary /i.ss01nvestments/comma.ss01 net\n\nCash and temporary investments, which may include investments in money market instruments that are purchased three months or less from maturity, are presented net of outstanding items, including cheques written but not cleared by the related banks as at the statement of financial position date. Cash and temporary investments, net, are classified as a liability in the statement of financial position when the total amount of all cheques written but not cleared by the related banks exceeds the amount of cash and temporary investments. When cash and temporary investments, net, are classified as a liability, they may also include overdraft amounts drawn on our bilateral bank facilities, which revolve daily and are discussed further in Note 22 .\n\n## (/l.ss08) Inventor/i.ss01es\n\nOur inventories primarily consist of mobile handsets, parts and accessories totalling $381 million as at December 31, 2021 (2020 - $328 million), and communications equipment held for resale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined on an average cost basis. Costs of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2021, totalled $2.2 billion (2020 - $2.0 billion).\n\n## (m) Property/comma.ss01 p/l.ss08ant and equ/i.ss01pment/semicolon.ss01 /i.ss01ntang/i.ss01b/l.ss08e assets\n\n## General\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are recorded at historical cost, which for self-constructed property, plant and equipment includes materials, direct labour and applicable overhead costs. For internally developed, internal-use software, the historical cost recorded includes materials, direct labour and direct labour-related costs. Where property, plant and equipment construction projects are of sufficient size and duration, an amount is capitalized for the cost of funds used to finance construction, as set out in Note 9 . The rate for calculating the capitalized financing cost is based on the weighted average cost of borrowing that we experience during the reporting period.\n\nWhen we sell property, plant and/or equipment, the net book value is netted against the sale proceeds and the difference, as set out in Note 7 , is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Other income.\n\n## Asset retirement obligations\n\nProvisions for liabilities, as set out in Note 25 , are recognized for statutory, contractual or legal obligations, normally when incurred, associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment (primarily certain items of outside plant and mobile site equipment) when those obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal",

The obligations are measured initially at fair value, which is determined using present value methodology, and the resulting costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying value of the related asset. In subsequent periods, the provisions for these liabilities are adjusted for the accretion of discount, for any changes in the market-based discount rate and for any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying future cash flows. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated on the same basis as the related asset and the discount accretion, as set out in Note 9 , is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n\n## (n) Investments\n\nWe account for our investments in companies over which we have significant influence, as discussed further in Note 21 , using the equity method of accounting, whereby the investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee companies and any earnings distributions\n\n## 2 Account/i.ss01ng po/l.ss08/i.ss01cy deve/l.ss08opments\n\n## (a) In/i.ss01t/i.ss01a/l.ss08 app/l.ss08/i.ss01cat/i.ss01on of standards/comma.ss01 /i.ss01nterpretat/i.ss01ons and amendments to standards and /i.ss01nterpretat/i.ss01ons /i.ss01n the report/i.ss01ng per/i.ss01od\n\nIn August 2020, the International Accounting Standards Board issued Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 , which amends IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement , IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures , IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 16 Leases . The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021, although earlier application is permitted. Interest rate benchmarks such as interbank offer rates (IBORs) play an important role in global financial markets as they index a wide variety of financial products, including derivative financial instruments. Market developments have impacted the reliability of some existing benchmarks and, in this context, the Financial Stability Board has published a report setting out recommendations to reform such benchmarks. The Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 amendments focus on the effects of the interest rate benchmark reform on a company's financial statements that arise when an interest rate benchmark used to calculate interest is replaced with an alternative benchmark rate; most significantly, there will be no requirement to de-recognize or adjust the amount of financial instruments for changes required by the reform, but will instead update the effective interest rate to reflect the change to the alternative benchmark rate. The effects, which have not been material in the current fiscal year, of these amendments on our financial performance and disclosure will be dependent upon the facts and circumstances of future changes in the derivative financial instruments we use, if any, and any future changes in interest rate benchmarks, if any, referenced by such derivative financial instruments we use.\n\nreceived. The excess of the cost of an equity investment over its underlying book value at the date of acquisition, except for goodwill, is amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets to which the excess cost is attributed.\n\nSimilarly, we account for our interests in the real estate joint ventures, as discussed further in Note 21 , using the equity method of accounting. Unrealized gains and losses from transactions with (including contributions to) the real estate joint ventures are deferred in proportion to our remaining interest in the real estate joint ventures.\n\nWe account for our other long-term investments at their fair values unless they are investment securities that do not have quoted market prices in an active market or do not have other clear and objective evidence of fair value. When we do not account for our other long-term investments at their fair values, we use the cost basis of accounting, whereby the investments are initially recorded at cost, and earnings from those investments are recognized only to the extent received or receivable. When there is a significant or prolonged decline in the value of an other long-term investment, the carrying value of that other long-term investment is adjusted to its estimated fair value.\n\n## (b) Standards/comma.ss01 /i.ss01nterpretat/i.ss01ons and amendments to standards and /i.ss01nterpretat/i.ss01ons /i.ss01n the report/i.ss01ng per/i.ss01od not yet effect/i.ss01ve and not yet app/l.ss08/i.ss01ed\n\n- /bullet.ss01 In February 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board issued narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements , IFRS Practice Statement 2, Making Materiality Judgements and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, although earlier application is permitted. The amendments will require the disclosure of material accounting policy information rather than disclosing significant accounting policies and clarify how to distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. We are currently assessing the impacts of the amended standards, but do not expect that our financial disclosure will be materially affected by the application of the amendments.\n- /bullet.ss01 In May 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board issued targeted amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, although earlier application is permitted. With a view to reducing diversity in reporting, the amendments will clarify that companies are required to recognize deferred taxes on transactions where both assets and liabilities are recognized, such as with leases and asset retirement (decommissioning) obligations. Based upon our current facts and circumstances, we do not expect our financial performance or disclosure to be materially affected by the application of the amended standard.",

In order to maintain or adjust our capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividends paid to holders of Common Shares, purchase Common Shares for cancellation pursuant to normal course issuer bids, issue new shares (including Common Shares and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares), issue new debt, issue new debt to replace existing debt with different characteristics, and/or increase or decrease the amount of trade receivables sold to an arm's-length securitization trust.\n\nDuring 2021, our financial objectives, which are reviewed annually, were unchanged from 2020. We believe that our financial objectives are supportive of our long-term strategy.\n\nWe monitor capital utilizing a number of measures, including: net debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA*) - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio; coverage ratios; and dividend payout ratios.\n\n## Debt and coverage rat/i.ss01os\n\nNet debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs is calculated as net debt at the end of the period, divided by 12-month trailing EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs. This measure, historically, is substantially similar to the leverage ratio covenant in our credit facilities. Net debt and EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs are measures that do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS-IASB and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The calculation of these measures is set out in the following table. Net debt is one component of a ratio used to determine compliance with debt covenants.",

We believe that our use of derivative financial instruments for hedging or arbitrage assists us in managing our financing costs and/or reducing the uncertainty associated with our financing or other business activities. Uncertainty associated with currency risk and other price risk is reduced through our use of foreign exchange derivatives that effectively swap floating currency exchange rates for fixed rates. When entering into derivative financial instrument contracts, we seek to align the cash flow timing of the hedging items with that of the hedged items. The effects of this risk management strategy and its application are set out in (i) following.\n\n## (b) Cred/i.ss01t r/i.ss01sk\n\nExcluding credit risk, if any, arising from currency swaps settled on a gross basis, the best representation of our maximum exposure (excluding income tax effects) to credit risk, which is a worst-case scenario and does not reflect results we expect, is set out in the following table.\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)        | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Cash and temporary investments, net | $  723   | $  848   |\n| Accounts receivable                 | 3,216    | 2,716    |\n| Contract assets                     | 709      | 707      |\n| Derivative assets                   | 89       | 42       |\n|                                     | $  4,737 | $  4,313 |\n\n## Cash and temporary investments, net\n\nCredit risk associated with cash and temporary investments is managed by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with: governments; major financial institutions that have been accorded strong investment grade ratings by a primary rating agency; and/or other creditworthy counterparties.

Any late payment charges are levied at an industry-based market or negotiated rate on outstanding non-current customer account balances.\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                                           | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020    | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|\n|                                                                        | Note        | Gross       | Allowance   | Net/one.numr | Gross       | Allowance   | Net/one.numr |\n| Customer accounts receivable,   net of allowance for doubtful accounts |             |             |             |              |             |             |              |\n| Less than 30 days past billing date                                    |             | $  883      | $   (8)     | $  875       | $  815      | $ (19)      | $  796       |\n| 30-60 days past billing date                                           |             | 330         | (7)         | 323          | 339         | (17)        | 322          |\n| 61-90 days past billing date                                           |             | 92          | (9)         | 83           | 90          | (19)        | 71           |\n| More than 90 days past billing date                                    |             | 140         | (21 )       | 119          | 98          | (43)        | 55           |\n| Unbilled customer finance receivables                                  |             | 1,323       | (65)        | 1,258        | 1,026       | (42)        | 984          |\n|                                                                        |             | $  2,768    | $  (110)    | $  2,658     | $  2,368    | $  ( 1 40)  | $  2,228     |\n| Current                                                                |             | $  2,194    | $ (81)      | $  2,113     | $  1,986    | $  (119)    | $  1,867     |\n| Non-current                                                            | 20          | 574         | (29)        | 545          | 382         | (21)        | 361          |\n|                                                                        |             | $  2,768    | $  (110)    | $  2,658     | $  2,368    | $  ( 1 40)  | $  2,228     |\n\nWe maintain allowances for lifetime expected credit losses related to doubtful accounts. Current economic conditions (including forwardlooking macroeconomic data), historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), reasons for the accounts being past due and the line of business from which the customer accounts receivable arose are all considered when determining whether to make allowances for past-due accounts. The same factors are considered when determining whether to write off amounts charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts against the customer accounts receivable. The doubtful accounts expense is calculated on a specific-identification basis for customer accounts receivable above a specific balance threshold and on a statistically derived allowance basis for the remainder.\n\nNo customer accounts receivable are written off directly to the doubtful accounts expense.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity related to our allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                 | 2021        | 2020       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Balance, beginning of period                       | $      1 40 | $       55 |\n| Additions (doubtful accounts expense)              | 42          | 91         |\n| Accounts written off/one.numr less than recoveries | (77)        | (22)       |\n| Other                                              | 5           | 16         |\n| Balance, end of period                             | $      110  | $   1 40   |\n\n## Contract assets\n\nCredit risk associated with contract assets is inherently managed by the size and diversity of our large customer base, which includes substantially all consumer and business sectors in Canada.

Current economic conditions, historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), and the line of business from which the contract asset arose are all considered when determining impairment allowances. The same factors are considered when determining whether to write off amounts charged to the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets.\n\n## Derivative assets (and derivative liabilities)\n\nCounterparties to our material foreign exchange derivatives are major financial institutions that have been accorded investment grade ratings by a primary credit rating agency. The total dollar amount of credit exposure under contracts with any one financial institution is limited and counterparties' credit ratings are monitored. We do not give or receive collateral on swap agreements and hedging items due to our credit rating and those of our counterparties. While we are exposed to the risk of potential credit losses due to the possible non-performance of our counterparties, we consider this risk remote. Our derivative liabilities do not have credit risk-related contingent features.\n\n## (c) L/i.ss01qu/i.ss01d/i.ss01ty r/i.ss01sk\n\nAs a component of our capital structure financial policies, discussed further in Note 3 , we manage liquidity risk by:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 maintaining a daily cash pooling process that enables us to manage our available liquidity and our liquidity requirements according to our actual needs;\n- /bullet.ss01 maintaining an agreement to sell trade receivables to an arm's-length securitization trust and bilateral bank facilities ( Note 22 ), a commercial paper program ( Note 26(c) ) and syndicated credit facilities ( Note 26(d) , (f) );\n- /bullet.ss01 maintaining an in-effect shelf prospectus;\n- /bullet.ss01 managing maturity profiles of financial assets and financial liabilities.\n- /bullet.ss01 continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows; and\n\nOur debt maturities in future years are disclosed in Note 26(i) . As at December 31, 2021, TELUS Corporation could offer $2.75 billion of debt or equity securities pursuant to a shelf prospectus that is in effect until June 2023 (2020 - $2.0 billion of debt or equity securities pursuant to a shelf prospectus that was in effect until June 2022). We believe that our investment grade credit ratings contribute to reasonable access to capital markets.\n\nWe closely match the contractual maturities of our derivative financial liabilities with those of the risk exposures they are being used to manage.\n\nThe expected maturities of our undiscounted financial liabilities do not differ significantly from the contractual maturities, other than as noted below. The contractual maturities of our undiscounted financial liabilities, including interest thereon (where applicable), are set out in the following tables.\n\nNon-derivative\n\nDerivative\n\n|                   |              |                     | Composite long-term debt   | Composite long-term debt   | Composite long-term debt                     | Composite long-term debt                     |       |                                   |                                   |           |\n|-------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|\n| As at             | Non-interest |                     | Long- term debt,           |                            | Currency swap                                | Currency swap                                |       | Currency swap   agreement amounts | Currency swap   agreement amounts |           |\n| December 31,      | bearing      |                     | excluding                  |                            | agreement amounts   to be exchanged/two.numr | agreement amounts   to be exchanged/two.numr |       | to be exchanged                   | to be exchanged                   |           |\n| 2021   (millions) | financial    | Short-term          | leases/one.numr            | Leases                     |                                              |                                              | Other | (Receive)                         |                                   |           |\n|                   | liabilities  | borrowings/one.numr | (Note 26)                  | (Note 26)                  | (Receive)                                    | Pay                                          |       |                                   | Pay                               | Total     |\n| 2022              | $  3,395     | $ 15                | $ 3,130                    | $  504                     | $  (2,050)                                   | $ 2,059                                      | $  8  | $  (544)                          | $  540                            | $ 7,057   |\n| 2023              | 62           | 1                   | 1,167                      | 364                        | ( 1 49)                                      | 148                                          | -     | -                                 | -                                 | 1,593     |\n| 2024              | 13           | 101                 | 1,724                      | 305                        | ( 1 49)                                      | 148                                          | -     | -                                 | -                                 | 2,142     |\n| 2025              | 14           | -                   | 2,217                      | 176                        | (522)                                        | 540                                          | -     | -                                 | -                                 | 2,425     |\n| 2026              | 2            | -                   | 1,901                      | 144                        | (116)                                        | 118                                          | -     | -                                 | -                                 | 2,049     |\n| 2027-2031         | 7            | -                   | 7,351                      | 398                        | ( 1 ,784)                                    | 1,852                                        | -     | -                                 | -                                 | 7,824     |\n| Thereafter        | -            | -                   | 10,499                     | 344                        | (2,805)                                      | 2,877                                        | -     | -                                 | -                                 | 10,915    |\n| Total             | $  3,493     | $  117              | $  27,989                  | $  2,235                   | $  (7,575)                                   | $ 7,742                                      | $  8  | $  (544)                          | $  540                            | $  34,005 |\n|                   |              | Total ( Note 26(i)  |                            | )                          |                                              | $  30,391                                    |       |                                   |                                   |           |",

The U.S. dollar is the only foreign currency to which we have a significant exposure as at the balance sheet date.\n\nOur foreign exchange risk management includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts and currency options to fix the exchange rates on a varying percentage, typically in the range of 50% to 75%, of our domestic short-term U.S. dollar-denominated transactions and commitments and all U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper. Other than in respect of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper, we designate only the spot element of these instruments as the hedging item, as the forward element is wholly immaterial; in respect of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper, we designate the forward rate.\n\nAs discussed further in Note 26(b) and Note 26(f) , we are also exposed to currency risk in that the fair value or future cash flows of our U.S. Dollar Notes and our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility U.S. dollar borrowings could fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Currency hedging relationships have been established for the related semi-annual interest payments and the principal payment at maturity in respect of the U.S. Dollar Notes; we designate only the spot element of these instruments as the hedging item, as the forward element is wholly immaterial. As the functional currency of our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary is the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affecting its borrowings are reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income.\n\n## (e) Interest rate r/i.ss01sk\n\nChanges in market interest rates will cause fluctuations in the fair values or future cash flows of temporary investments, construction credit facility advances made to the real estate joint venture, short-term obligations, long-term debt and interest rate swap derivatives.\n\nWhen we have temporary investments, they have short maturities and fixed interest rates and, as a result, their fair values will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates; absent monetization prior to maturity, the related future cash flows will not change due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nIf the balance of short-term investments includes dividend-paying equity instruments, we could be exposed to interest rate risk.\n\nDue to the short-term nature of the applicable rates of interest charged, the fair value of the construction credit facility advances made to the real estate joint venture is not materially affected by changes in market interest rates; the associated cash flows representing interest payments will be affected until such advances are repaid.\n\nAs short-term obligations arising from bilateral bank facilities, which typically have variable interest rates, are rarely outstanding for periods that exceed one calendar week, interest rate risk associated with this item is not material.\n\nShort-term borrowings arising from the sales of trade receivables to an arm's-length securitization trust are fixed-rate debts. Due to the short maturities of these borrowings, interest rate risk associated with this item is not material.\n\nAll of our currently outstanding long-term debt, other than commercial paper and amounts drawn on our credit facilities ( Note 26(c) , (f) ), is fixed-rate debt. The fair value of fixed-rate debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates; absent early redemption, the related future cash flows will not change. Due to the short maturities of commercial paper, its fair value is not materially affected by changes in market interest rates, but the associated cash flows representing interest payments may be affected if the commercial paper is rolled over.\n\nAmounts drawn on our short-term and long-term credit facilities will be affected by changes in market interest rates in a manner similar to commercial paper.",

We recognize such amounts on an accrual basis as the subsidized services are provided or as the subsidized costs are incurred.\n\n## C/R.ss04TC subs/i.ss01dy\n\nLocal exchange carriers' costs of providing the level of residential basic telephone services that the CRTC requires to be provided in high cost serving areas are greater than the amounts the CRTC allows the local exchange carriers to charge for the levels of service. To ameliorate the situation, the CRTC directs the collection of contribution payments, in a central fund, from all registered Canadian telecommunications\n\nservice providers (including voice, data and mobile service providers) that are then disbursed to incumbent local exchange carriers as subsidy payments to partially offset the costs of providing residential basic telephone services in non-forborne high cost serving areas. The subsidy payment disbursements are based upon a total subsidy requirement calculated on a per network access line/per band subsidy rate. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our subsidy receipts were $5 million (2020 - $10 million).\n\n## Government of Quebec\n\nSalaries for qualifying employment positions in the province of Quebec, mainly in the information technology sector, are eligible for tax credits. In respect of such tax credits, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $3 million (2020 - $3 million).\n\n## 8 Emp/l.ss08oyee benef/i.ss01ts expense\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)        | Note   | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Employee benefits expense - gross         |        |          |          |\n| Wages and salaries/one.numr               |        | $  4,118 | $  3,668 |\n| Share-based compensation/two.numr         | 14     | 236      | 173      |\n| Pensions - defined benefit                | 15(a)  | 113      | 102      |\n| Pensions - defined contribution           | 15(f)  | 106      | 94       |\n| Restructuring costs/two.numr              | 16(a)  | 79       | 49       |\n| Employee health and other benefits        |        | 227      | 190      |\n|                                           |        | 4,879    | 4,276    |\n| Capitalized internal labour costs, net    |        |          |          |\n| Contract acquisition costs                | 20     |          |          |\n| Capitalized                               |        | (91 )    | (74)     |\n| Amortized                                 |        | 66       | 55       |\n| Contract fulfilment costs                 | 20     |          |          |\n| Capitalized                               |        | (2)      | (2)      |\n| Amortized                                 |        | 5        | 4        |\n| Property, plant and equipment             |        | (362)    | (350)    |\n| Intangible assets subject to amortization |        | (226)    | (208)    |\n|                                           |        | (610)    | (575)    |\n|                                           |        | $  4,269 | $  3,701 |",

In our specific instance, this is relevant to our investments in Canadian subsidiaries and Canadian partnerships. We are not required to recognize such deferred income tax liabilities, as we are in a position to control the timing and manner of the reversal of the temporary differences, which would not be expected to be exigible to income tax, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. We are in a position\n\nto control the timing and manner of the reversal of the temporary differences in respect of our non-Canadian subsidiaries, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## (c) Other\n\nWe conduct research and development activities, which may be eligible\n\nto earn Investment Tax Credits. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded Investment Tax Credits of $21 million (2020 - $12 million). Of this amount, $14 million (2020 - $6 million) was recorded as a reduction of property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets and the balance was recorded as a reduction of goods and services purchased.",

attributable to Common Shares by the total weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per Common Share is calculated to give effect to share option awards and restricted share unit awards.\n\nThe following table presents reconciliations of the denominators of the basic and diluted per share computations. Net income was equal to diluted net income for all periods presented.\n\n3\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Basic total weighted average number   of Common Shares outstanding   | 1,346  | 1,275  |\n| Effect of dilutive securities - Restricted share units               | 5      |        |\n| Diluted total weighted average number   of Common Shares outstanding | 1,351  | 1,278  |\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no outstanding equity-settled restricted share unit awards were excluded in the calculation of diluted income per Common Share.

Each restricted share unit is nominally equal in value to one equity share and is nominally entitled to the dividends that would arise thereon if it were an issued and outstanding equity share. The notional dividends are recorded as additional issuances of restricted share units during the life of the restricted share unit. Due to the notional dividend mechanism, the grant-date fair value of restricted share units equals the fair market value of the corresponding equity shares at the grant date, other than for the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the relative total shareholder return performance condition (which have their grant-date fair value determined using a Monte Carlo simulation). The restricted share units generally become payable when vesting is complete; TELUS Corporation restricted share units typically vest over a period of 33 months (the requisite service period) and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units typically vest over a period of 48 months (the requisite service period). The vesting method of restricted share units, which is determined on or before the date of grant, may be either cliff or graded; the majority of TELUS Corporation restricted share units outstanding are cliff-vesting and the majority of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units are graded-vesting. Accounting for restricted share units, as either equity instruments or\n\nliability instruments, is based upon the expected manner of their settlement when they are granted. Grants of restricted share units prior to fiscal 2019 were accounted for as liability instruments, as the associated obligation was normally cash-settled.\n\n## TELUS Corporation restricted share units\n\nWe also award restricted share units that largely have the same features as our general restricted share units, but have a variable payout (0% - 200%) that depends upon the achievement of our total customer connections performance condition (with a weighting of 25%) and the total shareholder return on TELUS Corporation Common Shares relative to an international peer group of telecommunications companies (with a weighting of 75%). The grant-date fair value of the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the total customer connections performance condition equals the fair market value of the corresponding TELUS Corporation Common Shares at the grant date, and thus the notional subset has been included in the presentation of our restricted share units with only service conditions. The estimate, which reflects a variable payout, of the fair value of the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the relative total shareholder return performance condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Grants of restricted share units in 2021 and 2020 are accounted for as equity-settled, as that was their expected manner of settlement when granted.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of outstanding TELUS Corporation non-vested restricted share units.\n\n2020\n\n| Number of non-vested restricted share units as at December 31                       | 2021      |           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Restricted share units without market performance conditions                        |           |           |\n| Restricted share units with only service conditions                                 | 5,481,486 | 5,718,328 |\n| Notional subset affected by total customer connections performance condition        | 366,983   | 298,957   |\n|                                                                                     | 5,848,469 | 6,017,285 |\n| Restricted share units with market performance conditions                           |           |           |\n| Notional subset affected by relative total shareholder return performance condition | 1,100,949 | 896,870   |\n|                                                                                     | 6,949,418 | 6,914,155 |\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity related to TELUS Corporation restricted share units without market performance conditions.\n\n-\n\n| Years ended December 31          | 2021                                        | 2021                                        | 2021                     | 2020                                        | 2020                                        | 2020                     |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                  | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Weighted  average grant- | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Weighted  average grant- |\n|                                  | Non-vested                                  | Vested                                      | date fair value          | Non-vested                                  | Vested                                      | date fair value          |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period |                                             |                                             |                          |                                             |                                             |                          |\n| Non-vested                       | 6,017,285                                   | -

In respect of TELUS Corporation Common Shares held within the employee share purchase plan, TELUS Corporation Common Share dividends declared during the year ended December 31, 2021, of $42 million (2020 - $37 million) were to be reinvested in TELUS Corporation Common Shares acquired by the trustee from Treasury, with a discount applicable, as set out in Note 13(b) .\n\n## (d) Share opt/i.ss01on awards\n\n## General\n\nWe use share option awards as a form of retention and incentive compensation. We apply the fair value method of accounting for share-based compensation awards granted to officers and other employees. Share option awards typically have a three-year vesting period (the requisite service period). The vesting method of share option awards, which is determined on or before the date of grant, may be either cliff or graded; all share option awards granted subsequent to 2004 have been cliff-vesting.\n\nThe weighted average fair value of share option awards granted is calculated by using the Black-Scholes model (a closed-form option pricing model). The risk-free interest rate used in determining the fair\n\nvalue of the share option awards is based on a Government of Canada yield curve that is current at the time of grant. The expected lives of the share option awards are based on our historical share option award exercise data. Similarly, expected volatility considers the historical volatility in the price of our Common Shares in respect of TELUS Corporation share options and the average historical volatility in the prices of a peer group's shares, and TELUS International (Cda) Inc.'s own shares, in respect of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. share options. The dividend yield is the annualized dividend current at the time of grant divided by the share option award exercise price. Dividends are not paid on unexercised share option awards and are not subject to vesting.\n\n## TELUS Corporation share options\n\nEmployees may be granted share option awards to purchase TELUS Corporation Common Shares at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the time of grant. Share option awards granted under the plan may be exercised over specific periods not to exceed seven years from the time of grant. Share option awards granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020 were for front-line employees.\n\nThese share option awards have a net-equity settlement feature. The optionee does not have the choice of exercising the net-equity settlement feature; it is at our option whether the exercise of a share option award is settled as a share option or settled using the net-equity settlement feature.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity related to the TELUS Corporation share option plan.\n\n| Years ended December 31          |                           | 2021                                            | 2020                      | 2020                                    |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Number of   share options | Weighted   average share  option price/one.numr | Number of   share options | Weighted   average share   option price |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period | 3,014,700                 | $  21.59                                        | -                         | $         -                             |\n| Granted                          | 324,900                   | $  25.96                                        | 3,171,600                 | $  21.57                                |\n| Forfeited                        | (289,300)                 | $  21.75                                        | (156,900)                 | $  21.29                                |\n| Outstanding, end of period       | 3,050,300                 | $  22.04                                        | 3,014,700                 | $  21.59                                |\n\n- 1 The weighted average remaining contractual life is 5.4 years.

The solvency valuation effectively uses the fair value (excluding any asset ceiling limit effects) of the funded defined benefit pension plan assets (adjusted for theoretical wind-up expenses) to measure the solvency valuation assets. Although the defined benefit obligations accrued and the solvency valuation liabilities are calculated similarly, the assumptions used for each differ, primarily in respect of retirement ages and discount rates, and the solvency valuation liabilities, due to the required assumption that each plan is terminated on the valuation date, do not reflect assumptions about future compensation levels. Relative to the experience-based estimates of retirement ages used for purposes of determining the defined benefit obligations accrued, the minimum no-consent retirement age used for solvency valuation purposes may result in either a greater or lesser pension liability, depending upon the provisions of each plan. The solvency positions in this table reflect composite weighted average discount rates of 2.9% (2020 - 2.5%). A hypothetical decrease of 25 basis points in the composite weighted average discount rate would result in a $297 decrease in the PBSR solvency position as at December 31, 2021 (2020 - $330); these sensitivities are hypothetical, should be used with caution, are calculated without changing any other assumption and generally cannot be extrapolated because changes in amounts may not be linear.\n\n- 6 The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, by way of the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985 (PBSR) (see (e) ), requires that a solvency valuation be performed on a periodic basis. The actual PBSR solvency positions are determined in conjunction with mid-year annual funding reports prepared by actuaries (see (e) ); as a result, the PBSR solvency positions in this table as at December 31, 2021 and 2020, are interim estimates and updated estimates, respectively. The interim estimate as at December 31, 2020, was a net surplus of $375.\n\n## (b) Pens/i.ss01on p/l.ss08ans and other def/i.ss01ned benef/i.ss01t p/l.ss08ans - overv/i.ss01ew\n\nWe have a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans that provide pension and other retirement and post-employment benefits to most of our employees. As at December 31, 2021 and 2020, all registered defined benefit pension plans were closed to substantially all new participants and substantially all benefits had vested. The benefit plans in which our employees are participants reflect developments in our corporate history.\n\n## TELUS Corporation Pension Plan\n\nManagement and professional employees in Alberta who joined us prior to January 1, 2001, and certain unionized employees who joined us prior to June 9, 2011, are covered by this contributory defined benefit pension plan, which comprises slightly more than one-half of our total defined benefit obligation accrued. The plan contains a supplemental benefit account that may provide indexation of up to 70% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index. Pensionable remuneration is determined by the average of the best five years of remuneration in the last ten years preceding retirement.\n\n## Pension Plan for Management and Professional Employees of TELUS Corporation\n\nThis defined benefit pension plan, which with certain limited exceptions ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 2006, and which comprises approximately one-quarter of our total defined benefit obligation accrued, provides a non-contributory base level of pension benefits. Additionally, on a contributory basis, employees annually can choose increased and/or enhanced levels of pension benefits above the base level. At an enhanced level of pension benefits, the plan has indexation of 100% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index, to an annual maximum of 2%. Pensionable remuneration is determined by the annualized average of the best 60 consecutive months of remuneration.\n\n## TELUS Qu\u00e9bec Defined Benefit Pension Plan\n\nThis contributory defined benefit pension plan, which ceased accepting new participants on April 14, 2009, covers any employee not governed by a collective agreement in Quebec who joined us prior to April 1, 2006, any non-supervisory employee governed by a collective agreement who joined us prior to September 6, 2006, and certain other unionized employees. The plan comprises approximately one-tenth of our total defined benefit obligation accrued. The plan has no indexation and pensionable remuneration is determined by the average of the best four years of remuneration.\n\n## TELUS Edmonton Pension Plan\n\nThis contributory defined benefit pension plan ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 1998. Indexation is 60% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index and pensionable remuneration is determined by the annualized average of the best 60 consecutive months of\n\nremuneration. The plan comprises less than one-tenth of our total defined benefit obligation accrued.\n\n## Other defined benefit pension plans\n\nIn addition to the foregoing plans, we have non-registered, noncontributory supplementary defined benefit pension plans, which have the effect of maintaining the pension benefit earned once the allowable maximums in the registered plans are attained. As is common with non-registered plans of this nature, these plans are typically funded only as benefits are paid. These plans comprise less than 5% of our total defined benefit obligation accrued.\n\n## Telecommunication Workers Pension Plan\n\nCertain employees in British Columbia are covered by a negotiated-cost, target-benefit union pension plan. Our contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labour contracts (the current contract expired on December 31, 2021 - see Note 29(c) ), and are generally based on employee gross earnings. We are not required to guarantee the benefits or assure the solvency of the plan, and we are not liable to the plan for other participating employers' obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our contributions comprised a significant proportion of the employer contributions to the union pension plan; similarly, a significant proportion of the plan participants were our active and retired employees.\n\n## British Columbia Public Service Pension Plan\n\nCertain employees in British Columbia are covered by a public service pension plan. Contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of labour contracts negotiated by the Province of British Columbia and are generally based on employee gross earnings.\n\n## Defined contribution pension plans\n\nWe primarily offer three defined contribution pension plans, which are contributory, and these are the primary pension plans we sponsor that are available to our non-unionized and certain of our unionized employees. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, employees could generally choose to contribute to the plans at a rate of between 3% and 10% of their pensionable earnings; generally, we match 100% of contributions of employees up to 5% of their pensionable earnings and 80% of contributions of employees between 5% and 6% of their pensionable earnings. Membership in a defined contribution pension plan is generally voluntary until an employee's third-year service anniversary. In the event that annual contributions exceed allowable maximums, excess amounts are in certain cases contributed to a non-registered supplementary defined contribution savings plan.\n\n## Other defined benefit plans\n\nOther defined benefit plans, which are all non-contributory and, as at December 31, 2021 and 2020, non-funded, included a healthcare plan for retired employees and a life insurance plan, both of which ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 1997.",

A secondary goal is to maximize the long-term rate of return on the defined benefit plans' assets within a level of risk acceptable to us.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe consider absolute risk (the risk of contribution increases, inadequate plan surplus and unfunded obligations) to be more important than relative return risk. Accordingly, the defined benefit plans' designs, the nature and maturity of defined benefit obligations and the characteristics of the plans' memberships significantly influence investment strategies and policies. We manage risk by specifying allowable and prohibited investment types, setting diversification strategies and determining target asset allocations.\n\n## Allowable and prohibited investment types\n\nAllowable and prohibited investment types, along with associated guidelines and limits, are set out in each plan's required Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (SIPP), which is reviewed and approved annually by the designated governing body. The SIPP guidelines and limits are further governed by the permitted investments and lending limits set out in the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985 . As well as conventional investments, each fund's SIPP may provide for the use of derivative products to facilitate investment operations and to manage risk, provided that no short position is taken and no guidelines and limits established in the SIPP are violated. Internally and externally managed funds are not permitted to invest directly in our securities, or those of our subsidiaries, and are prohibited from increasing grandfathered investments in our securities; any such grandfathered\n\ninvestments were made prior to the merger of BC TELECOM Inc. and TELUS Corporation, our predecessors.\n\n## Diversification\n\nOur strategy for investments in equity securities is to be broadly diversified across individual securities, industry sectors and geographical regions. A meaningful portion (20% - 30% of total plan assets) of the plans' investment in equity securities is allocated to foreign equity securities with the intent of further diversifying plan assets. Debt securities may include a meaningful allocation to mortgages, with the objective of enhancing cash flow and providing greater scope for the management of the bond component of the plan assets. Debt securities may also include real return bonds to provide inflation protection, consistent with the indexed nature of some defined benefit obligations. Real estate investments are used to provide diversification of plan assets, hedging of potential long-term inflation and comparatively stable investment income.\n\n## Relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations\n\nWith the objective of lowering the long-term costs of our defined benefit pension plans, we purposely mismatch plan assets and benefit obligations. This mismatching is effected by including equity investments in the long-term asset mix, as well as fixed income securities and mortgages with durations that differ from those of the benefit obligations.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the present value-weighted average timing of estimated cash flows for the obligations (duration) of the defined benefit pension plans was 14.0 years (2020 - 14.1 years) and of the other defined benefit plans was 6.1 years (2020 - 5.8 years). Compensation for liquidity issues that may otherwise have arisen from the mismatching of plan assets and benefit obligations is provided by broadly diversified investment holdings (including cash and short-term investments) and cash flows from dividends, interest and rents from those diversified investment holdings.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nInformation about the fair value measurements of our defined benefit pension plan assets, in aggregate, is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                   |           |          | Fair value measurements at reporting date using       | Fair value measurements at reporting date using       | Fair value measurements at reporting date using   | Fair value measurements at reporting date using   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                   | Total     | Total    | Quoted prices in active   markets for identical items | Quoted prices in active   markets for identical items | Other                                             | Other                                             |\n| As at December 31 (millions)                                                      | 2021      | 2020     | 2021                                                  | 2020                                                  | 2021                                              | 2020                                              |\n| Asset class                                                                       |           |          |                                                       |                                                       |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Equity securities                                                                 |           |          |                                                       |                                                       |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Canadian                                                                          | $ 1,104   | $  1,044 | $  945                                                | $  849                                                | $   1 59                                          | $   1 95                                          |\n| Foreign                                                                           | 2,861     | 2,699    | 826                                                   | 685                                                   | 2,035                                             | 2,014                                             |\n| Debt securities                                                                   |           |          |                                                       |                                                       |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Issued by national, provincial or local governments                               | 1,290     | 1,453    | 1,120                                                 | 1,225                                                 | 170                                               | 228                                               |\n| Corporate debt securities                                                         | 2,436     | 2,087    | -

These significant estimates are of a long-term nature, consistent with the nature of employee future benefits.\n\n## Demographic assumptions\n\nIn determining the defined benefit pension expense recognized in net income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we utilized the Canadian Institute of Actuaries CPM 2014 mortality tables.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nThe discount rate, which is used to determine a plan's defined benefit obligations accrued, is based upon the yield on long-term, highquality, fixed-term investments, and is set annually. The rate of future increases in compensation is based upon current benefits policies and economic forecasts.\n\nThe significant weighted average actuarial assumptions arising from these estimates and used in measuring our defined benefit obligations accrued are as follows:\n\n2020\n\n|                                                                                             | 2021   |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Mortality assumptions used to determine defined  benefit obligations accrued at December 31 |        |        |\n| Life expectancy at 65 for a member   currently at age 65 (years)                            | 24.2   | 22.7   |\n| Discount rate/one.numr used to determine:                                                   |        |        |\n| Net benefit costs for the year ended December 31                                            | 2.50 % | 3.10 % |\n| Defined benefit obligations accrued   as at December 31                                     | 2.95 % | 2.50 % |\n| Current service cost in subsequent fiscal year                                              | 3.10 % | 2.70 % |\n| Rate of future increases in compensation   used to determine:                               |        |        |\n| Net benefit costs for the year ended December 31                                            | 2.90 % | 2.90 % |\n| Defined benefit obligations accrued   as at December 31                                     | 3.00 % | 2.90 % |\n\n## Sensitivity of key assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity of our key assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans was as follows:\n\n(3)\n\n| Years ended, or as at, December 31                                                                  |                        | 2021                | 2020                   | 2020                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Increase (decrease) (millions)                                                                      | Change in  obligations | Change in  expenses | Change in  obligations | Change in   expenses |\n| Sensitivity of key demographic assumptions   to an increase of one year/one.numr in life expectancy |                        |                     |                        |                      |\n|                                                                                                     | $  323                 | $  1 1              | $  349                 | $  1 1               |\n| Sensitivity of key financial assumptions to a                                                       |                        |                     |                        |                      |\n| hypothetical decrease of 25 basis points/one.numr in:                                               |                        |                     |                        |                      |\n| Discount rate                                                                                       | $  366                 | $  13               | $  386                 | $  15                |\n| Rate of future increases in compensation                                                            | $    (34)              | $    (3)            | $    (36)              | $                    |\n\n## (e) Emp/l.ss08oyer contr/i.ss01but/i.ss01ons\n\nThe determination of the minimum funding amounts necessary for substantially all of our registered defined benefit pension plans is governed by the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 , which requires that current service costs be funded, and that both going-concern and solvency valuations be performed on a specified periodic basis.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Any excess of plan assets over plan liabilities determined in the going-concern valuation reduces our minimum funding requirement for current service costs, but may not reduce the requirement to an amount less than the employees' contributions.

The terms of payment for the obtained AWS-4 spectrum licences are such that the amounts owed to the original licensee are accounted for as a long-term financial liability, as set out in Note 26(g) ; we paid $21 million for the obtained 2500 MHz spectrum licenses.\n\nInnovation, Science and Economic Development Canada held its 3500 MHz band spectrum auction during the period from June 15, 2021, through July 23, 2021. We were the successful auction participant for 142 spectrum licences, with a total purchase price of approximately $1.95 billion.\n\n## (b) Bus/i.ss01ness acqu/i.ss01s/i.ss01t/i.ss01ons\n\n## Blacksmith Applications Holdings Inc.\n\nOn September 22, 2021, we acquired 100% ownership of Blacksmith Applications Holdings Inc., a provider of management, optimization and analytics to food, beverage and consumer goods providers. The acquisition is complementary to, and was made with a view to growing, our existing smart data solutions business.\n\nThe primary factor that contributed to the recognition of goodwill was the earnings capacity of the acquired business in excess of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired (such excess arising from the acquired workforce and the benefits of acquiring an established business). The amount assigned to goodwill may be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\n## Individually immaterial transactions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired 100% ownership of businesses complementary to our existing lines of business. The primary factor that gave rise to the recognition of goodwill was the earnings capacity of the acquired businesses in excess of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired (such excess arising from the low level of tangible assets relative to the earnings capacities of the businesses). A portion of the amounts assigned to goodwill may be deductible for income tax purposes. Any differences between the results of operations currently presented and pro forma operating revenues, net income and basic and diluted net income per Common Share amounts reflecting the results of operations as if the business acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of the current fiscal year are immaterial (as are the post-acquisition operating revenues and net income of the acquired businesses for the year ended December 31, 2021).\n\n## Acquisition-date fair values\n\nAcquisition-date fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the following table:\n\nTotal of\n\n| (millions)                                | Blacksmith  Applications  Holdings Inc./one.numr   | individually  immaterial  transactions/one.numr   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Assets                                    |                                                    |                                                   |         |\n| Current assets                            |                                                    |                                                   |         |\n| Cash                                      | $ 26                                               | $      4                                          | $ 30    |\n| Accounts receivable/two.numr              | 14                                                 | 3                                                 | 17      |\n| Other                                     | 1                                                  | 5                                                 |         |\n|                                           | 41                                                 | 12                                                | 53      |\n| Non-current assets                        |                                                    |                                                   |         |\n| Property, plant and equipment             |                                                    |                                                   |         |\n| Owned assets                              | -

As at December 31, 2020, purchase price allocations had not been finalized. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the preliminary acquisition-date fair values for other current assets, intangible assets subject to amortization, goodwill, accounts payable, income and other taxes payable, provisions, deferred income tax liabilities and retained earnings were increased (decreased) by $(6 million), $22 million, $(75 million), $9 million, $(13 million), $37 million, $(58 million), and $(34 million), respectively; as required by IFRS-IASB, comparative amounts have been adjusted so as to reflect those increases (decreases) effective the dates of acquisition.\n\n## (d) Bus/i.ss01ness acqu/i.ss01s/i.ss01t/i.ss01on - subsequent to report/i.ss01ng per/i.ss01od\n\n## Fully Managed Inc.\n\nOn January 1, 2022, we acquired 100% ownership of Fully Managed Inc. for cash and contingent consideration of approximately $137 million. Fully Managed Inc. provides managed information technology support, technology strategy and network management. The investment was made with a view to growing our end-to-end capabilities to support small and medium-sized business customers.\n\nAs at February 10, 2022, our initial provision for the net identifiable assets acquired is in the range of $50 million - $60 million; as is customary in a business acquisition transaction, until the time of acquisition of control, we did not have full access to the books and records of the acquired business. Upon having sufficient time to review the books and records of the acquired business, as well as obtaining new and additional information about the related facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date, we will adjust provisional amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and thus finalize our purchase price allocation.\n\n## (e) Intang/i.ss01b/l.ss08e assets w/i.ss01th /i.ss01ndef/i.ss01n/i.ss01te /l.ss08/i.ss01ves - spectrum /l.ss08/i.ss01cences\n\nOur intangible assets with indefinite lives include spectrum licences granted by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, which are used for the provision of both mobile and fixed wireless services. The spectrum licence policy terms indicate that the spectrum licences will likely be renewed. We expect our spectrum licences to be renewed every 20 years following a review of our compliance with licence terms. In addition to current usage, our licensed spectrum can be used for planned and new technologies. As a result of our assessment of the combination of these significant factors, we currently consider our spectrum licences to have indefinite lives and, as referred to in Note 1(b) , this represents a significant judgment for us.\n\n## (f) Impa/i.ss01rment test/i.ss01ng of /i.ss01ntang/i.ss01b/l.ss08e assets w/i.ss01th /i.ss01ndef/i.ss01n/i.ss01te /l.ss08/i.ss01ves and goodw/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08\n\n## General\n\nAs referred to in Note 1(f) , the carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are periodically tested for impairment and, as referred to in Note 1(b) , this test represents a significant estimate for us, while also requiring significant judgments to be made. Also as referred to in Note 1(b) , effective January 1, 2020, we embarked upon the modification of our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls to accommodate the technology convergence-driven cessation of the historical distinction between our wireless and wireline operations and, with effect from January 1, 2021, transitioned to a new segment reporting structure, as referred to in Note 5 ; concurrent with the transition to a new segment reporting structure, there was necessarily a redetermination of our cash-generating units and such redetermination, reflected in the disclosed December 2021 annual test cash-generating units used for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment testing, aligned with the new segment reporting structure.

There is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets, given the necessity of making key economic assumptions about the future. Recoverable amounts based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations are categorized as Level 3 fair value measures.\n\nWe validate the results of our recoverable amounts calculations through a market-comparable approach and an analytical review of industry facts and facts that are specific to us. The market-comparable approach uses current (at time of test) market consensus estimates and equity trading prices for U.S. and Canadian firms in the same industry. In addition, we ensure that the combination of the valuations of the cashgenerating units is reasonable based on our current (at time of test) market value.\n\n-",

        "page_content": "## Key assumptions\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal calculation uses discounted cash flow projections that employ the following key assumptions: future cash flows and growth projections (including judgments about the allocation of future capital expenditures to support both mobile and fixed operations); associated economic risk assumptions and estimates of the likelihood of achieving key operating metrics and drivers; estimates of future generational infrastructure capital expenditures; and the future weighted average cost of capital. We consider a range of reasonably possible amounts to use for key assumptions and decide upon amounts that represent management's best estimates of market amounts. In the normal course, we make changes to key assumptions so that they reflect current (at time of test) economic conditions, updates of historical information used to develop the key assumptions and changes (if any) in our debt ratings.\n\nThe key assumptions for cash flow projections are based upon our approved financial forecasts, which span a period of three years and are discounted, for December 2021 annual impairment test purposes, at a consolidated post-tax notional rate of 6.6% and 9.0% for each of the TELUS technology solutions and the digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International cash-generating units, respectively\n\n## 19 Leases\n\nWe have the right of use of land, buildings and equipment under leases. Most of our leases for real estate that we use for office, retail or network (including mobile site) purposes typically have options to extend the lease terms, which we use to protect our investment in leasehold improve ments (including mobile site equipment) and to mitigate relocation risk, and/or which reflect the importance of the underlying real estate right-of-use lease assets to our operations. Judgments about lease terms are determinative of the measurement of right-of-use lease assets and the associated lease liabilities. Our judgment in respect of lease terms for leased real estate utilized in connection with our telecommunications infrastructure, more so than for any other right-of-use lease assets, routinely includes periods covered by options to extend the lease terms, as we are reasonably certain that we will extend such leases.\n\nIn the normal course of operations, there are future non-executory cash outflows in respect of leases to which we are potentially exposed and which are not included in our lease liabilities as at the reporting date. A significant portion (approximately one-third) of our mobile site lease payments have consumer price index-based price adjustments and such adjustments result in future periodic re-measurements of the lease liabilities with commensurate adjustments to the associated real estate\n\n(2020 - 7.0% for each of the wireless cash-generating unit and the wireline cash-generating unit). For impairment testing valuations, cash flows subsequent to the three-year projection period are extrapolated, for December 2021 annual impairment test purposes, generally using perpetual growth rates of 1.95% and 3.0% for each of the TELUS technology solutions cash-generating unit and the digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International cash-generating unit, respectively (2020 - 2.00% for each of the wireless cash-generating unit and the wireline cash-generating unit); these growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates observed in the markets in which we operate.\n\nWe believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the calculation of the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units is based would not cause the cash-generating units' carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and the goodwill allocated to each cash-generating unit) to exceed their recoverable amounts. If the future were to adversely differ from management's best estimates for the key assumptions and associated cash flows were to be materially adversely affected, we could potentially experience future material impairment charges in respect of our intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill.\n\nright-of-use lease assets (and associated future depreciation amounts); these adjustments would represent our current variable lease payments. As well, we routinely and necessarily commit to leases that have not yet commenced.\n\nAs mandated by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, telecommunications companies are obligated to allow, on their real estate assets owned, on their real estate right-of-use lease assets and/or on their owned-equipment situated on real estate right-of-use lease assets, competitors to co-locate telecommunications infrastructure equipment. Of our real estate right-of-use lease assets used for purposes of situating telecommunications infrastructure equipment, less than one-fifth have co-location subleases that we, as lessor, account for as operating leases.\n\nMaturity analyses of lease liabilities are set out in Note 4(c) and Note 26(i) ; the period interest expense in respect thereof is set out in Note 9 . The additions to, the depreciation charges for, and the carrying amounts of, right-of-use lease assets are set out in Note 17 . We have not currently elected to exclude low-value and short-term leases from lease accounting.\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                                | Note   | 2021   | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Income from subleasing right-of-use lease assets                  |        |        |          |\n| Co-location sublet revenue included in operating service revenues |        | $ 22   | $ 17     |\n| Other sublet revenue included in other income                     | 7      | $   4  | $      4 |\n| Lease payments                                                    |        | $  568 | $  434   |",

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture recognized $8 million (2020 - $NIL) of revenue from our office tenancy; of this amount, one-third was due to our economic interest in the real estate joint venture and two-thirds was due to our partners' economic interests in the real estate joint venture.\n\n## Construction credit facilities\n\nThe TELUS Sky real estate joint venture has a credit agreement, maturing August 31, 2023, with Canadian financial institutions (as 66/two.numr//three.dnom% lender) and TELUS Corporation (as 33/one.numr//three.dnom% lender) to provide $342 million of construction financing for the project. The construction credit facilities contain customary real estate construction financing representations, warranties and covenants and are secured by demand debentures constituting first fixed and floating charge mortgages over the underlying real estate assets. The construction credit facilities are available by way of bankers' acceptance or prime loan and bear interest at rates in line with similar construction financing facilities.",

        "page_content": "## 22 Short-term borrow/i.ss01ngs\n\nOn July 26, 2002, one of our subsidiaries, TELUS Communications Inc., entered into an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust associated with a major Schedule I bank under which it is currently able to sell an interest in certain trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million (2020 - $500 million). The term of this revolving-period securitization agreement ends December 31, 2024 (2020 - December 31, 2021), and it requires minimum cash proceeds of $100 million from monthly sales of interests in certain trade receivables. TELUS Communications Inc. is required to maintain a credit rating of at least BB (2020 - BB) from DBRS Limited or the securitization trust may require the sale program to be wound down prior to the end of the term.\n\nSales of trade receivables in securitization transactions are recognized as collateralized short-term borrowings and thus do not result in our de-recognition of the trade receivables sold. When we sell our trade receivables, we retain reserve accounts, which are retained interests in the securitized trade receivables, and servicing rights. As at December 31, 2021, we had sold to the trust (but continued to recognize) trade receivables of $118 million (2020 - $123 million). Short-term borrowings of $100 million (2020 - $100 million) are comprised of amounts advanced to us by the arm's-length securitization trust pursuant to the sale of trade receivables.\n\nThe balance of short-term borrowings (if any) is comprised of amounts drawn on bank facilities and/or other.\n\n## 23 Accounts payab/l.ss08e and accrued /l.ss08/i.ss01ab/i.ss01/l.ss08/i.ss01t/i.ss01es\n\n2020\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                   | 2021     |          |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Accrued liabilities                            | $  1,539 | $  1,251 |\n| Payroll and other employee-related liabilities | 633      | 545      |\n| Restricted share units liability               | 28       | 18       |\n|                                                | 2,200    | 1,814    |\n| Trade accounts payable                         | 1,213    | 855      |\n| Interest payable                               | 173      | 173      |\n| Indirect taxes payable and other/one.numr      | 119      | 129      |\n|                                                | $  3,705 | $  2,971 |\n\n- 1 The December 31, 2020, balance of indirect taxes payable and other has been adjusted, as set out in Note 18(c) .\n\n## 24 Advance b/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08/i.ss01ngs and customer depos/i.ss01ts\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                     | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Advance billings                                 | $  636 | $  551 |\n| Deferred customer activation and connection fees | 6      | 7      |\n| Customer deposits                                | 10     | 34     |\n| Contract liabilities                             | 652    | 592    |\n| Other                                            | 202    | 180    |\n|                                                  | $  854 | $  772 |",

Provisions for some written put options are determined based on the net present value of estimated future earnings results, and such provisions require us to make key economic assumptions about the future.

In respect of legal claims, we establish provisions, when warranted, after taking into account legal assessments, information presently available, and the expected availability of recourse.

In addition, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the date fixed for redemption.",

an unsecured commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our $2.75 billion syndicated credit facility (see (d) ) and is to be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and investments. This program enables us to issue commercial paper, subject to conditions related to debt ratings, up to a maximum aggregate amount at any one time of $1.9 billion equivalent (US$1.5 billion maximum) (2020 - $1.4 billion maximum). Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency\n\nrisk arising from issuing commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars. Commercial paper debt is due within one year and is classified as a current portion of long-term debt, as the amounts are fully supported, and we expect that they will continue to be supported, by the revolving credit facility, which has no repayment requirements within the next year. As at December 31, 2021, we had $1.9 billion (2020 - $731 million) of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$1.5 billion; 2020 - US$574 million), with an effective average interest rate of 0.35%, maturing through May 2022.",

As well, we have received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims (including intellectual property infringement claims) against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers.\n\nIt is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims and lawsuits due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; an incomplete factual record; uncertainty concerning legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and the appeal levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nHowever, subject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, with the exception of the items enumerated following.\n\n## Certified class actions\n\nCertified class actions against us include the following:\n\n## Per minute billing class action\n\nIn 2008, a class action was brought in Ontario against us alleging breach of contract, breach of the Ontario Consumer Protection Act , breach of the Competition Act and unjust enrichment, in connection with our practice of 'rounding up' mobile airtime to the nearest minute and charging for the full minute. The action sought certification of a national class. In November 2014, an Ontario class only was certified by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in relation to the breach of contract, breach of Consumer Protection Act , and unjust enrichment claims; all appeals of the certification decision have now been exhausted. At the same time, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice declined to stay the claims of our business customers, notwithstanding an arbitration clause in our customer service agreements with those customers. This latter decision was appealed and on May 31, 2017, the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed our appeal. The Supreme Court of Canada granted us leave to appeal this decision and on April 4, 2019, granted our appeal and stayed the claims of business customers.\n\n## Call set-up time class actions\n\nIn 2005, a class action was brought against us in British Columbia alleging that we have engaged in deceptive trade practices in charging for incoming calls from the moment the caller connects to the network, and not from the moment the incoming call is connected to the recipient. In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld a stay of all of the causes of action advanced by the plaintiff in this class action, with one exception, based on the arbitration clause that was included in our customer service agreements. The sole exception was the cause of action based on deceptive or unconscionable practices under the British Columbia Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act , which the Supreme\n\nCourt of Canada declined to stay. In January 2016, the British Columbia Supreme Court certified this class action in relation to the claim under the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act . The class is limited to residents of British Columbia who contracted mobile services with us in the period from January 21, 1999, to April 2010. We have appealed the certification decision. A companion class action was brought against us in Alberta at the same time as the British Columbia class action. The Alberta class action duplicates the allegations in the British Columbia action, but has not proceeded to date and is not certified. Subject to a number of conditions, including court approval, we have now settled both the British Columbia and the Alberta class actions.\n\n## Uncertified class actions\n\nUncertified class actions against us include:\n\n## 9-1-1 class actions\n\nIn 2008, a class action was brought in Saskatchewan against us and other Canadian telecommunications carriers alleging that, among other matters, we failed to provide proper notice of 9-1-1 charges to the public, have been deceitfully passing them off as government charges, and have charged 9-1-1 fees to customers who reside in areas where 9-1-1 service is not available. The plaintiffs advance causes of action in breach of contract, misrepresentation and false advertising and seek certification of a national class. A virtually identical class action was filed in Alberta at the same time, but the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench declared that class action expired against us as of 2009. No steps have been taken in this proceeding since 2016.\n\n## Public Mobile class actions\n\nIn 2014, class actions were brought against us in Quebec and Ontario on behalf of Public Mobile's customers, alleging that changes to the technology, services and rate plans made by us contravene our statutory and common law obligations. In particular, the Quebec action alleges that our actions constitute a breach of the Quebec Consumer Protection Act , the Quebec Civil Code , and the Ontario Consumer Protection Act . On June 28, 2021, the Quebec Superior Court approved the discontinuance of this claim against TELUS. The Ontario class action alleges negligence, breach of express and implied warranty, breach of the Competition Act , unjust enrichment, and waiver of tort. No steps have been taken in this proceeding since it was filed and served.\n\n## Handset subsidy class action\n\nIn 2016, a class action was brought in Quebec against us and other telecommunications carriers alleging that we breached the Quebec Consumer Protection Act and the Civil Code of Quebec by making false or misleading representations relating to the handset subsidy provided to our mobile customers, and by charging our mobile customers inflated rate plan prices and termination fees higher than those permitted under the Act . The claim was later amended to also seek compensation for amounts paid by class members to unlock their mobile devices. The authorization hearing was held on April 30 and May 1, 2019, and on July 15, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court dismissed the authorization application. The Plaintiff's appeal of this decision was dismissed by the Quebec Court of Appeal on July 23, 2021. The Plaintiff has not sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and the time for doing so has now expired. The action is therefore at an end.",

Should the ultimate resolution of these matters differ from management's assessments and assumptions, a material adjustment to our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, could result. Management's assessments and assumptions include that reliable estimates of any such exposure cannot be made considering the continued uncertainty about: the nature of the damages that may be sought by the plaintiffs; the causes of action that are being, or may ultimately be, pursued; and, in the case of the uncertified class actions, the causes of action that may ultimately be certified.\n\n## (b) Indemn/i.ss01f/i.ss01cat/i.ss01on ob/l.ss08/i.ss01gat/i.ss01ons\n\nIn the normal course of operations, we provide indemnification in conjunction with certain transactions.

In some cases, there is no maximum limit on these indemnification obligations. The overall maximum amount of an indemnification obligation will depend on future events and conditions and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, an indemnification obligation is recorded as a liability. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the related transactions, historically we have not made significant payments under these indemnifications. As at December 31, 2021, we had no liability recorded in respect of our indemnification obligations.\n\nSee Note 21(b) for details regarding our guarantees to the real estate joint ventures.\n\n## (c) Concentrat/i.ss01on of /l.ss08abour\n\nIn 2021, we commenced collective bargaining with the Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944, to renew a collective agreement that expired on December 31, 2021; the contract covered approximately 23% of our Canadian workforce as at December 31, 2021.

Deferred share units entitle directors to a specified number of TELUS Corporation Common Shares. Deferred share units accounted for as liabilities have been paid out when a director ceased to be a director, for any reason, at a time elected by the director in accordance with the Directors' Deferred Share Unit Plan ; during the year ended December 31, 2021, no amount was paid out (2020 - $3 million).

Optical fibre networks are used to transmit large amounts of data between locations at high upload and download speeds.\n\nFibre to the x (FTTx): A collective term for any broadband network architecture using optical fibre to replace all or part of the existing copper local loops. FTTH denotes fibre to the home, FTTP denotes fibre to the premises and FTTN denotes fibre to the node or neighbourhood.\n\nHSPA+ (High-speed packet access plus): A 4G technology capable of delivering manufacturer-rated wireless data download speeds of up to 21 Mbps (typical speeds of 4 to 6 Mbps). HSPA+ dual-cell technology can double those download speeds.\n\nIncumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC): An established telecommunications company providing local telephone service. Non-ILEC refers to the telecommunications operations of TELUS outside its traditional ILEC operating territories, where TELUS competes with the incumbent telephone company (e.g. Ontario and most of Quebec).\n\nInternet of Things (IoT): A network of uniquely identifiable end points (or things) that interact without human intervention, most commonly over a wireless network. These systems collect, analyze and act on information in real time and can be deployed to enable the creation of smart connected businesses, homes, vehicles and cities.\n\nInternet protocol (IP): A packet-based protocol for sending and receiving data across networks.\n\nIP-based network: A network designed using IP and QoS (quality of service) technology to reliably and efficiently support all types of customer traffic, including voice, data and video. An IP-based network allows a variety of IP devices and advanced applications to communicate over a single common network.\n\n- IP TV (internet protocol television): A television service (offered as Optik TV and Pik TV at TELUS) that uses a two-way digital broadcast signal sent through a network by way of a streamed broadband connection to a dedicated set-top box (or through an app for Pik TV).\n\nLicensed assisted access (LAA): An LTE feature that makes use of unlicensed spectrum in combination with licensed spectrum to deliver enhanced performance for mobile device users.\n\nFor f/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 def/i.ss01n/i.ss01t/i.ss01ons/comma.ss01 see Sect/i.ss01on 11 of Management/quoteright.ss01s d/i.ss01scuss/i.ss01on and ana/l.ss08ys/i.ss01s/period.ss01\n\nLTE (long-term evolution): The leading 4G global wireless technology standard. LTE advanced (LTE-A) and LTE advanced pro offer higher speeds and greater capacity, moving networks closer to 5G. LTE is capable of delivering manufacturer-rated wireless data download speeds of up to 150 Mbps (typical speeds of 12 to 45 Mbps), and LTE-A can offer speeds nearly 10 times higher (in select regions).\n\nMachine-to-machine (M2M): Technologies and networked devices that are able to exchange information and perform actions without human intervention.\n\nMobile virtual network operator (MVNO): A mobile service operator that leases access to a wireless network from other carriers to resell services to end customers.\n\nNormal course issuer bid (NCIB): A program that enables a company to purchase its own shares, typically for cancellation, through exchanges or private purchases over a set period of time.\n\nOver-the-top (OTT): Content, services and applications in a video format, for which delivery occurs through a medium other than the established video delivery infrastructure.\n\nPassive optical network (PON): A fibre-based transmission technology used for delivering broadband network access. GPON (gigabit-capable passive optical network) delivers data download speeds of up to 2.4 Gbps and upload speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps; XGS-PON (10-gigabit-capable symmetrical passive optical network) delivers data download and upload speeds of up to 2.5 Gbps.\n\nSmall cell: Low-powered radio access nodes that can operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum within a limited range to provide densification and capacity to a macro wireless network.\n\nSpectrum: The range of electromagnetic radio frequencies used in the transmission of voice, data and video. The capacity of a wireless network is in part a function of the amount of spectrum licensed and utilized by the carrier.\n\nSustainability-linked bond: A debt financing instrument with terms aligned to the borrower's performance against predetermined sustainability performance targets and principles.\n\nVirtual private network (VPN): The extension of an encrypted, private network across a public network that allows users to securely send and receive data, as if users were directly connected to a private network.\n\nVoice over internet protocol (VoIP): The transmission of voice signals over the internet or IP network.",

In May 2019, we announced an intention to target ongoing semi-annual dividend increases, with the increase to be 7 to 10% annually, through to the end of 2022. This further extends our multi-year dividend growth program originally\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nannounced in May 2011 and extended for three-year periods in both May 2013 and May 2016, and provides investors with ongoing clarity with respect to our intentions regarding our dividend growth program. Since 2011, we have raised our dividend 21 times, bringing the total number of our dividend increases to 28 since 2004.\n\nNotwithstanding this, dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on earnings and free cash flow and subject to the Board's assessment and determination of TELUS' financial situation, capital requirements and economic outlook on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain its dividend growth program through 2022 or that its dividend growth program will be extended.\n\nTELUS advises that, unless noted otherwise, all quarterly dividends paid since January 2006 are eligible dividends under the Income Tax Act . Under this legislation, Canadian residents may be entitled to enhanced dividend tax credits that reduce the income tax otherwise payable.

Under this plan, eligible shareholders can have their dividends reinvested automatically into additional shares. TELUS may elect to purchase common shares in the open market or by issuance from treasury (less a discount, if any, of up to 5%). TELUS will provide advance notification to participants if and when an election is made to change the method of purchasing common shares, and if by treasury issuance, any discount offered or any change in the rate of discount. Effective October 1, 2019, until TELUS elects otherwise, TELUS offers shares from treasury at a 2% discount from the average market price.\n\nWe also offer a share purchase feature, under which eligible shareholders can, on a monthly basis, buy TELUS shares (maximum $20,000 per calendar year and minimum $100 per transaction) without brokerage commissions or service charges.\n\nThis plan is managed by Computershare Trust Company of Canada.\n\nV/i.ss01s/i.ss01t te/l.ss08us/period.ss01com/ dr/i.ss01sp or contact Computershare for /i.ss01nformat/i.ss01on and enro/l.ss08ment forms",
