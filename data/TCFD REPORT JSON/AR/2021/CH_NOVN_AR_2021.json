Strong demand for heart failure medicine Entresto , psoriasis and autoimmune disease treatment Cosentyx , and recently launched  therapies  such  as  multiple  sclerosis  drug Kesimpta helped us increase sales and net profit as we maintained cost discipline. Looking ahead, we are confident we can maintain our momentum as we remain focused on operational excellence and science-based innovation.\n\nWith more than 12 new drug approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration in the past five years, we are committed to our long-term research and development (R&D) strategy, which is aimed at creating breakthrough therapies for patients with high unmet medical needs. We strive to build leading market positions in fast-growing areas of medicine and broaden patient reach to deliver on our purpose to improve and extend people's lives around the world.\n\nLast year we continued to make significant investments in R&D, including in cutting-edge medical technologies such as radioligand therapy and small-interfering RNA. Our clinical pipeline covers a diverse area of noncommunicable diseases such as cancer and heart disease. This is positioning us well for the future amid the rising global need for innovative chronic therapies as we continue to strengthen patient engagement.\n\nWe started a strategic review of our Sandoz generics division with the goal/uni00A0of strengthening its operational performance and maximizing shareholder return. Also, we divested our investment in Roche Holding AG, reflecting our strategy to create a focused medicines company.\n\nAcute pressure on societies and healthcare systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic remains high. In this challenging environment, our focus on/uni00A0operational excellence and shift to/uni00A0 flexible working by our employees continued to help us navigate the crisis. In a post-pandemic world, these lessons will enable us to maintain high levels of resilience and operational e/fficiency while continuing to position us as an employer of choice in a changing work environment.\n\nWe also made further progress in our environmental, social and governance (ESG) activities, which are an essential part of our strategy and an important reputation driver. Besides our progress in reducing our environmental footprint, we broadened patient access to our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrategic medicines and launched a new program in the United States to address health disparities - all with the intention to create more equitable and sustainable healthcare systems and support the United Nations' e/fforts to achieve the  Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe Board of Directors took further action to strengthen governance. We/uni00A0paved the way for comprehensive ESG oversight and changed the leadership of the Compensation Committee and the Governance, Nomination and Corporate Responsibilities Committee. We also nominated a new Board member. Together with the Executive Committee, the Board of Directors will continue the intensive dialogue with all stakeholder groups with a view to further strengthen trust in society and to maximize shareholder return.\n\nI thank you for the confidence you have placed in our company and am pleased to be able to propose a dividend increase of 3.3% to CHF 3.10 at the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJoerg Reinhardt\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors",

        "page_content": "## CEO's letter\n\n2021 was another year of rapid change for the biopharmaceutical industry and the world. The/uni00A0pandemic continues to disrupt care for patients across the spectrum of disease, creating a syndemic, or confluence of epidemics, that requires healthcare systems to cope with COVID-19 while caring for patients with chronic diseases.\n\nThrough the challenges ahead, there are reasons to be optimistic a healthier future is within our grasp - including the ways our industry has brought to this crisis the power of technology and shown once again the extraordinary ability of science to overcome humanity's greatest tests.\n\nAs we reimagine medicine at Novartis, our unwavering focus on our strategy and purpose enabled us/uni00A0to continue creating value for patients, healthcare professionals, healthcare systems, employees, shareholders and society.\n\nThe adaptability and commitment of/uni00A0 our employees, together with the resilience of our operations and capabilities in data science and tech nology, minimized disruptions to our business. Many changes, such as hybrid working, are now business as usual.\n\nOur impact on the world remains extraordinary, with 766 million patients reached in 2021. We received 21/uni00A0approvals in the US, the EU, Japan and China, including two new mole cular entities. Our siRNA therapy Leqvio is now approved in more than 50 countries, including the US. We also demonstrated the strength of our in-market portfolio, with medicines like Cosentyx , Entresto , Zolgensma , Kesimpta and Kisqali driving growth.\n\nOur pipeline promises innovation for years to come. We have built depth in five therapeutic areas and are building scale in five next-generation technology platforms. 2021 saw important data readouts, including for Kisqali in HR+/ HER2- advanced breast cancer, and for 177 Lu-PSMA-617, our  investigational  targeted  radioligand  therapy  for patients with advanced prostate cancer, which received breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We also received approval for Scemblix , a novel stamp inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.\n\nWe have a promising mid- and late-stage portfolio, with more than 20 assets with expected approval by 2026 that each have sales potential over USD 1 billion. We also initiated a share buyback of up to USD 15 billion, underscoring our confidence in our mid- and long-term pipeline and growth outlook.\n\nProgressing on our journey to build trust with society and furthering our legacy in global health and access, in 2021 Novartis reached the milestone of delivering a staggering 1 billion courses of malaria treatment to people in endemic countries. We continue delivering on our longstanding commitment to expand access, narrowing the time it takes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto scale our latest innovations. Our progress was underscored by improved environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings, and we once again ranked second in the Access to Medicine Index.\n\nWe continued to go big on data science and digital technologies, integrating our data and digital teams within Customer & Technology Solutions to maximize e/fficiency as we scale value-driving projects. For example, AI Nurse, developed in collaboration with Tencent, helps patients with heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases manage disease progression. It is used by 300/uni00A0000 patients in China.\n\nNovartis also continued doing our part to end the pandemic, quickly scaling up production of COVID-19 vaccines. We're proud to have helped develop a potential new treatment option with Molecular Partners.\n\nOur financial performance highlights the progress we've made and drives confidence for the future - with 4% growth in net sales and 6% growth in core operating income from the previous year. We're confident we'll drive consistent growth to 2030 and beyond. We've also initiated a strategic review of Sandoz to enable Sandoz to be positioned as a long-term leader in the generics industry.\n\nEmerging from the COVID-19 pande mic, I remain optimistic about a new era in medicine. Stakeholders like you play an important role in that. On behalf of all of us at Novartis, we're grateful for your contributions on the journey of reimagining medicine.\n\nSincerely,\n\nVas Narasimhan Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n<!-- image -->",

You should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this Annual Report and in other documents we file with or furnish to the SEC, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in or to maintain an investment in any Novartis securities. Our business, as well as our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and share price, could be materially adversely a/ffected by any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or not currently considered material.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Key products and commercial priorities\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to deliver key commercial priorities and successfully launch new products\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business and to replace revenue and income lost to generic, biosimilar and other competition depends heavily on the commercial success of our new or existing key products. The commercial success of these products could be impacted at any time by a number of factors, including pressure from new or existing competitive products, changes in the prescribing habits of healthcare professionals, unexpected side e/ffects or safety signals, supply chain issues or other product shortages, pricing pressure, regulatory proceedings, changes in labeling, loss of intellectual property protection, and global pandemics. In addition, our revenue and margins could be significantly impacted\n\nby the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of new products.\n\nHealthcare professionals, patients and payers may choose competitor products instead of ours for various reasons, including if they perceive them to be better in terms of e/fficacy, safety, cost, convenience or other reasons. The commercial success of our key products and launches in the face of increasing competition requires significant attention and management focus. Such competitive products could significantly a/ffect the revenue from our products and our results of operations. This impact could also be compounded to the extent such competition results in us making significant additional investments in research and development, marketing or sales.\n\n## Pricing, reimbursement and access\n\n## Risk description\n\nPricing and reimbursement pressure, including access to healthcare\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur businesses experience significant pressures on the pricing of our products and on our ability to obtain and maintain satisfactory rates of reimbursement for our products by governments, insurers and other payers. These pressures have many sources, including growth of healthcare costs as a percentage of gross domestic product; funding restrictions and policy changes; management of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on healthcare spending; and public controversies, political debate, investigations and legal proceedings regarding pharmaceutical pricing. Pressures on pricing may negatively impact both our product pricing and the availability of our products.",

        "page_content": "In addition, we face numerous cost-containment measures imposed by governments and other payers, including  government-imposed  industrywide  price reductions, mandatory pricing systems, reference pricing systems, payers limiting access to treatments based on cost-benefit analyses, importation of drugs from lower-cost countries to higher-cost countries, shifting of the payment burden to patients through higher co-payments and co-pay accumulator programs, limiting physicians' ability to choose among competing medicines, mandatory substitution of generic drugs for the patented equivalent, pressure on physicians to reduce the prescribing of patented prescription medicines, increasing pressure on intellectual property protections, and growing requirements for increased transparency on pricing. For more information on price controls, see 'Item 4. Information on  the  Company-Item  4.B  Business  overviewInnovative Medicines-Price controls.'\n\nThese challenges are expected to intensify in 2022 and beyond as political and budget pressures mount, and healthcare payers around the globe, including government-controlled health authorities, insurance companies and managed care organizations, step up initiatives to reduce the overall cost of healthcare, restrict access to higher-priced new medicines, increase the use of generics, and impose overall price cuts. These factors may materially a/ffect our ability to achieve value-based prices and maintain an acceptable return on our investments in the research and development of our products, and may impact our ability to research and develop new products.\n\nIn addition, our Sandoz Division has faced and may continue to face intense competition from other generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical companies, which aggressively compete for market share, including through significant price competition. Such competitive actions may increase the costs and risks associated with our e/fforts to introduce and market generic and biosimilar products, may delay the introduction or marketing of such products, and may further limit the prices at which we are able to sell these products. In particular, in the US in past years, industrywide price competition among generic pharmaceutical companies and consolidation of buyers caused significant declines in sales and profits of Sandoz.\n\n## Research and development\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure or delay in the research and development of new products or new indications for existing products\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe engage in extensive and costly research and development  activities,  both  through  our  own  internal resources and through collaborations with third parties, in an e/ffort to identify and develop new products and new indications for existing products that address unmet and changing medical needs and are commercially successful. Our ability to grow our business; to replace sales lost due to branded competition, entry of generics, or other reasons; and to bring to market products that take advantage of new and potentially disruptive technologies, including cell, gene and radioligand therapies,\n\ndepends in significant part upon the success of these e/fforts.\n\nResearch and development of new products of our Innovative Medicines Division, including the research and development of our cell and gene therapies, is a costly, lengthy and uncertain process. Because intellectual property protections are limited in scope and duration, the longer it takes to develop a product, the less time there may be for us to recoup our research and development costs before loss of exclusivity. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. In spite of such substantial investment, there can be no guarantee that our research and development activities will produce commercially successful new products that will enable us to replace revenue and income lost to competition and to grow our business. See also 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines-Research and development' with regards to the research and development e/fforts of our Innovative Medicines Division.\n\nNew products must undergo intensive preclinical and clinical testing, and must be approved by means of a highly complex, lengthy and expensive approval processes that can vary from country to country. Further, regulatory authorities continue to establish new and increasingly rigorous and time-consuming requirements for approval and reimbursement of new products and new indications. Similarly, the post-approval regulatory burden has also increased. These requirements make the maintenance of regulatory approvals for our products increasingly expensive, and further heighten the risk of recalls, product withdrawals, change to product specifications, loss of market share, and loss of revenue and profitability. The clinical testing, regulatory processes and post-approval activities described above become more di/fficult during pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This is primarily due to challenges related to recruiting, enrolling and treating patients in clinical trials. In addition, travel restrictions resulting from pandemics make it more di/fficult for regulatory authorities to inspect sites. For a further description of the research and development and approval processes for the products of our Innovative Medicines Division, see the sections headed 'Research and development' and 'Regulation' included in the description of our Innovative Medicines Division under 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines.'\n\nOur Sandoz Division has made, and expects to continue to make, significant investments in the development of biotechnology-based, 'biologic' medicines intended for sale as bioequivalent or 'biosimilar' versions of currently  marketed  biotechnology  products.  While  the development of such products typically is significantly less costly and complex than the development of the equivalent originator medicines, it is nonetheless significantly more costly and complex than that for typical small-molecule generic products. See also 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overviewSandoz-Development and registration' with regards to the research and development e/fforts of our Sandoz Division. In addition, many countries do not yet have fully developed legislative or regulatory pathways to facilitate",

Further delays or di/fficulties in the development or marketing of biosimilars could put at risk the significant investments that Sandoz has made, and will continue to make, in its Biopharmaceuticals business. Failure to successfully develop and market biosimilars could have a material adverse e/ffect on the success of the Sandoz Division and the Group as a whole. For more information about the approval processes that must be followed to market Sandoz Division products, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Sandoz-Regulation.' Further, our research and development activities must be conducted in an ethical and compliant manner. Among other things, we are concerned with patient safety (both preand post-product approval), data privacy, Current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, data integrity, the fair treatment of patients, and animal welfare. Should we fail to properly manage such issues, we risk injury to third parties, damage to our reputation, negative financial consequences as a result of potential claims for damages, sanctions and fines, and the potential that investments in research and development activities could have no benefit to the Group. Research to find new targets for drug discovery and the therapeutic agents to treat unmet medical needs is made more di/fficult during pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic./uni00A0This is primarily due to safety-related restrictions on the ability of laboratory scientists to work in research laboratories, and impacts our ability to collaborate with academic and commercial research organizations facing similar challenges and restrictions.\n\n## Alliances, acquisitions and divestments\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to identify external business opportunities or realize the expected benefits from our strategic acquisitions or divestments\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nAs part of our strategy, from time to time we acquire and divest products or entire businesses, and enter into strategic alliances and collaborations. For example, in February 2021, we closed the in-licensing of tislelizumab from an a/ffiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. for North America, Europe and Japan. This strategy depends in part on our ability to identify strategic external business opportunities and to move forward with such opportunities on acceptable terms.\n\nOnce a strategic transaction is agreed upon with a third party, we may not be able to complete the transaction in a timely manner or at all, nor can we be sure that pre-transaction due diligence will identify all possible issues that might arise during and after the transaction. Our e/fforts on such transactions can also divert management's attention from our existing businesses.\n\nAfter a transaction, e/fforts to develop and market acquired or licensed products, to integrate the acquired business or to achieve expected synergies may fail or may not fully meet expectations, as a result of di/fficulties in retaining key personnel, customers and suppliers; failure to obtain marketing approval or reimbursement within\n\nexpected time frames or at all; di/fferences in corporate culture, standards, controls, processes and policies; or other factors. Transactions can also result in liabilities being incurred that were not known at the time of acquisition, or the creation of tax or accounting issues. Acquired businesses are not always in full compliance with legal, regulatory or Novartis standards, including, for example, Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or cGCP standards, which can be costly and time-consuming to remedy. Also, our strategic alliances and collaborations with third parties may not achieve their intended goals and objectives within expected time frames, or at all.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully divest or spin o/ff businesses or other assets that we have identified for this purpose, or that any completed divestment or spin-o/ff will achieve the expected strategic benefits, operational e/fficiencies or opportunities, or that the divestment or spin-o/ff will ultimately maximize shareholder value.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\n## Risk description\n\nExpiry, assertion or loss of intellectual property protection\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nMany products of our Innovative Medicines Division are protected by intellectual property rights, which may provide us with exclusive rights to market those products for a limited time and enable our purpose of reimagining medicine by sustainably financing our research and development. However, the strength and duration of those rights can vary significantly from product to product and country to country, and they may be successfully challenged by third parties or governmental authorities.\n\nLoss of intellectual property protection and the introduction of generic or biosimilar competition for a patented branded medicine in a country typically result in a significant and rapid reduction in net sales and operating income for the branded product. Such competition can occur after successful challenges to intellectual property rights or the regular expiration of the patent term or other intellectual property rights. Such competition can also result from the entry of generic or biosimilar versions of another medicine in the same therapeutic  class  as  one  of  our  drugs  or  in  a  competing therapeutic class, from a Declaration of Public Interest or the compulsory licensing of our intellectual property by governmental authorities, or as a result of a general weakening of intellectual property and governing laws in certain countries around the world. In addition, generic or biosimilar manufacturers may sometimes conduct so-called 'launches at risk' of products that are still under legal challenge for infringement, or whose patents are still under legal challenge for validity, before final resolution of legal proceedings.\n\nWe also rely in all aspects of our businesses on unpatented proprietary technology, know-how, trade secrets and other confidential information, which we seek to protect through various measures, including confidentiality agreements with licensees, employees, third-party col-",

If these agreements are breached or our other protective measures should fail, then our contractual or other remedies may not be adequate to cover our losses.\n\nWe may also be subject to assertions of intellectual property rights against our innovative medicines by third parties. If successful, these actions may involve payment of future royalties or damages, for example for patent infringement, and may also involve injunctive relief requiring removal of one or more dosage strengths of a product from the market (or removal of a therapeutic indication from the product's approved labeling) for some period of time or throughout the life of the asserted intellectual property right. Such damages or such an injunction may have a material impact on our operating income and net sales.\n\nIn any given year, we may experience a potentially significant impact on our net sales from products that have already lost intellectual property protections, as well as products that may lose protection during the year. Because we may have substantially reduced marketing and research and development expenses related to products that are in their final years of exclusivity, the initial loss of protection for a product during a given year could also have an impact on our operating income for that year in an amount corresponding to a significant portion of the product's lost sales. The magnitude of the impact of generic or biosimilar competition on our income could depend on a number of factors, including, with respect to income in a given year, the time of year at which the generic or biosimilar competitor is launched; the ease or di/fficulty of manufacturing a competitor product and obtaining regulatory approval to market it; the number of generic or biosimilar competitor products approved, including whether, in the US, a single competitor is granted an exclusive marketing period; whether an authorized generic is launched; the geographies in which generic or biosimilar competitor products are approved, including the strength of the market for generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical products in such geographies, and the comparative profitability of branded pharmaceutical products in such geographies; and our ability to successfully develop and launch new products for patients that may also o/ffset the income lost to generic or biosimilar competition. For more information on the patent and  generic  competition  status  of  our  Innovative Medicines Division products, see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines-Intellectual property.'\n\n## Environmental, social and governance matters\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to meet environmental, social and governance expectations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nIncreasingly, in addition to financial results, companies are being judged by performance on a variety of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, which can contribute to the long-term sustainability of our companies' performance. An inability to successfully perform on ESG matters and meet societal expectations can\n\nresult in negative impacts to our reputation, recruitment, retention, operations, financial results and share price.\n\nA variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. In addition, investment in funds that specialize in companies that perform well in such assessments are increasingly popular, and major institutional investors have publicly emphasized the importance of such ESG measures in making their investment decisions. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, the unintentional costs or benefits of our actions on third parties not involved in such actions, which may impact society and the environment, such as with respect to climate change, the degradation of biodiversity, and inequality in society. In particular, the resulting costs of such actions may in the long term impact our operations and ability to achieve our strategic goals, ultimately resulting in broader negative impacts on the value of Novartis. Therefore, the role of our Board of Directors and executive o/fficers in supervising various sustainability issues is becoming increasingly important. In addition to the topics typically considered in such assessments in the healthcare industry, the public's ability to access our medicines is particularly important. If our advocacy and lobbying e/fforts are not aligned with our publicly stated ESG targets, our purpose statement or societal expectations, our performance on ESG assessments may be negatively impacted.\n\nWe actively manage a broad range of such ESG matters, taking into consideration their expected impact on the sustainability of our business over time, and the potential impact of our business on society and the environment. We recently created an ESG Management O/ffice, which is tasked with developing our ESG strategy and tracking our performance against our ESG targets. However, in light of investors' increasing focus on ESG matters and rapidly changing views on acceptable levels of action across a range of topics, there can be no certainty that we will manage such issues successfully, that the ESG standards we use to create our ESG targets and currently use to measure our performance against will remain the same, or that we will successfully meet society's or investors' expectations.\n\n## Sandoz business transformation\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to drive sustainable growth mid-term by pursuing biosimilars and inorganic growth opportunities\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur Sandoz Division operates in a challenging generics and biosimilars market, where it faces intense competition and continued pricing pressures as it seeks to increase its market share and achieve sustainable and profitable growth mid-term. To achieve this objective, we are implementing a strategy for Sandoz focused on several goals, including accelerating biosimilars growth in the long term, rebuilding the Sandoz US business, and achieving inorganic growth by identifying and successfully executing on merger and acquisition and strategic in-licensing partnership opportunities on acceptable terms. There is no guarantee that we will achieve our strategic goals for Sandoz within the expected time",

As a result, our inability to achieve these strategic goals or to successfully implement any proposed actions arising out of the strategic review could have a material adverse e/ffect on the success of the Sandoz Division and the Group as a whole, and may have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the strategic review itself will utilize additional employee and management time as well as Company resources that could be allocated to other areas of our business, which may negatively impact our overall Company performance. See also '-Pricing, reimbursement and access' with regards to the price competition for our Sandoz Division, '-Research and development' with regards to our research and development e/fforts related to the biosimilars market, and '-Alliances, acquisitions and divestments.'\n\n## Emerging business models\n\n## Risk description\n\nMissed opportunities in digitalization and emerging business models\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nRapid progress in medical and digital technologies and in the development of new business models is substantially transforming our industry and is creating new businesses and new opportunities for improving patient care and increasing revenue and profit, while sometimes quickly rendering established businesses uncompetitive or obsolete. Such transformations, both positive and negative, may impact the healthcare industry overall. Numerous tech companies are seeking to enter into the healthcare field, from research and development to pharmaceutical distribution and the delivery of care, which generates opportunities for technology partnerships that may accelerate innovation and complement our capabilities. However, this may also potentially disrupt our relationships with patients, healthcare professionals, customers, distributors and suppliers, with potentially negative consequences for us.\n\nTo take advantage of these opportunities, we have embarked upon a digital transformation strategy, with the goal of becoming an industry leader in leveraging advanced analytics and digital technologies, which was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to invest substantial resources into e/fforts to improve the way we use data in drug discovery and development; to gain insights into customer preferences and behaviors via data science; to improve the ways we engage with patients, doctors and other stakeholders; and to automate business processes. Our success in these e/fforts will depend on many factors, including data quality, technology architecture, partnering with the right technology companies, training our employees to fully capitalize on the new capabilities, attracting and retaining employees with appropriate skills and mindsets, and successfully innovating across a variety of technology fields. Our\n\ne/fforts in some of these initiatives have started to gain significant traction. However, we do not yet know if these changes will be sustainable as we scale and make them part of our ways of working. As a result, we may ultimately fail to either create innovative new products, tools or techniques in an adequate time frame, or fail to di/fferentiate our products and business models via digital technologies.\n\nFurthermore, our increasing use of social media and other digital engagement platforms carries risks related to potential violations of rules regulating the promotion of prescription medicines and the potential disclosure of confidential information, trade secrets, or loss of other intellectual property. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of social media and other digital engagement platforms has increased and is expanding into new uses. There continue to be uncertainties as to the rules that apply to such communications and as to the interpretations that health authorities will apply in this context, and as a result, despite our e/fforts to comply with applicable rules, there is a risk that our use of social media and other digital engagement platforms may cause us to be found in violation of applicable regulations.\n\nIn addition, the market for our products is evolving rapidly with frequent changes in scientific evidence, significant advances in availability and utilization of realworld evidence (RWE), and the acceleration in the adoption  of  virtual  and  social  media  and  other  digital engagement platforms by customers, patients and other stakeholders, which may allow us to (i) better understand the appropriate utilization of our products through RWE, (ii)  engage  and  appropriately  educate  customers, patients and other stakeholders about the benefits and risks associated with our products, and (iii) increase the e/fficiency of our engagement with customers. Failure to e/ffectively utilize these increasingly important channels and sources of evidence can result in the inadequate education of customers regarding the benefits and risks of our products and the loss of market share. In addition, there is risk of inappropriate utilization of this data and these channels by our employees or vendors.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Cybersecurity and IT systems\n\n## Risk description\n\nCybersecurity breaches and catastrophic loss of IT systems\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe are heavily dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology (IT) systems, including internet-based systems to support our business processes. We also have outsourced significant parts of our IT infrastructure to third-party providers, and we currently use these providers to perform business-critical IT services for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and incidents on such networks and systems, whether our own or those of the third-party providers we contract, and we have experienced and may in the future experience such cybersecurity threats",

        "page_content": "and attacks. Cybersecurity threats and attacks take many forms, and the size, age and complexity of our IT systems make them potentially vulnerable to external and internal security threats; outages; malicious intrusions and attacks; cybercrimes, including state-sponsored cybercrimes; malware; misplaced or lost data; programming or human errors; or other similar events. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of such threats and attacks has increased, as virtual and remote working has become more widely used, and sensitive data is accessed by employees working in less secure, home-based environments. In addition, due to our reliance on third-party providers, we have experienced and may in the future experience interruptions, delays or outages in IT service availability due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or security attacks experienced by or caused by the third-party provider. Interruptions in the service provided by these third parties could a/ffect our ability to perform critical tasks.\n\nA significant information security or other event, such as a disruption or loss of availability of one or more of our IT systems, whether managed by us or a third-party service provider, has previously and could in the future negatively impact important business processes, such as the conduct of scientific research and clinical trials, the submission of data and information to health authorities, our manufacturing and supply chain processes, our shipments to customers, our compliance with legal obligations, and communication between employees and with third parties. IT issues have previously led to, and could in the future lead to, the compromise of trade secrets or other intellectual property that could be sold and used by competitors to accelerate the development or manufacturing of competing products; to the compromise of personal financial and health information; and to the compromise of IT security data such as usernames, passwords and encryption keys, as well as security strategies and information about network infrastructure, which could allow unauthorized parties to gain access to additional systems or data. In addition, malfunctions in software or medical devices that make significant use of IT could lead to a risk of direct harm to patients.\n\nAlthough we have experienced some of the events described above, to date they have not had a material impact on our operations. Nonetheless, the occurrence of any of the events described above in the future could disrupt our business operations and result in enforcement actions or liability, including potential government fines and penalties, claims for damages, and shareholder litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.\n\nAny significant events of this type could require us to expend significant resources beyond those we already invest to remediate any damage, to further modify or enhance our protective measures, and to enable the continuity of our business.\n\n## Third-party management\n\n## Risk description\n\nFailure to maintain adequate governance and oversight over third-party relationships, and failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory or other obligations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe outsource the performance of certain key business functions to third parties, and invest a significant amount of e/ffort and resources into doing so, including to manage and oversee such third parties. Such outsourced functions include research and development collaborations, manufacturing operations, warehousing and distribution activities, certain finance functions, sales and marketing activities, data management and others. Some of these third parties, particularly those in developing countries, do not have internal compliance systems comparable to those within our organization.\n\nOur reliance on outsourcing and third parties for the research and development, sales or manufacturing of our products poses certain risks, including misappropriation of our intellectual property, failure of the third party to comply with regulatory and quality assurance requirements, unexpected supply disruptions, breach of the research and development or manufacturing agreement by the third party, and the unexpected termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party.\n\nIn addition, governments and the public expect companies like Novartis to take responsibility for and report on compliance with various human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental practices, as well as other actions of their third-party contractors around the world.\n\nUltimately, if third parties fail to meet their obligations to us, we may lose our investment in the collaborations or fail to receive the expected benefits of our agreements with such third parties. In addition, should any of these third parties fail to comply with the law or our standards, or should they otherwise act inappropriately in the course of their performance of services for us, there is a risk that we could be held responsible for their acts, that our reputation may su/ffer, and that penalties may be imposed upon us.\n\n## Manufacturing and product quality\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to ensure proper controls in product development and product manufacturing, and failure to comply with applicable regulations and standards\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nThe development and manufacture of our products is complex and heavily regulated by governmental health authorities around the world. Whether or not our products and the related raw materials are developed and manufactured at our own manufacturing sites or by third parties, we must ensure that all development and manufacturing processes comply with regulatory requirements as well as our own quality standards in order to deliver novel therapies to patients with unmet needs while ensuring patient safety. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements has resulted in, and may in the future result in, warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of products, injunctions, product recalls, failure to secure product approvals, or debarment.\n\nIn recent years, global health authorities have substantially intensified their scrutiny of manufacturers' compliance with regulatory requirements. Any significant failure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with regulatory  requirements,  or  with  health  authorities'",

A failure to fully comply with regulatory requirements could also lead to a delay in the approval of new products, an inability to ship or import our products, and significant penalties and reputational harm.\n\n## Fragmented IT landscape and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Enterprise Data Management (EDM) implementation\n\n## Risk description\n\nFragmented business processes and unclear data ownership may impact future digital opportunities, including the implementation of the new ERP system and EDM governance\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe rely on various information and other business systems to leverage data in order to operate our complex global business. Historically, while there are highly overlapping data strategy and architectural needs across our business units, we have taken the approach of building distinct solutions across both business units and geographies, which may cause disruptions to our operational stability. We are currently in the design and planning phase for the implementation of a new global ERP system that seeks to simplify, standardize and digitize processes in our commercial and finance functions and our Novartis Technical Operations unit to help ensure e/fficient and compliant business operations across business units and geographies as well as the availability of high-quality data necessary to aid our decision-making. We expect the first implementation of our new ERP system to begin in the second half of 2023, with full implementation by 2028, when our current system is out of maintenance by the software provider. Implementing and operating a new ERP system involves certain risks, including a failure of the new system to operate as expected, a failure to properly integrate with other systems we use, potential loss of data or information, compliance issues, cost overruns and delays, and operational disruptions. Any disruptions or malfunctions of our new ERP system could cause critical information we use to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate or inaccessible. In addition, if the design or implementation of our new ERP system is deficient, it could adversely a/ffect our operations, and could negatively impact the e/ffectiveness of our internal controls.\n\n## Talent management\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to attract, integrate and retain key personnel and qualified individuals\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe rely on a diverse, highly skilled workforce across our businesses and functions. Novartis invests in attracting, integrating and retaining talented individuals to achieve our business objectives. If we are unable to su/fficiently attract, integrate and retain key personnel - including senior  members  of  our  scientific  and  management\n\nteams, high-quality researchers and development specialists, and skilled personnel in key markets - our ability to achieve our major business objectives may be adversely a/ffected, our brand and reputation could be negatively impacted, and the diversity of our workforce may decline.\n\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to retain key talent and leaders while also recruiting new talent who bring new skills and perspectives. The market for skilled talent has become increasingly competitive. We are experiencing challenges in attracting and retaining skilled talent in several areas, including biology, chemistry, clinical development, drug manufacturing, IT and, in particular, our Oncology business unit and advanced technology platforms (i.e., our chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR/hyphen.capT) therapies, gene therapies and radioligand therapies). In addition, biotechnology companies have seen and continue to see a significant inflow of capital, and are not only competing with us to attract the same skilled talent but are also aggressively pursuing our experienced talent, threatening our ability to sustain a skilled talent supply to deliver on our business priorities.\n\nThe constraints associated with lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the need for more flexible working models. We addressed this need through our program called Choice with Responsibility, which now gives many employees the flexibility to determine, in consultation with their teams, where, when and how they work, while remaining in compliance with any tax, legal and other limitations. Our transition toward a more flexible working model accelerated our e/fforts to expand our recruitment of talent from an increasingly global pool. However, the external supply of new talent is especially limited in many of the geographies that are expected to be sources of growth for Novartis, particularly China and the US. In China, the US and several other markets, the geographic mobility of talent is decreasing, with ample career opportunities available closer to home for talented individuals, who often have increasing expectations that they may choose where they work.\n\nThe risks associated with drawing from the external supply of talent will be exacerbated if we are unable to retain and e/ffectively develop our key personnel and maintain a sustainable pipeline of talent and senior leaders with the critical skills and experiences necessary to deliver on our business priorities. As a result, our ability to retain critical talent, reward performance, incentivize our employees, pay competitive compensation and successfully implement our key personnel succession plans is essential. Our inability to integrate, engage and motivate employees, in particular those in leadership positions, may jeopardize our succession plans and our ability to achieve our business priorities.\n\n## Legal, ethics and compliance\n\n## Risk description\n\nChallenges in keeping up with legal and regulatory requirements, and evolving societal expectations regarding ethical behavior\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe are obligated to comply with the laws of all countries in which we operate and sell products with respect to an",

        "page_content": "extremely wide and growing range of activities. Such legal requirements are extensive and complex.\n\nThe laws and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry and applicable to us are broad in scope and are subject to change and evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our business practices. For example, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to various significant legal proceedings, such as private party litigation, government investigations and law enforcement actions worldwide. These types of matters may take various forms based upon evolving government enforcement and private party litigation priorities, and could include matters pertaining to pricing; bribery and corruption; trade regulation and embargo legislation; product liability; commercial  disputes;  employment  and  wrongful  discharge; antitrust; securities; government benefit programs; reimbursement; rebates; healthcare fraud; sales and marketing practices; insider trading; occupational health and safety; environmental regulations; tax; cybersecurity; data privacy; regulatory interactions; and intellectual property. Such activities can involve criminal proceedings and can retroactively challenge practices previously considered to be legal.\n\nThere is also a risk that governance for our medical and patient support activities, and our interactions with governments, public o/fficials/institutions, healthcare professionals,  healthcare  organizations  and  patient organizations may be inadequate or fail, or that we may undertake activities based on improper or inadequate scientific justification.\n\nOur Sandoz Division may from time to time seek approval to market a generic version of a product before the expiration of patents claimed by the marketer of the patented product. We do this in cases where we believe the relevant patents are invalid or unenforceable, or would not be infringed by our generic product. As a result, a/ffiliates of our Sandoz Division frequently face patent litigation, and in certain circumstances, we may make the business decision to market a generic product even though patent infringement actions are still pending. Should we elect to do so and conduct a so-called 'launch at risk,' we could face substantial damages if the final court decision is adverse to us.\n\nLegal proceedings and investigations are inherently unpredictable, and large judgments sometimes occur. As a consequence, we may in the future incur judgments that could involve large payments, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly, and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, such legal proceedings and investigations, even if meritless, may a/ffect our reputation, may create a risk of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the US and other countries, and may lead to civil litigation. As a result, having taken into account all relevant factors, we have in the past and may again in the future enter into major settlements of such claims without bringing them to final legal adjudication by courts or other such bodies, despite having potentially significant defenses against them, in order to limit the risks they pose to our business and reputation. Such settlements may require us to pay significant sums of money and to enter into corporate integrity or similar agree-\n\nments, which are intended to regulate company behavior for extended periods.\n\nFor information on significant legal matters pending against us, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 28. Commitments and contingencies.'\n\nNew requirements may also be imposed on us as a result of changing government and societal expectations regarding the healthcare industry, and acceptable corporate behavior generally. For example, we are faced with laws and regulations requiring changes in how we do business, including with respect to disclosures concerning our interactions with healthcare professionals, healthcare  organizations  and  patient  organizations. These laws and regulations include requirements that we disclose payments or other transfers of value made to healthcare professionals and organizations, as well as information relating to the costs and prices for our products, which represent evolving standards of acceptable corporate behavior. These requirements may incur significant costs, including substantial time and additional resources, that are necessary to bring our interactions with healthcare professionals and organizations into compliance with these evolving standards.\n\nIn addition to legal and regulatory requirements, as a company we aim to meet the evolving societal expectations of the public and our investors regarding ethical behavior and the increasing importance placed on ESG matters.\n\nTo help us in our e/fforts to comply with the many requirements that impact us, we have a significant global ethics and compliance program in place, and we devote substantial time and resources to e/fforts to ensure that our business is conducted in a lawful and publicly acceptable manner. Despite our e/fforts, an actual or alleged failure to comply with law or with heightened public expectations could lead to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance, or to other significant losses.\n\n## Data privacy\n\n## Risk description\n\nNoncompliance with personal data protection laws and regulations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe operate in an environment that relies on the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets of patients' and other individuals' personal information, including via social media and mobile technologies. Also, the operation of our business requires data to flow freely across borders of numerous countries in which there are di/fferent, and potentially conflicting, frequently changing data privacy laws in e/ffect. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took e/ffect in May 2018; the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took e/ffect in January 2020; Brazil's General Personal Data Protection Law, which entered into force in September 2020; and the Personal Information Protection Law in China, which took e/ffect in November 2021, impose stringent requirements on how we and third parties with whom we contract collect, share, export or oth-",

Breaches of our systems or those of our third-party contractors, or other failures to protect the data we collect from misuse or breach by third parties, could expose such personal information to unauthorized persons.\n\nAny event involving the substantial loss of personal information, use of personal information without a legal basis, or other privacy violations could give rise to significant liability, reputational harm, damaged relationships with business partners, and potentially substantial monetary penalties under laws enacted or being enacted around the world. Such events could also lead to restrictions on our ability to use personal information and/or transfer personal information across country borders. In addition, there is a trend of increasing divergence of data privacy legal frameworks, not only across these frameworks but also within individual legal frameworks themselves. This divergence may constrain the implementation of global business processes and may lead to di/fferent approaches on the use of health data for scientific research, which may have a negative impact on our business and operations.\n\n## Supply chain\n\n## Risk description\n\nInability to maintain continuity of product supply\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nMany of our products are produced using technically complex manufacturing processes and require a supply of highly specialized raw materials. For some of our products and raw materials, we may rely on a single source of supply. In addition, we manufacture and sell a number of sterile products, biologic products, and products involving advanced therapy platforms, such as CAR/hyphen.capT therapies, gene therapies and radioligand therapy products, all of which are particularly complex and involve highly specialized manufacturing technologies. Because the production process for some of our products is complex, there is a risk of production failures, which may result in supply interruptions or product recalls due to defective products being distributed to the market.\n\nIn addition, due to the inherent complexities of our production processes, we are required to plan our production activities well in advance. If we su/ffer from thirdparty raw material shortages, underestimate market demand for a product, or fail to accurately predict when a new product will be approved for sale, then we may not be able to produce su/fficient product to meet demand. These issues could be made worse during a pandemic like the COVID-19 pandemic, and could lead to (i) a sudden increase in demand for selected medicinal products, resulting in the short-term unavailability of raw material; (ii) logistical and supply challenges that may lead to our inability to ship products from one place to another due to restrictions imposed as a result of a pandemic, which can impact transportation and warehousing costs; or (iii) our inability to properly operate a production site due to restrictions imposed as the result of a pandemic.\n\nOur or our third-party suppliers' inability to manage such issues could lead to shutdowns, to product shortages, or to our being entirely unable to supply products\n\nto patients for an extended period of time. Further, because our products are intended to promote the health of patients, such shortages or shutdowns could endanger our reputation and have led to, and could continue to lead to, significant losses of sales revenue, potential litigation or allegations that the public health, or the health of individuals, has been harmed.\n\n## Falsified medicines\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact on patient safety, and reputational and financial harm to Novartis and our products\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe continue to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to falsified medicines, which include counterfeit,  stolen,  tampered  and  illegally  diverted medicines under the definition of the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially increased the presence of falsified medicines in the markets a/ffected and on the internet. Falsified medicines pose patient safety risks and can be seriously harmful or life-threatening. Reports of adverse events related to falsified medicines and increased levels of falsified medicines in the healthcare system a/ffect patient confidence in our genuine medicines and in healthcare systems in general. These events could also cause us substantial reputational and financial harm, and potentially lead to litigation if the adverse event from the falsified medicine is mistakenly attributed to the genuine one. Stolen or illegally diverted medicines, which are then not properly stored and are later sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. Further, there is a direct financial loss when, for example, falsified medicines replace sales of genuine medicines, or genuine medicines are recalled following discovery of falsified products.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\n## Geo-political and socio-economic threats\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of geo- and socio-political threats and macroeconomic developments\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nUnpredictable political conditions currently exist in various parts of the world, including a backlash in certain areas  against  free  trade;  anti-immigrant  sentiment; anti-corporatist sentiment; social unrest; fears of terrorism; risk of direct conflicts between nations; a global pandemic; and economic downturn.\n\nThe imposition of tari/ffs, including those imposed by the US and China, and the possibility of additional tari/ffs or other trade restrictions relating to trade between the US and other countries, could have a material negative impact on our business. Given that the status of trade negotiations remains subject to change, we cannot be certain of the nature or extent of the potential impact on our business. For example, if tari/ffs on pharmaceutical products or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)",

Increasing opposition to free trade may increase the risks we face in our e/fforts to improve and harmonize standards in regulation and intellectual property.\n\nFurthermore, significant conflicts continue in certain parts of the world. Collectively, such unstable conditions could, among other things, disturb the international flow of goods and increase the costs and di/fficulties of international transactions, which could significantly impact time to market and our ability to supply our products to patients in an undisrupted fashion, and further erode reimbursement levels for innovative therapies.\n\nIn addition, local economic conditions may adversely a/ffect the ability of payers, as well as our distributors, customers, suppliers and service providers, to pay for our products, or otherwise to buy necessary inventory or raw materials, and to perform their obligations under agreements with us. Although we make e/fforts to monitor these third parties' financial condition and their liquidity, our ability to do so is limited, and some of them may become unable to pay their bills in a timely manner or may even become insolvent. These risks may be elevated with respect to our interactions with fiscally challenged government payers, or with third parties with substantial exposure to such payers.\n\nOur business may be impacted by economic and financial conditions directly a/ffecting consumers. Given that in many countries, patients directly pay a large portion of their own healthcare costs, there is a risk that consumers may cut back on prescription drugs due to financial constraints.\n\nAt the same time, significant changes and potential future volatility in the financial markets, in the consumer and business environment, in the competitive landscape, and in the global political and security landscape make it increasingly di/fficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings. As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook that we have given or might give may be overtaken by events, or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate. Though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenues and earnings at the time we give such guidance, based on then-current knowledge and conditions, there is a risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be incorrect.\n\nFinancial market issues may also result in a lower return on our financial investments, and a lower value on some of our assets. Alternatively, inflation could accelerate, which could lead to higher interest rates, increasing our costs of raising capital. Uncertainties around future central bank and other economic policies in the US and EU, as well as high debt levels in certain other countries,  could  also  impact  world  trade.  Sudden increases in economic, currency or financial market volatility in di/fferent countries have also impacted, and may continue to unpredictably impact, our business or results of operations, including the conversion of our operating results into our reporting currency, the US dollar, as well as the value of our investments in our pension plans.\n\nFor a discussion of the e/ffect of price controls on our business, see 'Item 4.

Financial Statements-Note  29.  Financial  instruments  -  additional disclosures.'\n\n## Tax laws and developments\n\n## Risk description\n\nChanges in tax laws or their application\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nOur multinational operations are taxed under the laws of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in tax laws or in their application could lead to an increased risk of international tax disputes and an increase in our e/ffective tax rate, which could adversely a/ffect our financial results. The integrated nature of our worldwide operations can produce conflicting claims from revenue authorities in di/fferent countries as to the profits to be taxed in the individual countries, including potential disputes relating to the prices our subsidiaries charge one another for intercompany transactions, known as transfer pricing. Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have double tax treaties with other foreign jurisdictions, which provide a framework for mitigating the impact of double taxation on our revenues and capital gains. However, mechanisms developed to resolve such conflicting claims are largely untried and can be expected to be very lengthy. Accruals for tax contingencies are made based on experience, interpretations of tax law, and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities. However, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payments materially di/fferent from the amounts accrued.\n\nIn 2019, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) launched a new initiative on behalf of the G20 to minimize profit shifting by working toward a global tax framework that ensures that corporate income taxes are paid where consumption takes place and also introduces a global standard on minimum taxation combined with new tax dispute resolution processes. This project achieved OECD political consensus in October 2021, and the detailed principles are still under discussion. The OECD expects that the implementation of these new principles will begin globally in 2023. The EU also adopted a new Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC6) in 2018, which seeks additional reporting as of July 2020. During 2021, all EU member states implemented this EU directive as part of their respective local laws and regulations. In 2020, the EU announced it will introduce new centralized taxation powers to address the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not yet occurred. In addition, the European Commission continues to extend the application of its policies seeking to limit fiscal aid by member states to particular companies, and the related investigation of the member states' practices regarding the",

Our current and long-term debt requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service interest and principal payments and, if interest rates rise, this amount may increase. As a result, our existing debt may limit our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, to engage in transactions, or to meet other capital needs, or otherwise may place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt. Our debt could also limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business or industry, and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy. We may also have di/fficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring new debt on terms that we would consider to be commercially reasonable, if at all.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Risk description\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant impairment charges\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet, including, in particular, substantial goodwill and other intangible assets obtained through acquisitions, including  most  recently  through  our  acquisitions  of  The Medicines Company, Xiidra , Endocyte, Novartis Gene Therapies, AAA, and certain oncology products from GSK. As a result, we may incur significant impairment charges in the future if the fair value of the intangible assets and the groupings of cash-generating units containing goodwill would be less than their carrying value on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at any point in time.\n\nWe regularly review our intangible and tangible assets for impairment, including identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. Any significant impairment charges could have a material adverse e/ffect on our results of operations and financial condition. In 2021, for example, we\n\nrecorded intangible asset impairment charges of USD 403 million.\n\nFor  a  detailed  discussion  of  how  we  determine whether an impairment has occurred, what factors could result in an impairment, and the impact of impairment charges on our results of operations, see Item 18. Financial Statements-Note/uni00A01. Significant accounting policies' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.'\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rates\n\n## Risk description\n\nNegative e/ffect on financial results due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nChanges in exchange rates between the US dollar, our reporting currency, and other currencies can result in significant increases or decreases in our reported sales, costs and earnings as expressed in US dollars, and in the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows.\n\nIn addition to ordinary market risk, there is a risk that countries could take a/ffirmative steps that could significantly impact the value of their currencies. Such steps could include 'quantitative easing' measures and potential withdrawals by countries from common currencies. In addition, countries facing local financial di/fficulties, including countries experiencing high inflation rates and highly indebted countries facing large capital outflows, may impose controls on the exchange of foreign currency. Currency exchange controls could limit our ability to distribute retained earnings from our local a/ffiliates, or to pay intercompany payables due from those countries.\n\nDespite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge against foreign currency exchange risks, because a significant portion of our earnings and expenditures are in currencies other than the US dollar, including expenditures in Swiss francs that are significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate volatility may negatively and materially impact our results of operations and financial condition, and may impact the reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and liabilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict. Further, depending on the movements of particular foreign exchange rates, we may be materially adversely a/ffected at a time when the same currency movements are benefiting some of our competitors.\n\nFor more information on the e/ffects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated financial statements and on how we manage currency risk, see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.B Liquidity and capital resources-E/ffects of currency fluctuations' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Key customers\n\n## Risk description\n\nOngoing consolidation among our distributors and retailers, and the concentration of credit risk",

        "page_content": "## Context and potential impact\n\nIncreasingly, a significant portion of our global sales is made to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers, retail chains and other purchasing organizations. For example, our three most important customers globally accounted for approximately 17%, 11% and 6%, respectively, of net sales in 2021. The largest trade receivables outstanding were for these three customers, amounting to 16%, 12% and 7%, respectively, of the Group's trade receivables at December 31, 2021. The trend has been toward further consolidation among distributors and retailers. As a result, we may be a/ffected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of such customers. Furthermore, these customers are gaining additional purchasing leverage, increasing the pricing pressures facing our businesses. These pressures can particularly impact our Sandoz Division, the generic products of which can often be obtained from numerous competitors. Moreover, we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as a result of this concentration among our customers. If one or more of our major customers experienced financial difficulties, the e/ffect on us would be substantial, and could include a substantial loss of sales and an inability to collect amounts owed to us.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\n## Risk description\n\nImpact of environmental liabilities\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nThe environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose actual and potential obligations on us to investigate and remediate contaminated sites, including in connection with activities in the past by businesses that are no longer part of Novartis. In some cases, these remediation e/fforts may take many years. While we have set aside provisions for known worldwide environmental liabilities that are probable and estimable, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts for which we have provided in the Group consolidated financial statements. If environmental contamination resulting from our facility operations, business activities or products adversely impacts third parties or if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facilities, including the safety of our employees and contractors, and the environmental risks, we may face substantial one-time and recurring costs and other penalties, and be required to increase our provisions for environmental liabilities.\n\nSee also 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.D Property, plants and equipment' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities.'\n\n## Climate change\n\n## Risk description\n\nClimate change and increased risk of major natural disasters\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nNovartis is exposed to climate risks such as physical risks (e.g., heat, water scarcity, sea level rise, flooding\n\nfrom severe weather events) and transition risks (e.g., regulatory frameworks, carbon pricing, cost of and access to capital), which could vary in magnitude and impact country by country.\n\nFor example, some of our production facilities that depend on the availability of significant water supplies are located in areas where water is increasingly scarce. Other facilities are located in places that, because of increasingly violent weather events, sea level rise, or both, are increasingly at risk of substantial flooding. In regions where this risk is present, it impacts not only our own operations but also our distributed supply chain. Such events may result in increased costs, business interruptions, destruction of facilities, loss of life, and disruption to healthcare systems that patients use to access our medicines.\n\nClimate change may trigger the adoption of new regulatory requirements across the globe. Such legislation could include increased requirements to invest in technology to reduce energy use, water use and greenhouse gas emissions, beyond what we expect to invest in our existing plans. In addition, legislation could include carbon  pricing,  climate  risk  disclosure  mandates,  and changes in zoning or building codes to increase climate resilience. The combined impact of these transition risks could increase our direct operating costs and result in the same impact across our supply chain. As a result of these transition risks, we are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025, and carbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition, we are committed to achieving net zero across our value chain by 2040. Any failure to achieve these commitments in the expected time frame, or at all, could result in negative impacts to our reputation, our operations, and the price of our shares.\n\nFurthermore, our corporate headquarters, the headquarters of our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions, and certain of our major Innovative Medicines Division production and research facilities are located near earthquake fault lines in Basel, Switzerland. Other major facilities are located near major earthquake fault lines in various locations around the world. In the event of a major earthquake, we could experience business interruptions, destruction of facilities, and loss of life.\n\n## Pension plans\n\n## Risk description\n\nInaccuracies in the assumptions and estimates used to calculate our pension plan and other post-employment obligations\n\n## Context and potential impact\n\nWe sponsor pension and other post-employment benefit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the discount rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pension increases.

An oral single-pill combination of vildagliptin and metformin, marketed as Eucreas/GalvusMet , is also approved in the EU and other countries to treat adults with type/uni00A02 diabetes.\n\n## Compounds in development\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the key Innovative Medicines Division projects currently in the\n\nConfirmatory Development stage and may also describe certain projects in the Exploratory Development stage. Projects typically enter Confirmatory Development and become the responsibility of our Global Drug Development organization during Phase II testing. (For more information about our drug development program, see '-Research and development-Development program.') Projects are listed in alphabetical order by compound code, or by product name where applicable. Projects include those seeking to develop potential uses of new molecular entities as well as potential additional indications or new formulations for already marketed products. The table below, entitled 'Projects removed from the development table since 2020,' highlights changes to the table entitled 'Selected development projects' from the previous year.\n\nThe year that each project entered the current phase of development refers to the year of the first patient's first visit in the first clinical trial of that phase. For projects in Phase II, the year refers to the first patient's first visit in the first Phase II trial, which can happen before the Confirmatory Development stage. Prior to 2020, we reported the current phase based on the year in which the decision to enter the phase was made. To maintain continuity, we have included certain previously disclosed projects, noted below, that have not yet achieved 'first patient, first visit' in any Phase I/hyphen.capIII study for the reported indication and route of administration. We have disclosed these projects using our previous reporting criteria.\n\nA reference to a project being in registration means that an application has been submitted to a health authority for marketing approval. Compounds and new indications in development are subject to required regulatory approvals and, in certain instances, contractual limitations. These compounds and indications are in various stages of development throughout the world. It may not be possible to obtain regulatory approval for any or all of the new compounds and new indications referred to in this Form/uni00A020-F in any country or in every country. See '-Regulation' for further information on the approval process.",

The manufacturing of our products is highly regulated by governmental health authorities around the world, including the FDA and EMA. In addition to regulatory requirements, many of our products involve technically complex manufacturing processes or require highly specialized raw materials.\n\nIn 2021, we integrated Novartis Gene Therapies into our existing manufacturing and supply structure, created a new ophthalmology supply unit, and launched a contract manufacturing organization in biotechnology and cell and gene therapy services. We manufacture our products across the following platforms at facilities worldwide: large molecules, small molecules, Sandoz Technical Operations, cell and gene therapy, and ophthalmology and local market manufacturing (see also 'Item/uni00A04.D Property, plants and equipment'). In our manufacturing  network,  we  maintain  state-of-the-art processes, with quality as a priority, and require our suppliers to adhere to the same high standards we expect from our own people and processes. Those processes include chemical and biological syntheses; sterile processing, including CAR/hyphen.capT cell processing; and formulation and packaging. We are constantly working to improve our existing manufacturing processes, to develop new and innovative technologies, and to review and adapt our manufacturing network to meet our needs and those of our patients and customers.\n\nWe produce raw materials for manufacturing in-house or we purchase them from a number of third-party suppliers. Where possible, we maintain multiple supply sources so that the business is not dependent on a sin-\n\ngle or limited number of suppliers. However, our ability to do so may at times be limited by regulatory or other requirements. We monitor market developments that could have an adverse e/ffect on the supply of essential materials. Our suppliers of raw materials are required to comply with applicable regulations and Novartis quality standards.\n\nBecause the manufacturing of our products is complex and highly regulated by governmental health authorities, supply is never guaranteed. If we or our third-party suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, then there could be a product recall or other disruption to our production activities. We have experienced supply interruptions for our products in the past, and there can be no assurance that supply will not be interrupted again in the future. However, we have implemented a global manufacturing strategy to maximize business continuity in case of such events.\n\n## Marketing and sales\n\nThe Innovative Medicines Division serves customers with 23 243 field force representatives, as of December/uni00A031, 2021, including supervisors and administrative personnel. These trained representatives present the therapeutic benefits and risks of our products to physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, insurance groups, managed care organizations and other healthcare professionals. In the US, Novartis advertises certain products via digital and traditional media channels, including the internet, television, newspapers and magazines. Novartis also pursues co-promotion/co-marketing opportunities as well as licensing and distribution agreements with other companies in various markets.",

        "page_content": "The marketplace for healthcare is evolving: Customer groups beyond prescribers have increasing influence on treatment decisions and guidelines, while patients continue to become more informed stakeholders in their healthcare decisions and look for solutions to meet their changing needs. Novartis is responding by adapting our business practices to engage appropriately with patients, customer groups and other stakeholders, including by delivering innovative solutions to drive education, access and improved patient care.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated additional changes related to marketing and sales techniques in the healthcare industry. For example, many healthcare professionals have increased their use of virtual platforms when interacting with pharmaceutical companies, and prefer to receive information in a more convenient and personalized way. In response, Novartis is working to implement a new customer engagement model that combines traditional face-to-face visits with digital methods of engaging healthcare professionals. We are similarly changing our approach to engaging healthcare systems, payers and other healthcare providers.\n\nAlthough specific distribution patterns vary by country, Novartis generally sells its prescription drugs primarily to wholesale and retail drug distributors, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and managed healthcare providers. The growing number of so-called 'specialty' drugs in our portfolio has resulted in increased engagement with specialty pharmacies. In the US, specialty pharmacies continue to grow as a distribution channel for specialty products. Most specialty drugs can only be dispensed through specialty pharmacies that are wholly owned by national pharmacy benefit managers.\n\nIn the US, the US Centers for Medicare/uni00A0& Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest single payer for healthcare services as a result of continuing changes in healthcare economics and an aging population. In addition, both commercial and government-sponsored managed care organizations continue to be among the largest groups of payers for healthcare services in the US. In other countries, national health services are often the only significant payer for healthcare services. In an e/ffort to control prescription drug costs, almost all managed care organizations and national health services use formularies that list specific drugs that may be reimbursed and/or the level of reimbursement for each drug. Managed care organizations and national health services also increasingly use cost-benefit analyses to determine whether or not newly approved drugs will be added to a formulary and/or the level of reimbursement for that drug, and to determine whether or not to continue to reimburse existing drugs. We have dedicated teams that actively seek to optimize patient access, including formulary positions, for our products.\n\nThe trend toward consolidation among distributors and retailers of Innovative Medicines Division products continues in the US and internationally, both within country and across countries. This has increased our customers' purchasing leverage and resulted in increased pricing pressure on our products. Moreover, we are exposed to increased concentration of credit risk as a result of the consolidation among our customers.\n\nDrug pricing is an increasingly prominent issue in many countries as healthcare spending continues to rise.\n\nThis issue has received significant attention in the US (please see '-Price controls' for further information). At Novartis, we are increasing our e/fforts to enable patient access through innovative pricing and access initiatives in the US, Europe and other markets. These include contract  structures  such  as  pay-over-time  and  outcome-based agreements.\n\nIn 2021, Novartis reached an agreement with the National Health Service (NHS) in England to implement a  first-of-its-kind  population  health  management approach designed to provide faster and broader access to Leqvio for certain high-risk patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Novartis is exploring similar collaborations in other countries.\n\nAdditionally,  following  conditional  approval  of Zolgensma in Europe in 2020, Novartis Gene Therapies established 'Day One' early access agreements in multiple European countries. These agreements support early patient access by allowing a variety of customizable options, including retroactive rebates, deferred payments, installment options, outcome-based rebates, and collaborations with healthcare systems to optimize disease management. These e/fforts have expanded globally, and we now have multiple early access agreements and  pay-for-performance  agreements  (i.e.,  outcome-based arrangements) in place in various markets around the world. Zolgensma is approved in over 40 countries.\n\nNovartis has established an outcome-based framework in the US for one of the approved indications of our oncology product Kymriah , whereby the product invoice is linked to a successful outcome for each patient at an agreed milestone. Novartis also o/ffers outcome-based agreements for approved indications of Kymriah and Luxturna in certain countries other than the US. These typically involve a full upfront payment of the product with a partial refund in case of failed outcomes, or installment payments based on successful patient outcomes at agreed milestones.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe global pharmaceutical market is highly competitive. We compete against other major international corporations that have substantial financial and other resources, as well as against smaller companies that operate regionally or nationally. Competition within the industry is intense and extends across a wide range of activities, including pricing, product characteristics, customer service, sales and marketing, and research and development.\n\nLike  other  companies  selling  patented  pharmaceuticals, Novartis faces challenges from companies selling competing patented products. Generic forms of our products may follow the expiry of intellectual property protection, and generic companies may also gain entry to the market through successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. We use legally permissible measures to defend those rights. See also '-Intellectual property' below. We also may face competition from over-the-counter (OTC) products that do not require a prescription from a physician.",

        "page_content": "There is ongoing consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. At the same time, new entrants are looking to use their expertise to establish or expand their presence in healthcare, including technology companies seeking to benefit from the increasing importance of data and data management in our industry.\n\n## Research and development\n\nThe discovery and development of a new drug usually requires approximately 10 to 15/uni00A0years from the initial research to bringing a drug to market. This includes approximately six to eight years from Phase/uni00A0I clinical trials to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a substantial risk that a compound (i.e., drug or biologic) or other therapeutic candidate will not meet the requirements to progress further. In such an event, we may be required to abandon the development of a potential therapy in which we have made a substantial investment.\n\nWe manage our research and development expenditures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our strategic priorities. We make decisions about whether or not to proceed with development projects on a project-by-project basis. These decisions are based on the project's potential to meet a significant unmet medical need or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the science underlying the project, and the potential of the project (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical development) to generate significant positive financial results for the Company. Once a management decision has been made to proceed with the development of a particular molecule, the level of research and development investment required will be driven by many factors. These include the medical indications for which it is being developed, the number of indications being pursued, whether the molecule is of a chemical or biological nature, the stage of development, and the level of evidence necessary to demonstrate clinical e/fficacy and safety.\n\n## Research program\n\nOur research program is conducted by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), which is the research and early development innovation engine of Novartis. NIBR is responsible for the discovery of new medicines for diseases with unmet medical need. We focus our work in areas where we believe we can have the most impact for patients. This requires the hiring and retention of highly talented employees, a focus on fundamental disease mechanisms that are relevant across di/fferent disease areas, continuous improvement in technologies for drug discovery and potential therapies, close alliances with clinical colleagues, and the establishment of strategic external alliances.\n\nApproximately 5 200 full-time-equivalent scientists, physicians and business professionals work at NIBR sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts; East  Hanover,  New  Jersey;  San  Diego,  California; Emeryville, California; and Shanghai, China. They contribute to research into disease areas such as cardiovascular,  renal  and  metabolic  diseases;  neuroscience; oncology; muscle disorders; ophthalmology; autoimmune diseases; and respiratory and allergic diseases.\n\nResearch at the Friedrich Miescher Institute and the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and the Novartis  Institute  for  Tropical  Diseases  (NITD),  in Emeryville,  California,  focuses  on  discovering  new medicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria and cryptosporidiosis.\n\nAll drug candidates go through proof-of-concept trials to enable an early assessment of the safety and e/fficacy of the drug while collecting basic information on pharmacokinetics and tolerability, and adhering to the guidance for early clinical testing set forth by health authorities. Following proof of concept, our Global Drug Development unit conducts confirmatory trials on the drug candidates.\n\nIn 2020, we discontinued early discovery research at NIBR's Shanghai site and focused our research and development activities there on expanding the scale and scope of our early clinical development and later-stage clinical trial operations to help accelerate the development of new medicines.\n\nIn response to the current pandemic, we are pursuing potential therapeutic strategies to help combat COVID-19. Chief among these are our e/fforts to discover a novel therapy targeting the main protease - an enzyme essential  to  the  replication  of  many  coronaviruses, including SARS/hyphen.capCoV-2 - and our collaboration with Molecular Partners to develop ensovibep, a potential new treatment option for COVID-19 that targets the virus using  proprietary  DARPin  technology  to  neutralize SARS/hyphen.capCoV-2. The topline results of a Phase II study reported in early 2022 showed that a single intravenous dose of ensovibep reduced viral load through Day Eight, shortened symptom duration, reduced emergency room visits and/or hospitalizations related to COVID-19, and reduced deaths, compared to placebo. In separate studies, it maintained potent in-vitro pan-variant activity against all variants of concern identified so far, including Omicron.\n\n## Development program\n\nOur Global Drug Development (GDD) organization oversees drug development activities for our Innovative Medicines Division. GDD works collaboratively with NIBR to execute our overall pipeline strategy. The GDD organization includes centralized global functions such as Regulatory A/ffairs and Global Development Operations, and global Development Units aligned with our business franchises. GDD was created to improve resource allocation, technology implementation and process standardization to further increase innovation. GDD includes approximately 12 400 full-time equivalent employees worldwide.\n\nThe traditional model of clinical development consists of three phases:\n\nPhase/uni00A0I: The first clinical trials of a new compound generally performed in a small number of healthy human volunteers - to assess the drug's safety profile, including the safe dosage range. These trials also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and excreted, and the duration of its action.\n\nPhase/uni00A0II: Clinical studies performed with patients who have the target disease, with the aim of continuing the",

        "page_content": "Phase/uni00A0I safety assessment in a larger group, assessing the e/fficacy of the drug in the patient population, and determining the appropriate doses for further evaluation. Phase/uni00A0III: Large-scale clinical studies with several hundred to several thousand patients, which are conducted to establish the safety and e/fficacy of the drug in specific indications for regulatory approval. Phase/uni00A0III trials may also be used to compare a new drug against a current standard of care to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the new medicine.\n\nIn each of these phases, physicians monitor volunteer patients closely to assess the safety and e/fficacy of a potential new drug or indication.\n\nThough we use this traditional model, we have tailored the development process to be simpler, more flexible and e/fficient. We divide the development process into two stages: Exploratory Development to establish proof of concept, followed by Confirmatory Development to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients. Exploratory Development consists of clinical proof-ofconcept (PoC) studies, which are small clinical trials (typically involving between five and 15 patients) that combine elements of traditional Phase/uni00A0 I/II testing. NIBR conducts these customized trials, which are designed to give early insights into issues such as safety, e/fficacy and toxicity for a drug in a given indication. Once a positive proof of concept has been established, the drug moves to the Confirmatory Development stage and becomes the responsibility of GDD. Confirmatory Development has elements of traditional Phase/uni00A0II/III testing and includes trials aimed at confirming the safety and e/fficacy of the drug in the given indication, leading up to submission of a dossier to health authorities for approval. This stage can also include trials that compare the drug to the current standard of care for the disease in order to evaluate the drug's overall benefit-risk profile. Further, with new treatment approaches such as gene therapy for rare diseases, elements of Exploratory and Confirmatory Development may be combined and su/ffice for registration under certain conditions such as high unmet medical need and clinical data showing highly favorable benefit-risk. In these cases, additional post-approval studies may be required by the regulatory authorities to continue to gather important data to further support approval.\n\nThe vast amount of data that must be collected and evaluated makes clinical testing the most time-consuming and expensive part of new drug development. The next stage in the drug development process is to seek registration for the new drug. For more information, see '-Regulation.'\n\nOur Innovation Management Board (IMB) manages our activities at each phase of clinical development. The IMB is responsible for all major aspects of our development portfolio and oversees our drug development budget as well as major project phase transitions and milestones following a positive proof-of-concept outcome, including transitions to Confirmatory Development and the decision to submit a regulatory application to the health authorities. The IMB is also responsible for the endorsement  of  overall  development  strategy,  the endorsement of development project priorities, and decisions on project discontinuations. Our Chief Executive\n\nO/fficer chairs the IMB, and other representatives from Novartis senior management, with expertise spanning multiple fields, are among its core and extended membership.\n\n## Alliances and acquisitions\n\nOur Innovative Medicines Division enters into business development agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and with academic and other institutions to develop new products and access new markets. We license products that complement our current product line and are appropriate to our business strategy. We focus on strategic alliances and acquisition activities for key disease areas and indications that we expect to be growth drivers in the future. We review products and compounds we are considering licensing, using the same criteria that we use for our own internally discovered drugs.\n\nIn December 2021, Novartis announced the signing of an option, collaboration and license agreement with an a/ffiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. for ociperlimab, a late-stage TIGIT inhibitor that may be active against a wide range of solid tumors. This partnership strengthens the Company's immunotherapy pipeline and expands development opportunities with the PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab. Novartis announced in February 2021 that it closed the in-licensing of tislelizumab from an a/ffiliate of BeiGene, Ltd. for North America, Europe and Japan. Novartis is advancing tislelizumab as a potential bridge to synergistic drug combinations, with the goal of extending survival for more patients across tumors and lines of therapy.\n\nFor information about recent business acquisitions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions.'\n\n## Regulation\n\nThe international pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. Regulatory authorities around the world administer numerous laws and regulations regarding the testing, approval, manufacturing, importing, labeling and marketing of drugs, and review the safety and e/fficacy of pharmaceutical products. Extensive controls exist on the non-clinical and clinical development of pharmaceutical products. These regulatory requirements, and the implementation of them by local health authorities around the globe, are a major factor in determining whether a substance can be developed into a marketable product, and the amount of time and expense associated with that development.\n\nHealth authorities, including those in the US and the EU, have high standards of technical evaluation. The introduction of new pharmaceutical products generally entails a lengthy approval process. Products must be authorized or registered prior to marketing, and such authorization or registration must subsequently be maintained. In recent years, the registration process has required increased testing and documentation for the approval of new drugs, with a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction.\n\nTo register a pharmaceutical product, a registration dossier containing evidence establishing the safety, e/ffi-",

        "page_content": "cacy and quality of the product must be submitted to regulatory authorities. Generally, a therapeutic product must be registered in each country in which it will be sold. In every country, the submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that approval to market the product will be granted. Although the criteria for the registration of therapeutic drugs are similar in most countries, the formal structure of the necessary registration documents and the specific requirements, including risk tolerance, of the local health authorities can vary significantly from country to country. Even if a drug is registered and marketed in one country, the registration authority in another country may request additional information from the pharmaceutical company prior to registration or even reject the product. A drug may be approved for di/fferent indications in di/fferent countries.\n\nThe registration process generally takes between six months and several years, depending on the country, the quality of the data submitted, the e/fficiency of the registration authority's procedures, and the nature of the product. Many countries provide for accelerated processing of registration applications for innovative products of particular therapeutic interest. In recent years, the US and the EU have made e/fforts to harmonize registration requirements in order to achieve shorter development and registration times for medical products. However, the requirement in many countries to negotiate selling prices or reimbursement levels with government regulators and other payers can substantially extend the time until a product may finally be available to patients.\n\nThe following provides a summary of the regulatory processes in the principal markets served by Innovative Medicines Division a/ffiliates:\n\n## United States\n\nIn the US, applications for drug registration are submitted to and reviewed by the FDA. The FDA regulates the testing, manufacturing, labeling and approval for marketing of pharmaceutical products intended for commercialization in the US. The FDA continues to monitor the safety of pharmaceutical products after they have been approved for sale in the US market. The pharmaceutical development and registration process is typically intensive, lengthy and rigorous. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes su/fficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, e/fficacy and quality, then the company may file/uni00A0a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA), as applicable, for the compound. The NDA or BLA must contain all the scientific information that has been gathered about the compound. This typically includes information regarding the clinical experiences of patients tested in the drug's clinical trials. A Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) or Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) must be filed for new indications for a previously approved drug.\n\nOnce an application is submitted, the FDA assigns reviewers from its sta/ff, including experts in biopharmaceutics, chemistry, clinical microbiology, pharmacology/ toxicology, and statistics. After a complete review, these\n\ncontent experts provide written evaluations of the NDA or BLA. These recommendations are consolidated and are used by senior FDA sta/ff in its final evaluation of the NDA or BLA. Based on that final evaluation, the FDA then provides to the NDA or BLA's sponsor an approval, or a 'complete response' letter if the NDA or BLA application is not approved. If not approved, the letter will state the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA that need to be addressed. The sponsor must then submit an adequate response to the deficiencies in order to restart the review procedure.\n\nOnce the FDA has approved an NDA, BLA, sNDA or sBLA, the company can make the new drug available for physicians and other healthcare providers to prescribe. The drug owner must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including any cases of adverse reactions. For some medications, the FDA requires additional post-approval studies (Phase/uni00A0IV) to evaluate long-term e/ffects or to gather information on the use of the product under specified conditions.\n\nThroughout the life cycle of a product, the FDA requires compliance with standards relating to good laboratory, clinical and manufacturing practices. The FDA also requires compliance with rules pertaining to the manner in which we may promote our products.\n\n## European Union\n\nIn the EU, there are three main procedures for application for authorization to market pharmaceutical products in more than one EU member state at the same time: the centralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure and the decentralized procedure. It is also possible to obtain a national authorization for products intended for commercialization in a single EU member state only. The procedure used for first authorization must continue to be followed for subsequent changes, e.g., to add an indication for a licensed product.\n\nUnder the centralized procedure, applications are made to the EMA for an authorization that is valid for the European Union (all member states). The centralized procedure is mandatory for all biotechnology products; new chemical entities in cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, AIDS, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; advanced therapy medicines, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue-engineered  medicines;  and  orphan  medicines (medicines for rare diseases). It is optional for other new chemical entities, innovative medicinal products, and medicines for which authorization would be in the interest of public health. When a pharmaceutical company has gathered data that it believes su/fficiently demonstrates a drug's safety, e/fficacy and quality, the company may submit an application to the EMA. The EMA then receives and validates the application, and the specialized committee for human medicines, the CHMP, appoints a rapporteur and co-rapporteur to review it. They use experts from their countries to carry out the assessment but can also draw expertise from other member states ('multinational teams'). The entire review cycle must be completed within 210/uni00A0days, although there are 'clock stops' to allow the company to respond to questions set forth in the rapporteur and co-rapporteur's assessment",

        "page_content": "report and agreed with the CHMP. The first clock stop is at Day 120 and the clock restarts on Day 121, when the company's complete response is received by the EMA. If there are further aspects of the dossier requiring clarification, the CHMP will issue further questions at Day 180, and may also request an oral explanation, in which case the sponsor must not only respond to the further questions but also appear before the committee to justify its responses. On Day 210, the CHMP will take a vote to recommend the approval or non-approval of the application, and their opinion is transferred to the EC. The final EC decision under this centralized procedure is a single decision that is applicable to all member states. This decision occurs 60/uni00A0days, on average, after a positive CHMP recommendation.\n\nUnder both the mutual recognition procedure (MRP) and the decentralized procedure (DCP), the assessment is led by one member state, called the reference member state (RMS) which then liaises with other member states, known as the concerned member states. In the MRP, the company first obtains a marketing authorization in the RMS, which is then recognized by the concerned member states in 90 days. In the DCP, the application  is  done  simultaneously  in  the  RMS  and  all concerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS drafts an assessment report within 120/uni00A0days. Within an additional 90/uni00A0days, the concerned member states review the application and can issue objections or requests for additional information. On Day 90, each concerned member state must be assured that the product is safe and e/ffective, and that it will cause no risks to the public health. Once an agreement has been reached, each member state grants national marketing authorizations for the product.\n\nAfter receiving the marketing authorizations, the company must submit periodic safety reports to the relevant health authority (EMA for the centralized procedure, national health authorities for DCP or MRP). In addition, pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented and monitored, including the collection, evaluation and expedited reporting of adverse events, and updates to risk management plans. For some medications, post-approval studies (Phase/uni00A0IV) may be imposed to complement available data with additional data to evaluate longterm e/ffects (called a Post-Approval Safety Study, or PASS) or to gather additional e/fficacy data (called a Post-Approval E/fficacy Study, or PAES).\n\nEuropean marketing authorizations have an initial duration of five years. The holder of the marketing authorization must actively apply for its renewal after this first five-year period. As part of the renewal procedure, the competent authority will perform a full benefit-risk review of the product. Should the authority conclude that the benefit-risk balance is no longer positive, the marketing authorization  can  be  suspended  or  revoked.  Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless it is determined that the product must be further monitored for safety reasons. In this case, the authority may require another renewal at 10 years. If the holder does not apply for renewal, the marketing authorization automatically lapses. Any marketing authorization that is not followed within three years of its granting by the actual placing on the market of the corresponding medicinal product ceases to be valid.\n\n## Price controls\n\nIn most of the markets where we operate, the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to both direct and indirect price controls and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms. Due to increasing political pressure and governmental budget constraints, we expect these mechanisms to remain robust - and potentially even to be strengthened - and to have a continued negative influence on the prices we are able to charge for our products.\n\n## Direct governmental e/fforts to control prices\n\nUnited States: President Biden has made comprehensive drug pricing reform a priority in the US. Lacking 60 votes in the US Senate, Democrats pursued legislation through a procedure known as budget reconciliation to mandate a negotiation process for drugs covered in Medicare Part D and, eventually, Medicare Part B; redesign the Medicare Part D benefit with an out-of-pocket cap for seniors; and impose penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation. This legislation did not pass before the end of the 2021 calendar year. However, Democrats said they plan to revisit it in early 2022 and would like to pass drug pricing reform legislation before campaigning for the November mid-term elections begins. Further, by December 31, 2021, 20 US states had passed legislation intended to impact pricing or requiring manufacturer price transparency reporting, with eight of these states also allowing for drug a/ffordability (i.e., price control) review boards. The disclosure requirements vary by state. Many states require multiple types of reporting, including for new drug applications, new drug launches, prior notice of price increases, and quarterly or annual reporting. It is expected in 2022 that state legislatures will continue to focus on drug pricing and that similar bills will be passed in more states.\n\nEurope: In Europe, our operations are subject to significant price and marketing regulations. Many governments are introducing healthcare reforms in a further attempt to curb increasing healthcare costs. In some member states, these include reforms to permit the reimbursed use of o/ff-label medicines, despite the presence of licensed alternatives on the market. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to patients. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general in the EU, particularly with regard to prescription drugs, is intense. Increasingly strict analyses are applied when evaluating the entry of new products, and as a result, access to innovative medicines is limited based on strict cost-benefit assessments. In addition, prices for marketed products are referenced within member states and across international borders, further impacting individual EU member state pricing. Member states also collaborate to enhance pricing transparency and have started conducting joint health technology assessments, joint pricing negotiations and/or joint purchasing. As an additional control for healthcare budgets, some EU countries have passed legislation to impose further mandatory rebates for pharmaceutical products and/or financial claw-backs on the pharmaceutical industry.

        "page_content": "calculation of these rebates and claw-backs may lack transparency in some cases and can be di/fficult to predict.\n\n## Regulations favoring generics and biosimilars\n\nIn response to rising healthcare costs, most governments and private medical care providers have established reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for more expensive brand-name pharmaceuticals. All US states have generic substitution statutes. These statutes permit or require the dispensing pharmacist to substitute a less expensive generic drug instead of an original drug. Other countries, including many European countries, have similar laws. We expect that the pressure for generic substitution will continue to increase. In addition, the US, the EU and other jurisdictions are increasingly crafting laws and regulations encouraging the development of biosimilar versions of biologic drugs, which can also be expected to have an impact on pricing.\n\n## Cross-border sales\n\nPrice controls in one country can have an impact in other countries as a result of cross-border sales. In the EU, products that we have sold to customers in countries with stringent price controls can be legally resold to customers in other EU countries at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise available in the importing country (known as parallel trade). In North America, products that we have sold to customers in Canada - which has relatively stringent price controls are sometimes resold into the US, again at a lower price than the price at which the product is otherwise sold in the US. Such imports from Canada and other countries into the US are currently illegal. However, given the increased focus on pharmaceutical prices in the US, the Biden administration, certain members of the US Congress, and several US states continued to explore regulatory and legislative ways to allow the safe importation of pharmaceutical products into the US from select countries, including Canada. Six US states have enacted drug importation laws, but the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must certify that each state's importation plan is safe and cost-e/ffective before it can be implemented.\n\nWe expect that pressures on pricing will continue worldwide and will likely increase. Because of these pressures, there can be no certainty that in every instance we will be able to charge prices for a product that, in a particular country or in the aggregate, would enable us to earn an adequate return on our investment in that product.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe attach great importance to intellectual property (IP) rights  -  including  patents,  trademarks,  copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and regulatory data protection - as essential to our purpose of reimagining medicine to improve and extend people's lives, and to protect our investment in research and development, manufacturing and marketing. The IP system provides a means to attract the investments needed to conduct and sustainably\n\nfinance innovative R&D, and to manage the risks inherent in our work. For example, we seek IP protection under applicable laws for significant product developments in major markets. Among other things, patents may cover the products themselves, including the product's active ingredient or ingredients and its formulation. Patents may cover processes for manufacturing a product, including processes for manufacturing intermediate substances used in the manufacture of the product. Patents may also cover particular uses of a product, such as its use to treat a particular disease, or its dosage regimen. In addition, patents may cover tests for certain diseases or biomarkers - which can improve patient outcomes when administered with certain drugs - as well as assays, research tools and other techniques used to identify new drugs. The protection a/fforded, which may vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its duration and its scope of coverage.\n\nIn the US and other countries, the law recognizes that product development and review by the FDA and other health authorities can take an extended period, and provides an extension of patent term for a period related to the time taken for the conduct of clinical trials and for the health authority's review. However, the length of this extension and the patents to which it applies cannot be known in advance and can only be determined after the product is approved. In practice, it is not uncommon for patent term extensions (PTEs) or supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) to not fully account for the time it took to develop the product and receive marketing authorization. As a result, for example, it is rarely the case that a product's active ingredient(s) will have a full patent term at the time the product is approved by the FDA and other health authorities.\n\nIn addition to patent protection, various countries provide  regulatory  data  protection  (RDP)  or  regulatory-based marketing exclusivities for a prescribed period of time. RDP is a distinct type of IP right providing exclusivity that precludes a potential competitor from filing a regulatory application that relies on the sponsor's clinical trial data, or that precludes the regulatory authority from approving the application for a set period of time. The RDP period can vary depending upon the type of data included in the sponsor's application. When it is available, market exclusivity, unlike RDP, may preclude a competitor from obtaining marketing approval for a product even if a competitor's application relies on its own data. RDP and market exclusivity periods generally run from the date a product is approved, and so their expiration dates cannot be known with certainty until the product approval date is known and exclusivity has been granted by the relevant authorities.\n\n## United States Patents\n\nIn the US, a patent issued for an application filed today will receive a term of 20/uni00A0years from the earliest application filing date, subject to potential patent term adjustments for delays in patent issuance based upon certain delays in prosecution by the United States Patent and Trademark O/ffice (USPTO). A US pharmaceutical patent that claims a product, method of treatment using a product, or method of manufacturing a product may also be eligible for a PTE. This type of extension may only extend",

Only one patent may be extended for any product based on FDA review.\n\n## RDP and market exclusivity\n\nSeparate from patent exclusivities, the FDA may provide RDP or regulatory-based market exclusivity, which runs in parallel to any patent protection.\n\n- \u00b7  A new small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient receives five/uni00A0years of RDP, during which time a competitor generally may not submit or obtain approval of an application to the FDA based on a sponsor's clinical data.\n- \u00b7  A  new  biologic  active  pharmaceutical  ingredient receives 12/uni00A0years of regulatory-based market exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug.\n- \u00b7  The FDA may also request that a sponsor conduct pediatric studies and, in exchange, it will grant an additional six-month period of pediatric market exclusivity if the FDA accepts the data, the sponsor makes a timely application for approval for pediatric treatment, and the sponsor has a patent-based and/or regulatory-based exclusivity period for the product that can be extended.\n- \u00b7  Orphan drug exclusivity provides seven/uni00A0years of market exclusivity for drugs designated by the FDA as orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat rare diseases. During this period, a potential competitor generally may not market the same or similar drug for the same indication even if the competitor's application does not rely on data from the sponsor.\n\n## European community Patents\n\nPatent applications in Europe may be filed in the European Patent O/ffice (EPO) or in a particular country or countries. The EPO system permits a single application to be granted for the EU plus other non-EU countries such as Switzerland, Turkey and the UK. When the EPO grants a patent, it is then validated in the countries that the patent owner designates. The term of a patent granted by the EPO or a European country o/ffice is 20/uni00A0 years from the earliest application filing date. Pharmaceutical patents can be granted a further period of exclusivity under the SPC system. SPCs are designed, in part, to account for the time it took to receive marketing authorization of a product by the European health authorities. An SPC may be granted to provide, in combination with the patent, up to 15/uni00A0years of exclusivity from the date of the first European marketing authorization. However, an SPC cannot last longer than five/uni00A0years. The SPC duration may be extended by a further six/uni00A0months if the product is the subject of an agreed pediatric investigation plan. The post-grant phase of patents, including the SPC system, is currently administered on a country-by-country basis under national laws that, while differing, are intended to (but do not always) have the same e/ffect.\n\n## RDP and market exclusivity\n\nSeparate from patent exclusivities, the EU provides a system of regulatory data protection for authorized human medicines that runs in parallel to any patent protection. The system for new drugs being approved today is usually referred to as '8+2+1' because it provides an initial period of eight/uni00A0years of data protection, during which a competitor cannot rely on the relevant data; a further period of two/uni00A0years of market exclusivity, during which the data can be used to support applications for marketing authorization but a competitive product cannot be launched; and a possible one-year extension of the market exclusivity period if, during the initial eight-year data exclusivity period, the sponsor registered a new therapeutic indication with 'significant clinical benefit.' This system applies both to national and centralized authorizations in the EU plus other non-EU countries such as the UK.\n\nThe EU also has an orphan drug exclusivity system for medicines. If a medicine is designated as an orphan drug, then it benefits from 10/uni00A0years of market exclusivity after it is authorized, during which time an application for the same or similar medicine for the same indication will not generally be accepted or granted. Under certain circumstances, this exclusivity can be extended with a two-year pediatric extension.\n\n## Third-party patents and challenges to intellectual property\n\nThird parties can challenge our IP, including patents, patent term extensions, RDP and marketing exclusivities (such as pediatric extensions and orphan drug exclusivity), through various proceedings. For example, patents in the US can be challenged in the USPTO through various proceedings, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Post-Grant Review (PGR) proceedings. They may also be challenged through patent infringement litigation under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act or under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In the EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions in the EPO, or national patents may be challenged in national courts or national patent o/ffices. The outcomes of such challenges can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nIn addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in some circumstances a competitor may be able to market a generic version of one of our products by, for example, designing around our patents or marketing the generic product for non-patent-protected indications, or filing a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the Hatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2) application). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur the costs of conducting its own clinical trials and preparing its own regulatory application, and avoid our RDP altogether. There is a risk that some countries may seek to impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the availability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or limit the extent to which such rights may be enforced. Also, even though we may own, co-own or in-license patents  protecting  our  products,  and  conduct  freedom-to-operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless assert that one of our products infringes a third-party patent for which we do not have a license, seeking rem-",

For each, we identify issued, unexpired patents by their general subject matter and, in parentheses, years of expiry in, if relevant, the US and the EU. The identified patents are owned, co-owned or exclusively in-licensed by Novartis and relate to at least one dosage strength of the product or to the method of treatment or its use as it is currently approved and marketed or, in the case of a compound in development, as it is currently submitted to the FDA and/or the EMA for approval. Identification of an EU patent refers to national patents in EU countries and/or to the national patents that have been derived from a patent granted by the EPO. Novartis may own, co-own, control or have rights to additional patents, for example, relating to compound forms, methods of treatment or use, formulations, devices, processes, product-by-process, synthesis, purification and detection.\n\nWe identify unexpired RDP periods and, in parentheses, years of expiry if the relevant marketing authorizations have been authorized or granted. We identify certain unexpired patent term extensions and marketing exclusivities and, in parentheses, years of expiry if they are granted; their subject matter scope may be limited and is not specified. Marketing exclusivities and patent term extensions include orphan drug exclusivity (ODE), pediatric exclusivity (PE), patent term extension (PTE) and supplementary protection certificate (SPC). We designate them as 'pending' if they have been applied for but not granted and include years of expiry if estimable. Such pending applications may or may not ultimately be granted.\n\nIn the case of the EU, identification of a patent, supplementary protection certificate, marketing exclusivity or regulatory data protection means grant, authorization and maintenance in at least one EU country or the UK. However, it could be pending, not granted, expired or found invalid in others.\n\nFor each product below, we indicate whether there is current generic or biosimilar competition for one or more product versions in one or more approved indications in either the US or one or more EU countries, if IP is otherwise disclosed. We identify certain enforcement actions, or ongoing challenges to the disclosed IP, including IPRs or PGRs if instituted by the USPTO, that have not been finally resolved (including appeals) unless noted. Challenges identified as being in administrative entities, such as national patent o/ffices, include judicial appeals from decisions of those entities. Resolution of challenges to the disclosed IP, which in the EU may involve IP in one or more EU countries, may include settlement agreements under which Novartis permits or does not permit future launch of generic versions of our products before expiration of that IP. We identify certain\n\nmaterial terms of such settlement agreements where they could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business. In other cases, such settlement agreements may contain confidentiality obligations restricting what may be disclosed.\n\nFor additional information regarding commercial arrangements with respect to these products, see 'Key marketed products.'\n\n## Novartis Oncology business unit\n\nHematology\n\n- \u00b7 Tasigna.

Our divisional strategy focuses on three areas: developing a broad and consistent pipeline of generic and biosimilar launches across key geographies and across a broad range of therapeutic areas; positioning Sandoz to be 'first in' by having a strong pipeline with a focus on being first to market and 'last out' by way of competitive costs and stable supply; and instilling a true 'generic mindset,' with a focus on priorities, simple and rapid decision-making, and focused resource allocation.\n\nSandoz is a global market leader in biosimilars, with a total of eight approved and marketed products, and a pipeline of over 15 molecules. In addition to internally developed projects, our biosimilar portfolio comprises publicly announced commercialization agreements with BioCon, Gan & Lee, EirGenix, Polpharma Biologics and Bio-Thera Solutions Ltd. Availability of our biosimilars varies by country.\n\nSandoz is also the global market leader in generic antibiotics by volume. Its Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site is the hub of the last vertically integrated antibiotics production chain in Europe, which o/ffers certain com-\n\n## Key marketed products\n\nThe Sandoz global portfolio covers a wide range of therapeutic areas. The following are some of the Sandoz key marketed products in each of its franchises (availability varies by market):\n\n## Retail Generics\n\n| Product                     | Originator drug   | Description             |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid | Augmentin  \u00ae      | Antibiotic              |\n| Zoledronic acid             | Aclasta           | Osteoporosis treatment  |\n| Acetylcysteine              | Various           | Mucolytic agent         |\n| Tacrolimus                  | Various           | Immunosuppressive agent |\n\npetitive advantages including added supply chain resilience.\n\nOn January 31, 2020, we closed the previously announced acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global Incorporated, consisting of o/ff-patent branded medicines with a focus on anesthetics and specialty brands.\n\nOn July 27, 2020, Sandoz and the Austrian government announced a planned combined investment of more than EUR 150 million to enhance the long-term competitiveness and supply resilience of European production for key antibiotics. In May 2021, Sandoz confirmed details of its investment of EUR 100 million in its Kundl, Austria, manufacturing site and announced an additional EUR 50 million investment in a new sterile production line in Palafolls, Spain. In October 2021, Sandoz announced that its planned acquisition of GSK's global cephalosporin antibiotics business, first announced in February 2021, had been successfully closed.\n\nOn October 1, 2021, Sandoz Inc., the US subsidiary of Sandoz, entered into a settlement agreement with the Civil Division of the US Department of Justice (DOJ) concerning the department's yearslong pricing investigation into the US generic drug industry. This settlement was an expected outcome of the resolution the company reached in March 2020 with the DOJ Antitrust Division regarding the same investigation and underlying conduct. As part of the settlement, Sandoz agreed to certain corporate integrity obligations as part of a corporate integrity agreement with the O/ffice of Inspector General of the US Department of Health and Human Services. The latest settlement contains no new factual allegations against Sandoz and, in 2020, the Group fully provisioned for this settlement and disclosed the agreement in principle as part of the March 2020 resolution. For more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities.'\n\nIn October 2021, we announced the commencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division. This review will explore all options, ranging from retaining the business to separation, to determine how to best maximize value for our shareholders.",

Sales of our anti-infective products and over-the-counter cough and cold products are subject to material changes in seasonal demand, while sales of the vast majority of our other products are not. The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted seasonal variation.\n\n## Production\n\nFor information on the production of our products, see '-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative MedicinesProduction.'\n\nIn September 2020, as part of a broader reorganization of Novartis Technical Operations (NTO), we established the Sandoz Technical Operations (STO) platform within NTO. STO focuses on producing generic medicines for Sandoz, as well as related external supply operations and supply chain.\n\nDue to impurities found in the active ingredient batches sourced from third-party manufacturers, we recalled Sandoz valsartan, losartan and irbesartan products in the second half of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, and ranitidine film-coated tablets in the second half of 2019, from several markets, in line with our quality standards for all of our marketed products. The discovery of nitrosamines in some types of drug products led several health regulators (e.g., EMA, FDA and others) to conduct a detailed analysis of these impurities in a/ffected medicinal products. Novartis works with health authorities around the world to continuously review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines. The EMA, FDA and other health authorities have provided guidance to the pharmaceutical industry to prevent unacceptable levels of nitrosamines in medicines. The EMA review concluded in March 2021 for chemical human medicines and in July 2021 for biological human medicines. Any products identified with a potential risk for nitrosamines will undergo further testing. For these products, the final outcome of this testing and potentially necessary control strategies will be submitted to the EMA and other health authorities by September 2022.\n\nBeginning in September 2021, we initiated a voluntary recall of all finished product batches of losartan and losartan HCT products exceeding or potentially exceed-\n\ning acceptable regulatory limits of the azido impurity in the losartan drug substance. This impurity, which is an industrywide issue, is a mutagen that may increase the risk of cancer over time if allowed to rise above certain levels. This recall is unrelated to the nitrosamine-related recalls described above, and we are working to re-establish supply as soon as practicable.\n\n## Marketing and sales\n\nSandoz sells a broad portfolio of products, including the products of our Retail Generics franchise and biosimilars, to wholesalers, pharmacies, hospitals and other healthcare outlets. Sandoz adapts its marketing and sales approach to local decision-making processes, depending on the structure of the market in each country.\n\nIn response to rising healthcare costs, many governments and private medical care providers, such as health maintenance organizations, have instituted reimbursement schemes that favor the substitution of bioequivalent generic versions of originator pharmaceutical products, such as those sold by our Retail Generics franchise. In the US, statutes have been enacted by all states that permit or require pharmacists to substitute a less expensive generic product for the brand-name version of a drug that has been prescribed to a patient. Generic use is growing in Europe, but penetration rates in many EU countries (as a percentage of volume) remain well below those in the US.\n\nRecent trends have been toward continued consolidation among distributors and retailers of Sandoz products, both in the US and internationally, which has increased our customers' purchasing leverage.\n\nLegislative or regulatory changes can have a significant impact on our business in a country.

        "page_content": "mation on such changes, see '-Item 4.B Business overview-Innovative Medicines-Price controls.'\n\nOur Anti-Infectives franchise supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates - mainly antibiotics - for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.\n\nOur Biopharmaceuticals franchise operates in an already mature market framework in Europe and some other markets, while the business environment is rapidly evolving in the US and many international markets. Regulatory pathways for approving biosimilar products are at various stages of maturity by market, but in some cases are still relatively new or still in development. Policies have not yet been fully defined or implemented regarding the substitution and reimbursement of biosimilars in many markets, including the US. As a result, in many of these markets, our biosimilar products are marketed as branded competitors to the originator products.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe market for generic products is characterized by increasing demand for high-quality pharmaceuticals that can be marketed at lower costs due to comparatively minimal initial research and development investments. Increasing pressure on healthcare expenditure and numerous patent and data exclusivity period expirations have encouraged more generic product launches, resulting in increased competition among the companies selling generic pharmaceutical products, leading to ongoing price pressure. In particular, Sandoz faces increased industrywide pressure on prices for generic products, particularly in the US, driven by factors including customer consolidation and growing competition from other manufacturers of generic medicines. These factors contributed to a decline in industrywide US sales that began in 2017 and continued through 2021.\n\n## Development and registration\n\nDevelopment of Sandoz Biopharmaceuticals is jointly overseen by Sandoz and GDD, and is governed by the IMB. Development and registration activities for Retail Generics products, and registration activities for Biopharmaceuticals products, are also overseen by Sandoz.\n\nBefore a generic pharmaceutical may be marketed, intensive technical and clinical development work must be performed to demonstrate, in bioavailability studies, the bioequivalence of the generic product to the reference product. Nevertheless, research and development costs associated with generic pharmaceuticals are generally  much  lower  than  those  of  the  originator pharmaceuticals, as no original drug discovery, preclinical studies or clinical trials on dose finding, safety and e/fficacy are typically performed by the generics company. As a result, the di/fferent focus and lower costs of the  generic  pharmaceutical  model  ultimately  allow generic pharmaceutical products to be o/ffered at lower prices, which support and contribute to the cost containment goals of healthcare systems.\n\nWhile generic pharmaceuticals are follow-on versions of chemically synthesized molecules, biosimilar\n\nproducts contain a version of the active substance of an already approved biological reference medicine. Due to the inherent variability and complexity of biologic products, including batch-to-batch di/fferences and variations following manufacturing changes, the development and the regulatory pathway of biosimilars di/ffer significantly from that of generics.\n\nThe development of a biosimilar product is much more technically challenging than the development of a typical generic small-molecule pharmaceutical. While generic pharmaceuticals normally do not require clinical studies in patients, regulators worldwide do require such targeted studies for biosimilar products. Biosimilars are engineered to match the reference medicine in quality, safety and e/fficacy. This is achieved by systematically defining the target range of the reference medicine and then comparing the biosimilar to the reference medicine at various development stages to confirm biosimilarity and to establish that there are no clinically meaningful di/fferences between the proposed biosimilar and the reference biologic. Because the purpose of a biosimilar clinical development program is to confirm biosimilarity and not to establish e/fficacy and safety de novo, the clinical studies required are less than those required for a reference biologic. Therefore, the cost of development for a biosimilar is usually less than that of a reference biologic.\n\nThe development and registration sta/ff employed by a/ffiliates of the Sandoz Division are based worldwide, including at facilities in Holzkirchen, Germany; Hyderabad, India; Kundl, Austria; Ljubljana, Slovenia; and Rudolstadt, Germany. In November 2020, Sandoz completed (i) the previously announced closure of the Holzkirchen, Germany, development and registration site, with the exception of patch development and the project management group, and (ii) the closure of the product development and registration site as well as the maintenance and development regulatory centers in Unterach, Austria. We are conducting a review of our global development and regulatory network to consolidate and streamline operations and optimize our network structure to enable Sandoz to compete sustainably in an increasingly challenging generics environment. As part of this review, in the fourth quarter of 2020, Sandoz announced the planned closure of its maintenance regulatory center in Barleben, Germany, which was completed in December 2021. Sandoz also announced the planned closure of the Fougera development center located in Melville, New York, as well as the product development center in Boucherville, Canada, which were completed in April 2021 and June 2021, respectively.\n\n## Regulation\n\n## Generics\n\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act in the US (and similar legislation in the EU and in other countries) eliminated the requirement that manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals repeat the extensive clinical trials required for reference products, so long as the generic version could be shown to be therapeutically equivalent to the reference product.",

        "page_content": "In the US, the decision on whether a generic pharmaceutical is therapeutically equivalent to the original product is made by the FDA based on an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) filed by the generic product's manufacturer. An ANDA is generally permitted to be filed four years after the initial approval of the reference product and generally cannot be fully approved by the FDA until any regulatory exclusivity of the reference product has expired. The process typically takes nearly two years from the filing of the ANDA until FDA approval. However, delays can occur if issues arise, for example, regarding the interpretation of bioequivalence study data, labeling requirements for the generic product, or qualifying the supply of active ingredients. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman Act requires a generic manufacturer to certify in certain situations that the generic product does not infringe on any current applicable patents on the product held by the holder of the marketing authorization for the reference product, or to certify that such patents are invalid. This certification often results in a patent infringement lawsuit being brought against the generics company. In the event of such a lawsuit, the Hatch-Waxman Act imposes an automatic 30-month delay in the approval of the ANDA to allow the parties to resolve the intellectual property issues. For generic applicants who are the first to file their ANDA containing a certification claiming non-infringement or patent invalidity, the Hatch-Waxman Act generally provides those applicants  with  180/uni00A0 days  of  marketing  exclusivity, enabling such generic applicants to exclusively market their product alongside the reference product at a certain point in time, which is generally after any intellectual property issues have been resolved. However, after such point in time, the generic applicants must launch their products within certain time frames or risk losing the marketing exclusivity that they had gained by being a first-to-file applicant.\n\nIn the EU, decisions on the granting of a marketing authorization are made either by the European Commission based on a positive recommendation by the EMA under the centralized procedure, or by a single member state under the national or decentralized procedure. See '-Innovative Medicines-Regulation-European Union.' Companies  may  submit  abridged  applications  for approval of a generic medicinal product based upon its 'essential similarity' to a medicinal product authorized and marketed in the EU following the expiration of the product's data exclusivity period. In such cases, the generics company is able to submit its abridged application based on the data submitted by the innovator company for the reference product, without the need to conduct extensive Phase/uni00A0III clinical trials of its own. For all products that received a marketing authorization in the EU after late 2005, the abridged application can be submitted throughout the EU. However, the data submitted by the innovator company in support of its application for a marketing authorization for the reference product is generally protected for 10 years after the first grant of marketing authorization in all member states, and can be extended for an additional year if, during the initial eight-year data exclusivity period, the innovator company registers a new therapeutic indication with 'significant clinical benefit.' In the case of orphan drugs, it may be extended with a two-year pediatric extension. See '-\n\nItem 4.B Business overview-Innovative MedicinesIntellectual property.'\n\n## Biosimilars\n\nThe  regulatory  pathways  for  approval  of  biosimilar medicines are still being developed and established in many countries of the world. A regulatory framework for the approval of biosimilars has been established in the EU, Japan, Canada and the US, while the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance. Sandoz has successfully registered and launched the first biosimilar (or biosimilar-type) medicine in Europe, the US, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and many countries in Latin America and Asia. Sandoz was the first company to secure approval for and launch a biosimilar under the US biosimilar pathway that was established as part of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). The approval of biosimilars in Europe follows a process similar to that followed for small molecules. However, biosimilars usually have to be approved through the centralized procedure because they are manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. As part of the approval process in the EU, biosimilars have to demonstrate comparability to the reference medicine in terms of safety, e/fficacy and quality through an extensive comparability exercise, based on strict guidelines set by the authorities. Regulators will only approve a biosimilar based on data that allows the regulators to conclude that there are no clinically meaningful di/fferences between the reference medicine and the biosimilar.\n\nIn the US, under the BPCIA, a biosimilar must be highly similar with no clinically meaningful di/fferences compared to the reference medicine. Approval of a biosimilar in the US requires the submission of a BLA to the FDA, including an assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics; an e/fficacy study; and possibly a pharmacodynamics study. The BLA for a biosimilar can be submitted as soon as four years after the initial approval of the reference biologic, but can only be approved 12/uni00A0 years after the initial approval of the reference biologic.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nWe take all reasonable steps to ensure that our products do not infringe valid intellectual property rights held by others, including taking steps to proactively challenge intellectual property rights that we believe should not have been granted. Nevertheless, competing companies commonly assert patent and other intellectual property rights. As a result, we can become involved in significant litigation regarding our products. If we are unsuccessful in defending these suits, we could be subject to injunctions preventing us from selling our products and to potentially substantial damages.\n\nWherever possible, our products are protected by our own patents. Among other things, patents may cover the products themselves, including the product's formulation, or the processes for manufacturing a product. However, there can be no assurance that our intellectual property will protect our products or that we will be able",

Financial Statements'). 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects' with the sections on compounds in development and selected development projects of our divisions (see 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview') constitute the Operating and Financial Review ( Lagebericht ), as defined by the Swiss Code of Obligations.\n\nThe discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of certain items from fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and year-to-year comparison between fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, that are not included in this Form 20-F can be found in 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects' of our Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which is incorporated by reference herein.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur purpose is to reimagine medicine to improve and extend people's lives. We use innovative science and technology to address some of society's most challenging healthcare issues. We discover and develop breakthrough treatments and find new ways to deliver them to as many people as possible. We also aim to reward those who invest their money, time and ideas in our Company. Our vision is to become the most valued and trusted medicines company in the world.\n\nThe businesses of Novartis are divided operationally on a worldwide basis into two identified reporting segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Innovative Medicines: innovative patent-protected prescription medicines\n- \u00b7  Sandoz: generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars\n\nIn addition, we separately report the results of Corporate activities. The financial results of our Corporate activities include the costs of the Group headquarters and those of corporate coordination functions in major countries. Corporate also includes other items of income and expense that are not attributable to specific segments, such as certain revenues from intellectual property rights and certain expenses related to post-employment  benefits,  environmental  remediation  liabilities, charitable activities, donations and sponsorships.\n\nOur divisions are supported by the following organizational units: the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Global Drug Development, Novartis Technical Operations and Customer & Technology Solutions (for-\n\nmerly named Novartis Business Services). The financial results of these organizational units are included in the results of the divisions for which their work is performed.\n\nSignificant transactions are discussed in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions,' 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 3. Segmentation of key figures 2021, 2020 and 2019,' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 30. Discontinued operations.'\n\nFollowing  the  February  28,  2019,  shareholders' approval of the spin-o/ff of the Alcon business, the Group reported its consolidated financial statements as 'continuing operations' and 'discontinued operations' to comply with IFRS. Continuing operations include the businesses of the Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions, and the continuing Corporate activities. Discontinued operations include the Alcon eye care devices business and certain Corporate activities attributable to the Alcon business prior to the spin-o/ff, the gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders, and certain other expenses related to the spin-o/ff. See 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies,' 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 30. Discontinued operations.'\n\n## Our business environment\n\nWe operate in a complex, fast-moving environment. Innovation is accelerating, driven by better understanding of the genetic and biological roots of disease, and surging use of data analytics and digital technology in healthcare. At the same time, people around the world are living longer, fueling a rise in chronic diseases. Together, these factors are increasing demand for high-quality care and pressuring healthcare systems to restrain spending growth.\n\n- \u00b7 Healthcare  demand  and  associated  spending  are expected to rise, post-COVID-19 . Global demand for healthcare will continue to grow over the next five years, supported by renewed economic growth and increased investment in healthcare in many countries after the COVID-19 pandemic. We see future growth for our business in many markets around the world, including in the US and - over the longer term - in China. Meanwhile, pressure on pharmaceutical pricing is expected to continue as payers around the world step up initiatives to reduce the overall cost of healthcare.\n- \u00b7 Innovation continues to accelerate . Medical innovation is accelerating, as technologies like gene therapy and artificial intelligence open new paths to scientific discovery. Increased cooperation within the industry, highlighted by the development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, could lead to a new era of open science. At the same time, innovation is getting harder, with new discoveries requiring significant long-term investment.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Use of data and technology is expanding across our industry . The use of data science and digital technologies is increasing rapidly across our industry - in everything from clinical trials and manufacturing to patient diagnostics and treatment. COVID-19 has accelerated this trend. Meanwhile, customers want more e/fficient and personalized ways to connect with pharmaceutical companies. Against this backdrop, data privacy and cybersecurity are growing in importance.\n- \u00b7 Access  to  healthcare  remains  a  global  challenge . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), almost a third of the world's population does not have access to the medicines they need. For the past five years, access rates in the poorest countries have been declining. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted deep health inequities in both developed and developing countries. Access can be improved by integrating access strategies into how we research, develop and deliver our new medicines globally.\n- \u00b7 Aging populations are driving a rise in noncommunicable diseases . As the complexity of the world's healthcare challenges grows, the nature of the global disease burden is also changing. Aging populations are fueling a rise in noncommunicable conditions such as heart disease and cancer, driving an increase in disability and putting additional pressure on healthcare systems.\n- \u00b7 New ways of working are here to stay even after COVID19. COVID-19 changed our work habits. Post-pandemic, many employees continue to want more flexibility in how they work. Within our own workforce, there is more emphasis on digital skills, which are in increasingly short supply across the economy. At the same time, workplace diversity has become more important than ever to attract and retain talented employees, and support innovation.\n- \u00b7 Climate crisis is threatening to undermine global health gains. Climate change is already causing extreme heat and poor air quality in some areas, which threaten to exacerbate pre-existing health conditions such as respiratory diseases. In addition, an increase in temperature and humidity may cause a proliferation of insects that carry vector-borne diseases, including dengue fever and malaria. Ultimately, climate change could undermine decades of progress in improving human health at a time when antimicrobial resistance is also rising.\n- \u00b7 There is an opportunity to build public trust in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has brought an opportunity to reset public trust in our industry, with companies working together to end the pandemic. Trust matters for our industry: Our success depends on patents and trademarks that are granted by society and protect the long-term investments required for our business. Trust also matters for patient engagement, for working with regulators and policymakers, and for attracting talented employees.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur strategy is to build a focused medicines company powered by technology leadership in research and development  (R&D),  world-class  commercialization,\n\nglobal access and data science. In 2021, we continued to execute on this strategy, as reflected by our commencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division and the divestment of our investment in Roche in a bilateral transaction with Roche (see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions'). As we implement our strategy, we have five priorities to shape our future and help us continue to create value for our company, our shareholders and society:\n\n## Deliver transformative innovation\n\nIn our pursuit of transformative treatments, we seek to find new ways to cure disease, intervene earlier in chronic illnesses and improve patients' quality of life. We have one of the strongest clinical development programs in the industry, with more than 275 research programs as well as 98 assets in development spanning around 50 diseases - from heart disease and cancer to rare but debilitating genetic disorders - and 71 new molecular entities, with the potential to transform the standard of care for patients.\n\nWe invest in technology platforms - including cell and gene therapies and radioligand therapies - that o/ffer more targeted approaches to fighting and, in some cases, potentially curing serious diseases. We invested USD 9.5 billion in research and development in 2021, or approximately 18.5% of our net sales. We use data and digital strategies in our research and development operations to open new paths to scientific discovery, improve patient outcomes and streamline the development process. We also focus our R&D capabilities on global health challenges like malaria and sickle cell disease.\n\n## Embrace operational excellence\n\nWe work to improve the productivity of our operations while maintaining high standards of patient safety and environmental sustainability. Our e/fforts cut across the Company, with special emphasis on manufacturing and our supply chain, new product launches and business services. These activities underpin our investment in innovation and support our financial performance, while helping to build trust with stakeholders. In our commercial operations, we are taking steps to deliver more focused and consistent launches across key markets to support our long-term financial performance and provide better outcomes for patients and customers.\n\nWe are transforming our manufacturing operations to support our strategy, while reducing the environmental footprint of our facilities and helping to produce vaccines for COVID-19. In addition, patient health and safety is fundamental to our purpose, and our activities in this regard are focused on three areas: product quality, pharmacovigilance and combating falsified medicines. Our supply chain is key to the resilience of our operations: We identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risk associated with suppliers through our Third-Party Risk Management framework, which promotes ethical behavior and fosters sustainability. With a view toward delivering e/fficient and e/ffective business services, in 2021 we merged all business services and technology operations into a new organization called Customer & Technology Solutions (CTS). CTS will further accelerate productivity improve-",

        "page_content": "ments while investing to support the business to implement our strategy.\n\n## Go big on data and digital\n\nOur aim is to transform Novartis into a medicines company powered by data science and digital technologies. Using data, we believe, can improve e/fficiency, drive sales and innovation, and ultimately increase the value of our pipeline of new medicines. We plan to achieve this by focusing on four areas: (i) accelerating innovation by embracing data analytics and applying artificial intelligence and other technologies to the challenge of discovering new medicines, and forming partnerships with technology companies big and small; (ii) engaging customers by investing in digital tools to provide personalization and better experiences, while also providing digital health solutions for patients; (iii) embedding data and digital in our operations by using technologies like artificial intelligence to drive greater e/fficiency and cost savings across our own operations, and to promote training opportunities to develop digital skills among our employees; and (iv) using data responsibly and securely to ensure the ethical use of new technologies and prioritize e/ffective data privacy and cybersecurity.\n\n## Unleash the power of people\n\nWe continue to transform our corporate culture to support our long-term performance. We want every employee to feel inspired by our purpose, be curious about new ideas, and work in an unbossed environment that encourages initiative and teamwork. We are exploring new ways of working, post-pandemic, to give employees greater flexibility, while maintaining a focus on productivity and innovation, and ensure we continue to attract world-class talent. At the same time, we are making progress in diversity and inclusion to support employee engagement and bring us closer to the diverse perspectives of patients and other stakeholders. We aim to achieve gender balance in management and fulfill our United Nations (UN) pay equity and transparency pledge by 2023.\n\n## Build trust with society\n\nBuilding trust with customers, patients, partners and our employees is critical to delivering on our purpose. It defines our approach to managing our key environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) topics: being a part of the solution on pricing and access, addressing global health challenges, being a responsible citizen, and holding ourselves to high ethical standards. We seek to expand access to our medicines to patients in both developed and developing countries, while addressing major global  health  challenges.  We  reached  56.2  million patients in 2021 through access initiatives, and we have set ambitious targets to reinforce our commitments to access and global health. We focus our global health e/fforts on the control or elimination of four priority diseases: (i) sickle cell disease, (ii) Chagas disease, (iii) malaria and (iv) leprosy.\n\nIn 2020, Novartis committed to increase patient reach with our strategic innovative therapies by at least 200% by 2025 (compared with 2019), and we aim to increase patient reach of our four global health flagship programs by at least 50% over the same period. To reinforce our commitment to these targets, we issued a EUR 1.85 billion sustainability-linked bond (SLB) in 2020. The bond is the first of its kind in the healthcare industry and the first SLB incorporating social targets, with bondholders entitled to receive a higher amount of interest if Novartis fails to meet its access targets. Our stakeholders expect us to follow high ethical standards wherever we operate: We are making progress in embedding our Code of Ethics across the organization and supporting employees to do what is right when faced with ethical dilemmas. We are also committed to being a responsible corporate citizen by reducing the environmental footprint of our Company. We are committed to becoming carbon neutral in our own operations by 2025 and carbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition, we are committed to achieving net zero across our value chain by 2040. We also aim to be water and plastic neutral by 2030.",

        "page_content": "## Group overview\n\nThe COVID-19 situation continues to evolve and is taking di/ffering courses across the multitude of geographies that Novartis operates in. We continue to take strong actions to help address the pandemic consequences. Our primary concerns remain the health and safety of our employees and patients.\n\nDuring the year, the COVID-19 situation normalized in most geographies and therapeutic areas, however we still saw a slight impact on parts of our business, mainly in oncology and generics. Our operations remain stable and cash collections continue to be according to our normal trade terms, with days sales outstanding at normal levels. Novartis remains well positioned to meet its ongoing financial obligations and has su/fficient liquidity to support our normal business activities. At present, drug development operations are continuing with manageable disruptions, with our range of digital technologies allowing us to proactively manage our clinical trials portfolio and rapidly mitigate any disruptions (see the section on compounds in development and selected development projects of our divisions within 'Item 4. Information on the Company-Item 4.B Business overview').\n\nIn 2021, Novartis delivered sales growth, margin expansion, and advanced its pipeline.\n\nNet sales to third parties for Novartis continuing operations were USD 51.6 billion, up 6% in reported terms and up 4% measured in constant currencies (cc) to remove the impact of exchange rate movements. Sales growth was driven by volume growth of 8 percentage points, mainly driven by Entresto , Cosentyx , Zolgensma and Kesimpta for the Novartis Pharmaceuticals business unit, and Promacta/Revolade , Kisqali , Jakavi and Tafinlar + Mekinist for the Novartis Oncology business unit. The strong volume growth was partly o/ffset by the negative impacts of pricing (2 percentage points) and generic competition (2 percentage points).\n\nBy division, Innovative Medicines delivered net sales of USD/uni00A042.0 billion (+8%, +6% cc). Sandoz net sales were USD/uni00A09.6 billion (0%, -2% cc), as growth from Biopharmaceuticals and 1 percentage point relating to contract manufacturing revenue reclassification was more than o/ffset by negative price impact and softer Retail Generics demand.\n\nIn Emerging Growth Markets, which comprise all markets excluding the US, Canada, Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, sales from continuing oper-\n\nations were USD/uni00A013.3 billion (+12%, +11% cc) driven by China (USD/uni00A03.1 billion) growing 19% (+11% cc).\n\nOperating income from continuing operations was USD 11.7 billion (+15%, +13% cc), mainly driven by higher sales and lower legal expenses, partly o/ffset by increased M&S and R&D investments and higher amortization. Operating  income  margin  was  22.6%  of  net  sales, increasing by 1.7 percentage points (+1.8 percentage points cc).\n\nNet income was USD 24.0 billion compared to USD 8.1 billion in the prior year benefiting from the USD 14.6 billion gain from the divestment of our investment in Roche Holding AG, Basel (Roche) 1 . Earnings per share were USD 10.71 compared to USD 3.55 in the prior year.\n\nNet cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 15.1 billion, compared to USD 13.6 billion in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year. This was partly o/ffset by unfavorable hedging results.\n\nFree cash flow increased to USD 13.3 billion (+14% USD). This was mainly driven by higher operating income adjusted for non-cash items and lower payments for legal provisions, partly o/ffset by USD 650 million upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an a/ffiliate of BeiGene, Ltd.\n\nWe also present our core results 2 , which exclude the impact of amortization, impairments, disposals, acquisitions, restructurings and other significant items, to help investors understand our underlying performance.\n\nCore operating income from continuing operations was USD 16.6 billion (+8%, +6% cc) benefiting from higher sales, partly o/ffset by increased M&S and R&D investments. Core operating income margin was 32.1% of net sales, increasing by 0.4 percentage points (+0.5 percentage points cc).\n\nCore net income was USD 14.1 billion (+7%, +5% cc). Core EPS was USD 6.29 (+9%, +7% cc), growing faster than core net income and benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.",

        "page_content": "Markets, partly o/ffset by a decline seen in Europe and Japan.\n\nPromacta/Revolade (USD 2.0 billion, +16%, +15% cc) grew across all regions, driven by increased use in chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and as first-line treatment for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in the US. In the first quarter, the US prescribing information was updated to include 'persistent' ITP, per clinical treatment guidelines.\n\nJakavi (USD 1.6 billion, +19%, +16% cc) growth was driven by strong demand in the myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera indications. Data readouts from two Phase III studies (REACH2 and REACH3) showed Jakavi significantly improved outcomes in patients with steroid-resistant/dependent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) compared to best available therapy. Regulatory filings are under review and approvals are expected in 2022.\n\nGleevec/Glivec (USD  1.0  billion,  -14%,  -15%  cc) declined due to increased generic competition.\n\nKymriah (USD 587 million, +24%, +22% cc) grew strongly in all regions. Coverage continued to expand, with more than 350 qualified treatment centers and 30 countries having coverage for at least one indication. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted regenerative medicine advanced therapy designation and orphan drug status for Kymriah in follicular lymphoma. At the interim analysis, the Phase II ELARA trial in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma met its primary endpoint of complete response rate. Manufacturing for Kymriah was expanded through regulatory approvals in Switzerland, France and Japan.\n\nExjade/Jadenu (USD 563 million, -14%, -16% cc) declined mainly due to pressure from generic competition in all regions.\n\nAdakveo (USD 164 million, +56%, +56% cc) worldwide launch continued to progress well, with continuous double-digit growth in cumulative patients in the US in 2021, despite COVID-19 challenges. In the US, more than 95% of insured lives have a payer coverage policy in place across Medicaid, Medicare, and Commercial segments. In the UK, NICE recommendation was received in October 2021.\n\n## Solid Tumor\n\nSales in the Solid Tumor franchise reached USD 7.1 billion (+3%, +2% cc), of which Tafinlar + Mekinist delivered USD 1.7 billion, Sandostatin USD 1.4 billion, Afinitor / Votubia USD 0.9 billion and Kisqali USD 0.9 billion. The highest growth coming from Kisqali , followed by Tafinlar + Mekinist , and Tabrecta , o/ffsetting decline in Afinitor / Votubia , Votrient and other mature brands.\n\nTafinlar + Mekinist (USD 1.7 billion, +10%, +8% cc), the worldwide targeted therapy leader in BRAF/MEK-inhibition, continued to deliver strong growth driven by demand in both BRAF+ adjuvant / metastatic melanoma and BRAF+ advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tafinlar + Mekinist is the first and only targeted therapy to achieve both five-year overall survival (OS) in metastatic melanoma and five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) in adjuvant melanoma.\n\nSandostatin (USD 1.4 billion, -2%, -3% cc) sales declined due to ongoing competitive pressure in Europe and Japan.\n\nAfinitor / Votubia (USD 938 million, -13%, -14% cc) declined due to generic competition in the US, Europe and Emerging Growth Markets. In the US, generic competition for the 10 mg and disperse formulation entered in October 2021.\n\nKisqali (USD 937 million, +36%, +36% cc) sales grew across all geographies driven by the longest overall survival benefit ever reported in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. New overall survival data presented at The San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium provide further evidence of the Kisqali unique benefit across the most common intrinsic subtypes, including HER2-enriched subtype, suggesting that Kisqali re-sensitizes ET-resistent tumors to hormonal therapy and supporting the scientific rationale for the Phase III HARMONIA trial comparing Kisqali to palbociclib. Kisqali is approved in 96 countries.\n\nVotrient (USD 577 million, -9%, -10% cc) declined due to increased competition in the US, Europe and Japan.\n\nLutathera (USD 475 million, +7%, +6% cc) sales grew in all the regions. There are 450 centers now actively treating patients globally. Sales from all AAA brands (including Lutathera and radiopharmaceutical diagnostic products) were USD 717 million.\n\nPiqray (USD 329 million, +3%, +3% cc) grew in Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, partially o/ffset by a decline in the US. Piqray in combination with fulvestrant received European Commission (EC) approval to treat HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation. Piqray is the first and only therapy specifically for the approximately 40% of HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer patients who have a PIK3CA mutation, which  is  associated  with  poor  prognosis. Piqray is approved in more than 60 countries.\n\nTabrecta (USD 90 million, +157%, +155% cc) US launch continues to progress well. All leading lung cancer institutions have started patients on treatment with more than 1,000 unique prescribers LTD and Tabrecta maintains its strong position as the number one prescribed MET inhibitor for NSCLC in the US. Tabrecta is the first and only therapy approved by the FDA to specifically target metastatic NSCLC with a mutation that leads to MET exon 14 skipping (METex14), as detected by an FDA-approved test using tissue and blood. Tabrecta is approved in nine countries.\n\n## Novartis Pharmaceuticals business unit Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology\n\nSales in the Immunology, Hepatology and Dermatology franchise reached USD 5.8 billion (+19%, +18% cc), of which Cosentyx delivered USD 4.7 billion.\n\nCosentyx (USD 4.7 billion, +18%, +17% cc) saw strong growth driven by sustained underlying demand across indications in the US and Europe and volume growth in China  following  National  Reimbursement  Drug  List (NRDL) listing in the first quarter of 2021. In 2021, Novartis received an EU label update for Cosentyx to include e/fficacy data on axial manifestations in patients with psoriatic arthritis, based upon data from the MAXIMISE trial. Cosentyx received approval in the US and China for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in pediatric patients aged six years and older. Cosentyx also received US",

Two hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) Phase III studies (SUNRISE and SUNSHINE) met their primary  endpoint,  with  more  patients  treated  with Cosentyx achieving an HS Clinical Response (HiSCR), compared with placebo, at week 16.\n\nIlaris (USD 1.1 billion, +21%, +22% cc) strong sales were driven by continued growth across all regions. Contributors to continuing growth include launch of adult-onset Still's disease, the other adult rheumatology indications in the US and Periodic Fever Syndromes (PFS) indications in Europe.\n\n## Neuroscience\n\nSales in the Neuroscience franchise were USD 5.1 billion (+17%, +15% cc), mainly driven by the sales growth of Kesimpta and Zolgensma , partly o/ffset by sales decline of Gilenya .\n\nGilenya (USD 2.8 billion, -7%, -9% cc) sales declined due to increased competition.\n\nZolgensma (USD 1.4 billion, +47%, +46% cc) access continued to expand globally throughout 2021. Zolgensma had a strong fourth quarter with year-over-year growth driven by expanding access in Europe and Emerging Growth  Markets,  combined  with  steady  US  sales. Zolgensma is now approved in 42 countries.\n\nKesimpta (USD 372 million) sales were driven by strong access and increased demand. To initiate access, Kesimpta is being provided free of charge for US patients who are eligible for reimbursement until they are covered by their insurance. The share of free goods is decreasing as reimbursement progresses. In March, Kesimpta received EC approval. Kesimpta is now approved in 64 countries.\n\nMayzent (USD 281 million, +65%, +65% cc) continued to grow, driven by fulfilling an important unmet need in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients showing signs of progression despite being on other treatments. Mayzent is the first and only oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) studied and proven to delay disease progression in a broad secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patient population. Mayzent is now approved in 67 countries.\n\nAimovig (USD 215 million, ex-US, ex-Japan +31%, +27% cc). E/ffective January 1, 2022, Novartis and Amgen reached an agreement to settle all remaining claims in the litigation between the companies. Novartis returns its Aimovig US rights to Amgen, which is now exclusively commercializing Aimovig in the US. Novartis' ex-US rights remain una/ffected and Novartis will continue to commercialize Aimovig in the rest of the world, with the exception of Japan. Amgen will no longer pay royalties to Novartis on sales of Aimovig in the United States, and the parties' cost sharing for commercialization of Aimovig in the United States ceases. The parties will continue to share development expenses worldwide in accordance with the relevant agreements. Other terms of the settlement are confidential. Aimovig has been prescribed to over 620,000 patients worldwide in the post-trial setting. See also 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 20. Provisions and other non-current liabilities.'\n\n## Ophthalmology\n\nSales in the Ophthalmology franchise were USD 4.3 billion (-2%, -4% cc).\n\nLucentis (USD 2.2 billion, +12%, +8% cc) sales growth was driven by Europe and Emerging Growth Markets, partly o/ffset by decline in Japan.\n\nXiidra (USD 468 million, +24%, +24% cc) showed double-digit  growth,  driven  by  a  solid  and  sustainable increased brand awareness among diagnosed patients su/ffering from signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and a lower prior year base due to COVID-19.\n\nBeovu (USD 186 million, -2%, -3% cc) sales declined in the US partly o/ffset by growth in other markets versus prior year following continued geographic expansion. Beovu is now approved in 73 countries.\n\nOther Ophthalmology products declined due to generic impacts in the US, primarily for Travatan and Ciprodex .\n\n## Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism\n\nSales in the Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism franchise were USD 3.6 billion (+43%, +40% cc).\n\nEntresto (USD 3.5 billion, +42%, +40% cc) sustained strong growth with increased patient share across markets, driven by demand as the essential first-choice therapy for heart failure patients (with reduced ejection fraction). Sales in the US continue to benefit from FDA approval in February of an expanded indication in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal, making Entresto the first therapy indicated for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and most heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The European Society of Cardiology heart failure guidelines and the American College of Cardiology Expert  Consensus  Decision  Pathway  recommend Entresto as first-line heart failure therapy. In China, Entresto has been listed in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for both HFrEF and hypertension, e/ffective January 2022.\n\nLeqvio (USD 12 million) is the first and only small-interfering RNA therapy to reduce LDL cholesterol, a risk factor  for  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular  disease (ASCVD), which is caused by plaque buildup in the arteries. Leqvio is administered by a healthcare professional twice a year as an injection, following an initial dose and a dose at three months. On December 22, 2021, it was approved in the US to treat adults with clinical ASCVD or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol. In the EU and other countries, it is approved to treat adults with primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidemia. It is used in combination with a statin or a statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL cholesterol goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant or for whom a statin is contraindicated.\n\n## Respiratory and Allergy\n\nSales in the Respiratory and Allergy franchise were USD 2.1 billion (+9%, +6% cc), of which Xolair delivered USD 1.4 billion.",

The indication of nasal polyps has been approved and currently launched in the US, Germany, Canada and several other countries. In April 2021 the FDA approved Xolair for self-injection; this formulation in the US in the second quarter of 2021. Novartis co-promotes Xolair with Genentech in the US and shares a portion of operating income, but does not record any US sales.\n\nUltibro Group (USD 584 million, -6%, -10% cc) sales declined mainly in Europe due to competition. Ultibro Group consists of Ultibro Breezhaler , Seebri Breezhaler and Onbrez Breezhaler .\n\n## Established Medicines\n\nThe Established Medicines franchise had sales of USD 5.7 billion (-9%, -10% cc).\n\n## Sandoz\n\nNet sales were USD 9.6 billion (0%, -2% cc). Volume increased by 7 percentage points from growth in Biopharmaceuticals and 1 percentage point relating to contract manufacturing revenue reclassification, partly o/ffset by the impact of softer Retail demand, with a weak cough and cold season in the first half. Volume growth was more than o/ffset by a negative price e/ffect of 9 percentage points mainly due to increasing competition and the impact of prior year o/ff-contract sales in the US. We continue to see an impact of COVID-19, particularly for the Retail Generics and third-party Anti-Infectives businesses. However, the e/ffects have been more moderate in recent months and the Sandoz business is continuing to normalize.\n\nSales in Europe were USD 5.3 billion (+1%, -2% cc), in the US USD 1.8 billion (-15%), in Asia / Africa / Australasia USD 1.7 billion (+11%, +9% cc) and in Canada and Latin America USD 872 million (+13%, +10% cc). Sales in Europe declined due to the impact of COVID-19 on the Retail Generics business. The sales decline in the US was due to the negative price e/ffect in the Retail Generics business, especially oral solids, which were additionally impacted by partnership terminations, as well as prior year Biopharmaceuticals o/ff-contract sales.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of net sales to third parties by business franchise in the Sandoz Division:\n\n| (USD millions)                                 | Year ended Dec /three.tab/one.tab, /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | Year ended   Dec /three.tab/one.tab, /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   | Change in USD /percent.tab   | Change in constant  currencies /percent.tab   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Retail Generics /one.tab                       | /seven.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab/two.tab                         | /seven.tab/space.tab/two.tab/four.tab/four.tab                            | - /two.tab                   | - /four.tab                                   |\n| Biopharmaceuticals                             | /two.tab/space.tab/one.tab/one.tab/six.tab                             | /one.tab/space.tab/nine.tab/two.tab/eight.tab                             | /one.tab/zero.tab            | /seven.tab                                    |\n| Anti-Infectives   (partner label/API) /one.tab | /four.tab/two.tab/three.tab                                            | /four.tab/seven.tab/four.tab                                              | - /one.tab/one.tab           | - /one.tab/two.tab                            |\n| Total Sandoz                                   | /nine.tab/space.tab/six.tab/three.tab/one.tab                          | /nine.tab/space.tab/six.tab/four.tab/six.tab                              | /zero.tab                    | - /two.tab                                    |\n\nGalvus Group (USD 1.1 billion, -9%, -8% cc) declined across all regions, mainly in Emerging Growth Markets due to generic competition and in Japan due to the exclusive promotion agreement.\n\nExforge Group (USD 901 million, -8%, -11% cc) declined mainly due to generic competition and the impact of Volume-Based procurement in China.\n\nDiovan Group (USD 773 million, -23%, -25% cc) declined mainly due to generic competition and the impact of Volume- Based procurement in China.\n\nZortress/Certican (USD 431 million, -5%, -6% cc) declined mainly due to generic competition in the US.\n\nVoltaren/Cataflam (USD 373 million, +4%, +3% cc) grew in Emerging Growth Markets, partially o/ffset by decline in Europe and Japan.\n\nNeoral/Sandimmun(e) (USD 368 million, -6%, -8% cc) declined across all markets mainly due to generic competition.\n\n## Retail Generics\n\nIn Retail Generics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets active ingredients and finished dosage forms of small molecule pharmaceuticals to third parties across a broad range of therapeutic are, as well as finished dosage form of anti-infectives sold to third parties.\n\nRetail sales were USD 7.1 billion (-2%, -4% cc), declining due to the above-mentioned factors.\n\n## Biopharmaceuticals\n\nIn Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein- and other biotechnology-based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnology manufacturing services to other companies. The Biopharmaceuticals business also includes Glatopa , a generic version of Copaxone \u00ae , which treats relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis and is marketed in the US.\n\nGlobal sales of Biopharmaceuticals (biosimilars, biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing and Glatopa ) grew to USD 2.1 billion (+10%, +7% cc), driven by continued growth outside the US and Ziextenzo (pegfilgrastim) US.\n\n## Anti-Infectives\n\nIn Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third-party customers.\n\nTotal Anti-Infectives franchise sales were USD 1.1 billion (-3%, -5% cc) impacted by softer retail demand.

This increase was mainly due to the gain of USD 14.6 billion recognized on the divestment of our investment in Roche. As a result of the decision to divest our investment in Roche, the Group discontinued the recognition of its share of income of Roche from November 3, 2021.\n\nExcluding the divestment gain from our investment in Roche, income from associated companies increased to USD 783 million, compared to USD 673 million in prior year, mainly due to the increase in the share of income from Roche. The estimated income for Roche through November 3, 2021, net of amortization, was USD 745 million compared to USD 741 million in prior full year period. A positive prior year true up of USD 40 million has been recognized in the first quarter of 2021, compared to a negative true up of USD 64 million in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n## Interest expense and other financial income and expense\n\nInterest expense decreased to USD 811 million from USD 869 million in prior year, mainly due to lower interest expense on financial debts.\n\nOther financial income and expense amounted to a net expense of USD 80 million in line with a net expense of USD 78 million in the prior year.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nThe tax rate was 8.1% compared to 18.3% in the prior year. In the current year, the tax rate decreased due to the impact of the divestment gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Roche, partially o/ffset by uncertain tax positions and prior year items. The prior year tax rate was impacted by the e/ffect of non-deductible legal charges and uncertain tax positions.\n\nExcluding these impacts, the rate would have been 15.7% compared to 15.6% in the prior year. The increase from prior year was mainly the result of a change in profit mix.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income was USD 24.0 billion, benefiting from the USD 14.6 billion gain from the divestment of our investment in Roche.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per share were USD 10.71 compared to USD 3.55 in the prior year.",

The increase from prior year was mainly the result of a change in profit mix.\n\n## Core net income\n\nCore net income was USD 14.1 billion (+7%, +5% cc).\n\n## Core earnings per share\n\nCore EPS was USD 6.29 (+9%, +7% cc), growing faster than core net income and benefiting from lower weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\n- 1 For an explanation of non-IFRS measures and reconciliation tables, see '-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis.'",

As part of our\n\nlong-term  strategy  to  focus  Novartis  as  a  leading medicines company, we announced and/or completed several acquisitions and divestments during 2021 and 2020.\n\nA detailed description of significant transactions in 2021 and 2020, can be found in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 2. Significant transactions.'\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe Group's management has assessed the e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Group's independent statutory auditor also issued an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Both the Group's management and\n\nits external auditors concluded that the Group maintained, in all material respects, e/ffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. For more details, see 'Item 15. Controls and Procedures.'\n\n## Approach to risk management\n\nSee 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item  6.C  Board  practices-Corporate  governance-Information and control systems-Risk manage-\n\nment' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis\n\nNovartis uses certain non-IFRS metrics when measuring  performance,  especially  when  measuring  current-year results against prior periods, including core results, constant currencies, free cash flow and net debt.\n\nDespite the use of these measures by management in setting goals and measuring the Group's performance, these are non-IFRS measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. As a result, such measures have limits in their usefulness to investors.\n\nBecause of their non-standardized definitions, the non-IFRS measures (unlike IFRS measures) may not be\n\ncomparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. These non-IFRS measures are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how the Group's management assesses underlying performance. These non-IFRS measures are not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for IFRS measures, and should be viewed in conjunction with IFRS financials.\n\nAs an internal measure of Group performance, these non-IFRS measures have limitations, and the Group's performance  management  process  is  not  solely restricted to these metrics.",

        "page_content": "## Core results\n\nThe Group's core results - including core operating income, core net income and core earnings per share exclude fully the amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets, excluding software, net gains and losses on fund investments and equity securities valued at fair value through profit and loss, and certain acquisition- and divestment-related items. The following items that exceed a threshold of USD/uni00A0 25 million are also excluded: integration- and divestment-related income and expenses; divestment gains and losses; restructuring charges/releases and related items; legal-related items; impairments of property, plant and equipment, and financial assets, and income and expense items that management deems exceptional and that are or are expected to accumulate within the year to be over a USD/uni00A025 million threshold.\n\nNovartis believes that investor understanding of the Group's performance is enhanced by disclosing core measures of performance since, core measures exclude items that can vary significantly from year to year, they enable better comparison of business performance across years. For this same reason, Novartis uses these core measures in addition to IFRS and other measures as important factors in assessing the Group's performance.\n\nThe following are examples of how these core measures are utilized:\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to monthly reports containing financial information prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), senior management receives a monthly analysis incorporating these core measures.\n- \u00b7 Annual budgets are prepared for both IFRS and core measures.\n\nAs an internal measure of Group performance, the core results measures have limitations, and the Group's performance management process is not solely restricted to these metrics. A limitation of the core results measures is that they provide a view of the Group's operations without including all events during a period, such as the e/ffects of an acquisition, divestment, or amortization/impairments of purchased intangible assets, impairments to property, plant and equipment and restructurings and related items.\n\n## Constant currencies\n\nChanges in the relative values of non-US currencies to the US dollar can a/ffect the Group's financial results and financial position. To provide additional information that may be useful to investors, including changes in sales volume, we present information about our net sales and various values relating to operating and net income that are adjusted for such foreign currency e/ffects.\n\nConstant currency calculations have the goal of eliminating two exchange rate e/ffects so that an estimate can be made of underlying changes in the consolidated income statement excluding the impact of fluctuations in exchanges rates:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact of translating the income statements of consolidated entities from their non-USD functional currencies to USD\n- \u00b7 The impact of exchange rate movements on the major transactions of consolidated entities performed in currencies other than their functional currency.\n\nWe calculate constant currency measures by translating the current year's foreign currency values for sales and other income statement items into USD, using the average exchange rates from the prior year and comparing them to the prior year values in USD.\n\nWe use these constant currency measures in evaluating the Group's performance, since they may assist us in evaluating our ongoing performance from year to year. However, in performing our evaluation, we also consider equivalent measures of performance that are not a/ffected by changes in the relative value of currencies.\n\n## Growth rate calculation\n\nFor ease of understanding, Novartis uses a sign convention for its growth rates such that a reduction in operating expenses or losses compared to the prior year is shown as a positive growth.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nNovartis defines free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from investing activities associated with purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets, of financial assets and of other non-current assets. Excluded from free cash flow are cash flows from investing activities associated with acquisitions and divestments of businesses and of interests in associated companies, purchases and sales of marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and net cash flows from financing activities.\n\nFree cash flow is a non-IFRS measure and is not intended to be a substitute measure for net cash flows from operating activities as determined under IFRS. Free cash flow is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of the Group's ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or use of existing cash. Free cash flow is a measure of the net cash generated that is available for investment in strategic opportunities, returning to shareholders and for debt repayment. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure, which means it should not be interpreted as a measure determined under IFRS.",

Net debt is presented as additional information because management believes it is a useful supplemental indicator of the Group's ability to pay dividends, to meet financial commitments, and to invest in new strategic opportunities, including strengthening its balance sheet.\n\n## Additional information\n\n## EBITDA\n\nNovartis defines earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as operating income, excluding depreciation of property, plant and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets, amortization of intangible assets, and impairments of plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and of intangible assets.\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                     | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                       | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operating income from continuing operations  /one.tab/one.tab/space.tab/six.tab/eight.tab/nine.tab |                                                         | /one.tab/zero.tab/space.tab/one.tab/five.tab/two.tab |\n| Depreciation of property,   plant and equipment                                                    | /one.tab/space.tab/two.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab           | /one.tab/space.tab/three.tab/one.tab/eight.tab       |\n| Depreciation of the    right-of-use-assets                                                         | /three.tab/one.tab/eight.tab                            | /three.tab/three.tab/zero.tab                        |\n| Amortization of intangible   assets                                                                | /three.tab/space.tab/nine.tab/zero.tab/three.tab        | /three.tab/space.tab/four.tab/six.tab/two.tab        |\n| Impairments of property,   plant and equipment, and   intangible assets  /one.tab                  | /six.tab/eight.tab/four.tab                             | /one.tab/space.tab/three.tab/five.tab/four.tab       |\n| EBITDA total Group                                                                                 | /one.tab/seven.tab/space.tab/eight.tab/zero.tab/two.tab | /one.tab/six.tab/space.tab/six.tab/one.tab/six.tab   |\n\n- 1 There were no impairments of right-of-use assets in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Enterprise value\n\nEnterprise value represents the total amount that shareholders and debt holders have invested in Novartis, less the Group's liquidity.\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                               | Dec /three.tab/one.tab, /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab      | Dec /three.tab/one.tab, /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Market capitalization                                                                        | /one.tab/nine.tab/six.tab/space.tab/one.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab | /two.tab/one.tab/four.tab/space.tab/two.tab/six.tab/nine.tab       |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                    | /one.tab/six.tab/seven.tab                                     | /six.tab/eight.tab                                                 |\n| Non-current financial debts                                                                  | /two.tab/two.tab/space.tab/nine.tab/zero.tab/two.tab           | /two.tab/six.tab/space.tab/two.tab/five.tab/nine.tab               |\n| Current financial debts and   derivatives financial instruments                              | /six.tab/space.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/five.tab                   | /nine.tab/space.tab/seven.tab/eight.tab/five.tab                   |\n| Marketable securities,   commodities, time deposits   and derivative financial   instruments | - /one.tab/five.tab/space.tab/nine.tab/two.tab/two.tab         | - /one.tab/space.tab/nine.tab/zero.tab/five.tab                    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                                    | - /one.tab/two.tab/space.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab       | - /nine.tab/space.tab/six.tab/five.tab/eight.tab                   |\n| Enterprise value                                                                             | /one.tab/nine.tab/seven.tab/space.tab/one.tab/four.tab/two.tab | /two.tab/three.tab/eight.tab/space.tab/eight.tab/one.tab/eight.tab |",

This increase was mainly driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items and other adjustments, including divestment gains, and lower payments out of provisions, mainly due to legal matters in the prior year. This was partly o/ffset by unfavorable hedging results.\n\nNet cash inflows from investing activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 4.2 billion, compared to net cash outflows of USD 13.1 billion in 2020.\n\nThe current year cash inflows were driven by proceeds of USD 20.7 billion from the divestment of our investment in Roche; USD 2.3 billion from the sale of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits; and USD 1.4 billion from the sale of intangible assets, financial assets and property, plant and equipment. These cash inflows were partly o/ffset by USD 16.4 billion cash outflows for purchases of marketable securities and time deposits, mainly due to the investment of a portion of the proceeds from the divestment of our investment in Roche; USD 1.6 billion for purchases of intangible assets (including the upfront payment to in-license tislelizumab from an a/ffiliate of BeiGene, Ltd); USD 1.4 billion for purchases of property, plant and equipment; USD 0.6 billion for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, net (including the acquisition of GSK's cephalosporin antibiotics business for USD 351 million); and USD 0.2 billion for purchases of financial assets.\n\nIn 2020, net cash outflows used in investing activities from continuing operations of USD 13.1 billion were mainly driven by USD 10.0 billion for acquisitions and divestments of businesses, net (including the acquisition of The Medicines Company for USD 9.5 billion, net of cash acquired USD 0.1 billion, and the acquisition of the Japanese business of Aspen Global Incorporated for\n\nUSD 0.3 billion); USD 1.4 billion for net purchases of marketable securities, commodities and time deposits; USD 1.3 billion for purchases of property, plant and equipment; and USD 1.3 billion for purchases of intangible assets. These cash outflows were partly o/ffset by cash inflows of USD 0.7 billion from the sale of financial assets (including USD 0.3 billion proceeds from the sale of Alcon Inc. shares) and USD 0.4 billion from the sale of intangible assets.\n\nNet cash outflows used in financing activities from continuing operations amounted to USD 16.3 billion, compared to USD 2.2 billion in 2020.\n\nThe current year cash outflows were driven by USD 7.4 billion for the dividend payment; USD 3.0 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 3.5 billion net decrease in current financial debts; and USD 2.2 billion for the repayment of two bonds denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion and of EUR 0.6 billion) at maturity. Payments of lease liabilities and other financing cash flows resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 0.2 billion.\n\nIn 2020, net cash outflows used in financing activities from continuing operations of USD 2.2 billion were driven by USD 7.0 billion for the dividend payment; USD 2.1 billion for net treasury share transactions; USD 2.0 billion for the repayment of two US dollar bonds at maturity; USD 0.3 billion net payments for lease liabilities; and USD 0.2 billion for other financing cash outflows, net. These cash outflows were partly o/ffset by cash inflows of USD 7.1 billion from the increase in non-current financial debts, mainly consisting of USD 4.9 billion from the issuance of bonds denominated in US dollars (notional amount of USD 5.0 billion) and USD 2.1 billion from the issuance of a sustainability-linked bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.85 billion); and USD 2.3 billion from the net increase in current financial debts.",

December 31, 2020.\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill decreased by USD 2.6 billion as net additions (including the in-licensing of tislelizumab from an a/ffiliate of BeiGene, Ltd) and acquisitions were more than o/ffset by amortization, unfavorable currency translation adjustments and impairments.\n\nGoodwill decreased by USD 0.4 billion, mainly due to unfavorable currency translation adjustments, only partially o/ffset by additions.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment decreased by USD 0.7 billion, as net additions were more than o/ffset by depreciation, unfavorable currency translation adjustments and net impairments.\n\nInvestments in associated companies decreased by USD 9.4 billion mainly due to the divestment of our investment in Roche.\n\nThese decreases were partly o/ffset by an increase in financial and other non-current assets of USD 1.5 billion, driven by an increase in the prepaid post-employment benefit plans of USD 1.2 billion, resulting from actuarial gains primarily from valuation impact on plan assets and changes in the discount rates used to calculate the actuarial defined benefit obligations.\n\nRight-of-use assets and deferred tax assets were broadly in line with December 31, 2020.\n\nTotal current assets of USD 45.7 billion at December 31, 2021, increased by USD 16.0 billion compared to December 31, 2020.\n\nCash and cash equivalents increased by USD 2.7 billion and marketable securities, commodities, time deposits and derivative financial instruments increased by USD 14.0 billion, mainly driven by the cash generated through operating activities and the proceeds of USD 20.7 billion from the divestment of our investment in Roche, partially o/ffset by the dividend payment, the purchase of treasury shares and the repayment of a financial debt.",

        "page_content": "Inventories,  trade  receivables  and  other  current assets and income tax receivables were broadly in line with December 31, 2020.\n\nWe consider our provisions for doubtful trade receivables to be adequate. We continue to monitor the level of trade receivables, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Turkey. Should there be a substantial deterioration in our economic exposure with respect to those countries, we may change the terms of trade on which we operate. The gross trade receivables from these countries at December 31, 2021, amounted to USD/uni00A01.3 billion (2020: USD/uni00A01.5 billion), of which USD/uni00A027 million is past due for more than one year (2020: USD/uni00A0 55 million), and for which provisions of USD/uni00A024 million have been recorded (2020: USD/uni00A027 million). At December 31, 2021, amounts past due for more than one year were not significant in any of these countries on a standalone basis. The majority of the outstanding trade receivables from Portugal, Spain and Greece are due directly from local governments or government-funded entities.\n\nFor a table showing an overview of the aging analysis of total trade receivables and the total amount of the provision for doubtful trade receivables as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, see 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 15. Trade receivables.'\n\nThere is also a risk that certain countries could devalue  their  currency.  Currency  exposures  are described in more detail in '-E/ffects of currency fluctuations.'\n\n## Liabilities\n\nTotal non-current liabilities of USD 33.8 billion decreased by USD 4.3 billion compared to December 31, 2020.\n\nNon-current financial debts decreased by USD 3.4 billion mainly due to the reclassification of USD 2.6 billion from non-current to current financial debts, primarily two USD denominated bonds with notional amounts of USD 1.0 billion and USD 1.5 billion maturing in 2022, and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.8 billion.\n\nProvisions and other non-current liabilities decreased by USD 0.8 billion, primarily due to a USD 0.9 billion decrease in accrued liabilities for defined benefit pension plans mainly due to actuarial gains primarily from valuation impact on plan assets and the changes in discount rates used to calculate the actuarial defined benefit obligations.\n\nNon-current lease liabilities and deferred tax liabilities were broadly in line with December 31, 2020.\n\nTotal current liabilities of USD 30.2 billion decreased by USD 2.9 billion compared to December 31, 2020.\n\nProvisions and other current liabilities and current income tax liabilities increased by USD 0.5 billion mainly due to an increase in the treasury share repurchase obligation of USD 1.0 billion, which was partially o/ffset by a decrease of USD 0.4 billion in other current provisions.\n\nCurrent financial debts and derivative financial instruments decreased by USD 3.5 billion mainly due to the repayment of a USD 1.5 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion) and USD 0.7 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 0.6 billion) at maturity, repayments of current financial debts of USD 3.5 billion and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.3 billion, partly o/ffset by the reclassification from non-current to current financial debts of USD 2.6 billion.\n\nCurrent lease liabilities and trade payables were broadly in line with December 31, 2020.\n\nIn our key countries, Switzerland and the United States, assessments have been agreed by the tax authorities up to 2016 in Switzerland and up to 2014 in the United States, with the exception of one open United States position related to the 2007 tax filing. In addition, a subsidiary in France, acquired with the AAA acquisition, has an open position related to the tax years 2014 and 2015. Uncertainties also exist on the application of a taxing right based on a German non-resident tax regulation for specific revenues derived from German registered intellectual property rights.\n\nNovartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent di/fficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.\n\n## Equity\n\nThe Group's equity increased by USD 11.2 billion to USD 67.8 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020.\n\nThis increase was mainly due to the net income of USD 24.0 billion, net actuarial gains of USD 1.8 billion, equity-based compensation of USD 0.7 billion and the net favorable fair value adjustments on financial instruments of USD 0.2 billion.\n\nThis was partially o/ffset by the cash-dividend payment of USD 7.4 billion, purchases of treasury shares of USD 2.9 billion, the increase of the treasury share repurchase obligation of USD 1.0 billion and unfavorable currency translation di/fferences of USD 4.8 billion.",

Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies').\n\nIn 2021, Novartis repurchased a total of 30.7 million shares for USD 2.8 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line, including 19.6 million shares (USD 1.8 billion) under the up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback announced in November 2020, 8.6 million shares (USD 0.8 billion) to mitigate dilution related to participation plans of employees and 2.5 million shares (USD 0.2 billion) under the up-to USD 15 billion share buyback announced in December 2021. In addition, 1.5 million shares (USD 0.1 billion) were repurchased from employees. In the same period, 10.3 million shares (for an equity value of USD 0.8 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of employees. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 21.9 million versus  December  31,  2020.  These  treasury  share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 2.1 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 3.0 billion.\n\nIn 2020, Novartis repurchased a total of 32.6 million shares for USD 2.9 billion on the SIX Swiss Exchange second trading line, including 8.0 million shares (USD 0.7 billion) bought back under the up-to USD 2.5 billion share buyback announced in November 2020, and 24.6 million shares (USD 2.2 billion) to mitigate dilution related to par-\n\nticipation plans of employees. In addition, 1.7 million shares (USD 0.2 billion) were repurchased from employees. In the same period, 26.1 million shares (for an equity value of USD 1.5 billion) were delivered as a result of options exercised and share deliveries related to participation plans of employees. Consequently, the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 8.2 million versus  December  31,  2019.  These  treasury  share transactions resulted in a decrease in equity of USD 1.6 billion and a net cash outflow of USD 2.1 billion including the benefit from net option proceeds.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nAt December 31, 2021, our holding of treasury shares amounted to 199.5 million shares, or approximately 8% of the total number of issued shares. Approximately 102.5 million treasury shares were held in entities that restrict their availability for use.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, our holding of treasury shares amounted to 210.2 million shares, or approximately 9% of the total number of issued shares. Approximately 103.0 million treasury shares were held in entities that restrict their availability for use.",

As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant e/ffect on both the Group's results of operations as well as the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This in turn may significantly a/ffect reported earnings (both positively and negatively) and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\n\nFor purposes of our consolidated balance sheets, we translate assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies into US dollars at the prevailing market exchange rates as of the relevant balance sheet date. For purposes of the Group's consolidated income and cash flow statements, revenue, expense and cash flow items in local currencies are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the relevant period. As a result, even if the amounts or values of these items remain unchanged in the respective local currency, changes in exchange rates have an impact on the amounts or values of these items in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause our expenditure in Swiss francs is significantly higher than our revenue in Swiss francs, volatility\n\nin the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nThe Group manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate, after taking into account the natural hedging a/fforded by our global business activity. In 2021 and 2020, we entered into various contracts that change in value with movements in foreign exchange rates, to preserve the value of assets, commitments and expected transactions. We use forward contracts and foreign currency options to hedge. For more information on how these transactions a/ffect our consolidated financial statements and on how foreign exchange rate exposure is managed, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies,' 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 5. Interest expense and other financial income and expense,' 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 15. Trade receivables,' 'Item 18.

Non-current  financial  debts decreased by USD 3.4 billion mainly due to the reclassification of USD 2.6 billion from non-current to current financial debts, primarily two USD denominated bonds with notional amounts of USD 1.0 billion and USD 1.5 billion maturing in 2022, and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.8 billion.\n\nCurrent financial debts and derivative financial instruments decreased by USD 3.5 billion mainly due to the repayment of a USD 1.5 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 1.25 billion) and USD 0.7 billion bond denominated in euro (notional amount of EUR 0.6 billion) at maturity, repayments of current financial debts of USD 3.5 billion and favorable currency translation adjustments of USD 0.3 billion, partly o/ffset by the reclassification from non-current to current financial debts of USD 2.6 billion.\n\nNovartis has two US commercial paper programs under which it can issue up to USD 9.0 billion in the aggregate  of  unsecured  commercial  paper  notes. Novartis also has a Japanese commercial paper program under which it can issue up to JPY 150 billion (approximately USD 1.3 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes.

Total non-current and current financial debts, including derivatives, amounted to USD 29.2 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to USD 36.0 billion at December 31, 2020.\n\nThe debt/equity ratio decreased to 0.43:1 at December 31, 2021, compared to 0.64:1 at December 31, 2020.\n\nThe net debt decreased to USD 0.9 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to USD 24.5 billion at December 31, 2020, mainly driven by the USD 20.7 billion cash proceeds received from the divestment of our investment in Roche.\n\nWe continuously track our liquidity position and asset/liability profile. This involves modeling cash flow maturity profiles based on both historical experiences and contractual expectations to project our liquidity requirements. We seek to preserve prudent liquidity and funding capabilities. We are confident that we have sufficient liquidity to support our normal business activities for the foreseeable future.\n\nCertain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.\n\nWe are not aware of any significant demands to change the level of liquidity needed to support our normal business activities. We make use of various borrowing facilities provided by several financial institutions. We also successfully issued various bonds in previous years, and raised funds through our commercial paper programs.\n\nThe maturity schedule of our net debt can be found in 'Item 18.

Our divisions have numerous products in various stages of development. For further information on these policies and these products in development, see 'Item 4. Information on the CompanyItem 4.B Business overview.'\n\nAs described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, our drug development e/fforts are subject to the risks and uncertainties inher-\n\n## 5.D Trend information\n\nPlease see '-Item 5.A Operating results', '-Item 5.B Liquidity and capital resources' and 'Item 4. Information\n\non the Company-Item 4.B Business overview' for trend information.\n\n## 5.E Critical accounting estimates\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which a/ffect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Our significant accounting policies that are set out in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies' include a description of the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\nGiven the uncertainties inherent in our business activities, we must make certain estimates and assumptions that require di/fficult, subjective and complex judgments. Because of uncertainties inherent in such judgments, actual outcomes and results may di/ffer from our assumptions and estimates, which could materially a/ffect the Group's consolidated financial statements. Application of the following accounting policies requires certain assumptions and estimates that have the potential for the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement believes that the estimation uncertainties described below did not have or are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.\n\n## Deductions from revenues\n\nAs is typical in the pharmaceutical industry, our gross sales are subject to various deductions, which are primarily composed of rebates and discounts to retail customers, government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance companies and managed healthcare organizations. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. These adjustments are deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales.\n\nThe following summarizes the nature of some of these deductions and how the deduction is estimated. After recording these, net sales represent our best estimate of the cash that we expect to ultimately collect. The US market has the most complex arrangements related to revenue deductions.\n\n## United States-specific healthcare plans and program rebates\n\nThe United States Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is administered by state governments, using state and federal funds to provide assistance to certain vulnerable and  needy  individuals  and  families.  Calculating  the rebates to be paid related to this program involves interpreting relevant regulations, which are subject to challenge or change in interpretative guidance by government authorities. Provisions for estimating Medicaid rebates are calculated using a combination of historical experience, product and population growth, product\n\nent in any new drug development program.

This benefit is provided and administered through private prescription drug plans. Provisions for estimating Medicare Part D rebates are calculated based on the terms of individual plan agreements, product sales and population growth, product pricing, and the mix of contracts.\n\nWe o/ffer rebates to key managed healthcare and private plans in an e/ffort to ensure patient access to our products and to sustain and increase the market share of our products. These programs provide a rebate after the plans have demonstrated they have met all terms and conditions set forth in their contract with us.\n\nThese rebates are estimated based on the terms of individual agreements, historical experience, product pricing and projected product growth rates, and are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded.\n\nThese provisions are adjusted based on established processes and experiences from filing data with individual states and plans. There is often a time lag of several months between recording of the revenue deductions and the final accounting for them.\n\n## Non-United States-specific healthcare plans and program rebates\n\nIn certain countries other than the US, we provide rebates to governments and other entities. These rebates are often mandated by laws or government regulations. These rebates are estimated based on government regulations, laws and terms of individual rebate arrangements, historical experience and other relevant factors, and are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenue is recorded. These estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience. There is often a time lag of several months between the recording of revenue deductions and the final accounting for them.\n\n## Innovative pay-for-performance arrangements\n\nWe enter into innovative pay-for-performance arrangements (i.e. outcome based arrangements) with certain healthcare providers and governments. Under these agreements, we may be required to make refunds, defer a portion of the sales price until anticipated treatment outcomes meet predefined targets, or to provide additional medicines free of charge if anticipated treatment outcomes do not meet predefined targets.\n\nThe impact of potential refunds, deferral of a portion of the sales price, or the delivery of additional medicines at no cost is estimated and recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded. Estimates are based on historical experience and clinical data. In cases where historical experience and clinical data are not su/fficient for a reliable estimation of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until such history is available.\n\nThese provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted periodically based on established processes and actual\n\nexperience, including the products actual outcomes achieved compared to the anticipated predefined targets.\n\nThere is often a time lag of several months between recording  of  the  revenue  deductions  and  the  final accounting for them.\n\n## Non-healthcare plans and program rebates, returns and other deductions\n\nWe o/ffer rebates to purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers to sustain and increase market share and to ensure patient access to our products. Since rebates are contractually agreed upon, the related provisions are estimated based on the terms of the individual agreements, historical experience and projected product sales growth rates.\n\nChargebacks occur where our subsidiaries have arrangements with indirect customers to sell products at prices that are lower than the price charged to wholesalers. A chargeback represents the di/fference between the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer's contract price. We account for chargebacks by reducing revenue by the estimate of chargebacks attributable to a sales transaction. Provisions for estimated chargebacks are calculated using a combination of factors, such as historical experience, product growth rates, product pricing, level of inventory in the distribution channel, and the terms of individual agreements.\n\nWhen we sell a product providing a customer the right to return it, we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on our sales return policy and historical return rates. Other factors considered include actual product recalls, expected marketplace changes, the remaining shelf life of the product, and the expected entry of generic products. In 2021, sales returns amounted to approximately 1% of gross product sales. If su/fficient experience is not available, sales are only recorded based on evidence of product consumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nWe enter into distribution service agreements with major wholesalers, which provide a financial disincentive for the wholesalers to purchase product quantities in excess of current customer demand. Where possible, we adjust shipping patterns for our products to maintain wholesalers' inventory levels consistent with underlying patient demand.\n\nWe o/ffer cash discounts to customers to encourage prompt payment. Cash discounts are estimated and accrued at the time of invoicing and are deducted from revenue.\n\nFollowing a decrease in the price of a product, we generally grant customers a 'shelf stock adjustment' for their existing inventory for the relevant product. Provisions for shelf stock adjustments, which are primarily relevant within the Sandoz Division, are determined at the time of the price decline or at the point of sale, if the impact of a price decline on the products sold can be reasonably estimated based on the customer's inventory levels of the relevant product.\n\nOther sales discounts, such as consumer coupons and copay discount cards, are o/ffered in some markets. The estimated amounts of these discounts are recorded at the time of sale or when the coupons are issued, and are estimated utilizing historical experience and the spe-",

Goodwill and other currently not amortized intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually.\n\nAn asset is considered impaired when its balance sheet carrying amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impairment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the limited cases where the value in use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or cash generating units (CGUs), and for this purpose, management considers the range of economic  conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset.\n\nThe estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions spe-\n\ncific to the nature of the Group's activities as indicated in 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies.' Due to these factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting techniques.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the grouping of cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated is based on fair value less costs of disposal. The valuations are derived from applying discounted future cash flows based on key assumptions, including the terminal growth rate and discount rate. For additional information on impairment charges recognized and reversed by divisions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 1. Significant accounting policies-Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets' and 'Item 18. Financial StatementsNote 11. Goodwill and intangible assets.'\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant part of our consolidated balance sheet, primarily due to acquisitions. Although no significant additional impairments are currently anticipated based on our impairment assessment and review of reasonable possible changes in key assumptions to the respective impairment assessment, future impairment evaluation could lead to material impairment charges in the future.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 18.

        "page_content": "## /uni00A0 Contingent consideration\n\nIn an acquisition or divestment of a business, it is necessary to recognize contingent future amounts due to previous owners representing contractually defined potential amounts as a liability or asset. Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty payments related to certain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at their fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment and, if material, are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time.\n\nFor additional information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 29. Financial instruments - additional disclosures.'\n\n## Retirement and other postemployment benefit plans\n\nWe sponsor pension and other post-employment benefit plans in various forms that cover a significant portion of our current and former employees. For post-employment plans with defined benefit obligations, we are required to make significant assumptions and estimates about future events in calculating the expense and the present value of the liability related to these plans. These include assumptions about the interest rates we apply to estimate future defined benefit obligations and net periodic pension expense, as well as rates of future pension increases. In addition, our actuarial consultants provide our management with historical statistical information, such as withdrawal and mortality rates in connection with these estimates.\n\nAssumptions and estimates used by the Group may di/ffer materially from the actual results we experience due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, and longer or shorter life spans of participants, among other factors.\n\nDepending on events, such di/fferences could have a material e/ffect on our total equity.\n\nFor more information on obligations under retirement and other post-employment benefit plans and underlying actuarial assumptions, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 25. Post-employment benefits for employees.'\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe prepare and file our tax returns based on an interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record esti-\n\nmates based on these judgments and interpretations. Our tax returns are subject to examination by the competent taxing authorities, which may result in an assessment being made, requiring payments of additional tax, interest or penalties. Since Novartis uses its intellectual property globally to deliver goods and services, the transfer prices within the Group as well as arrangements between subsidiaries to finance research and development and other activities may be challenged by the national tax authorities in any of the jurisdictions in which Novartis operates. Therefore, inherent uncertainties exist in our estimates of our tax positions, but we believe that our estimated amounts for current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, including any amounts related to any uncertain tax positions, are appropriate based on currently known facts and circumstances.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 6. Income taxes' and 'Item 18. Financial Statements-Note 12. Deferred tax assets and liabilities.'\n\n## Provisions and contingencies\n\nA number of Group companies are involved in various government investigations and legal proceedings (intellectual property, sales and marketing practices, product liability, commercial, employment and wrongful discharge, environmental claims, etc.) arising out of the normal conduct of their businesses.\n\nWe record provisions for legal proceedings when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reliably estimated. These provisions are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. For significant product liability cases, the provision is actuarially determined based on factors such as past experience, amount and number of claims reported, and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported.\n\nProvisions are recorded for environmental remediation costs when expenditure on remedial work is probable and the cost can be reliably estimated.\n\nNovartis believes that its total provisions are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent di/fficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, Novartis may incur additional costs beyond the amounts provided. Management believes that such additional amounts, if any, would not be material to the Group's financial condition but could be material to the results of operations or cash flows in a given period.\n\nFor more information, see 'Item 18.

        "page_content": "## 6.B Compensation\n\n## Dear shareholder,\n\nI am pleased to share with you the 2021 Compensation Report of Novartis AG.\n\nI would like to start by thanking Enrico Vanni for his valuable contribution during his tenure as Chair of the Compensation Committee and express my sincerest gratitude for his support and advice since I took over the role.\n\nAt Novartis, our compensation system seeks to reward our executives for delivering sustainable growth, successful outcomes on our financial and strategic targets and value creation for our shareholders. We aim to be transparent in how we link executive compensation to performance and have continued to engage with shareholders and proxy advisors in this e/ffort.\n\n## 2021 changes to Executive Committee compensation system and disclosures\n\nThe year completes the first three-year performance cycle of the new Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP), following the combination of the previous LTPP and the Long-Term Relative Performance Plan (LTRPP), as communicated in our 2018 Compensation Report. The combined plan focuses on four equally weighted performance metrics: net sales compound annual growth rate (CAGR), core operating income CAGR, innovation, and relative total shareholder return (TSR).\n\nIn 2021, we reviewed our Compensation Report format with a view to increase its accessibility while maintaining its depth of disclosure. We chose to develop our '-Compensation at a glance' section to incorporate a more graphical illustration of the 2021 CEO pay outcomes and provide a summary of our executive compensation framework for the year ahead. In addition, we o/ffer further visibility into the 2019-2021 LTPP targets, showing the threshold, target and maximum opportunity for each performance metric.\n\n## 2021 performance highlights\n\n2021 was a year of solid performance, with growth across sales, profits, margins and cash flow. Sales growth drivers were Entresto (USD 3.5 billion), Cosentyx (USD 4.7 billion), and Zolgensma (USD 1.4 billion), along with therapies like Kesimpta , Promacta/Revolade , Kisqali and Jakavi . These growth brands, along with other launch products, represent 52% of Innovative Medicines sales, up from 44% in 2020. While overall sales performance was on target, COVID-19 continued to have an impact on parts of our business, specifically Oncology and Sandoz.\n\nWe continued to deliver innovation to patients in 2021 with 21 approvals, including Leqvio (US, EU) and Scemblix (US), and 34 submissions made across our top four markets. However, the year was not without setbacks, as some clinical trials of experimental compounds including Kymriah for blood cancer, ACZ885 (canakinumab) for lung cancer, and CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kidney transplant patients - did not meet their primary goals.\n\nWe progressed our e/fforts to deliver next-generation medicines while driving our environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda. Pursuing new health equity initiatives in clinical trial diversity, advancing access to medicines, and using data and digital technologies in underserved regions in Africa, South America and Asia are some examples of our long-term commitment to transforming global health. More details on our ESG e/fforts can be found in the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2021.\n\nPerformance against the incentive targets, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, Alcon Keep/uni00A0Whole awards and dividend equivalents, resulted in 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF/uni00A011/uni00A0224/uni00A0727. This is a reduction of 11.8% compared to 2020. Overall, while the financial and operational targets were met or surpassed, some of the innovation targets were missed, which led to a reduction in long-term growth potential. This is reflected in a TSR performance below the peer group median. The reduced contribution of innovation and relative TSR to the 2019-2021 LTPP cycle were the main drivers of the lower total realized compensation in 2021 versus 2020. (For more information, please see '-LTPP performance outcomes')\n\n## 2022 Board compensation and Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe Board is planning to split the Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director (LID) roles, and to appoint separate board members to these roles as from the 2022 AGM. The Board has approved the introduction of an LID fee. More information can be found in '-2022 Board compensation' and '-Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director' in Item 6.C of this Annual Report.\n\nIn line with our Articles of Incorporation, we put to a vote the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Board of Directors from the 2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM, and the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the Executive Committee for the financial year 2023. We also request your advisory vote on this Compensation Report.\n\nWe deeply value our ongoing dialogue with you and other stakeholders. As always, we welcome your feedback, which is extremely valuable in driving improvements in our compensation system and practices.\n\nFinally, I would like to acknowledge and thank my fellow committee members for their diligence and service during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Moroney, D.Phil.\n\nChair of the Compensation Committee",

The main elements of our compensation philosophy are set out in the table below.\n\n| Pay for   performance      | \u00b7  Variable compensation is tied directly to the  achievement of strategic Company targets                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholder  alignment     | \u00b7  Our incentives are significantly weighted  toward long-term equity-based plans \u00b7  Measures under the Long-Term Incentive  plans are calibrated to promote the creation  of shareholder value \u00b7  Executive Committee members are |\n| Balanced   rewards         | \u00b7  Balanced set of measures to create  sustainable value \u00b7  Mix of targets based on financial metrics,                                                                                                                             |\n| Business   ethics          | \u00b7  The Novartis Values and Behaviors are an  integral part of our compensation system \u00b7  They underpin the assessment of overall                                                                                                   |\n| Competitive   compensation | \u00b7  Total compensation must be sufficient to  attract and retain key global talent \u00b7  Overarching emphasis on pay for                                                                                                               |\n\n## Alignment with Company strategy\n\nOur strategy is to build a focused medicines company powered by technology leadership in research and development, world-class commercialization, global access and data science. We foster a company culture that is inspired, curious and unbossed. We believe these elements drive continued innovation and will support the creation of value over the long term for our Company, employees, society and shareholders.\n\n## Approach to market benchmarking\n\nThere remains significant competition for top executive talent with deep expertise, competencies and proven performance within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. As such, external peer compensation data is one of a number of key reference points considered by the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee when making decisions on executive pay, helping to ensure that the compensation system and compensation levels at Novartis remain competitive. Novartis makes the commitment to shareholders to confirm benchmarking practices, including the peer group, each year.\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes in a rigorous approach to peer group construction and maintenance. The Compensation Committee also believes that using a consistent set of peers that is similar in size and scope enables shareholders to evaluate the compensation year on year and make pay-for-performance comparisons. In 2021, the Compensation Committee decided to maintain the same primary peer group of 14 global healthcare companies , as presented in the table below.\n\n## GLOBAL HEALTHCARE PEER GROUP\n\n| AbbVie          | Amgen                | AstraZeneca       |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Biogen          | Bristol-Myers Squibb | Eli Lilly & Co.   |\n| GlaxoSmithKline | Gilead Sciences      | Johnson & Johnson |\n| Novo Nordisk    | Merck & Co.          | Pfizer            |\n| Roche           | Sanofi               |                   |\n\nThe companies in this peer group reflect our industry and are similar to Novartis in terms of both size and scope of operations. Although Novartis is headquartered in Switzerland, more than a third of its sales come from the US market, and the US remains a significant talent pool for the recruitment of executives by the Company. It is therefore critical that Novartis is able to attract and retain key talent globally, especially from the US.\n\nTo continue to align the compensation system with this strategy and to ensure that Novartis is a highperforming organization, the Company operates both a short-term Annual Incentive plan and a Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plan with a balanced set of measures and targets. The Board of Directors determines specific, measurable and time-bound performance measures for the Annual Incentive and LTI plans. The Compensation Committee reviewed the existing compensation system and determined that it continues to support our strategy.\n\nFor consideration of European and local practices, the Compensation Committee also reviewed in 2021 a cross-industry peer group of Europe-headquartered multinational companies, selected based on comparability to Novartis in terms of industry, size, global scope of operations, and economic influence. Based on this review, the selected European peers were Anheuser-Busch InBev, AstraZeneca, Bayer, BMW, GlaxoSmithKline, L'Or\u00e9al, Merck KgaA, Nestl\u00e9, Novo Nordisk, Reckitt Benckiser (new), Roche, Siemens (new), Sanofi and Unilever.",

        "page_content": "## Executive Committee performance/uni00A0management process\n\nTo foster a high-performance culture, the Company applies a performance management process based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. The CEO and the other Executive Committee members are subject to a formal three-step process: objective setting, performance evaluation and compensation determination. This process is explained in the chart below.\n\nPerformance targets are generally set before the start of the relevant performance cycle. There is a rigorous framework in place for establishing targets to ensure they are suitably robust and challenging, and align with the strategic priorities of the Group.\n\nThe key factors taken into account when setting targets include:\n\n- \u00b7  Internal and external market expectations\n- \u00b7  Novartis strategic priorities\n- \u00b7 Regulatory factors (e.g., new launches, patent expiries)\n- \u00b7  Investment in capital expenditure\n- \u00b7  Values and Behaviors\n\n## Objective setting\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO proposes his targets to the Chairman of the Board; they are then reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors, based on input from the Compensation Committee.\n- \u00b7 For other Executive Committee members, targets for their division or unit are initially discussed with the CEO and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee.\n\nThe targets are challenged at multiple stages before they are ultimately approved by the Board of Directors. In line with good governance practices, the Compensation Committee works to set targets that are ambitious and challenging but do not encourage undue risk-taking.\n\nFollowing the end of the performance cycle, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee consider performance against the targets originally set. The CEO and Executive Committee members are not present while the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee discuss their individual performance evaluations. Prior to determining the final outcome, related factors such as performance relative to peers, wider market conditions, general industry trends and good practice are used to inform the overall performance assessment.\n\n## Compensation determination\n\n- \u00b7 A recommendation for the CEO's variable pay is made by the Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors for final determination.\n- \u00b7 For the Long-Term Incentive financial measures payout schedules, a formulaic approach applies and the Compensation Committee can also exercise judgment to ensure there is appropriate alignment between payout levels and overall performance achieved. The same principle of discretion applies to the relative TSR and innovation performance measures.\n- \u00b7 The CEO's recommendations for other Executive Committee members are considered and approved by the Compensation Committee, after which the Board of Directors is notified of the outcomes.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO's performance against the individual balanced scorecard is assessed by the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 For Executive Committee members, the CEO discusses with the Chairman each member's performance (assessed against his or her individual balanced scorecard) before making recommendations to the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Periodic assessments, including at the mid-year stage, ensure progress is suitably tracked.",

Operational excellence (20%)  Financial performance in 2021 improved from last year on core operating income and core margin, to USD 16.0  billion and 32.0% in constant currencies respectively. Net income exceeded target. The gain from the divestment  of the investment in Roche Holding AG was not considered in any of the performance assessments. The financial  performance was largely driven by growth brands  Cosentyx  and  Entresto , which together generated USD 8.3  billion in sales as well as other growth drivers like  Zolgensma ,  Promacta/Revolade ,  Kisqali , and  Kesimpta . However,  the effects of the pandemic were still apparent in Oncology and Sandoz as we continued to see delays in cancer  care and a weak flu season dampened generics sales. Key launches were successfully executed in 2021 with  Entresto  (US; to treat heart failure with preserved ejection  fraction) and  Kesimpta  (EU, Japan) achieving their sales goals. We continue to optimize our network of manufacturing sites and testing labs worldwide, adjusting our production  capacity to match our changing product mix. Overall, our year-end footprint was consolidated to 53 sites, with a  number of other site exits planned.

The percentage of women in      |       |\n| management increased to 46% in 2021 (from 45% in 2020). In addition to our prior year progress, we achieved pay     |       |\n| transparency in a further 10 countries in 2021, including Switzerland and the US bringing the total to 16 countries |       |\n| where employees can compare their pay to external benchmarks.

All our new suppliers have been assessed against all of these TPRM risks.\n\nNovartis participated in a collective action initiated by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) to jointly develop a reporting standard on anti-corruption. We published our first anti-bribery report for 2021 based on the guidance issued by NBIM and aligned with principles such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n## PRICING AND ACCESS\n\nWe made progress on health equity with 100% of US Phase III studies evaluating diversity and inclusion principles in feasibility planning since mid-2021.\n\nA global access strategy is defined for 100% of our new Innovative Medicines launches. In 2021, we launched a total of 31 new emerging market brands (EMBs) across this portfolio and reduced the time lag between launches in Europe and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). For example, Kesimpta was launched in Brazil within 4 months of first launch in Europe; Tabrecta EMB was launched in India 6 months ahead of planned first launch in Europe, and Adakveo EMB was launched simultaneously in India and Germany.\n\nIn 2021 we reached more than 56 million patients through our access approaches including flagship programs, emerging market brands, support programs and donations.\n\nThe Access to Medicine Foundation recognized our efforts in this area, ranking us second in the 2021 Access to Medicine Index.\n\n## GLOBAL HEALTH\n\nOur flagship programs reached more than 32 million patients in LMICs. We continued to make important contributions to improving global health by focusing on the control or elimination of four priority diseases (sickle cell disease, Chagas disease, malaria, and leprosy). We achieved several of our Global Health pipeline milestones in 2021; for example, positive results were reported for the Phase IIb study of KAF156, a Novartis compound for malaria, and its partner medicine, lumefantrine, in adults and children with malaria. We also expanded our sickle cell disease (SCD) program rollout in India, which has the world's highest burden of SCD outside of Africa, and in Ghana and Uganda.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE CITIZENSHIP\n\nIn 2021, we committed to a 2040 goal to become net zero across our value chain, leveraging our efforts to be carbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In this pursuit, we exceeded our targets with a 34% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and 40% and 56% reduction in our water consumption and waste respectively, versus the 2016 baseline.\n\n| Overall assessment of strategic objectives   | Met   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Overall assessment of CEO balanced scorecard | Met   |\n\n## ANNUAL INCENTIVE PAYOUT\n\nPayout\n\nThe 2021 CEO performance showed solid financial results, including sales and profit growth at or above target and most strategic objectives were achieved or exceeded.

The aim was to introduce a simplified LTI program that compensates executives more directly on performance linked to the Group's strategic imperatives of accelerating growth and margin expansion to drive long-term value.\n\nThe previous financial performance measure was replaced by net sales CAGR and core operating income CAGR in the simplified LTPP. The long-term innovation and relative TSR performance measures were retained, and an equal weighting applies to each of the aforementioned measures. Each of the four measures has a maximum payout of 200% of target.\n\n## OVERVIEW OF LONG/hyphen.capTERM PERFORMANCE PLAN\n\nAward vehicle\n\nGrant formula\n\nAt the start of the performance cycle, PSUs are granted under the Long-Term Incentive plan, as follows:\n\nTarget opportunity\n\n- \u00b7  CEO: 325% of annual base salary\n\nPerformance measures\n\n- \u00b7  Net sales CAGR\n\nTarget setting\n\nPayout range\n\nPayout formula\n\n- \u00b7  Core operating income CAGR\n- \u00b7  Innovation metrics\n- \u00b7  Relative TSR\n\nFinancial targets: Targets for net sales CAGR and core operating income CAGR are set based on the strategic plan of the Company.\n\nInnovation: Global Drug Development (GDD) targets are based on targeted filings communicated at the start of each performance cycle. The Science & Technology Committee determines the most important Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) milestones.\n\nFinancial targets: When assessing performance, achievements for threshold, target and maximum payout are defined for each metric and a payout curve is applied to determine the corresponding payout between 0-200% against target.\n\nInnovation: At the end of the cycle, the Compensation Committee determines the payout factor in the range of 0-150% based on the performance assessment made by the Science & Technology Committee. A payout between 150-200% of target is only delivered for truly exceptional performance.\n\nRelative TSR: Performance on TSR is assessed relative to a global healthcare peer group, as outlined below. As disclosed in the 2018 Compensation Report, the share value for the 2019-2021 cycle is determined by using the one-day pricing approach for the start of the performance cycle and the three-month averaging method at the end of the cycle. (From cycles 2020-2022 onwards, a three-month averaging method will be used for both the start and the end of the cycle.) Companies are then ranked in order of highest to lowest TSR in USD.\n\n## Global healthcare peer group\n\n| Abbvie          | Amgen                | AstraZeneca       |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| Biogen          | Bristol-Myers Squibb | Eli Lilly & Co    |\n| GlaxoSmithKline | Gilead Sciences      | Johnson & Johnson |\n| Novo Nordisk    | Merck & Co.          | Pfizer            |\n| Roche           | Sanofi               |                   |\n\n| Novartis position   in the peer group   | Payout range (% of target)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Position 1 - 2                          | 170% - 200%                  |\n| Position 3 - 5                          | 130% - 160%                  |\n| Position 6 - 8                          | 80% - 120%                   |\n| Position 9 - 15                         | 0%                           |\n\nThe Compensation Committee may use its discretion on each metric, including deciding on the payout within the ranges where appropriate.

Hale, Chief Legal O/fficer, was appointed a member of the Executive Committee on May 15, 2021. A buyout award in cash of CHF 111 975 was granted to replace compensation forfeited from her former employer as a result of her appointment at Novartis, in line with our policy (see '-Executive Committee appointments compensation policy').\n\nRobert Kowalski was promoted internally as Chief People & Organization (P&O) O/fficer on September 1, 2021.\n\n## 2021 Executive Committee member departures\n\nIn determining the compensation arrangements for departing Executive Committee members, the Compensation Committee ensures that contractual entitlements are respected, and all payments are in line with our plan rules and the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies.\n\nAll Executive Committee members have a 12-month notice period during which they are entitled to their contractual base salary, pension, Annual Incentive and other benefits. No new LTPP grants are made during the notice period.\n\nThe plan rules require that any equity vesting will occur on the normal vesting date (i.e., there is no accelerated vesting, with the exception of termination due to death or long-term disability, and malus and clawback as well as non-compete restrictions will continue to apply). No severance or non-compete payments are made to departing Executive Committee members. Further details on the policy treatment of variable compensation for departing Executive Committee members can be found in '-Treatment of variable compensation for Executive Committee leavers.'\n\nFormer Chief Legal O/fficer of Novartis, Shannon Klinger, resigned from the Executive Committee as of March 15, 2021. The Board of Directors agreed to shorten her 12-month notice period and decided on a cool-o/ff period until May 31, 2021, during which she had no access to any confidential information concerning the Company. Strictly in line with the Novartis incentive plan rules, her Annual Incentive for the 2021 performance year; unvested LTPP for cycles 2019-2021, 2020-2022 and 2021-2023; and unvested DSBP awarded in 2019, 2020 and 2021 were all forfeited in full.\n\nFormer Chief Digital O/fficer of Novartis, Bertrand Bodson, left the Executive Committee on February 1, 2021, and former Chief People & Organization O/fficer of Novartis, Steven Baert, left the Executive Committee on June 30, 2021. Both departed under good leaver conditions.\n\nSubsequently, the Board of Directors agreed to shorten the 12-month notice period for both Mr. Bodson and Mr. Baert to allow them to take on new positions on December 1, 2021, and October 1, 2021, respectively, with companies that are not in the Novartis comparator peer group as defined in the applicable variable pay plan rules. Outstanding LTI grants will vest at the end of the relevant performance cycles on a pro-rata basis, per their contractual agreements and in line with the said plan rules.",

Disclosing realized compensation means that the Annual Incentive and the LTI are disclosed at the end of their respective performance cycles, reflecting actual payouts based on performance.\n\nThe total actual payout may vary year on year depending on multiple factors, including the composition of the Executive Committee and the tenure of its members (as new members may not have a vested LTI), compensation increases, payout of variable compensation based on actual performance, share price fluctuations of the LTI, and dividend equivalents.\n\nAs communicated in the previous Compensation Reports, all Novartis shareholders received a dividend in kind in Alcon shares at the spin-o/ff date, which created immediate and significant value to shareholders. Unvested performance share units (PSUs), such as the LTPP, were not entitled to such dividend in kind. To ensure equal treatment relative to shareholders, PSU holders were instead awarded Alcon Keep Whole awards of similar value to the dividend in kind. These are only realized at the same time as the underlying PSUs and are subject to the same performance conditions. The vesting of these Alcon Keep Whole awards will be disclosed in the realized compensation of the CEO and Executive Committee members.\n\n## 2021 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members\n\nThe table below reports fixed and other compensation for the year, including the Annual Incentive for the 2021 performance year, the realized LTI for the 2019-2021 performance cycle, and any buyouts vesting in 2021. The portion of the Annual Incentive paid in shares for the year 2021 is disclosed using the underlying value of Novartis shares at the date of grant, while the realized values of any other equity awards (including dividend equivalents) are calculated using the share price on the date of vesting.\n\nTo determine the appropriateness of the 2021 CEO and executive compensation payouts under the Annual Incentive and LTI plans, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee reviewed management's performance and contribution, taking the following into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7  Operational and financial performance against targets\n- \u00b7  Progress toward strengthening our global product portfolio\n- \u00b7  Accomplishments across all strategic pillars, with careful attention to ESG targets\n\nThe incentive performance outcomes, combined with base salary and other benefits, pension, Alcon Keep Whole awards and dividend equivalents, resulted in 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO of CHF/uni00A011 224 727 .\n\n## 2021 realized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members\n\n|

compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members for 2021 compared to 2020\n\nThe 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO was CHF 11 224 727. This is a reduction of 11.8% compared to the prior year, mainly due to the lower performance payout of the 2019-2021 LTPP (107% compared to the 126% combined payout for the 2018-2020 LTPP and LTRPP). During the 2019-2021 LTPP performance cycle, the TSR ranking for Novartis, which is weighted 25% of the overall LTPP opportunity, was below median, which resulted in zero payout for this measure. Long-term Innovation performance, also weighted 25%, was also lower (109% compared to 131% in 2018-2020). For more detail, please refer to '-LTPP performance outcomes.'\n\nThe 2021 total realized compensation for the Executive Committee members, including the CEO, was CHF/uni00A056/uni00A0639/uni00A0891. The small decrease compared to the prior year can be mainly attributed to the lower 2019-2021 LTPP payout compared to the 2018-2020 cycle and, to a lesser extent, lower annual incentive payouts on average for Executive Committee members for 2021 compared to the prior performance year. The lower performance payouts were partially o/ffset by vesting of the first LTI for some Executive Committee members, granted to them following their respective appointments three years ago.",

This amount is out of total employer contributions of CHF 4 966 397 paid in 2021 for all Executive Committee members, and provides a right to the maximum future insured government pension benefit.\n- 2 The portion of the Annual Incentive delivered in equity is rounded up to the nearest share, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 26, 2022) of CHF 78.16 per Novartis share and USD 84.24 per ADR.\n- 3 The amounts represent the underlying share value of the target number of PSUs granted to Executive Committee members for the 2021-2023 performance cycle, based on the closing share price on the grant date (January 20, 2021) of CHF 86.01 per Novartis share and USD 96.92 per ADR for all members.\n- 4 Includes any other perquisites, benefits in kind, and international assignment benefits as per the global mobility policy (e.g., housing, international health insurance, children's school fees, tax equalization). The compensation and benefits elements related to the period after the step-down dates are also reported under 'other 2021 compensation'.\n- 5 All amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due by the Executive Committee member.\n- 6 Amounts in USD for James Bradner were converted at a rate of CHF 1.00 = USD 1.0942, which is the average rate used in the Group's 2021 consolidated financial statements.\n- 7 Karen Hale received a pro-rata LTPP award of 18 639 PSUs on Apr-2, 2021 (at CHF 81.15 share price at grant) upon joining the organization, as per contractual entitlement. The other compensation amount includes the first six weeks of compensation before her appointment to the Executive Committee.\n- 8 Robert Kowalski received his 2021 LTPP grant before his appointment to Executive Committee, therefore the reported LTPP amount is pro-rated to reflect his time as Executive Committee member over the full performance cycle.\n- 9 Steven Baert left the Executive Committee on June 30, 2021 and ended his notice period on September 30, 2021, in line with his reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2021 Executive Committee member departures'). He received his 2021 Annual Incentive 100% in cash on a pro-rata basis, and the LTPP grant for the 2021-2023 performance cycle, included in the table above, will vest at the end of the performance cycle on a pro-rata basis subject to the plan rules.\n- 10 Bertrand Bodson left the Executive Committee on January 31, 2021 and ended his notice period on November 30, 2021, in line with his reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2021 Executive Committee member departures'). He received his 2021 Annual Incentive 100% in cash on a pro-rata basis, and no LTPP was granted for the 2021-2023 performance cycle.\n- 11 Shannon Klinger resigned as Chief Legal O/fficer as of March 15, 2021, and left the Company on May 31, 2021, in line with her reduced contractual notice period (for more details, see '-2021 Executive Committee member departures'). The 2021 Annual Incentive and LTPP 2021-2023 cycle grant (23 586 PSUs), displayed at pro-rata value for the time she was in her role in 2021, were forfeited in full upon her departure.\n\n## Compensation at grant value\n\nIn accordance with the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies, Novartis continues to disclose total compensation at grant value for the CEO and other Executive Committee members. The following tables disclose for the CEO and other Executive Committee members:\n\n- \u00b7  Fixed 2021 compensation (base salary and benefits)\n- \u00b7  The actual cash portion and the deferred portion granted in equity of the 2021 Annual Incentive\n- \u00b7  2021-2023 LTPP performance cycle awards, which are reported at target grant date value, under the assumption that the awards will vest at 100% achievement, excluding any share price movement and dividend equivalents that may be accrued over the performance cycle. The future payout will be determined only after the performance cycle concludes in three years (i.e., the end of 2023), with a payout range of 0% to 200% of the target value\n- \u00b7  Other compensation for 2021, which includes other benefits, either paid in cash or granted in equity in the year\n\nTo assess CEO actual pay for performance in 2021, including the Annual Incentive payout

Each year at the AGM, shareholders are requested to approve, in a binding vote, the total compensation of the Board of Directors until the following AGM.\n\nThe Board of Directors sets the level of compensation for its Chairman and the other members to be in line with relevant benchmark companies, which include other large Switzerland-based multinational companies: ABB, Credit Suisse, Holcim, Nestl\u00e9, Roche and UBS. This peer group was chosen for Board compensation due to the comparability of Swiss legal requirements, including broad personal and individual liabilities under Swiss law (and criminal liability under Swiss rules regarding board and executive committee compensation related to the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies), and under US law (due to the Company's secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange). The Board of Directors reviews the compensation of its members, including the Chairman, each year based on a proposal by the Compensation Committee and on advice from its independent advisor, including relevant benchmarking information. The peer group used for the Board of Directors is di/fferent than that used for the Executive Committee to ensure independence of decision-making.\n\nThe Chairman's contract and the Board of Directors compensation policy do not provide for any termination-related payments.\n\n## Chairman of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board\n\nAs Chairman, Joerg Reinhardt receives total annual compensation valued at CHF 3.8 million. The total compensation is comprised equally of cash and shares, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Cash compensation: CHF 1.9 million per year\n- \u00b7  Share compensation: annual value equal to CHF 1.9 million of unrestricted Novartis shares\n\nFor 2021, the Chairman voluntarily waived the increase in compensation to which he is contractually entitled, which is an amount not lower than the average annual compensation increase awarded to employees based in Switzerland (1.0% for 2021).\n\n## Other Board/uni00A0members\n\nThe annual fee rates for Board membership and additional functions are included in the table below. These\n\nwere approved by the Board of Directors with e/ffect from the 2021 AGM.

Since the 2021 AGM, the roles of Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director (LID) have been held by the same Board member and no additional compensation was paid for the LID role. From the 2022 AGM, the roles will be held by separate Board members. For more information on the roles, please refer to '-Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director' in Item 6.C of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Board has approved an annual fixed fee of CHF 20 000 for the LID role.  As per the Board compensation policy, at least 50% of the fee will be paid in Novartis shares and the remainder will be paid in cash. When determining the compensation principles and the amount, the designated LID candidate was excused from any discussion.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation governance\n\n## Legal framework\n\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations and the corporate governance guidelines of the SIX Swiss Exchange require listed companies to disclose certain information about the compensation of board and executive committee members, their equity participation, and loans made to them. This Annual Report fulfills that requirement. In addition, the Annual Report is in line with the principles of the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse).\n\n## Risk management principles\n\nThe Compensation Committee, with support from its independent advisor, reviews market trends in compensation, and changes in corporate governance rules and best practices. Together with the Risk Committee, it also reviews the Novartis compensation systems to ensure that they do not encourage inappropriate or excessive risk-taking, and instead encourage behaviors that support sustainable value creation. A summary of the risk management principles is outlined below.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n\n- \u00b7  Rigorous performance management process, with approval of targets and evaluation of performance for the CEO by the Board of Directors\n- \u00b7  Balanced mix of short-term and long-term variable compensation elements\n- \u00b7  Values and Behaviors are a key component of the Annual Incentive and are embedded in our culture\n- \u00b7  Clawback and malus principles apply to all elements of the variable compensation\n- \u00b7  Performance-vesting LongTerm Incentives only, with three-year cycles\n- \u00b7  All variable compensation is capped at 200% of target\n- \u00b7  Contractual notice period of 12/uni00A0months\n- \u00b7  Post-contractual non-compete period is limited to a maximum of 12 months from the end of employment. Resulting compensation is limited to the annual base salary plus the prior-year Annual Incentive as per contract, if applicable\n- \u00b7  Good and bad leaver provisions apply to variable compensation of leavers\n- \u00b7  No severance payments or change-of-control clauses\n- \u00b7  Share ownership requirements; no hedging or pledging of Novartis share ownership\n\nExecutive Committee employment contracts provide for a notice period of up to 12 months and contain no changeof-control clauses or severance provisions (for example, agreements concerning special notice periods, longer-term contracts, 'golden parachutes,' waiver of lockup periods for equities and bonds, shorter vesting periods, and additional contributions to occupational pension schemes). For share ownership requirements, please refer to '-Share ownership requirements for the CEO and other Executive Committee members.'\n\n## Compensation decision-making authorities\n\nAuthority for decisions related to compensation is governed by the Articles of Incorporation, Board Regulations and the Compensation Committee Charter, which are all published on the Company website: www.novartis.com/\n\ninvestors/company-overview/corporate-governance. The Compensation Committee serves as the supervisory and governing body for compensation policies and plans within Novartis, and has overall responsibility for determining, reviewing and proposing compensation policies and plans for approval by the Board of Directors in line with the Compensation Committee Charter. A summary of discussions and conclusions of each committee meeting is delivered to the full Board of Directors. A summary of the compensation decision-making authorities is set out below.\n\n## Compensation authorization levels within the parameters set by the shareholders' meeting\n\n## DECISION ON\n\n## DECISION/hyphen.capMAKING AUTHORITY\n\n| Compensation of Chairman and   other Board members   | Board of Directors     |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Compensation of CEO                                  | Board of Directors     |\n| Compensation of other Executive   Committee members  | Compensation Committee |\n\n## Committee member independence\n\nThe Compensation Committee is composed exclusively of members of the Board of Directors who meet the independence criteria set forth in the Board Regulations. From the 2021 AGM, the Compensation Committee had the following five members: Simon Moroney (as Chair), Patrice Bula, Bridgette Heller, Enrico Vanni and William Winters.\n\n## Role of the Compensation Committee's independent advisor\n\nThe Compensation Committee retained Mercer Limited during the financial year 2021 as its independent external compensation advisor to support the committee in determining the design and implementation of compensation and benefits. The advisor from Mercer Limited was hired directly by the Compensation Committee in 2017, and the Compensation Committee has been fully satisfied with the performance and independence of the advisor since its engagement. In determining whether to renew the engagement with the advisor, the Compensation Committee evaluates, at least annually, the quality of the consulting service, the independence of the advisor, and the benefits of rotating advisors. Mercer Limited also provides services related to management development at the mid- and frontline leader level and in respect of corporate pensions. The independent advisor and his team that advises and supports the committee are not responsible or rewarded for work beyond support to the Compensation Committee and the People & Organization function on senior compensation.\n\n## Meetings held in 2021 and self-evaluation\n\nIn 2021, the Compensation Committee held seven formal meetings. In line with prior years, it collaborated with the Science & Technology Committee to review and endorse, for approval by the Board of Directors, the innovation targets and achievements of the Annual Incentive and LTPP. The Compensation Committee conducted a self-evaluation in 2021.",

We also held virtual roadshows in 2021 as part of our engagement with North American, European and Asian investors.\n\n## Voting rights, restrictions and representation\n\n## REGISTRATION\n\nShareholders have the right to vote and to execute all other rights as granted under Swiss law and the Articles of Incorporation (see, in particular, articles 17 and 18 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nEach share registered with the right to vote by the third business day before the General Meeting entitles the holder to one vote at General Meetings. Article 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that to be registered with voting rights, a shareholder must declare that he or she acquired the shares in his or her own name and for his or her own account. According to article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Board may register nominees with the right to vote. The Share Register is an internal, non-public register subject to statutory confidentiality and data privacy.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance.\n\n## REGISTRATION RESTRICTIONS\n\nArticle 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 2% of the share capital. Given that shareholder representation at General Meetings traditionally has been rather low in Switzerland, Novartis AG considers registration restrictions necessary to prevent a minority shareholder from dominating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions are in force for the registered shareholders listed in '-Item 6.C Board practices-Group structure and shareholdersShareholders-Significant shareholders.' Exemptions also apply to the Novartis Foundation for Employee Participation, Basel, which as of December 31, 2021, was registered in the Share Register with less than 2% of the share capital, and to Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, which as of December 31, 2021, was not registered but held 2.1% according to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG. No further exemptions were requested in 2021. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.\n\nArticle 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation provides that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote for more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the registered share capital. Exemptions are in force for the nominees listed in '-Item 6.C Board",

        "page_content": "practices-Group structure and shareholders-Shareholders-Significant shareholders,' and for the nominee Citibank, London, which in 2015 requested an exemption, but as of December 31, 2021, was not registered in the Share Register. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.\n\nAccording to article 5, paragraph 4 of the Articles of Incorporation, shareholders, ADR holders, or nominees who are linked to each other or who act in concert to circumvent registration restrictions are treated as one person or nominee for the purposes of the restrictions on registration.\n\nThe registration restrictions may be changed by resolution of the General Meeting, with approval of at least two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting.\n\nThe Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance.\n\n## REPRESENTATION AND ONLINE VOTING PLATFORM\n\nRegistered shareholders will receive personal invitations to the General Meetings along with a registration/proxy form as well as a personal one-time password and a QR code to log in to our online voting platform. By  returning the registration/proxy form or using the online voting platform, shareholders would normally be able to order an admission card for the General  Meeting or appoint another shareholder or the Independent Proxy to vote their shares on their behalf. However, in accordance with Swiss legislation passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical attendance at the 2021 Annual  General Meeting (AGM) was not possible, and shareholders could exercise their voting rights only through the Independent Proxy. Due to the challenging and unpredictable  situation regarding COVID-19, the Board decided in December 2021 to also hold the 2022 AGM without shareholders being physically present.\n\nIf the Independent Proxy is appointed, shareholders can also give voting instructions on alternative or additional motions related to the agenda items either (i) following the recommendations of the Board for such alternative or additional motions, or (ii) opposing such alternative or additional motions. They can also abstain from voting.\n\nShareholders choosing not to receive the comprehensive invitation materials will be informed of upcoming General Meetings through a letter containing the login credentials to access the online platform as well as a reference to www.novartis.com/investors/shareholder-information/general-meetings, where all relevant information is available.\n\n## ADR HOLDERS\n\nADR holders have the rights enumerated in the deposit agreement (such as the right to give voting instructions and to receive dividends). The ADS depositary of Novartis AG - JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., New York holds the shares underlying the ADRs and is registered as a shareholder in the Share Register. An ADR is not a share, and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder. Each ADR represents one share. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing the depositary to exercise their voting rights. The ADS depositary exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder.\n\n## General Meeting\n\n## CONVENING\n\nThe AGM must be held within six months after the end of our financial year (December 31), and normally takes place in late February/early March. Extraordinary General Meetings may be requested by the Board, the external auditor, or shareholders representing at least 10% of the share capital.\n\n## AGENDA\n\nShareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF 1 million may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda. Such requests must be made in writing at least 45 days before the meeting, specifying the requested item and proposal.\n\n## POWERS\n\nAccording to article 17 of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance), the following powers are vested exclusively in the General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption and amendment of the Articles of Incorporation\n- \u00b7  Election and removal of the Chairman, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor\n- \u00b7  Approval of the management report and of the consolidated financial statements\n- \u00b7  Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and decision on the appropriation of available earnings shown on the balance sheet, including dividends\n- \u00b7  Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM). If the maximum aggregate amount of compensation already approved by the AGM is not su/fficient to cover the compensation of newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members, Novartis may use up to 40% of the amount last approved for the newly appointed or promoted Executive Committee members.\n- \u00b7  Discharge of Board and Executive Committee members\n- \u00b7  Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles of Incorporation (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting\n\n## STATUTORY QUORUMS\n\nThe General Meeting passes resolutions and elections with the absolute majority of the votes represented at the meeting. However, under article 18 of the Articles of Incorporation (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/ corporate-governance), the approval of two-thirds of the votes represented at the meeting is required for:\n\n- \u00b7  Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Creation of shares with increased voting powers\n- \u00b7  Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of registe red shares, and the removal of such restrictions\n- \u00b7  Authorized or conditional increase of the share capital\n- \u00b7  Increase of the share capital out of equity, by contribution in kind, for the purpose of an acquisition of property or the grant of special rights\n- \u00b7  Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights\n- \u00b7  Change of the registered o/ffice of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Dissolution of Novartis AG\n\nIn addition, the law provides for a qualified majority for other resolutions, such as a merger or demerger.",

Winters\n\n- 1 Mr. von Planta will not stand for re-election at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Changes to the Board of Directors\n\nSrikant Datar, Board member since 2003, did not stand for re-election at the 2021 AGM following his appointment as dean of Harvard Business School in the US. Mr. Datar's CV can be found in the 2020 Annual Report (page 136), available at www.novartis.com/media-library/novartis-annual-report-2020.\n\n## Election and term of o/ffice\n\nBoard members (including the Chairman) and Compensation Committee members are elected individually by shareholders at the General Meeting for a one-year term of o/ffice. The term of o/ffice expires at the end of the next AGM.\n\nAs adopted by the 2021 AGM, the previous age limit set forth in the Articles of Incorporation was replaced by a term limit. Accordingly, a member shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. Under special circumstances and if deemed to be in the best interest of the Company, the Board may recommend exceptions to the shareholders (see article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation: www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance).\n\nThe term limit supports our commitment to renew the Board on an ongoing basis. It also follows international best practice, which increasingly asks for an overall  tenure of no more than 12 years. We believe age is still a  relevant factor in Board composition, and the GNCRC will  consider this and other factors - including gender, nationality and ethnicity - when evaluating candidates and exploring ways to increase Board diversity.\n\nSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE\n\n- J. Reinhardt (Chair)\n- N. Andrews\n- A. Fudge\n- F. van Houten\n- S. Moroney\n- C. Sawyers\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Chairman, supported by the GNCRC, ensures e/ffective succession plans for the Board, the CEO and the Executive Committee. These plans are discussed by the Board in private meetings. A search for a new Board member is launched - normally with the support of a professional executive search company - with individual selection criteria defined based on the evolving needs of the Company and a continuing focus on diversity. The set of competencies (further explained in '-Item 6.C Board practices-Board of Directors-Board skills') is also an important criterion for the GNCRC when evaluating new candidates. Candidates are interviewed by the Chairman, members of the GNCRC, other Board members, and members of the Executive Committee. The GNCRC then makes a recommendation to the full Board, and the Board ultimately decides who should be proposed for election at the upcoming AGM.\n\nThe Board will propose to the shareholders Ana de Pro Gonzalo as new Board member for election at the 2022 AGM. Andreas von Planta already announced that he will not stand for re-election at the 2023 AGM. To ensure an orderly transition, the Board will also propose the re-election of Mr. von Planta by granting an exception pursuant to article 20, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation, as he will exceed the 12-year term limit introduced last year.\n\n## RISK COMMITTEE\n\n- T.

A diverse Board ensures that the appropriate balance of skills, expertise and experience is represented to discharge responsibilities to shareholders, and helps create long-term value. We are continuously looking for opportunities to increase our Board diversity, including gender, age, nationality and ethnicity. The female representation on our Board currently amounts to 31%. The GNCRC is focused on achieving even greater diversity when identifying new Board member candidates.\n\nNATIONALITY NATIONALITY All Board members - including the Chairman - are non executive and independent, pursuant to applicable corporate governance rules and Novartis independence criteria, which are outlined in Appendix II to the Board Regulations (www.novartis.com/investors/company-overview/ corporate-governance). In particular, no Board member is or was a member of the management of Novartis AG or of any other Novartis Group company in the last three financial years up to December 31, 2021, or has a significant business relationship with Novartis AG or with any other Novartis Group company. Because all Board members are independent, no separate meetings of independent Board  members were held in 2021.\n\nIndependence is assessed annually. Each Board member completes an independence questionnaire that is subject to review by the GNCRC.

Every third year, this process is conducted by an independent external consultant. This last happened in 2020 with the consulting firm Egon Zehnder.\n\n## Qualitative review\n\n- \u00b7  Based on the results, the Chairman and the committee chairs each lead a qualitative review with their colleagues and then with the entire Board.\n- \u00b7  In addition, the Board, without its Chairman, discusses the Chairman's performance, and then provides him with feedback.\n\n## Trainings\n\nOur Board receives regular briefings and trainings on ethics, risks and compliance, and other relevant topics. In 2021, each Board member completed the following e-learning courses:\n\n- \u00b7  Diversity & Inclusion\n- \u00b7  Adverse Events\n- \u00b7  Fit to Commit, focusing on our ethical commitments around our Professional Practices Policy (P3), insider trading, data privacy, and digital engagement for personal use\n\nOur Chief Legal O/fficer also provides regular updates to our Board members on developments related to insider trading laws and regulations, and annually briefs the members of the Board and the Executive Committee on their insider trading duties. In addition, the Company o/ffers to its Board members a broad set of external trainings.\n\n## Outcome\n\n- \u00b7  The last self-assessment of November 2021 determined that the Board and its committees are functioning effectively and efficiently.\n- \u00b7  The feedback confirmed that the Board has an open culture, fostering a broad range of viewpoints.\n- \u00b7  The results also identified key areas on which to focus, such as further development of the Group strategy, oversight of a range of challenging technology projects, and the impact on/uni00A0persistent pricing pressure in the US/uni00A0and Europe.\n\n## Role of the Board and its committees\n\nThe Board is responsible for the overall direction and oversight of management, and holds the ultimate decision-making authority, with the exception of decisions reserved for shareholders.\n\nThe Board has delegated certain of its duties and responsibilities to its five committees led by a Board-elected committee chair, as set out in the Board Regulations (www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corporate-governance). In some cases, these responsibilities are of an advisory or preparatory nature (A/P). In other cases, the committee has decision-making power that is subject to final Board approval (FBA), or the responsibilities have been fully  delegated to the committee (FD). All committees have the authority to retain external consultants.\n\nAny Board member may request a Board or committee meeting and the inclusion of an agenda item. Before meetings, Board members receive materials to help them prepare the discussions and decision-making.",

Controls and Procedures').\n\n## Information from senior management\n\nThe Board ensures that it receives su/fficient information from the Executive Committee through:\n\n- \u00b7  Monthly CEO reporting (including detailed written updates from each division and business unit head), frequent communications from the CEO on current developments, and a yearly presentation\n- \u00b7  Executive Committee meeting minutes\n- \u00b7  Regular meetings/teleconferences by the Board and/or Board committees with the CEO and/or other members of the Executive Committee (e.g., the CFO, the Chief Legal O/fficer, the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer), and regular meetings/teleconferences with senior management (e.g., the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit)\n- \u00b7  Information from Executive Committee members or other Novartis employees, and visits to Novartis sites\n\nTo get an outside view, the Board and/or Board committees occasionally invite external advisors (e.g., the independent advisor of the Compensation Committee, the external auditor) to attend a meeting and/or represent a specific topic.\n\n## Monthly financial reports\n\nNovartis produces comprehensive, consolidated (unaudited) financial statements on a monthly basis for the Group and its operating divisions. These are typically available within 10 days after the end of the month, and include the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Consolidated income statement of the month and year to date, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as well as adjustments to arrive at core results, as defined by Novartis (see 'Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects-Item 5.A Operating results-Non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis'). The IFRS and core figures are compared to the prior-year period and targets in both USD and on a constant currency basis.\n- \u00b7  Supplementary data on a monthly and year-to-date basis, such as free cash flow and earnings per share on a USD basis\n\nManagement information related to the consolidated income statements and free cash flow is made available to Board members through the monthly CEO Report, including an analysis of key deviations from the prior year or target.\n\nPrior to the release of each quarter's results, the Board receives the actual consolidated financial statement information and an outlook of the full-year results in accordance with IFRS and core results (as defined by Novartis), together with related commentary.\n\nAnnually, in the middle of the year, the Board approves the Company's strategic plan for the next three years. In the fourth quarter of the year, the Board approves the operating targets for the following year as well as the financial targets for the following three-year period, including a projected consolidated income statement in USD prepared in accordance with IFRS and non-IFRS measures as defined by Novartis (core results).\n\nThe Board does not have direct access to the Novartis financial and management reporting systems but can, at any time, request more detailed information.",

Our Board has ultimate oversight of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) system and regularly reviews the most significant risks and how these risks are managed.

Furthermore, our Internal Audit function provides an independent evaluation of risk management (see '-Item 6.C Board practices-Information and control systems-Novartis Business Assurance & Advisory').\n\n## BOARD COMMITTEES\n\n## RISK COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Oversees the risk management system and processes\n- \u00b7  Reviews, together with management, the prioritization and handling of risks, the risk portfolio, and actions implemented by management\n- \u00b7  Performs deep dives into key risk areas and fosters a culture of smart risk-taking\n- \u00b7  Receives updates at its four annual meetings from designated risk owners as well as the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer and/ or the Head of Risk & Resilience\n\n## AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Ensures that Internal Audit plans are aligned with key risks and that the function provides independent assurance and insights around these risks\n- \u00b7  Works closely with the Risk Committee to minimize gaps in risk coverage\n- \u00b7  Reviews the integrated assurance report with the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer and the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit\n- \u00b7  Receives a biannual presentation from the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer\n- \u00b7  Receives a quarterly presentation from the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit on the progress of the risk-based audit plan and key insights from audit and advisory activities\n- \u00b7  Pays particular attention to financial risk\n- \u00b7  Has closed sessions individually with the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit and, upon request, with the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer\n\n## COMPENSATION COMMITTEE\n\n- \u00b7  Works closely with the Risk Committee to ensure that the compensation system does not lead to excessive risk-taking (see '-Item 6.B Compensation-Compensation governanceRisk management principles')\n\n## EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF NOVARTIS\n\n- \u00b7  Regularly assesses risks and fosters a culture of risk awareness, in line with the Novartis Values and Behaviors and the Novartis Code of Ethics\n\n## ETHICS, RISK & COMPLIANCE\n\n- \u00b7  Governs the Novartis Code of Ethics\n- \u00b7  Provides an integrated ERM framework (further described in the following section)\n- \u00b7  Governs the global compliance program within Novartis\n- \u00b7  Administers the Enterprise Policy Management and global Internal Controls framework\n\n## SENIOR LEADERS OF DIVISIONS, ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS AND/uni00A0GROUP FUNCTIONS, AT ALL LEVELS\n\n- \u00b7  Provide appropriate risk management within their area of responsibility\n- \u00b7  Establish adequate risk prevention and mitigation strategies when risk exposure is identified, including tracking progress and providing resources for possible actions\n- \u00b7  Assess emerging risks, trends and overall exposure as part of the ERM process\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management framework\n\nThe Ethics, Risk & Compliance (ERC) function provides an integrated ERM framework to obtain a holistic view of Company risks and drive a culture of smart risk-taking. Under the leadership of the Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance O/fficer, the Risk & Resilience team is responsible for the overall ERM process. This process covers, but is not limited to covering, risks associated with:\n\n- \u00b7  The research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of products\n- \u00b7  Finance; taxes; intellectual property; compliance with law and regulations; security; product safety; human resources; and health, safety and environmental protection\n- \u00b7  Business objectives and strategies, including mergers and acquisitions\n- \u00b7  External factors such as the social, political and economic environment\n\nThe ERM process continued to evolve in 2021. The Risk & Resilience team conducted risk workshops and collaborated with all risk assurance/monitoring functions to identify key risks across the Company. Each Novartis unit organized a focused risk workshop at the leadership team level. In parallel, risk workshops were held in the top 11 countries (by revenue) and in certain focus markets. Once key risks were identified, mitigation action plans were created to e/ffectively address them. The findings from these workshops were consolidated into the Novartis Risk Compass, which enables senior management, the Executive Committee and the Board to focus discussions on key risks and more closely align our corporate strategy with our risk exposure and ways of working.\n\nIn 2021, we further matured our ERM framework within the Novartis Risk & Resilience organization, developed additional risk management trainings, and integrated other critical risk management functions (like Third-Party Risk Management) into the Risk & Resilience department. Furthermore, a new team was established to coordinate and harmonize monitoring activities across the Company. The Enterprise Policy Management and Internal Control teams are progressing as planned to generate a holistic framework.",

        "page_content": "## Novartis Business Assurance &/uni00A0Advisory\n\nNBAA brings together the independent functions of Global Security and Internal Audit, with Quality, Data Analytics, Operations and Strategy (QDOS) as their support and excellence function. It provides the business, management and Board with protection, independent advice and assurance so Novartis can better manage risks and opportunities, make more informed decisions, and achieve its objectives. NBAA also proactively shares insights through learnings from audits, advisories, reviews, investigations and anti-counterfeit activities to enable the business to better detect and address emerging risks, trends and developments.\n\n## SpeakUp O/ffice\n\nOur SpeakUp O/ffice provides a safe place for employees to report potential misconduct. They have the option to do so anonymously. The SpeakUp O/ffice moved from NBAA to ERC in 2021 to further support an integrated and holistic compliance system.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe purpose of Internal Audit is to assist the Board and the Executive Committee in discharging their governance responsibilities by providing independent assurance and advice on the e/ffectiveness, e/fficiency and adequacy of processes and controls that support Novartis in achieving its objectives, managing its major risks, and ensuring compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations. The Internal Audit function executes the risk-based annual audit plan approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee (ACC) at the Group and entity levels, and reports the results to the audited units, the Executive Committee and the ACC (in the form of formal quarterly updates).\n\nPotential material irregularities are escalated to the ACC and to the SpeakUp O/ffice for triage and possible investigation, and action plans are developed together with the audited units. Moreover, Internal Audit conducts follow-up for high-risk findings prior to the due date for remediation actions. Overdue high-risk findings are reported to the ACC on a quarterly basis. If the audit opinion is 'needs major improvement,' a follow-up audit takes place the next year. Audit findings and action plans are stored and monitored in a single application to enable e/fficient follow-up.\n\nIn 2021, a larger proportion of the plan was focused on assurance in comparison to 2020, with good coverage of ERM Group risks as well as emerging topics including digital, gene therapies and business continuity management. More flexibility and agility were built into the plan, meaning Internal Audit could respond to new risks and business requests throughout the year, adding ten new engagements and progressing toward its real-time assurance aspiration. The following outlines the number of audits, internal reviews and advisories performed in 2021, and key topics repeatedly observed.\n\n## /two.cap/zero.cap/two.cap/one.cap INTERNAL AUDIT ACTIVITIES AND OBSERVATIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recurring observations relate to:\n\n- 3 Data governance and management; oversight of digital initiatives\n- 3 Third-party management, including subcontracting oversight\n- 3 Design of some commercial and R&D processes, and cross-functional collaboration over complex programs, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) implementation\n- 3 Patient support program, including monitoring of external service providers\n\nInternal Audit performed 100% of planned activities (equating to 70 engagements) in 2021, most conducted remotely, despite the obstacles created by COVID-19. These engagements comprised 46 audits, 14 advisories and 10 internal reviews covering the entire value chain of Novartis and key strategic and operational risks. Internal Audit has developed a hybrid model for engagement delivery, choosing between remote and in-person auditing based on the engagement scope and COVID-19 situation within the audited entity.\n\nNBAA and ERC continue to work toward integrated assurance by improving collaboration across all Novartis risk and assurance/monitoring providers. This includes the coordination of internal plans; alignment on terminology (e.g., root cause analysis) and risk areas; development of the integrated assurance map with aligned messaging and reporting; and increased communication around potential issues and risks. On a quarterly basis, to increase the level of assurance provided, NBAA reports to the ACC and the Executive Committee on key insights from all risk and monitoring functions, including key risks identified, emerging trends and monitoring coverage, comparing it with the Internal Audit insights.\n\n## Global Security\n\nGlobal Security proactively collects and shares threat intelligence to protect Novartis from situations that may compromise the safety of people, products and assets, and the reputation of our organization. Global Security protects patients from counterfeit products and, as part of the SpeakUp process, performs fair and timely investigations into high-risk cases of alleged internal misconduct. It also provides personal security advice and support for Novartis executives and other employees with utmost discretion.\n\n## NBAA leadership\n\nOur Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit reports administratively to the CEO, and functionally to the Chair of the ACC, and meets with the latter and the Chairman at least quarterly. She is a standing guest at the Executive Committee meetings.

        "page_content": "## Auditors\n\n## Duration of the mandate and/uni00A0terms/uni00A0of/uni00A0o/ffice\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the ACC selects and nominates an independent auditor for election at the AGM. PwC assumed its existing auditing mandate for Novartis in 1996. Claudia Benz, auditor in charge, began serving in her role in 2021, and Kris Muller, global relationship partner, began serving in her role in 2019. The ACC together with PwC ensure that these partners are rotated at least every five years.\n\n## Auditing fees and additional fees\n\nThe ACC monitors and preapproves the fees paid to the external auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It has developed and approved a policy with clear guidelines on the engagement of the independent auditor firm. This policy is designed to help ensure that the independence of the external auditor is maintained. It limits the scope of services that the external auditor may provide to the Group, stipulating certain permissible types of audit-related and non-audit services, including tax services and other services that have been preapproved by the ACC. The ACC preapproves all other services on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe external auditor is required to report periodically to the ACC about the scope of the services it has provided to the Group and the fees for the services it has performed to date. PwC fees for professional services related to the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, are as follows:\n\n|                        |   2021 USD million |   2020 USD million |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Audit services         |               22.2 |               20.5 |\n| Audit-related services |                1.5 |                1.4 |\n| Tax services           |                0.1 |                0.4 |\n| Other services         |                1.4 |                1.2 |\n| Total                  |               25.2 |               23.5 |\n\nAudit services include work performed to issue opinions on consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements of Novartis AG, to issue opinions related to the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting, and to issue reports on local statutory financial statements. Also included are audit services that generally can only be provided by the statutory auditor, such as the audit of the Compensation Report, audits of the adoption of new accounting policies, audits of information systems and the related control environment, as well as reviews of quarterly financial results.\n\nAudit-related services include other assurance services provided by the independent auditor but not restricted to those that can only be provided by the statutory auditor. They include services such as audits of pension and other employee benefit plans; audits in connection with non-recurring transactions; contract audits of third-party arrangements; corporate responsibility assurance; and other audit-related services.\n\nTax services represent tax compliance, assistance with historical tax matters, and other tax-related services.\n\nOther services include procedures related to corporate integrity agreements, benchmarking studies, and license fees for use of accounting and other reporting guidance databases.\n\n## Information to the Board and the ACC\n\nThe ACC, acting on behalf of the Board, is responsible for overseeing the activities of the external auditor. In 2021, this committee held eight meetings. PwC was invited to all of these meetings to attend the discussions on auditing matters and any other matters relevant to its audit.\n\nThe ACC recommended to the Board to approve the audited consolidated financial statements and the separate parent company financial statements of Novartis/uni00A0AG for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Board proposed the acceptance of these financial statements for approval by the shareholders at the next AGM.\n\nThe ACC regularly evaluates the performance of the external auditor and, based on this, once a year determines whether the external auditor should be proposed to the shareholders for re-election. To assess the performance of the external auditor, the ACC holds private meetings with the CFO and the Global Head of NBAA and Head of Internal Audit and, if necessary, obtains an independent external assessment. Criteria applied for the performance assessment of the external auditor include an evaluation of its technical and operational competence; its independence and objectivity; the sufficiency of the resources it has employed; its focus on areas of significant risk to Novartis; its willingness to probe and challenge; its ability to provide e/ffective, practical recommendations; and the openness and e/ffectiveness of its communications and coordination with the ACC, the Internal Audit function and management.\n\nOnce a year, the auditor in charge and the global relationship partner report to the Board on the external auditor's activities during the current year and on the audit plan for the  coming year.\n\nOn an annual basis, the external auditor provides the ACC with written disclosures required by the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and the committee and the external auditor discuss the external auditor's independence from Novartis.",

The audit tender was conducted through a fair, transparent and balanced process according to defined selection criteria under a strong governance structure, ensuring that all audit firms had equal access to management and information. Based on the\n\nresults of this tendering process, the ACC shortlisted two firms and, based on the assessment of those two firms against the selection criteria, the Board decided to propose to the shareholders at the 2022 AGM the election of KPMG as the external auditor commencing for the 2022 financial year. If KPMG is elected as our new external auditor at the 2022 AGM, PwC's mandate as our external auditor will end at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM, and KPMG will serve as our external auditor for the 2022 financial year.",

Financial Statements.'\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nSubject to the dividend policy described below, our Board of Directors expects to recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of each financial year. If approved by our shareholders at the relevant annual shareholders' meeting, the dividends will be payable shortly following such approval. Any shareholder who purchases our shares before the ex-dividend date and holds the shares until that date shall be deemed to be entitled to receive the dividends approved at that meeting. Dividends are reflected in our financial statements in the year in which they are approved by our shareholders.\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay a growing annual dividend in Swiss francs. This policy is subject to our financial conditions and outlook at the time, the results of our operations, and other factors.\n\nThe Board will propose a dividend of CHF 3.10 per share to the shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on March 4, 2022. Because we pay dividends in Swiss francs, exchange rate fluctuations will a/ffect the US dollar amounts received by holders of ADRs.

This includes the compliant sale of medicines and other healthcare products worldwide. To help us fulfill this mission, we have for many years maintained two representative o/ffices located in Iran.\n\nAs of October/uni00A018, 2010, a non-US a/ffiliate within our Innovative Medicines Division entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Pursuant to the MoU, the Iranian Ministry of Health acknowledges certain benefits that may apply to sales of certain Innovative Medicines Division medicines by third-party distributors in Iran. These include  fast-track  registration,  market  exclusivity, end-user subsidies, and exemptions from customs tari/ffs. Novartis receives no payments from the Iranian Ministry of Health under the MoU, and the MoU creates no\n\nobligations on the part of either Novartis or the Iranian Ministry of Health.\n\nFrom time to time, including in 2021, non-US a/ffiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions made payments to government entities in Iran related to patents, trademarks, exit fees and other transactions ordinarily incident to travel by doctors and other medical professionals resident in Iran to attend conferences or other events outside Iran.\n\nFrom time to time, including in 2021, non-US a/ffiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions enter into agreements with hospitals, research institutes, medical associations and universities in Iran to provide grants and sponsor congresses, seminars and symposia, and with doctors and other healthcare professionals for consulting  services,  including  participation  in  advisory boards  and  investigator  services  for  observational (non-interventional)  studies.  Some  hospitals  and research institutes are owned or controlled by the government of Iran, and some doctors and healthcare professionals are employed by hospitals that may be public or government-owned.\n\nBecause our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions have operations in Iran, including employees, they obtain services and have other dealings incidental to their activities in that country, including paying taxes and salaries either directly or indirectly through a service provider, and obtaining o/ffice rentals, insurance, electricity, water and telecommunications services, o/ffice and similar supplies, and customs-related services from Iranian companies that may be owned or controlled by the government of Iran. In addition, from time to time, representatives of our non-US a/ffiliates participate in meetings with Iranian o/fficials to discuss issues relevant to our business and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nNon-US a/ffiliates in our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions maintain local accounts at banks that are, as of November 5, 2018, on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List). These non-US a/ffiliates make local transactions for employee payroll and local vendor payment purposes. These transactions are conducted for the purpose of facilitating the provision of medicine to Iran, in line with the humanitarian exceptions contained in Section 11 of Executive Order 13902 and other applicable sanctions legal authorities. No transactions are made with an Iranian financial institution designated on the SDN List in connection with Iran's support for international terrorism or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.",

Additional Information\n\n## 10.A Share capital\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## 10.B Memorandum and articles of association\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation ('Articles'); our Regulations of the Board, the Board Committees and the Executive Committee ('Board Regulations'); and Swiss law, particularly the Swiss Code of Obligations ('Swiss CO'), and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles and the Board Regulations, which are an exhibit to this Form/uni00A020-F, and to Swiss law.\n\n## 10.B.1 Company purpose\n\nNovartis AG is registered in the commercial register of the canton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland, under number CHE-103.867.266. Our business purpose, as stated in Article/uni00A02 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises in the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold interests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemistry, physics, information technology or related areas. We may acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and intellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In pursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sustainable value.\n\n## 10.B.2 Directors\n\nAccording  to  our  Articles,  the  Board  of  Directors ('Board') consists of a minimum of eight and a maximum of 16 members. The members of the Board (including the Chairman) are elected individually by the General Meeting of Shareholders ('General Meeting') for a one-year term of o/ffice lasting until completion of the next Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ('AGM').\n\n- (a)  A Board resolution requires the a/ffirmative majority of the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations, a member of our Board ('Director') may not participate in decisions and resolutions on matters that a/ffect, or reasonably might a/ffect, the Director's interests or the interests of a person close to the Director.\n- (b) Compensation of the Directors is subject to the approval of the aggregate amounts of such compensation by a shareholders' resolution under the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Public Companies of the Swiss Federal Council.\n- (c) The Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits to Directors.\n- (d)  The Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on the Board for more than 12 years. The Board may, under certain circumstances and if deemed in the best interests of the Company, recommend exceptions to this rule to the General Meeting.\n- (e) Our Directors are not required to be shareholders at the time of the election by the General Meeting. However, according to our share ownership guidelines, the Chairman is required to own a minimum of 30 000 Novartis AG shares, and other Directors are required to own at least 5 000 Novartis AG shares within five years after joining the Board, to ensure their interests are aligned with those of our shareholders.\n\n## 10.B.3 Shareholder rights\n\nBecause Novartis AG has only one class of registered shares, the following information applies to all shareholders.\n\n- (a) Under the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out of  balance  sheet  profits  or  out  of  distributable reserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the Board may propose that a dividend be paid, we may only pay dividends upon shareholders' approval at a General Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires us to accrue general legal reserves under certain circumstances so long as these reserves amount to less than 20% of our registered share capital, and Swiss law and the Articles permit us to accrue additional reserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors must confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board conforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our Board expects to recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of each financial year. See 'Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees-Item 6.C Board Practices-Capital Structure-Limitation on  transferability-Per-share  information'  and 'Item/uni00A0 8./uni00A0 Financial Information-Item/uni00A0 8.A. Consolidated statements and other financial informationDividend policy.'\n\nDividends are usually due and payable shortly after the shareholders have passed a resolution approving the payment. Dividends that have not been claimed within five years after the due date revert to us and are allocated to our general reserves. For information about deduction of the withholding tax or other duties from dividend payments, see '-Item/uni00A010.E Taxation.'",

        "page_content": "- (b) Each share is entitled to one vote at a General Meeting. Voting rights may only be exercised for shares registered with the right to vote on the record date for the applicable General Meeting. In order to do so, the shareholder must file/uni00A0a share registration form with us, setting forth the shareholder's name, address and citizenship (or, in the case of a legal entity, its registered o/ffice). If the shareholder has not timely registered its shares, then the shareholder may not vote at, or participate in, a General Meeting.\n\nTo vote its shares, the shareholder must also explicitly declare that it has acquired the shares in its own name and for its own account. If the shareholder refuses to make such a declaration, the shares may not be voted unless the Board recognizes such shareholder as a nominee.\n\nThe Articles provide that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 2% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction. Considerations include whether the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable value and has a long-term investment horizon. Furthermore, the Articles provide that no nominee shall be registered with the right to vote shares comprising more than 0.5% of the registered share capital. The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses, and number of shares of the persons for whose account it holds 0.5% or more of the registered share capital. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders. We have in the past granted exemptions from the 2% rule for shareholders and the 0.5% rule for nominees.\n\nFor purposes of the 2% rule for shareholders and the 0.5% rule for nominees, groups of companies and groups of shareholders acting in concert are considered to be one shareholder. These rules also apply to shares acquired or subscribed by the exercise of subscription, option or conversion rights.\n\nAfter hearing the registered shareholder or nominee, the Board may cancel, with retroactive e/ffect as of the date of registration, the registration of the shareholders if the registration was e/ffected based on false information.\n\nRegistration restrictions in the Articles may only be removed upon a resolution carrying a two-thirds majority of the votes represented at a General Meeting.\n\nExcept as noted below, shareholders' resolutions require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes present at a General Meeting. As a result, abstentions have the e/ffect of votes against such resolutions. Some examples of shareholders' resolutions requiring a vote by such 'absolute majority of the votes' are:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption and amendment of the Articles\n- \u00b7  Election and removal of the Chairman, the Board and Compensation Committee members, the Independent Proxy and the external auditor\n- \u00b7 Approval of the management report and of the consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of the financial statements of Novartis AG, and decision on the appropriation of available earnings shown on the balance sheet, including dividends, if any\n- \u00b7 Approval of the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board (from an AGM until the next AGM) and of the Executive Committee (for the financial year following the AGM)\n- \u00b7  Discharge  of  Board  and  Executive  Committee members from liability for matters disclosed to the General Meeting\n- \u00b7  Decision on other matters that are reserved by law or by the Articles (e.g., advisory vote on the Compensation Report) to the General Meeting\n\nAccording to the Articles and Swiss law, the following matters require the approval of a 'supermajority' of at least two-thirds of the votes present at a General Meeting:\n\n- \u00b7  Alteration of the purpose of Novartis AG\n- \u00b7  Creation of shares with increased voting powers\n- \u00b7  Implementation of restrictions on the transfer of registe red shares, and the removal of such restrictions\n- \u00b7 Authorized or conditional increase of the share capital\n- \u00b7  Increase of the share capital out of equity, by contribution in kind, for the purpose of an acquisition of property or the grant of special rights\n- \u00b7  Restriction or cancellation of subscription rights\n- \u00b7  Change of the registered o/ffice of Novartis/uni00A0AG\n- \u00b7  Dissolution of Novartis AG\n\nIn addition, the law provides for a qualified majority for other resolutions, such as a merger or demerger.\n\nOur shareholders are required to annually elect all Directors (including the Chairman), the Compensation Committee members, the external auditor and the Independent Proxy. The Articles do not provide for cumulative voting of shares.\n\nAt a General Meeting, shareholders can be represented by a proxy, which must either be the shareholder's legal representative, another shareholder with the right to vote, or the Independent Proxy. Votes are taken either by a show of hands or by electronic voting, unless the General Meeting resolves to have a ballot or where a ballot is ordered by the chair of the meeting. However, in accordance with Swiss legislation passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in December 2021 the Board has decided that voting rights at our 2022 AGM can only be exercised through the Independent Proxy. It will not be possible to physically attend our 2022 AGM.",

The ADR is vested with rights defined and enumerated in the Deposit Agreement (such as the rights to vote, to receive a dividend and to receive a share of Novartis AG in exchange for a certain number of ADRs). The enumeration of rights, including any limitations on those rights in the Deposit Agreement, is final. There are no other rights given to the ADR holders. Only the ADS depositary, holding our shares underlying the ADRs, is registered as shareholder in our share register. An ADR is not a Novartis AG share and an ADR holder is not a Novartis AG shareholder.\n\nThe Deposit Agreement between our depositary, the ADR holder and us has granted certain indirect rights to vote to the ADR holders. ADR holders may not attend a General Meeting in person. ADR holders exercise their voting rights by instructing JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., our depositary, to exercise the voting rights attached to the registered shares underlying the ADRs. Each ADR represents one Novartis AG share. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., exercises the voting rights for registered shares underlying ADRs for which no voting instructions have been given by providing a discretionary proxy to an uninstructed independent designee. Such designee has to be a shareholder of Novartis AG. The same voting restrictions apply to ADR holders as to those holding Novartis AG shares (i.e., the right to vote up to 2% of the Novartis AG  registered  share  capital  -  unless  otherwise granted an exemption by the Board - and the disclosure requirement for nominees).\n\n- (c) Shareholders have the right to allocate the profit shown on our balance sheet and to distribute dividends by vote taken at the General Meeting, subject to the legal requirements described in 'Item/uni00A010.B.3(a) Shareholder rights.'\n- (d) Under the Swiss CO, any surplus arising out of a liquidation of Novartis AG (i.e., after the settlement of all claims of all creditors) would be distributed to the shareholders in proportion to the paid-in nominal value of their shares.\n- (e) The Swiss CO limits a corporation's ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase shares if we have su/fficient freely disposable equity in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. The aggregate nominal value of all Novartis AG shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. However, it is accepted that a Swiss corporation may repurchase its own shares beyond the statutory limit of 10% if the repurchased shares are clearly earmarked for cancellation. In addition, we are required to recognize a negative position, or if our subsidiaries acquire our shares, to create a special reserve on our balance sheet in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired shares. Repurchased shares held by us or our subsidiaries do not carry any rights to vote at a General Meeting, but are entitled to the economic benefits generally connected with the shares. The definition of subsidiaries, and therefore, treasury shares, for purposes of the above-described reserves requirement and voting\n\nrestrictions, di/ffers from the definition of subsidiaries for purposes of consolidation in our consolidated financial statements. The definition in the consolidated financial statements requires consolidation for financial reporting purposes of special purpose entities in instances where we have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Therefore, our consolidated financial statements include special purpose entities, mainly foundations, which do not qualify as subsidiaries subject to the reserve requirements and voting restrictions of the Swiss CO because we do not hold a majority participation in these special purpose entities. Accordingly, no reserve requirements apply to shares held by such special purpose entities, and such entities are not restricted from independently voting their shares.\n\nUnder the Swiss CO, we may not cancel treasury shares without the approval of a capital reduction by our shareholders.\n\n- (f)  Not applicable.\n- (g) Since all of our issued and outstanding shares have been fully paid in, our shareholders are not obliged to make  further  contributions  with  respect  to  their shares.\n- (h) See '-Item/uni00A0 10.B.3(b) Shareholder rights' and 'Item/uni00A010.B.7 Change in control.'\n\n## 10.B.4 Changes to shareholder rights\n\nUnder the Swiss CO, we may not issue new shares without the prior approval of a capital increase by our shareholders. If a capital increase is approved, then our shareholders would generally have certain pre-emptive rights to obtain newly issued shares in an amount proportional to the nominal value of the shares they already hold. These pre-emptive rights could be excluded in certain limited circumstances with the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of two-thirds of the votes. In addition, we may not create shares with increased voting powers or place restrictions on the transfer of registered shares without the approval of a resolution adopted at a General Meeting by a supermajority of votes. In addition, see '-Item/uni00A010.B.3(b) Shareholder rights' with regard to the Board's ability to cancel the registration of shares under limited circumstances.\n\n## 10.B.5 Shareholder meetings\n\nUnder the Swiss CO and the Articles, we must hold an AGM within six months after the end of our financial year. A General Meeting may be convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor. The Board is further required to convene an extraordinary General Meeting if so resolved by a General Meeting, or if so requested by shareholders representing at least 10% of the share capital, specifying the items for the agenda and their proposals. Shareholders representing shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least CHF/uni00A01/uni00A0000/uni00A0000 may request that an item be included in a General Meeting agenda.

Under certain circumstances, distributions out of capital contribution reserves made by shareholders after December/uni00A031, 1996, are exempt from the Withholding Tax. We are required to withhold Withholding Tax due from the gross distribution and to pay the Withholding Tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. The Withholding Tax is refundable in full to Swiss tax residents who are the beneficial owners of the taxable distribution at the time it is resolved and duly report the gross distribution received on their personal tax return or in their financial statements for tax purposes, as the case may be.\n\nIncome tax on dividends. A Swiss tax resident who receives dividends and similar distributions (including stock dividends and liquidation surplus) on shares or ADRs is required to include such amounts in the shareholder's personal income tax return. However, distribu-\n\ntions out of qualified capital contribution reserves are not subject to income tax.

Under current Swiss tax law, the gain realized on shares held by a Swiss resident who holds shares or ADRs as part of his private property is generally not subject to any federal, cantonal or municipal income taxation on gains realized on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADRs. However, gains realized upon a repurchase of shares by us may be characterized as taxable dividend income if certain conditions are met. Book gains realized on shares or ADRs held by a Swiss corporate entity or by a Swiss resident individual as part of the shareholder's business property are, in general, included in the taxable income of such person. However, the Federal Law on the Direct Federal Tax of December/uni00A014, 1990, and several cantonal laws on direct cantonal taxes provide for exceptions for Swiss corporate entities holding more than 10% of our voting stock for more than one year.\n\n## Residents of other countries\n\nRecipients of dividends and similar distributions on our shares who are neither residents of Switzerland for tax purposes nor holding shares as part of a business conducted through a permanent establishment situated in Switzerland ('Non-Resident Holders') are not subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of such distributions. Moreover, gains realized by such recipients upon the disposal of shares are not subject to Swiss income taxes.\n\nNon-Resident Holders of shares are, however, subject to the Withholding Tax on dividends and similar distributions mentioned above and, under certain circumstances, to the Stamp Duty described below. Such Non-Resident Holders may be entitled to a partial refund of the Withholding Tax if the country in which they reside has entered into a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Switzerland. Non-Resident Holders should be aware that the procedures for claiming treaty refunds (and the time frame required for obtaining a refund) may di/ffer from country to country. Non-Resident Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding receipt, ownership, purchase, sale or other dispositions of shares or ADRs, and the procedures for claiming a refund of the Withholding Tax.",

If, however, the shares or ADRs of Non-Resident Holders can be attributed to a permanent establishment or a fixed place of business maintained by such person within Switzerland during the relevant tax year, the shares or ADRs may be subject to Swiss income taxes in respect of income and gains realized on the shares or ADRs, and such person may qualify for a full refund of the Withholding Tax based on Swiss tax law.\n\nResidents of the US. A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced rate of tax on dividends equal to 15% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i)/uni00A0qualifies for benefits under the Treaty, (ii)/uni00A0is not a company (or, if it is a company, such company directly holds less than 10% of our voting stock), and (iii)/uni00A0does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed base in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 15% Treaty rate. A Non-Resident Holder who is a resident of the US for purposes of the Treaty is eligible for a reduced\n\nrate of tax on dividends equal to 5% of the dividend, provided that such holder (i)/uni00A0is a company, (ii)/uni00A0qualifies for benefits under the Treaty, (iii)/uni00A0holds directly at least 10% of our voting stock, and (iv)/uni00A0does not conduct business through a permanent establishment or fixed place of business in Switzerland to which the shares or ADRs are attributable. Such an eligible holder must apply for a refund of the amount of the Withholding Tax in excess of the 5% Treaty rate. Claims for refunds must be filed on Swiss Tax Form/uni00A082 (82C for corporations; 82I for individuals; 82E for other entities), which may be obtained from any Swiss Consulate General in the US or from the Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland at the address below, together with an instruction form. Four copies of the form must be duly completed, signed before a notary public of the US, and sent to the Federal Tax Administration of Switzerland, Eigerstrasse 65, CH-3003 Bern, Switzerland. The form must be accompanied by suitable evidence of deduction of Swiss tax withheld at source, such as certificates of deduction, signed bank vouchers or credit slips. The form may be filed on or after July/uni00A01 or January/uni00A01 following the date the dividend was payable, but no later than December/uni00A031 of the third year following the calendar year in which the dividend became payable.

The sale of shares, whether by Swiss residents or Non-Resident Holders, may be subject to federal securities transfer Stamp Duty of 0.15%, calculated on the sale proceeds, if the sale occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other Swiss securities dealer, as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Duty Act. The Stamp Duty has to be paid by the securities dealer and may be charged to the parties in a taxable transaction who are not securities dealers. Stamp Duty may also be due if a sale of shares occurs with or through a non-Swiss bank or securities dealer, provided that (i)/uni00A0such bank or dealer is a member of the SIX, and (ii)/uni00A0the sale takes place on the SIX. In addition to this Stamp Duty, the sale of shares by or through a member of the SIX may be subject to a minor stock exchange levy.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nThe following is a general discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant to you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because this discussion does not consider any specific circumstances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs, persons who are subject to US taxation are strongly urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall US federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as to the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences, of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs. In particular, additional or di/fferent rules may apply to US expatriates; banks and other financial institutions; regulated investment companies; traders in securities who elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting; dealers in securities or currencies; tax-exempt entities; insurance companies; broker-dealers; investors liable for alternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or ADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion transaction; holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; persons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attribution, 10% or more of our outstanding shares. This discussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold the shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for investment purposes), and whose functional currency is the US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for benefits under the Treaty.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is a beneficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i)/uni00A0an individual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal income tax purposes; (ii)/uni00A0a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the US or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii)/uni00A0an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv)/uni00A0a trust (i)/uni00A0subject to the primary supervision of a US court and\n\nthe control of one or more US persons, or (ii)/uni00A0that has a valid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of the owning and disposing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner of our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see the discussion below under '-Dividends' regarding certain statements made by the US Treasury concerning depositary arrangements.\n\nThis discussion assumes that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nDividends. US Holders will be required to include in gross income, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount (without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the dividend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time that such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs. For this purpose, a 'dividend' will include any distribution paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other than certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock) paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under US federal income tax principles. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of a US Holder's tax basis in the shares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such tax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain, which will be long-term capital gain if the US Holder held our shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the Code, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs are not eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to corporate shareholders.\n\nDividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs will constitute income from sources outside the US for US foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations and conditions provided in the Code, US Holders generally may claim as a credit against their US federal income tax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the Withholding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign tax credits, but may be subject to other limitations, and each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor.\n\nThe US Treasury has expressed concern that parties to whom ADRs are released may be taking actions incon-",

        "page_content": "sistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US Holders of ADRs. Accordingly, the summary above of the creditability of the Withholding Tax could be a/ffected by future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.\n\nIn general, a US Holder will be required to determine the amount of any dividend paid in Swiss francs, including the amount of any Withholding Tax imposed thereon, by translating the Swiss francs into US dollars at the spot rate on the date the dividend is actually or constructively received by a US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs, regardless of whether the Swiss francs are in fact converted into US dollars. If a US Holder converts the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder generally should not recognize foreign currency gain or loss on such conversion. If a US Holder does not convert the Swiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder will have a tax basis in the Swiss francs equal to the US dollar value on such date. Any foreign currency gain or loss that a US Holder recognizes on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the Swiss francs generally will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss.\n\nFor a non-corporate US Holder, the US dollar amount of any dividends paid that constitute qualified dividend income generally will be taxable at a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds), provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. In addition, the dividends could be subject to a 3.8% net investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. We currently believe that dividends paid with respect to our shares and ADRs will constitute qualified dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided that the US Holder meets certain holding period and other requirements. US Holders of shares or ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability to them of the reduced dividend rate in light of their own particular situation and the computations of their foreign tax credit limitation with respect to any qualified dividends paid to them, as applicable.\n\nSale or other taxable disposition. Upon a sale or other taxable disposition of shares or ADRs, US Holders gen-\n\nerally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the di/fference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US Holder's tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the shares or ADRs. This capital gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period in the shares or ADRs exceeds one year. In the case of a non-corporate US Holder, any long-term capital gain generally will be subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates, with a maximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income that exceeds certain thresholds). In addition, the gains could be subject to a 3.8% investment income tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the US Holder's net investment income or the amount by which modified adjusted gross income exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on filing status. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations under the Code. Deposits or withdrawals of our shares by US Holders in exchanges for ADRs will not result in the realization of gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes.\n\nUS information reporting and backup withholding. Dividend payments with respect to shares or ADRs and proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares or ADRs received in the United States or through US-related financial intermediaries may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and possible US backup withholding. Certain exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to these information reporting and backup withholding requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a US Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Any US Holders required to establish their exempt status generally must provide a properly executed IRS Form/uni00A0W-9 (Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification). Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a US Holder's US federal income tax liability, and a US Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.\n\n## 10.F Dividends and paying agents\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## 10.G Statement by experts\n\nNot applicable.",

This annual contribution payment will equal: (a)(1) USD 1.7/uni00A0million less (a)(2) the custody costs, fees and expenses (including,  without  limitation,  any  central  securities depository fees, charges and expenses) incurred during the applicable Contract Year (the items in (a)(2) collectively are the 'Custody Costs') plus (b)/uni00A070% of the gross\n\nissuance and cancellation fees collected by JPMorgan under the Deposit Agreement during such Contract Year minus (c)/uni00A0that portion (if any) of JPMorgan's legal fees, charges and out-of-pocket expenses in excess of USD 50 000 for such Contract Year. To the extent that the Custody Costs for a Contract Year exceed USD 1.7/uni00A0million, these costs would be capped at USD 1.7/uni00A0million.\n\nJPMorgan has further agreed to waive the USD 0.05 per ADS issuance fees that would normally be owed by Novartis in connection with our deposits of shares as part of our employee stock ownership and employee participation plans. Novartis is responsible for reimbursing JPMorgan  for  all  taxes  and  governmental  charges required to have been withheld and/or paid, and not so withheld and/or paid, arising from such waived fees.",

Controls and Procedures\n\n## Report of Novartis Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nNovartis AG's Chief Executive O/fficer and Chief Financial O/fficer, after evaluating the e/ffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule/uni00A013a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were e/ffective.\n\nThe Board of Directors and management of the Group are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Group's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Group's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its published consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be e/ffective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nGroup management assessed the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December/uni00A031, 2021. In making this assessment, it used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment, management concluded that, as of December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group's internal control over financial reporting is e/ffective based on those criteria.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG, Switzerland, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an unqualified opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting, which is included in this Annual Report under 'Item/uni00A018. Financial Statements-Report  of  independent  registered  public accounting firm.'\n\nSee the report of PwC, an independent registered public accounting firm, included under 'Item/uni00A018. Financial Statements-Report of independent registered public accounting firm.'\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report that have materially a/ffected, or are reasonably likely to materially a/ffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVas Narasimhan Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nHarry Kirsch Chief Financial O/fficer\n\nBasel, February 1, 2022",

Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the ACC selects and nominates an independent external auditor for election at the AGM by our shareholders, who must elect the external auditor on an annual basis via shareholder resolutions that require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes present at the AGM. In April 2020, the ACC decided to invite several audit firms, including PwC, to participate in a tender process that would lead to the selection of an external auditor to be proposed for election at the 2022 AGM. The audit tender was conducted through a fair, transparent and balanced process according to defined selection criteria under a strong governance structure, ensuring that all audit firms had equal access to management and information. Based on the results of this tendering process, the Board decided to propose to the shareholders at the 2022 AGM the election of KPMG AG ('KPMG') as the external auditor commencing for the 2022 fiscal year. As disclosed in our Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we notified PwC that they would not be proposed for re-election as external auditor at the AGM on March 4, 2022. If KPMG is elected as our new external auditor at the 2022 AGM, KPMG would then serve as our external auditor for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nIn respect of fiscal years 2020 and 2021 and the subsequent interim period through February 1, 2022:\n\n- \u00b7  PwC has not issued any reports on our consolidated financial statements or on the e/ffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion. The relevant PwC auditor's reports were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.\n- \u00b7 There has not been any disagreement with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures which disagreement, if not resolved to PwC's satisfaction, would have caused PwC to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its  auditor's  reports,  or  any  reportable  event  as described in Item 16F(a)(1)(v) of Form 20-F.\n\nWe have provided PwC with a copy of the foregoing disclosure and have requested that the firm furnish us with a letter addressed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether PwC agrees with such disclosure and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of PwC's letter, dated February 2, 2022, in which PwC stated that the firm agrees with such disclosure, is filed as Exhibit 16.1.\n\nDuring fiscal years 2020 and 2021, and the subsequent interim period through February 1, 2022, we did not consult with KPMG regarding: (i) the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and neither was a written report or oral advice provided to us by KPMG that KPMG concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to an accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or reportable event as described in Item 16F(a)(1) of Form 20-F.",

Corporate Governance\n\nNovartis AG is subject to and compliant with the laws and regulations of Switzerland (in particular, Swiss company and securities laws, SIX Swiss Exchange rules and the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance) and the securities laws of the United States, including New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules, as applicable to foreign private issuers of securities. The following summarizes some significant ways in which our corporate governance practices di/ffer from those followed by domestic listed US companies under the listing standards of the NYSE:\n\n- \u00b7  Novartis  AG  shareholders  do  not  receive  written reports directly from Board committees.\n- \u00b7 External auditors are appointed by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM), as opposed to being appointed by the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n- \u00b7  While shareholders cannot vote on all equity compensation plans, they are entitled to hold separate, yearly binding votes on Board and Executive Committee compensation.\n- \u00b7  The Board has set up a separate Risk Committee that oversees the risk management system and processes, as opposed to delegating this responsibility to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n- \u00b7  The  full  Board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the performance evaluation of the Board and Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7  The full Board is responsible for setting objectives relevant to the CEO's compensation and for evaluating his performance.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Novartis Group/uni00A0consolidated/uni00A0financial statements\n\n## 1. Significant accounting policies\n\nThe Novartis Group (Novartis or Group) is a multinational group of companies specializing in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of innovative pharmaceuticals and cost-saving generic medicines. The Group is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value.\n\nThe Group's financial year-end is December 31, which is also the annual closing date of the individual entities' financial statements incorporated into the Group's consolidated  financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, either at the balance sheet date or during the year, which a/ffect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts.\n\nEstimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the given circumstances and are regularly monitored. Actual outcomes and results could di/ffer from those estimates and assumptions. Revisions to estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised.\n\nListed below are accounting policies of significance to Novartis or, in cases where IFRS provides alternatives, the option adopted by Novartis.\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include all entities, including structured entities, over which Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland, directly or indirectly has control (generally as a result of owning more than 50% of the entity's voting interest). Consolidated entities are also referred to as 'subsidiaries.'\n\nIn cases where Novartis does not fully own a subsidiary, it has elected to value any remaining outstanding non-controlling interest at the time of acquiring control of the subsidiary at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net identified assets.\n\nInvestments  in  associated  companies  (generally defined as investments in entities in which Novartis holds between 20% and 50% of voting shares or over which it otherwise has significant influence) and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, except for selected venture fund investments for which the Group has elected to apply the method of fair value through the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Novartis are presented in US dollars (USD). The functional currency of a subsidiary is generally the local currency of that respective entity. The functional currency used for the reporting of certain Swiss and foreign finance entities is USD instead of their respective local currencies. This reflects the fact that the cash flows and transactions of these entities are primarily denominated in this currency.\n\nFor subsidiaries not operating in hyperinflationary economies, the subsidiary's results, financial position and cash flows that do not have USD as their functional currency are translated into USD using the following exchange rates:\n\n- \u00b7  Income, expense and cash flows for each month using the average exchange rate, with the US dollar values for each month being aggregated during the year\n- \u00b7  Balance sheet using year-end exchange rates\n- \u00b7  Resulting exchange rate di/fferences are recognized in other comprehensive income\n\nFor subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies, the impact of the restatement of the non-monetary assets and liabilities with the general price index at the beginning of the period is recorded in retained earnings in equity. The subsequent gains or losses resulting from the restatement of non-monetary assets are recorded in 'Other financial income and expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale or held for distribution to owners\n\nNon-current assets are accounted for as assets held for sale or as related to discontinued operations when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction or distribution to owners and a sale or distribution to owners is considered highly probable. They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and any resulting impairment is recognized. Assets related to discontinued operations and assets of a disposal group held for sale are not depreciated or amortized. The prior year consolidated balance sheet is not restated.\n\nIf in a subsequent period, the criteria for classification as held for sale are no longer met, the recoverable amount of assets and liabilities are reclassified out of assets held for sale into the respective balance sheet lines and the prior year consolidated balance sheet is not restated. The cumulative amount of depreciation and amortization not recorded since the date of their classification as assets held for sale, and any required adjustments to the recoverable amounts of assets are recognized in the consolidated income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2019, at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Novartis AG shareholders, held on February  28,  2019,  the  Novartis  AG  shareholders approved a special distribution by way of a dividend in kind to e/ffect the spin-o/ff of Alcon Inc.\n\nThe February 28, 2019, shareholder approval for the spin-o/ff required the Alcon Division and selected portions of corporate activities attributable to Alcon's business (the 'Alcon business') to be reported as discontinued operations.\n\nThe shareholder approval to spin o/ff the Alcon business also required the recognition of a distribution liability at the fair value of the Alcon business. The Group elected to measure the distribution liability at the fair value of the Alcon business net assets taken as a whole. The distribution liability was recognized through a reduction in retained earnings. It was required to be adjusted at each balance sheet date for changes in its estimated fair value, up to the date of the distribution to shareholders through retained earnings. Any resulting impairment of the business assets to be distributed would have been recognized in the consolidated income statements in 'Other expense' of discontinued operations, at the date of initial recognition of the distribution liability or at subsequent dates resulting from changes of the distribution liability valuation. At the April 8, 2019, distribution settlement date, the resulting gain, which was measured as the excess amount of the distribution liability over the then-carrying value of the net assets of the business distributed, was recognized on the line 'Gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders' in the income statement of discontinued operations.\n\nThe recognition of the distribution liability required the use of valuation techniques for purposes of impairment testing of the Alcon business' assets to be distributed and for the measurement of the fair value of the distribution liability. These valuations required the use of management assumptions and estimates related to the Alcon business' future cash flows, market multiples to estimate day one market value, and control premiums to apply in estimating the Alcon business fair value. These fair value measurements were classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy. The section '-Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets' in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques.\n\nTransaction costs that were directly attributable to the distribution (spin-o/ff) of Alcon to the Novartis shareholders, and that would otherwise have been avoided, were recorded to equity.\n\nFor additional disclosures, refer to 'Note 2. Significant transactions-Significant transactions in 2019Completion of the spin-o/ff of the Alcon business through a dividend in kind distribution to Novartis AG shareholders,' and 'Note 30. Discontinued operations.'\n\n## Acquisition of assets and businesses\n\nAssets separately acquired are recorded at cost, which includes the purchase price and any directly attributable costs for bringing the asset into the condition to operate as intended. Expected costs for obligations to dismantle and remove property, plant and equipment and restore the site when it is no longer used are included in their cost.\n\nAcquired businesses are accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless the optional concentration test is applied. The optional concentration test allows for an election on a transaction-by-transaction basis to account for the acquired business as an asset separately acquired when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nThe acquisition method requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their respective fair values on the date the Group obtains control. The excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration transferred over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recognized as goodwill. The valuations are based on information available at the acquisition date. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe application of the acquisition method requires certain estimates and assumptions to be made, especially concerning the fair values of the acquired intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and the useful lives of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Estimates of fair value require the use of valuation techniques. These valuations require the use of management assumptions and estimates, including the value of comparable assets in the market, amount and timing of future cash flows, outcomes and costs of research  and  development  activities,  probability  of obtaining regulatory approval, long-term sales forecasts, actions of competitors, discount rates and terminal growth rates. The section '-Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets' in this Note 1 provides additional information on key assumptions that are highly sensitive in the estimation of fair values using valuation techniques.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the estimated useful life of the individual asset. Freehold land is not depreciated. The related depreciation expense is included in the costs of the functions using the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the  balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections over the useful life.",

The Group elected to allocate the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components on the basis of the relative standalone price of each component.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present\n\nvalue of the future lease payments as from the commencement date of the lease to the end of the lease term. The lease term includes the period of any lease extension that management assess as reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, the Novartis incremental borrowing rate for the asset subject to the lease in the relevant market.\n\nThe Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever there is a change to the lease terms or expected payments under the lease, or a modification that is not accounted for as a separate lease.\n\nThe portion of the lease payments attributable to the repayment of lease liabilities is recognized in cash flows used in financing activities, and the portion attributable to the payment of interest is included in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially recognized on the balance sheet at cost, which comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received, and any initial direct costs incurred by Novartis,\n\nand expected costs for obligations to dismantle and remove right-of-use assets when they are no longer used.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease over the shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term.\n\nRight-of-use assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the balance sheet carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life.\n\nIn arrangements where the Group is the lessor, it determines at lease inception whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. Leases that transfer substantially all of the risk and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the counterparty (the lessee) are accounted for as finance leases. Leases that do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease payments received are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated income statement in either 'net sales' or 'other income,' depending on the nature of the underlying asset to the lease arrangement.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on applying the acquisition method on the acquisition of a business and is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying fair value of the net identified assets acquired. It is allocated to groups of cash-generating units (CGUs), which are usually represented by the reported segments. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the level of these groups of CGUs, and any impairment charges are recorded under 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Intangible assets available for use\n\nNovartis has the following classes of available for use intangible assets: currently marketed products; technologies and other intangible assets (including computer software).\n\nCurrently marketed products represent the composite value of acquired intellectual property (IP), patents, distribution rights and product trade names.\n\nTechnologies represent identified and separable acquired know-how used in the research, development and production processes.\n\nSignificant investments in internally developed and acquired computer software are capitalized and included in the 'Other' category, and amortized once available for use.\n\nIntangible assets available for use with a definite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis and are evaluated for potential",

Any impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated income statement under 'Research and development.' Once a project included in IPR&D has received marketing approval from a regulatory authority, it is transferred to the 'Currently marketed  products' category.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAn asset, a CGU or a grouping of CGUs is considered impaired  when  its  balance  sheet  carrying  amount exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, which is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Usually, Novartis applies the fair value less costs of disposal method for its impairment assessment. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. In the limited cases where the value-in-use method would be applied, net present value techniques would be applied using pre-tax cash flows and discount rates.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal reflects estimates of assumptions that market participants would be expected to use when pricing the asset or CGU, and for this purpose, management considers the range of economic conditions that are expected to exist over the remaining useful life of the asset.\n\nThe estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Group's activities with regard to:\n\n- \u00b7  Amount and timing of projected future cash flows\n- \u00b7  Long-term sales forecasts\n- \u00b7 Actions of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.)\n- \u00b7  Sales erosion rates after the end of patent or other intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the entry of generic competition\n- \u00b7 Outcome of research and development activities (compound e/fficacy, results of  clinical trials, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Amount and timing of projected costs to develop IPR&D into  commercially viable products\n- \u00b7  Profit margins\n- \u00b7  Probability of obtaining regulatory approval\n- \u00b7  Future tax rate\n- \u00b7  Appropriate terminal growth rate\n- \u00b7  Appropriate discount rate\n\nGenerally, for intangible assets with a definite useful life, Novartis uses cash flow projections for the whole useful life of these assets. For goodwill, Novartis generally utilizes cash flow projections for a five-year period based on management forecasts, with a terminal value based on cash flow projections usually in line with inflation rates for later periods.\n\nProbability-weighted scenarios are  typically used. Discount rates used consider the Group's estimated weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific asset, country and currency risks associated with cash flow projections, to approximate the discount rate that market participants would use to value the asset.\n\nDue to the above factors, actual cash flows and values could vary significantly from forecasted future cash flows and related values derived using discounting techniques.\n\n## Impairment of associated companies accounted for at equity\n\nNovartis considers investments in associated companies for impairment evaluation whenever objective evidence indicates the net investment may be impaired, including when a quoted share price indicates a fair value less than the per-share balance sheet carrying value for the investment.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of the investment is estimated to be lower than the balance sheet carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference in the consolidated income statement under 'Income from associated companies.'\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts are usually presented within current financial  debts  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet, except in cases where a right of o/ffset has been agreed with a bank, which allows for presentation on a net basis.",

        "page_content": "## Marketable securities, commodities and non-current financial assets\n\nCommodities, which include gold bullion or coins, are valued at the lower of cost or fair value using current market prices. The changes in fair value below cost are immediately recorded in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nMarketable securities are financial assets held for short-term purposes which are principally traded in liquid markets and are classified within current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in 'Other financial  income  and  expense'  in  the  consolidated income statement. Non-current financial assets held for long-term  strategic  purposes  are  classified  within non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The financial impacts related to these financial assets are recorded in 'Other income' and 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement.\n\nMarketable  securities  and  non-current  financial assets are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is di/fferent from the settlement date when the transaction is ultimately e/ffected. Quoted securities are remeasured at each reporting date to fair value based on current market prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active or no market is available, fair values are established using valuation techniques. The majority of non-quoted investments are initially valued at fair value through the purchase price established between a willing buyer and seller. Non-quoted investments are subsequently adjusted based on values derived from discounted cash flow analysis or other pricing models. These investment values are classified as 'Level 3' in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe Group classifies and accounts for its marketable securities and non-current financial assets in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7  Debt securities are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with subsequent recycling into the consolidated income statement, as they meet both the 'solely payment of principal and interest' and the business model criteria. Unrealized gains and losses, except exchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are recognized in the consolidated income statement when the debt instrument is sold, at which time the gain is transferred to 'Other financial income and expense.' Exchange gains and losses related to debt instruments are immediately recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n- \u00b7  Fund investments and equity securities of the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL). Unrealized gains and losses, including exchange gains and losses, are recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Other income' for gains and 'Other expense' for losses.\n- \u00b7  Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside of the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. Unrealized gains and losses, including\n\nexchange gains and losses, are recorded as a fair value adjustment in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. They are reclassified to retained earnings when the equity security is sold. If these equity securities are not designated at the date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, they are valued at FVPL, as described above.\n\n- \u00b7  Other non-current financial assets, such as loans and long-term receivables from customers, advances and other deposits, are valued at amortized cost, which reflects the time value of money less any allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt securities valued at fair value through other comprehensive income. Impairments on debt securities are recorded in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nFor other financial assets valued at amortized cost, impairments, which are based on their expected credit losses, and exchange rate losses are included in 'Other expense'  in  the  consolidated  income  statement. Exchange rate gains and interest income, using the e/ffective interest rate method, are included in 'Other income' or 'Other financial income' in the consolidated income statement, depending on the nature of the item.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at fair value and are remeasured to their current fair value at the end of each subsequent reporting period. The valuation of a forward exchange rate contract is based on the discounted cash flow model, using interest curves and forward rates at the reporting date as observable inputs.\n\nOptions are valued based on a modified BlackScholes model using volatility and exercise prices as major observable inputs.\n\nThe Group utilizes derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging to reduce the volatility in the Group's performance due to the exposure to various business-related risks. To mitigate these risks, the Group enters into certain derivative financial instruments. The risk reduction is obtained because the derivative's value or cash flows are expected, wholly or partly, to o/ffset changes in the value or cash flows of the recognized assets or liabilities. The overall strategy is aiming to mitigate the currency and interest rate risk of positions that are contractually agreed, and to partially mitigate the exposure risk of selected anticipated transactions.\n\nCertain derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting treatment. A prerequisite for obtaining this accounting-hedge relationship is extensive documentation on inception and proving on a regular basis that the economic hedge is e/ffective for accounting purposes. Other derivative financial instruments do not meet the criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized immediately in 'Other financial income and expense' in the consolidated income statement.",

        "page_content": "In addition, the Group has designated certain longterm debt components as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations. On consolidation, foreign currency di/fferences arising on long-term debt designated as net investment hedges of a foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation e/ffects, to the extent that the hedge is e/ffective. The foreign currency di/fferences arising from hedge ine/ffectiveness are recognized in the income statement in 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\nWhen a hedged net investment is disposed of, the proportionate portion of the cumulative amount recognized in equity in relation to the hedged net investment is transferred to the consolidated income statement as an adjustment to the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventory is valued at the lower of acquisition or production cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and net realizable value. This value is used for the 'Cost of goods sold' in the consolidated income statement. Unsaleable inventory is fully written o/ff in the consolidated income statement under 'Cost of goods sold.'\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognized at their invoiced amounts, including any related sales taxes less adjustments for estimated revenue deductions such as rebates, chargebacks and cash discounts.\n\nProvisions for doubtful trade receivables are established using a forward-looking expected credit loss model (ECL), which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivable. These provisions represent the difference between the trade receivable's carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated collectible amount. Charges for doubtful trade receivables are recorded as marketing and selling costs recognized in the consolidated income statement within 'Selling, general and administration' expenses.\n\n## Legal and environmental liabilities\n\nNovartis and its subsidiaries are subject to contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, environmental remediation liabilities and other product-related and commercial litigation, and governmental investigations and proceedings.  A provision is recorded where a reliable estimate can be made of the probable outcome of legal or other disputes against the subsidiary.\n\n## Contingent consideration\n\nIn an acquisition or divestment of a business, it is necessary to recognize contingent future amounts due to previous owners, representing contractually defined\n\npotential amounts as a liability or an asset. Usually for Novartis, these are linked to milestone or royalty payments related to certain assets and are recognized as a financial liability or financial asset at fair value, which is then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date. These estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or  market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of payment, and are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time.\n\nChanges in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in subsequent periods are recognized in the consolidated income statement in 'Cost of goods sold' for currently marketed products and in 'Research and development' for IPR&D. Changes in contingent consideration assets are recognized in 'Other income' or 'Other expense,' depending on their nature.\n\nThe e/ffect of unwinding the discount over time is recognized for contingent liabilities in 'Interest expense' and for contingent assets as interest income recognized in the consolidated income statement within 'Other financial income and expense.'\n\n## Defined benefit pension plans and/uni00A0other/uni00A0post-employment benefits\n\nThe liability in respect of defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefits is the defined benefit obligation calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The current service cost for such post- employment benefit plans is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which employees are employed, while the net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognized as 'Other expense' or 'Other income.'\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are initially recorded at fair value on their trade date, which is di/fferent from the settlement date, when the transaction is ultimately e/ffected. Treasury shares are deducted from consolidated equity at their nominal  value  of  CHF/uni00A0 0.50  per  share.  Di/fferences between the nominal amount and the transaction price on purchases or sales of treasury shares with third parties, or the value of services received for the shares allocated to employees as part of share-based compensation arrangements, are recorded in 'Retained earnings' in the  consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue on the sale of Novartis Group products and services, which is recorded as 'Net sales' in the consolidated income statement, is recognized when a contractual promise to a customer (performance obligation) has been fulfilled by transferring control over the promised goods and services to the customer, substantially all of which is at the point in time of shipment to or receipt of the products by the customer or when the services are performed.

        "page_content": "provisions, revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the acceptance criteria. If products are stockpiled at the request of the customer, revenue is only recognized once the products have been inspected and accepted by the customer, and there is no right of return or replenishment on product expiry. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration Novartis expects to receive in exchange for its goods and services, when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the consideration is allocated based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\n\nThe consideration Novartis receives in exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is only recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The most common elements of variable consideration are listed below.\n\n- \u00b7  Rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, managed healthcare organizations and other customers, as well as chargebacks are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions  at  the  time  the  related  revenues  are recorded, or when the incentives are o/ffered. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience, regulations, specific terms in the individual agreements, product pricing and the mix of products, contracts, channels and payors.\n- \u00b7  Refunds  granted  to  healthcare  providers  under innovative pay-for-performance agreements (i.e., outcome  based  arrangements)  are  provisioned  and recorded as a revenue deduction at the time the related sales are recorded. They are calculated on the basis of historical experience and clinical data available for the product, as well as specific terms of the individual agreements. In cases where historical experience and clinical data are not su/fficient for a reliable estimation of the outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved or until such history is available.\n- \u00b7 Cash discounts are o/ffered to customers to encourage prompt payment and are provisioned and recorded as revenue deductions at the time the related sales are recorded.\n- \u00b7  Shelf stock adjustments are generally granted to customers, primarily of the Sandoz Division, to cover the inventory held by them at the time a price decline becomes e/ffective. Revenue deduction provisions for shelf stock adjustments are recorded when the price decline is anticipated, based on the impact of the price decline on the customer's estimated inventory levels.\n- \u00b7  Sales returns provisions are recognized and recorded as revenue deductions when there is historical experience of Novartis agreeing to customer returns and Novartis can reasonably estimate expected future returns. In doing so, the estimated rate of return is applied, determined on the basis of historical experience of customer returns and considering any other relevant factors. This is applied to the amounts invoiced, also considering the amount of returned products to be destroyed versus products that can be placed back in inventory for resale. Where shipments are made on a resale or return basis, without su/fficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is only\n\nrecorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nNet sales and provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted to actual amounts as rebates, refunds, discounts and returns are processed. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these sales deductions.\n\n'Other revenue' includes income from profit-sharing arrangements with our collaboration partners, and royalty and milestone income from the out-licensing of intellectual property when Novartis retains an interest in the intellectual property through a license. Royalty income earned from a license is recognized when the underlying sales have occurred. Milestone income is recognized at the point in time when it is highly probable that the relevant milestone event criteria are met, and the risk of reversal of revenue recognition is remote. Other revenue also includes revenue from activities such as manufacturing or other services rendered, to the extent such revenue is not recorded under net sales, and is recognized when control transfers to the third party and our performance obligations are satisfied.\n\n## Research and development\n\nInternal research and development (R&D) costs are fully charged to 'Research and development' in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Group considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude the capitalization of internal development expenses as an intangible asset until marketing approval from a regulatory authority is obtained in a major market such as the United States, the European Union, Switzerland or Japan.\n\nPayments made to third parties, such as contract research and development organizations in compensation for subcontracted R&D, that are deemed not to transfer intellectual property to Novartis are expensed as internal R&D expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Such payments are only capitalized if they meet the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset, usually when marketing approval has been received from a regulatory authority in a major market.\n\nPayments made to third parties to in-license or acquire intellectual property rights, compounds and products, including initial upfront and subsequent milestone payments, are capitalized, as are payments for other assets, such as technologies to be used in R&D activities. If additional payments are made to the originator company to continue performing R&D activities, an evaluation is made as to the nature of the payments. Such additional payments will be expensed if they are deemed to be compensation for subcontracted R&D services not resulting in an additional transfer of intellectual property rights to Novartis. Such additional payments will be capitalized if they are deemed to be compensation for the transfer to Novartis of additional intellectual property developed at the risk of the originator company.

Costs for activities that are required by regulatory authorities as a condition for obtaining marketing approval in a major market are capitalized and recognized as currently marketed products.\n\nInventory produced ahead of regulatory approval is fully provisioned, and the charge is included in 'Other expense' in the consolidated income statement, as its ultimate use  cannot be assured. If this inventory can subsequently be sold, the provision is released to 'Other income' in the consolidated income statement, either on approval by the appropriate regulatory authority or, exceptionally in Europe, on recommendation by the Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use (CHMP), if approval is virtually certain.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nVested  Novartis  shares  and  American  Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that are granted as compensation are valued at their market value on the grant date and are immediately expensed in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe fair values of unvested restricted shares (RSs), restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) in Novartis shares and ADRs granted to employees  as  compensation  are   recognized  as  an expense over the related vesting period. The expense recorded  in  the  consolidated  income  statement  is included in the personnel expenses of the various functions in which the employees are employed.\n\nUnvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs and RSUs are only conditional on the provision of services by the plan participant during the vesting period. They are valued at fair value on the grant date. As RSUs do not entitle the holder to dividends, the fair value is based on the Novartis share price at the grant date adjusted for the net present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the holding period. The fair value of these grants, after making adjustments for assumptions related to forfeiture during the vesting period, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective vesting period.\n\nPSUs are subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria during the vesting period and require plan participants to provide services during this period. The following paragraphs provide an overview of the accounting policies for the share-based compensation plans that grant PSUs.\n\nFor PSUs that are subject to performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics and that are conditional on the provision of service by plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on assumptions concerning the expected performance against the internal performance metrics throughout the vesting period. The assumptions\n\nare based on the Group's targets for those performance metrics, and the expected forfeitures due to plan participants not meeting their service conditions. The assumptions are periodically adjusted over the vesting period. Any change in estimates for past services is recorded immediately as an expense or income in the consolidated income statement, and amounts for the remaining vesting period are expensed on a straight-line basis. As a result, at the end of the vesting period, the charge during the entire vesting period represents the amount that will finally vest. The number of equity instruments that finally vest is determined at the vesting date.\n\nFor PSUs that are subject to performance criteria based on variables that can be observed in the market, which for Novartis plans is the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period, and that are conditional on the provision of services by the plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on the total fair value of the grant over the vesting period. IFRS requires that these variables that can be observed in the market are taken into account in determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Novartis determined the fair value of these PSUs at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Adjustments to the number of equity instruments granted are only made if a plan participant does not fulfill the service conditions.\n\nFor PSUs granted under plans that are subject to both performance criteria based on Novartis internal performance metrics and Novartis TSR relative to a specific peer group of companies over the vesting period and that are conditional on the provision of service by plan participants during the vesting period, the expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, and is determined based on a bifurcation into the components based on the performance criteria related to Novartis internal performance metrics and TSR, as described in the paragraphs above.\n\nMeasuring the fair values of PSUs granted that include TSR performance criteria requires use of estimates. The Monte Carlo simulation used to determine the fair value of the PSUs TSR performance criteria requires the probability of factors related to uncertain future events; the term of the award; the grant price of underlying shares or ADRs; expected volatilities; the expected correlation matrix of the underlying equity instruments with those of the peer group of companies; and the risk-free interest rate as input parameters.\n\nIf a plan participant leaves Novartis for reasons other than  retirement,  disability  or  death,  then  unvested restricted shares, restricted ADRs, RSUs and PSUs are forfeited, unless determined otherwise by the provision of the plan rules or by the Compensation Committee of the Novartis Board of Directors, for example, in connection with a reorganization or divestment.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from governments or similar organizations are recognized at their fair value when there is reasonable",

Corresponding releases are recorded in 'Other income' in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Healthcare contributions\n\nHealthcare contribution levies and fees under governmental programs that require the Group to contribute to a  country's  healthcare  costs,  other  than  programs described in 'Revenue recognition' in this Note 1, are recognized  in  'Other  expense'  in  the  consolidated income statement. Provisions for healthcare contributions are adjusted to the actual amounts levied. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the e/ffect of these healthcare contributions.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nTaxes on income are recorded in the same periods as the revenues and expenses to which they relate and include interest and penalties incurred during the period. Deferred taxes are determined using the comprehensive liability method and are calculated on the temporary differences that arise between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying value in the balance sheet prepared for consolidation purposes, except for those temporary di/fferences related to investments in subsidiaries and associated companies, where the timing of their reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Since the retained earnings are reinvested, withholding or other taxes on eventual distribution of a subsidiary's retained earnings are only taken into account when a dividend has been planned.\n\nThe estimated amounts for current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, including any amounts related to any uncertain tax positions, are based on currently known facts and circumstances. Tax returns are based on an interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and reflect estimates based on these judgments and interpretations.\n\nThe tax returns are subject to examination by the competent taxing authorities, which may result in an assessment being made requiring payments of additional tax, interest or penalties. Inherent uncertainties exist in the estimates of the tax positions.\n\n## Impact of adopting significant new IFRS standard in 2021\n\nThe following new IFRS standard has been adopted by Novartis from January 1, 2021:\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2, Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (Interest Benchmark Reform Amendments)\n\nInterest Benchmark Reform Amendments became e/ffective from January 1, 2021. These amendments address issues that might a/ffect financial reporting when an existing interest rate benchmark (i.e. Interbank o/ffered rate IBOR) is replaced with an alternative benchmark interest rate. The e/ffects of interest rate benchmark reform on the Group's financial instruments and risk management strategies did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements and are not expected to have a significant impact in future periods.\n\nThere are no other IFRS standards or interpretations not yet e/ffective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## Impact of adopting significant new IFRS standard in 2020\n\nThe following new IFRS standard has been adopted by Novartis from January 1, 2020:\n\n## IFRS 3 Business Combinations amendments\n\nThe IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations that revised the definition of a business, which assist entities with the evaluation of when an asset or group of assets acquired should be considered a business. This amended standard has been applied to transactions entered into on or after January 1, 2020. The amended standard allows an entity to apply an optional concentration  test,  on  a  transaction-by-transaction basis, to evaluate whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If this optional concentration test is met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business. The adoption of this amended standard on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have a significant impact in future periods. However, this will depend on the facts and circumstances of future transactions and if the Group decides to apply the optional concentration test in the assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is or is not a business.",

The lease liability reflects the net present value of the remaining lease payments, and the rightof-use asset corresponds to the lease liability, adjusted for payments made before the commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement. The standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and related interpretations.\n\nUpon adoption of the new standard, a portion of the annual operating lease costs, which was previously fully recognized as functional expenses, as a component of operating income, was recorded as interest expense. In addition, the portion of the lease payments that represents the reduction of the lease liability is recognized in the cash flow statement as an outflow from financing activities, which was previously fully recognized as an outflow  from  operating  activities.  Given  the  leases involved, these e/ffects are not significant to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flow.\n\nThe Group implemented the new standard on January 1, 2019, and applied the modified retrospective method, with right-of-use assets measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to those leases recognized in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application. The Group did not restate prior years.\n\n## 2. Significant transactions\n\nThe Group applied the acquisition method of accounting for businesses acquired, and did not elect to apply the optional concentration test to account for acquired business as an asset separately acquired.\n\n## Significant transactions in 2021\n\n## Sandoz - acquisition of GSK's cephalosporin antibiotics business\n\nOn February 10, 2021, Sandoz entered into an agreement with certain subsidiaries of GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK) for the acquisition of the GSK's cephalosporin antibiotics business.\n\nUnder the agreement, Sandoz acquired the global rights to three established brands (Zinnat \u00ae , Zinacef \u00ae and\n\n## Results of our impact assessment:\n\nThe undiscounted operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2018, amounted to USD 3.6 billion. This includes approximately USD 0.1 billion of leases with a commencement date in 2019, as well as short-term leases and low-value leases that are recognized from January 1, 2019, upon adoption of IFRS 16, on a straightline basis as expense in profit and loss. This also includes USD 0.2 billion lease commitments related to the Alcon Division, which is attributable to discontinued operation in 2019. For the remaining undiscounted lease commitments attributable to continuing operations of USD 3.3 billion, the Group recognized on January 1, 2019, lease liabilities of USD 1.74 billion and right-of-use assets of USD 1.55 billion (after the reclassification of USD 0.1 billion from property, plant and equipment, and net adjustments for the USD 0.3 billion recognition of sublease receivables, prepayments and accrued lease payments recognized as at December 31, 2018).

Upon shareholder approval, the Alcon business was reported as discontinued operations, and the fair value of the Alcon business exceeded the carrying value of its net assets.\n\nThe conditions precedent to the spin-o/ff were met and on April 8, 2019 the spin-o/ff of the Alcon business was e/ffected by way of a distribution of a dividend in kind of Alcon Inc. shares to Novartis AG shareholders and ADR (American Depositary Receipt) holders ('the Distribution'), which amounted to USD 23.4 billion and was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings. Through the Distribution, each Novartis AG shareholder received one Alcon Inc. share for every five Novartis AG shares/ ADRs they held on April 8, 2019, close of business. As of April 9, 2019, the shares of Alcon Inc. are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol 'ALC.'\n\nThe dividend in kind distribution liability to e/ffect the spin-o/ff of the Alcon business ('the distribution liability') amounted  to  USD  26.4  billion  at  March  31,  2019, unchanged from its initial recognition on February 28, 2019, and was in excess of the carrying value of the Alcon business net assets as of February 28, 2019, and as of March 31, 2019. The net assets of the Alcon business amounted to USD 23.1 billion as at March 31, 2019.\n\nOn March 6, 2019, Alcon entered into financing arrangements with a syndicate of banks under which it\n\nborrowed on April 2, 2019, a total amount of USD 3.2 billion. These borrowings consisted of approximately USD 2.8 billion and the equivalent of USD 0.4 billion in EUR in bridge and other term loans under such Alcon facilities agreement. In addition, approximately USD 0.3 billion of borrowings under a number of local bilateral facilities in di/fferent countries, with the largest share of borrowings in Japan, were raised. This resulted in a total gross debt of USD 3.5 billion. These outstanding borrowings of the Alcon legal entities were recorded in the balance sheet and financing cash flow from discontinued operations. Prior to the spin-o/ff, through a series of intercompany transactions, Alcon legal entities paid approximately USD 3.1 billion in cash to Novartis and its a/ffiliates.\n\nAt the April 8, 2019 Distribution, the fair value of the distribution liability of the Alcon business amounted to USD 23.4 billion, a decrease of USD 3.0 billion from March 31, 2019. As mentioned above, prior to the spino/ff, through a series of intercompany transactions, Alcon legal entities incurred additional net financial debt and paid approximately USD 3.1 billion in cash to Novartis and its a/ffiliates. This additional net debt and transactions resulted in a decrease in Alcon's net assets to USD 20.0 billion at the date of the Distribution of the dividend in kind to Novartis AG shareholders on April 8, 2019. The distribution liability at April 8, 2019, remained in excess of the then-carrying value of the Alcon business net assets.\n\nCertain consolidated foundations own Novartis AG dividend-bearing shares restricting their availability for use  by  the  Group.  These  Novartis  AG  shares  are accounted for as treasury shares. Through the Distribution, these foundations received Alcon Inc. shares representing an approximate 4.7% equity interest in Alcon Inc. Upon the loss of control of Alcon Inc. through the Distribution, the financial investment in Alcon Inc. was recognized at its fair value based on the opening traded share price of Alcon Inc. on April 9, 2019 (a Level 1 hierarchy valuation). At initial recognition, its fair value of USD 1.3 billion was reported on the Group's consolidated balance sheet as a financial asset. Management has designated this investment at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nThe total non-taxable, non-cash gain recognized at the distribution date of the spin-o/ff of the Alcon business amounted to USD 4.7 billion consisting of:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                               | April /eight.tab, /two.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/nine.tab     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Net assets derecognized                                                      | - /two.tab/zero.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/five.tab  |\n| Derecognition of distribution liability                                      | /two.tab/three.tab/space.tab/four.tab/three.tab/four.tab |\n| Di/fference between net assets and distribution liability                    | /three.tab/space.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/nine.tab          |\n| Recognition of Alcon Inc. shares obtained   through consolidated foundations | /one.tab/space.tab/two.tab/seven.tab/three.tab           |\n| Currency translation gains recycled into   the consolidated income statement | /one.tab/two.tab/three.tab                               |\n| Transaction costs recognized in the   consolidated income statement          | - /one.tab/one.tab/four.tab                              |\n| Gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to   Novartis AG shareholders             | /four.tab/space.tab/six.tab/nine.tab/one.tab             |\n\nFor additional disclosures on discontinued operations, refer to Note 30.",

The acquisition gave Novartis full rights to IFM Tre, Inc.'s portfolio of NLRP3 antagonists. The NLRP3 antagonists portfolio consisted of one clinical program and two preclinical programs: IFM-2427, a first-in-class, clinical-stage systemic antagonist for an array of chronic inflammatory disorders, including atherosclerosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); a preclinical-stage gut-directed molecule for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; and a preclinical-stage central nervous system (CNS)-penetrant molecule.\n\nThe previously held interest of 9% was adjusted to its fair value of USD 33 million through the consolidated income statement at acquisition date. This remeasurement resulted in a gain of USD 14 million. The fair value of the total purchase consideration for acquiring the 91% stake Novartis did not already own amounted to USD 361 million. The amount consisted of an initial cash payment of USD 285 million, and the fair value of the contingent consideration of USD 76 million due to the IFM Tre, Inc. shareholders, which they are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified development and commercialization milestones.

The transaction bolstered the Novartis front-of-the-eye portfolio and ophthalmic leadership. The transaction closed on July 1, 2019. The purchase price consisted of a USD 3.4 billion upfront payment, customary purchase price adjustments of USD 0.1 billion, and the potential milestone payments of up to USD 1.9 billion, which Takeda is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified commercialization milestones.\n\nThe fair value of the total purchase consideration was USD 3.7 billion. The amount consisted of an initial cash payment of USD 3.5 billion, and the fair value of the contingent consideration of USD 0.2 billion, which Takeda is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified commercialization milestones.\n\nThe purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of approximately USD 3.6 billion, consisting mainly of intangible assets of USD 3.6 billion, and goodwill amounted to approximately USD 0.1 billion. In 2019, from the date of acquisition, the business generated net sales of USD 0.2 billion. Management estimated that net sales for the entire year of 2019 would have amounted to USD 0.3 billion, had the business been acquired at the beginning of the 2019 reporting period.\n\nThe 2019 results of operations since the date of acquisition were not material.\n\n## 3. Segmentation of key figures 2021, 2020 and 2019\n\nThe businesses of Novartis are divided operationally on a worldwide basis into two identified reporting segments: Innovative Medicines and Sandoz. In addition, we separately report Corporate activities.\n\nReporting segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the chief operating decision-maker, which is the Executive Committee of Novartis. The reporting segments are  managed separately because they each research, develop, manufacture, distribute and sell distinct products that require differing marketing strategies.\n\nThe Executive Committee of Novartis is responsible for allocating resources and assessing the performance of the reporting segments.\n\nThe reporting segments are as follows:\n\nInnovative Medicines researches, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells patented prescription medicines. The Innovative Medicines Division is organized into two global business units: Novartis Oncology and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Novartis Oncology consists of the global business franchises Hematology and Solid Tumor, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals consists of the global business franchises Immunology, Hepatology\n\nand Dermatology; Neuroscience; Ophthalmology; Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism; Respiratory and Allergy; and Established Medicines.\n\nSandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished dosage form medicines as well as intermediary products including active pharmaceutical ingredients. Sandoz is organized globally into three franchises: Retail Generics, Anti-Infectives and Biopharmaceuticals. In Retail Generics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets active ingredients and finished dosage forms of small molecule pharmaceuticals to third parties across a broad range of therapeutic areas, as well as finished dosage form of anti-infectives sold to third parties. In Anti-Infectives, Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third-party customers. In Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets protein- or other biotechnology-based products, including biosimilars, and provides biotechnology manufacturing services to other companies.\n\nIncome and expenses relating to Corporate include the costs of the Group headquarters and those of cor-",

In addition, Corporate includes other items of income and expense that are not attributable to specific segments, such as certain revenues from intellectual property rights, certain expenses related to post-employment benefits, environmental remediation liabilities, charitable activities, donations and sponsorships. Usually, no allocation of Corporate items is made to the segments. As a result, Corporate assets and liabilities principally consist of net debt (cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities less financial debts), investments in associated companies, and current and deferred taxes and non-segment-specific environmental remediation and post-employment benefit liabilities.\n\nOur divisions are supported by the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical  Research,  Global  Drug  Development, Novartis Technical Operations and Customer & Technology Solutions (formerly named Novartis Business Services).\n\n- \u00b7 The Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR) conducts  research  activities  for  the  Innovative Medicines Division and also collaborates with Sandoz.\n- \u00b7  The Global Drug Development organization oversees all  drug  development  activities  for  our  Innovative Medicines Division and collaborates with our Sandoz Division on the development of its biosimilars portfolio.\n- \u00b7  The Novartis Technical Operations organization manages  our  manufacturing  operations  across  our Innovative  Medicines and Sandoz Divisions.\n- \u00b7 Customer & Technology Solutions (CTS), formerly named Novartis Business Services, is our shared services organization that delivers business support ser-\n\nces across the Group, such as information technology, real estate and facility services, procurement, product lifecycle services, talent and people solutions, financial reporting and accounting operations, and communication and engagement.\n\nFollowing the February 28, 2019, shareholders' approval of the spin-o/ff of the Alcon business (refer to Notes 1, 2 and 30 for further details), the Group reported its consolidated financial statements as 'continuing operations' and 'discontinued operations.'\n\nContinuing operations comprise the activities of the Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divisions, and the continuing Corporate activities.\n\nDiscontinued operations included the operational results from the Alcon eye care devices business and certain corporate activities attributable to the Alcon business prior to the spin-o/ff, the gain on distribution of Alcon Inc. to Novartis AG shareholders, and certain other expenses related to the Distribution (refer to Notes 1, 2 and 30 for further details).\n\nThe accounting policies mentioned in Note 1 are used in the reporting of segment results. Inter-segmental sales are made at amounts that are considered to approximate arm's length transactions. The Executive Committee of Novartis evaluates segmental performance and allocates resources among the segments based on a number of measures, including net sales, operating income and net operating assets. Segment net operating assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment; rightof-use assets; intangible assets; goodwill; inventories; and trade and other operating receivables less operating liabilities.",

As a result, Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021.\n\nThe divestment transaction closed on December 6, 2021, and Novartis realized a gain of USD 14.6 billion, recorded in income from associated companies. See Note 2.\n\nThe Group's holding in Roche voting shares was 33.3% at December 31, 2020 and 2019. This investment represented approximately 6.2% of Roche's total outstanding voting and non-voting equity instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nSince full-year financial data for Roche is not available when Novartis produces its consolidated financial results, a survey of analyst estimates is used to estimate the Group's share of Roche's net income. Any di/fferences between  these  estimates  and  actual  results  were adjusted in the Group's consolidated financial statements when available. As Novartis discontinued the use of equity method accounting starting from November 3, 2021, and the divestment closed on December 6, 2021, no such adjustment will be made to the 2022 Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe following tables show summarized financial information for Roche, including current values of fair value adjustments made at the time of the acquisition of the",

extension options, excluded from the measurement of lease liabilities. The Group's most material lease with a lease term extension, representing a lease liability value of USD 0.6 billion (2020: USD 0.6 billion), has a determined lease term end date of 2071 (2020: 2071). Non-enforceable extension options of up to 10 years have not been included within the measurement of this lease liability, and do not have a material impact to the carrying value of the lease for both 2021 and 2020. Should the landlord agree to a lease extension, rent will be referenced to the market rates as at the commencement of the extension period. There were no significant sale and leaseback transactions in 2021 or 2020.\n\nIn 2019, the Group completed sale and leaseback transactions for certain property, plant and equipment as part of its plans to consolidate sites. Transactions resulted in net cash inflows of USD 0.7 billion and the recognition of USD 96 million of lease liabilities, and USD 37 million of right-of-use assets. The right-of-use assets value reflects the proportion of the property, plant and equipment retained for a period of one to five years, with two five-year extension periods for certain right-of-use\n\nassets. The liabilities reflect the net present value of future lease payments. The net gain on the sale and leaseback transactions amounted to USD 478 million.\n\nThe following table provides additional disclosures related to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                                       | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | 2020                          | 2019                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities  /one.tab                                                                      | /six.tab/two.tab                    | /six.tab/seven.tab            | /six.tab/six.tab              |\n| Expense on short-term leases                                                                                         | /six.tab                            | /four.tab                     | /seven.tab                    |\n| Expense on low-value leases                                                                                          | /seven.tab                          | /seven.tab                    | /eight.tab                    |\n| Total cash outflows for leases                                                                                       | /three.tab/eight.tab/one.tab        | /three.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab | /three.tab/three.tab/nine.tab |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Thereof:                                                                                     |                                     |                               |                               |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Cash outflows for short-term leases   /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0and low-value leases  /two.tab | /one.tab/three.tab                  | /one.tab/one.tab              | /one.tab/five.tab             |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Payments of interest  /three.tab                                                             | /five.tab/two.tab                   | /five.tab/six.tab             | /five.tab/one.tab             |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Payments of lease liabilities  /four.tab                                                     | /three.tab/one.tab/six.tab          | /three.tab/one.tab/two.tab    | /two.tab/seven.tab/three.tab  |",

        "page_content": "/uni00A0 The December 31, 2020, presentation of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheet has been adjusted. This adjustment was made to conform with the December 31, 2021, presentation to o/ffset all deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets within the same tax jurisdiction and when a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax assets against current tax liabilities exists.\n\nIn the December 31, 2020, consolidated balance sheet, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets were presented on gross basis and not fully netted as required for presentation in the consolidated balance sheet, because only certain portions of deferred tax amounts were o/ffset.\n\nThe correction resulted in a decrease in the previously reported December 31, 2020, deferred tax liabilities, total non-current liabilities, total liabilities, and total equity and liabilities by USD 4.3 billion and a corresponding USD 4.3 billion decrease in deferred tax assets, total non-current assets, and total assets. The correction resulted only in the net presentation of these deferred tax amounts in the consolidated balance sheet, with no impact to the consolidated income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows, and management concluded the item was not material to the previously issued consolidated financial statements.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as the Group has the ability to control any future reversal and the unremitted earnings are retained in the foreign subsidiaries for reinvestment. The total unremitted earnings retained for reinvestment in the Group's foreign subsidiaries that would be subject to withholding tax or other taxes if remitted to the Group are estimated at approximately USD 29 billion in 2021 (2020: USD 27 billion).\n\nThe gross value of tax-loss carry-forwards that have or have not been capitalized as deferred tax assets, with their expiry dates, is as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)        | Not capitalized                                 | Capitalized                                    | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab total         |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| One year              | /one.tab/five.tab                               | /four.tab                                      | /one.tab/nine.tab                               |\n| Two years             | /one.tab/four.tab                               | /six.tab                                       | /two.tab/zero.tab                               |\n| Three years           | /three.tab/seven.tab                            | /one.tab/zero.tab                              | /four.tab/seven.tab                             |\n| Four years            | /two.tab/six.tab                                | /one.tab/one.tab                               | /three.tab/seven.tab                            |\n| Five years            | /one.tab/four.tab/six.tab                       | /two.tab/zero.tab                              | /one.tab/six.tab/six.tab                        |\n| More than five years  | /three.tab/space.tab/five.tab/three.tab/six.tab | /one.tab/space.tab/eight.tab/seven.tab/two.tab | /five.tab/space.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab |\n| Not subject to expiry | /four.tab/one.tab/eight.tab                     | /six.tab/eight.tab/four.tab                    | /one.tab/space.tab/one.tab/zero.tab/two.tab     |\n| Total                 | /four.tab/space.tab/one.tab/nine.tab/two.tab    | /two.tab/space.tab/six.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab  | /six.tab/space.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab/nine.tab  |\n\n| (USD millions)                 | Not capitalized                                   | Capitalized                                    | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab total       |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| One year                       | /two.tab/zero.tab                                 |                                                | /two.tab/zero.tab                              |\n| Two years                      | /one.tab                                          | /five.tab                                      | /six.tab                                       |\n| Three years                    | /two.tab                                          | /six.tab                                       | /eight.tab                                     |\n| Four years                     | /two.tab/three.tab                                |                                                | /two.tab/three.tab                             |\n| Five years                     | /one.tab/one.tab                                  | /four.tab/zero.tab                             | /five.tab/one.tab                              |\n| More than five years  /one.tab | /three.tab/space.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab   | /two.tab/space.tab/two.tab/nine.tab/one.tab    | /five.tab/space.tab/six.tab/nine.tab/one.tab   |\n| Not subject to expiry          | /three.tab/two.tab/three.tab                      | /six.tab/eight.tab/three.tab                   | /one.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/six.tab   |\n| Total                          | /three.tab/space.tab/seven.tab/eight.tab/zero.tab | /three.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/five.tab | /six.tab/space.tab/eight.tab/zero.tab/five.tab |\n\n| (USD millions)                            | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/nine.tab   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Tax losses carried forward   that expired | /one.tab/eight.tab                  | /one.tab/four.tab                    | /nine.tab                            |\n\nDeferred tax assets related to taxable losses of relevant Group entities are recognized to the extent it is considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which such losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Basel-Stadt cantonal tax reform was approved by voters in February 2019, with parts of the reform retroactively enacted per January 1, 2019. The newly enacted tax rate resulted in a decrease of the blended cantonal and federal tax rate from 22% to 13%. This change impacted the Group's Basel-Stadt-domiciled operating subsidiaries.\n\nThe Swiss federal tax reform was approved by voters in May 2019. The enactment of the Swiss federal tax reform required the abolishment of the holding company tax regimes as of January 1, 2020. As a result, the holding company tax rate increased from the current 8% to 13%, e/ffective January 1, 2020.\n\nThe enactment of these Swiss tax reforms required a revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities to the newly enacted tax rates at the date of enactment.\n\nThe following table shows the impact on the revaluation of deferred assets and liabilities in 2019, as at the respective dates of the enactment of the Swiss tax reforms:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                                        | Income  statement continuing operations   | Equity                          | Total                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Deferred tax asset   and liability revaluation                                                                        |                                           |                                 |                                 |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Items previously recognized   /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0in consolidated income statement        | /two.tab/three.tab/four.tab               |                                 | /two.tab/three.tab/four.tab     |\n| /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0Items previously recognized   /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0in other comprehensive income  /one.tab |                                           | - /three.tab/five.tab/eight.tab | - /three.tab/five.tab/eight.tab |\n| Total revaluation of deferred   tax assets and liabilities                                                            | /two.tab/three.tab/four.tab               | - /three.tab/five.tab/eight.tab | - /one.tab/two.tab/four.tab     |",

Novartis continues to monitor sovereign debt issues and economic conditions in the countries in which it operates, particularly in Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Turkey, and evaluates trade receivables in these countries for potential collection risks. The majority of the outstanding trade receivables from Portugal, Spain and Greece are due directly from local governments or from government-funded entities. Deteriorating credit and economic conditions as well as other factors  in  these  closely  monitored  countries  have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect these\n\ntrade receivables, and may require the Group to re-evaluate the expected credit loss amount of these trade receivables in future periods.\n\nThe following table shows the gross trade receivables balance from these closely monitored countries at December 31, 2021 and 2020; the amounts that are past due for more than one year; and the related provisions for doubtful trade receivables that have been recorded:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                               | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab              | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Total balance of gross trade  receivables from closely   monitored countries | /one.tab/space.tab/three.tab/three.tab/six.tab | /one.tab/space.tab/five.tab/zero.tab/five.tab |\n| Past due for more than one year                                              | /two.tab/seven.tab                             | /five.tab/five.tab                            |\n| Provisions for doubtful   trade receivables                                  | /two.tab/four.tab                              | /two.tab/seven.tab                            |\n\nAt December 31, 2021, amounts past due for more than one year are not significant in any of these countries on a standalone basis.\n\nTotal trade receivables include amounts denominated in the  following major currencies:\n\n| (USD millions)               | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab             |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| US dollar (USD)              | /three.tab/space.tab/three.tab/four.tab/four.tab | /three.tab/space.tab/three.tab/one.tab/one.tab |\n| Euro (EUR)                   | /one.tab/space.tab/four.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab   | /one.tab/space.tab/six.tab/six.tab/eight.tab   |\n| Russian ruble (RUB)          | /four.tab/seven.tab/three.tab                    | /two.tab/eight.tab/eight.tab                   |\n| Japanese yen (JPY)           | /three.tab/eight.tab/three.tab                   | /four.tab/three.tab/seven.tab                  |\n| British pound (GBP)          | /two.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab                       | /one.tab/nine.tab/one.tab                      |\n| Chinese yuan (CNY)           | /one.tab/nine.tab/seven.tab                      | /two.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab                    |\n| Australian dollar (AUD)      | /one.tab/three.tab/nine.tab                      | /one.tab/five.tab/three.tab                    |\n| Canadian dollar (CAD)        | /one.tab/three.tab/nine.tab                      | /one.tab/two.tab/five.tab                      |\n| Brazilian real (BRL)         | /one.tab/two.tab/nine.tab                        | /one.tab/four.tab/eight.tab                    |\n| Swiss franc (CHF)            | /one.tab/zero.tab/six.tab                        | /one.tab/two.tab/four.tab                      |\n| Other currencies             | /one.tab/space.tab/four.tab/eight.tab/seven.tab  | /one.tab/space.tab/five.tab/six.tab/four.tab   |\n| Total trade receivables, net | /eight.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/five.tab  | /eight.tab/space.tab/two.tab/one.tab/seven.tab |",

The provisions are reassessed on a yearly basis and adjusted as necessary.\n\nIn the United States, Novartis has been named under federal legislation (the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in respect of certain sites. Novartis actively participates in, or monitors, the cleanup activities at the sites in which it is a PRP. The provision takes into consideration the number of other PRPs at each site as well as the identity and financial position of such parties in light of the joint and several nature of the liability.\n\nThe expected timing of the related cash outflows as of December 31, 2021, is currently projected as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                | Expected  cash outflows     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Due within two years                                          | /nine.tab/four.tab          |\n| Due later than two years, but within five years               | /one.tab/nine.tab/nine.tab  |\n| Due later than five years, but within /one.tab/zero.tab years | /two.tab/seven.tab/five.tab |\n| Due after /one.tab/zero.tab years                             | /four.tab/eight.tab         |\n| Total environmental remediation liability provisions          | /six.tab/one.tab/six.tab    |\n\n## Provisions for product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters\n\nNovartis has established provisions for certain product liabilities, governmental investigations and other legal matters where a potential cash outflow is probable and Novartis can make a reliable estimate of the amount of the outflow. These provisions represent the Group's current best estimate of the total financial e/ffect for the matters described below and for other less significant mat-\n\nters. Potential cash outflows reflected in a provision might be fully or partially o/ffset by insurance in certain circumstances.\n\nNovartis has not established provisions for potential damage awards for certain additional legal claims against its subsidiaries if Novartis currently believes that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated. In total, these not-provisioned-for matters include more than 3 000 individual product liability cases and certain other legal matters. Plainti/ffs' alleged claims in these matters, which Novartis does not believe to be entirely remote but which do not fulfill the conditions for the establishment of provisions, currently aggregate to, according to the current best belief of Novartis, approximately USD/uni00A00.5 billion. In addition, in some of these matters there are claims for punitive or multiple (treble) damages, civil penalties and disgorgement of profits that in the view of Novartis are either wholly or partially unspecified, or wholly or partially unquantifiable at present; the Group believes that information about these amounts claimed by plainti/ffs generally is not meaningful for purposes of determining a reliable estimate of a loss that is probable or more than remote.\n\nA number of other legal matters are in such early stages or the issues presented are such that the Group has not made any provisions since it cannot currently estimate either a potential outcome or the amount of any potential losses. For these reasons, among others, the Group generally is unable to make a reliable estimate of possible loss with respect to such cases. It is therefore not practicable to provide information about the potential financial impact of those cases.\n\nThere might also be cases for which the Group was able to make a reliable estimate of the possible loss or the range of possible loss, but the Group believes that publication of such information on a case-by-case basis would seriously prejudice the Group's position in ongoing legal proceedings or in any related settlement discussions. Accordingly, in such cases, information has been disclosed with respect to the nature of the contingency, but no disclosure is provided as to an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss.\n\nNote 28 contains additional information on contingencies.\n\n## Summary of significant legal proceedings\n\nThe following is a summary of significant legal proceedings to which Novartis or its subsidiaries are currently a party, or were a party and that concluded in 2021.\n\n## Investigations and related litigations Southern District of New York (S.D.N.Y.) Gilenya marketing practices investigation and litigation\n\nIn 2013, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NPC) received a civil investigative demand from the United States Attorney's O/ffice (USAO) for the S.D.N.Y. requesting the production of documents and information relating to marketing practices for Gilenya , including the remuneration of healthcare providers in connection therewith. In 2017, the S.D.N.Y. and New York State declined to intervene in claims raised by an individual",

        "page_content": "relator in a qui tam complaint, which continue to be vigorously contested.\n\n## Government generic pricing antitrust investigations, antitrust class actions\n\nSince 2016, Sandoz Inc. has received a grand jury subpoena and a civil investigative demand and interrogatories from the Antitrust and Civil Divisions of the US Department of Justice (DOJ), and a subpoena and interrogatories from the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut in connection with those agencies' investigations into alleged price fixing and market allocation of generic drugs in the United States as well as alleged federal False Claims Act (FCA) violations. In 2020, Sandoz Inc. reached a resolution with the DOJ Antitrust Division, pursuant to which Sandoz Inc. paid USD 195 million and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. The Sandoz Inc. resolution related to instances of misconduct at the company between 2013 and 2015 with regard to certain generic drugs sold in the United States. Under the terms of that agreement, Sandoz Inc. will continue to  take  steps  to  enhance  its  compliance  program, employee training and monitoring, and will continue to cooperate with the US government's ongoing investigation into the generic pharmaceutical industry. Sandoz Inc. also finalized a resolution with the DOJ Civil Division and in 2021 paid USD 185 million plus interest from the date of the agreement in principle, to settle related claims arising under the FCA, and entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the O/ffice of Inspector General (OIG) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This resolution with the DOJ resolves all federal government matters related to price fixing allegations.\n\nSince the third quarter of 2016, Sandoz Inc. and Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. have been sued alongside other generic pharmaceutical companies in numerous individual and putative class action complaints by direct and indirect private purchasers and by 54 US states and territories, represented by their respective Attorneys General. Plainti/ffs claim that defendants, including Sandoz Inc., engaged in price fixing and market allocation of generic drugs in the United States, and seek damages and injunctive relief. The litigation includes complaints alleging product-specific conspiracies, as well as complaints alleging the existence of an overarching industry conspiracy, and assert claims for damages and penalties under federal and state antitrust and consumer protection acts. The cases have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court (USDC) for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Lucentis/Avastin \u00ae matters\n\nIn connection with an investigation into whether Novartis entities, F. Ho/ffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech Inc. and Roche S.p.A. colluded to artificially preserve the market positions of Avastin \u00ae and Lucentis , in 2014 the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) imposed a fine equivalent to USD 125 million on the Novartis entities. Novartis paid the fine, subject to the right to later claim recoupment, and appealed before the Consiglio di Stato (CdS). In 2014 and 2015, the Italian Ministry of Health and the Lombardia region sent letters with payment requests for a total\n\nequivalent of approximately USD/uni00A01.3 billion in damages from Novartis and Roche entities based on these allegations. In 2019, the CdS upheld the ICA decision and fine. Following that CdS decision, several additional Italian regions and hospitals sent letters claiming damages for an aggregate amount of approximately USD 330 million. None of these claims have been asserted in legal proceedings and no further letters have been sent since. Novartis continues to appeal the CdS decision. In 2019, the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a Statement of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging anti-competitive practices on the French market for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for wet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to 2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the Novartis entities had infringed competition law by abusing a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine, again subject to recoupment, and is appealing the FCA's decision. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all claims in Italy and France. Novartis is also challenging policies and regulations allowing o/ff-label/unlicensed use and reimbursement for economic reasons in various countries, including Italy and Turkey.\n\n## South Korea investigation\n\nIn 2016, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation into, among other things, allegations that Novartis Korea utilized medical journals to provide inappropriate economic benefits to healthcare professionals (HCPs). This resulted in a non-material fine, which the prosecutor appealed. In 2021, the appellate court upheld the fine, and the prosecutor has appealed that decision.\n\n## Greece investigation\n\nNovartis is providing information to the Greek authorities investigating allegations of potentially inappropriate economic benefits to HCPs, government o/fficials and others in Greece. These authorities include the Greek Coordinating Body for Inspection and Control, and the Greek Body of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), from which the Company received a summons in 2018 and 2020. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine equivalent  to  approximately  USD  1.2  million,  which Novartis Hellas has appealed.\n\n## 340B Drug Pricing Program investigation\n\nIn 2021, NPC received a civil investigative subpoena from the O/ffice of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont. The subpoena requested the production of documents and information concerning NPC's participation in the 340B Drug Pricing Program in Vermont. NPC provided documents and information to the O/ffice of the Attorney General. Also in 2021, NPC received a notification from the US Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) stating that HRSA believes NPC's contract pharmacy policy, which was revised in 2020 to establish a geographic limitation on contract pharmacy eligibility,  but  maintained  eligibility  for  pharmacies located within a 40-mile radius of the parent 340B hospital, violates the 340B statute. HRSA also threatened an enforcement action. NPC believes its policy is consistent with the 340B program's original intent to sup-",

Accordingly, NPC sued HRSA in the USDC for the District of Columbia to challenge HRSA's determination and to enjoin HRSA from taking action with respect to NPC's contract pharmacy policy. HRSA then referred the matter regarding NPC's contract pharmacy policy to OIG, which could result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties on NPC. In November 2021, the USDC issued a decision rejecting HRSA's interpretation of the 340B statute, vacated the violation notification and remanded the matter to HRSA. HRSA has filed an appeal.\n\n## Entresto matter\n\nIn 2021, NPC received a civil investigative demand from the DOJ seeking information from 2016 to the present regarding the marketing and pricing of Entresto , including remuneration provided to HCPs. NPC is cooperating with the DOJ's inquiry.\n\n## Antitrust class actions Exforge\n\nSince 2018, Novartis Group companies as well as other pharmaceutical companies have been sued by various direct and indirect purchasers of Exforge in multiple US individual and putative class action complaints. They claim that Novartis made a reverse payment in the form of an agreement not to launch an authorized generic, alleging violations of federal antitrust law and state antitrust, consumer protection and common laws, and seeking damages as well as injunctive relief. The cases have been consolidated in the S.D.N.Y. and the claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Product liability litigation Reclast\n\nNPC is a defendant in more than 20 US product liability actions involving Reclast and alleging atypical femur fracture injuries, all of which are in New Jersey state or federal court and in California state court, coordinated with claims against other bisphosphonate manufacturers. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Taxotere \u00ae (docetaxel)\n\nSandoz is a defendant in more than 3 000 US product liability  actions  involving  Taxotere \u00ae (docetaxel),  an oncology product, many of which have been transferred to a multidistrict litigation in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The complaints allege misleading marketing and that Sanofi, as innovator, and several 505(b)(2) NDA holders (including Sandoz) failed to warn of the risk of permanent alopecia/hair loss. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Amiodarone\n\nSandoz entities are named in more than five individual and multi-plainti/ff US product liability cases involving amiodarone, a cardiac drug indicated to treat life-threatening arrhythmias that have not responded to other treatment. The complaints allege failure to warn, o/ff-label pro-\n\nmotion, and failure to include medication guides to pharmacies. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Sartans and ranitidine\n\nSince 2018, claims have been brought against Sandoz and other pharmaceutical companies alleging injury from carcinogenic impurities found in valsartan and valsartan/ HCT film-coated tablets and/or losartan marketed or manufactured by Sandoz. These claims include several putative class actions in Canada. Claims have also been brought alleging injury from carcinogenic impurities in ranitidine-containing  medicines.  These  claims  also include several putative class actions in Canada and a multidistrict litigation in Florida. All of these claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Tasigna\n\nNPC is a defendant in more than 300 US product liability actions involving Tasigna , alleging that the product caused various cardiovascular e/ffects and that NPC failed to provide adequate warnings about those alleged side e/ffects. State court actions are pending in a multicounty litigation in Bergen County, New Jersey, and federal cases are pending in a multidistrict litigation in the Middle District of Florida. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\nOther matters\n\n## Average Wholesale Price (AWP) litigation\n\nLawsuits have been brought, the latest in February 2016, by various US state governmental entities and private parties  against  various  pharmaceutical  companies, including NPC, alleging that they fraudulently overstated the AWP that is or has been used by payers, including state Medicaid agencies, to calculate reimbursements to healthcare providers. NPC remains a defendant in a putative class action brought by private payers in New Jersey, and vigorously contests those claims.\n\n## Shareholder derivative lawsuit\n\nIn 2021, NPC, Sandoz Inc., Novartis Capital Corporation and certain present and former directors and o/fficers of Novartis were named as defendants, and Novartis was named as a nominal defendant, in a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit filed in New York state court. The plainti/ffs, derivatively as purported Novartis shareholders on behalf of Novartis, seek damages and other remedies based on alleged conduct by the corporate and individual defendants. The claims are being vigorously contested.\n\n## Concluded legal matters Japan investigation\n\nIn 2015, a trial started against a former Novartis Pharma K.K. (NPKK) employee, and also against NPKK under the dual liability concept in Japanese law, over allegations brought by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor O/ffice for alleged manipulation of data in sub-analysis publications of the Kyoto Heart Study regarding valsartan.

        "page_content": "charges against NPKK were subject to a maximum total fine of JPY 4 million. In 2018, the Tokyo High Court upheld a not-guilty ruling of the Tokyo District Court in 2017 for both the former NPKK employee and NPKK, and that ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan. In 2021, the Supreme Court issued its decision dismissing the prosecutors' appeal and upholding the Tokyo District Court's not-guilty ruling. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## Aimovig-Amgen dispute\n\nIn 2015 and 2017, Novartis and Amgen entered into agreements regarding the development and commercialization of Aimovig , which the companies co-commercialized in the US and to which Novartis has exclusive rights in all territories outside the US, excluding Japan. Amgen issued a termination notice in April 2019 based on an alleged material breach of the collaboration agreements, and this notice, as well as other ancillary matters, were the subject of legal proceedings between Novartis and Amgen. Novartis disputed Amgen's allegations vigorously. In 2020, the court ruled that Amgen did not have grounds to terminate the 2017 agreement and dismissed that portion of their lawsuit. In 2022, the parties reached a confidential agreement to settle all remaining claims in the litigation. Novartis returned its Aimovig US rights to Amgen,  which  is  now  exclusively  commercializing Aimovig in the US. Novartis will continue to commercialize Aimovig in the rest of the world, with the exception of Japan. This matter is now concluded.\n\n## Summary of product liability, governmental investigations and other legal matters provision movements\n\n| (USD millions)                                                                                                                         | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab               | /two.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/nine.tab            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| January /one.tab                                                                                                                       | /four.tab/eight.tab/seven.tab       | /one.tab/space.tab/three.tab/six.tab/nine.tab    | /three.tab/four.tab/zero.tab                  |\n| Provisions related to   discontinued operations  /one.tab                                                                              |                                     |                                                  | - /four.tab/two.tab                           |\n| Impact of acquisitions of businesses                                                                                                   |                                     | /one.tab/one.tab                                 | /one.tab/zero.tab                             |\n| Cash payments                                                                                                                          | - /two.tab/nine.tab/two.tab         | - /one.tab/space.tab/eight.tab/six.tab/three.tab | - /one.tab/one.tab/six.tab                    |\n| Releases of provisions                                                                                                                 | - /four.tab/four.tab                | - /three.tab/one.tab                             | - /five.tab/two.tab                           |\n| Additions to provisions                                                                                                                | /two.tab/five.tab/one.tab           | /one.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/eight.tab    | /one.tab/space.tab/two.tab/three.tab/zero.tab |\n| Currency translation e/ffects                                                                                                          | - /five.tab                         | - /one.tab/seven.tab                             | - /one.tab                                    |\n| December /three.tab/one.tab                                                                                                            | /three.tab/nine.tab/seven.tab       | /four.tab/eight.tab/seven.tab                    | /one.tab/space.tab/three.tab/six.tab/nine.tab |\n| Less current portion                                                                                                                   | - /five.tab/six.tab                 | - /three.tab/zero.tab/six.tab                    | - /one.tab/space.tab/one.tab/six.tab/nine.tab |\n| Non-current product   liabilities, governmental   investigations and other   legal matters provisions   at December /three.tab/one.tab | /three.tab/four.tab/one.tab         | /one.tab/eight.tab/one.tab                       | /two.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab                    |\n\n- 1 Notes 1, 2 and 30 provide information related to discontinued operations.\n\nNovartis believes that its total provisions for investigations, product liability, arbitration and other legal matters are adequate based upon currently available information.

        "page_content": "Note 2 details significant acquisitions of businesses, specifically, the acquisition of the cephalosporin antibiotics business from GSK in 2021; The Medicines Company and the Japanese business of AGI in 2020 and Xiidra and IFM Tre, Inc. in 2019. The goodwill arising out of these\n\nacquisitions is attributable to the buyer-specific synergies, the assembled workforce, and the accounting for deferred tax liabilities on the acquired assets. Goodwill of USD/uni00A0107 million in 2021 (2020: USD 74 million; 2019: USD 98 million) is tax deductible.\n\n## 25. Post-employment benefits for employees\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nIn addition to the legally required social security schemes, the Group has numerous independent pension and other post-employment benefit plans. In most cases, these plans are externally funded in entities that are legally separate from the Group. For certain Group companies, however, no independent plan assets exist for the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations of employees. In these cases, the related unfunded liability is included in the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations (DBOs) of all major pension and other post-employment benefit plans are reappraised annually by independent actuaries. Plan assets are recognized at fair value. The major plans are based in Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, which represent 95% of the Group's total DBO for pension plans. Details of the plans in the two most significant countries, Switzerland and the United States, which represent 80% of the Group's total DBO for post-employment benefit plans, are provided below.\n\nSwiss-based pension plans represent the most significant portion of the Group's total DBO and plan assets. For the active insured members born on or after January 1, 1956, or having joined the plans after December 31, 2010, the benefits are  partially linked to the contributions paid into the plan. Certain features of Swiss pension plans required by law preclude the plans from being categorized as defined contribution plans. These factors include a minimum interest guarantee on retirement savings accounts, a predetermined factor for converting the accumulated savings account balance into a pension, and embedded death and disability benefits.\n\nAll benefits granted under Swiss-based pension plans are vested, and Swiss legislation prescribes that the employer has to contribute a fixed percentage of an\n\nemployee's pay to an external pension fund. Additional employer contributions may be required whenever the plan's statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level. The employee also contributes to the plan. The pension plans are run by separate legal entities, each governed by a board of trustees that - for the principal plans - consists of representatives nominated by Novartis and the active insured employees. The boards of trustees are responsible for the plan design and asset investment strategy.\n\nIn December 2020, the Board of Trustees of the Novartis Swiss Pension Fund agreed to adjust the annuity conversion rate at retirement with e/ffect from January 1, 2022. This amendment does not a/ffect existing pensioners, and its impact on existing plan participants will be mitigated by way of defined compensatory measures. This amendment resulted in a net pre-tax curtailment gain of USD 101 million (CHF 90 million).\n\nThe United States pension plans represent the second-largest component of the Group's total DBO and plan assets. The principal plans (Qualified Plans) are funded, whereas plans providing additional benefits for executives (Restoration Plans) are unfunded. Employer contributions are required for Qualified Plans whenever the statutory funding ratio falls below a certain level.\n\nFurthermore, in certain countries, employees are covered under other post-employment benefit plans and post-retirement medical plans.\n\nIn the US, other post-employment benefit plans consist primarily of post-employment healthcare benefits, which have been closed to new members since 2015. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax e/fficient.",

statements. This can result in substantial changes in the Group's other comprehensive income, long-term liabilities and prepaid  pension assets.\n\nThe DBO is significantly impacted by assumptions regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuarially determined post-employment benefit liability. This rate is based on yields of high-quality  corporate bonds in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond yields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO increases and the funded status decreases.\n\nIn Switzerland, an increase in the DBO due to lower discount rates is slightly o/ffset by lower future benefits expected to be paid on the employee's savings account where the assumption on interest accrued changes in line with the  discount rate.\n\nThe impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan's assets is more di/fficult to predict. A significant part of the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore partially compensate for the decrease in the funded status. Furthermore, pension assets also include significant holdings of equity instruments. Share prices tend to rise when interest rates decrease and therefore often counteract the negative impact of the rising defined benefit",

Such pension increases also decrease the funded status, although there is no strong correlation between the value of the plan assets and pension/inflation increases.\n\nAssumptions regarding life expectancy significantly impact the DBO. An increase in longevity increases the DBO. There is no o/ffsetting impact from the plan assets, as no longevity bonds or swaps are held by the pension funds.

For the Novartis Top Leaders (NTLs), the Annual Incentive is paid 70% in cash and 30% in RSs or RSUs. Both the ECN and NTLs can opt to invest up to the maximum cash portion of their Annual Incentive to receive further RSs or RSUs. Any cash is paid out during February or March in the year following the end of the performance period, and the shares are granted during January in the year following the end of the performance period.\n\n## Share savings plans\n\nEmployees in certain countries and certain key executives worldwide are encouraged to invest their Annual Incentive in a share savings plan.\n\nUnder the share savings plan, participants may elect to receive their relevant compensation fully or partially in Novartis shares in lieu of cash. As a reward for their participation in the share savings plan, at no additional cost to the participant, Novartis matches their investments in shares after a holding period of three or five years.\n\nNovartis operates share savings plans for which employees may only participate in one of the share savings plans in any given year. The most significant are listed below:\n\n- \u00b7  In  Switzerland,  Employee  Share  Ownership  Plan (ESOP) participants may choose to receive their Annual Incentive (i) 100% in shares, (ii) 50% in shares and 50% in cash, or (iii) 100% in cash. After expiration of a threeyear holding period for Novartis shares invested under the ESOP, participants will receive one matching share for every two invested shares. Employees eligible for the equity plan 'Select' are not eligible to receive ESOP matching shares starting with the 2017 performance period.\n- \u00b7  The Leveraged Share Savings Plan (LSSP) was available to key executives for performance periods prior to 2016. At the participant's election, the Annual Incentive was awarded partly or entirely in shares. The elected number of shares is subject to a holding period\n\nof five years. At the end of the holding period, Novartis will match the invested shares at a ratio of 1-to-1 (i.e., one share awarded for each invested share). In the United States, both the LSSP award and the corresponding match are cash settled.\n\nThe Novartis Group CEO, the other Executive Committee members from 2014, and the NTLs from 2016 are not eligible to participate in the share savings plans.\n\n## Novartis equity plan 'Select'\n\nThe equity plan 'Select' is a global equity incentive plan under which eligible employees may annually be awarded a grant subject to a three-year, and for selected units a four-year, staggered vesting period. No awards are granted for performance ratings below a certain threshold. Executive Committee members and NTLs are not eligible to participate in the equity plan 'Select.'\n\nThe equity plan 'Select' currently allows participants in Switzerland to choose the form of their equity compensation in RSs or RSUs. In all other jurisdictions, RSs or RSUs are granted unilaterally. Until 2013, participants could also choose to receive part or the entire grant in the form of tradable share options.\n\nTradable share options expire on their 10 th anniversary from the grant date. Each tradable share option entitles the holder to purchase after vesting (and before the 10 th anniversary from the grant date) one Novartis share at a stated exercise price that equals the closing market price of the underlying share at the grant date. As the exercise price does not reflect the decrease in the Novartis share due to the Alcon spin, one-fifth of an Alcon share will also be awarded to the option holder upon exercise.\n\n## Options under Novartis equity plan 'Select' outside North America\n\nThe following table shows the activity associated with the share options during the period. The weighted average prices in the table below are translated from Swiss francs into USD at historical rates.\n\n|                                            | 2021                            | 2021                                    | 2020                             | 2020                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | Options (millions)              | Weighted average  exercise  price (USD) | Options   (millions)             | Weighted average  exercise  price (USD)  |\n| Options outstanding   at January /one.tab  | /two.tab/period.tab/six.tab     | /six.tab/two.tab/period.tab/zero.tab    | /three.tab/period.tab/four.tab   | /six.tab/zero.tab/period.tab/nine.tab    |\n| Sold or exercised                          | - /zero.tab/period.tab/nine.tab | /five.tab/eight.tab/period.tab/nine.tab | - /zero.tab/period.tab/eight.tab | /five.tab/seven.tab/period.tab/three.tab |\n| Outstanding at December /three.tab/one.tab | /one.tab/period.tab/seven.tab   | /six.tab/three.tab/period.tab/six.tab   | /two.tab/period.tab/six.tab      | /six.tab/two.tab/period.tab/zero.tab     |\n| Exercisable at December /three.tab/one.tab | /one.tab/period.tab/seven.tab   | /six.tab/three.tab/period.tab/six.tab   | /two.tab/period.tab/six.tab      | /six.tab/two.tab/period.tab/zero.tab     |\n\nAll share options were granted at an exercise price that was equal to the closing market price of the Group's shares at the grant date.

The actual payout depends on the achievement of the performance measures and ranges between 0% and 200% of the granted amount. PSUs granted under the LTPP do not carry voting rights, but do carry dividend equivalents that are paid in unrestricted Novartis shares at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe LTPP awards are subject to a three-year performance and vesting period. Until 2018, the performance\n\ncriteria were based on Novartis internal performance metrics. Starting in 2019, following the combination of the two LTPP and LTRPP, for new grants the performance criteria are based on both Novartis internal performance metrics and variables that can be observed in the market, which is the ranking of the Novartis total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year performance periods.\n\nTSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calculated as the change in the company share price, which is translated to USD at the relevant exchange rate, including the reinvestment return of dividends, over the threeyear performance period. The calculation is based on Bloomberg standard published TSR data, which is publicly available. The position of Novartis in the peer group determines the payout range based on a payout matrix.\n\n## Long-Term Relative Performance Plan\n\nThe LTRPP is an equity plan for the Novartis ECN and NTLs. The last grant under this plan was made in 2018. The LTRPP performance criteria are based on variables that can be observed in the market, which is the ranking of the Novartis TSR relative to a global healthcare peer group of 14 other companies, over rolling three-year performance periods. The TSR for Novartis and the peer companies is calculated as described in the LTPP section above.\n\n## Other share awards\n\nSelected employees may exceptionally receive Special Share Awards of RSs or RSUs. These Special Share Awards provide an opportunity to reward outstanding achievements or exceptional performance, and aim to retain key contributors. They are based on a formal internal selection process, through which the individual performance of each candidate is thoroughly assessed at several management levels. Special Share Awards have a minimum three-year vesting period. In exceptional circumstances, Special Share Awards may be awarded to attract  special  expertise  and  new  talents  to  the organization. Externally recruited ECN members are eligible only for special awards that are 'buyouts' in the case that it is to replace equity forfeited with their former employer. The equity is provided on a like-for-like basis as the forfeited equity, at the same value with the same vesting period, and with or without a performance condition.\n\nWorldwide, employees at di/fferent levels in the organization were awarded RSs and RSUs in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nIn addition, in 2021, 2020 and 2019, Board members received  unrestricted shares as part of their regular compensation.",

Transactions with related parties\n\n## Roche Holding AG\n\nNovartis has two agreements with Genentech, Inc., United States (Genentech), and one agreement with Spark Therapeutics, Inc., United States (Spark). Both companies  are   subsidiaries  of  Roche  Holding  AG (Roche), which were indirectly included in the consolidated financial statements using equity accounting until November 3, 2021, when Novartis entered into an agreement with Roche to divest its 33.3% of Roche voting shares. On December 6, 2021, Novartis divested its investment in Roche, on which date Roche ceased to be a related party (see Notes 2 and 4).\n\n## Lucentis\n\nNovartis has licensed from Genentech/Roche the exclusive rights to develop and  market Lucentis outside the United States for indications related to diseases of the eye. Novartis pays royalties on the net sales of Lucentis products outside the United States. From January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021, Lucentis sales of USD/uni00A02.0 billion (2020: USD/uni00A01.9 billion; 2019: USD/uni00A02.1 billion) were recognized by Novartis.\n\n## Xolair\n\nNovartis and Genentech/Roche are co-promoting Xolair in the United States, where Genentech/Roche records\n\nall sales. Novartis records sales  outside the United States.\n\nNovartis markets Xolair and records all sales and related costs outside the United States as well as co-promotion costs in the US. Genentech/Roche and Novartis share the resulting profits from sales in the United States, Europe and other countries, according to agreed profit-sharing  percentages.  From  January  1,  2021  until December 6, 2021, Novartis recognized total sales of Xolair of USD/uni00A0 1.3 billion (2020: USD/uni00A0 1.3 billion; 2019: USD/uni00A01.2 billion), including sales to Genentech/Roche for the United States market.\n\n## Luxturna\n\nIn 2018, Novartis entered into an exclusive licensing and commercialization agreement and a supply agreement with Spark for Luxturna outside the United States. The agreements include regulatory and sales milestones as well as royalties payable to Spark on ex-US sales. On December 17, 2019, Roche acquired Spark.\n\nThe net income for royalties, cost sharing and profit sharing arising out of the Lucentis , Xolair and Luxturna agreements with Roche totaled USD/uni00A0188 million from January 1, 2021 until December 6, 2021 (net income in 2020: USD/uni00A0217 million; net income in 2019: USD/uni00A0101 million).\n\nFurthermore, Novartis has several patent license, supply and distribution agreements with Roche.",

This increase in cash compensation is mainly attributable to ECN members who joined the ECN during 2019. As a result, 2019 represented only a portion of their annual compensation. Other compensation increased on account of higher social security payments on vested equity-based compensation.\n\nThe Annual Incentive award, which is fully included in equity- based compensation even when paid out in cash, is granted in January in the year following the reporting period.\n\nThe disclosures on Board and executive compensation required by the Swiss Code of Obligations and in\n\naccordance with the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Stock Exchange Listed Companies are shown in the Compensation Report of the Group.\n\n## Transactions with former members of the Board of Directors\n\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the following payments (or waivers of claims) were made to former Board members or to 'persons closely' linked to them:\n\n|            | Currency   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                      | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab                     | /two.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/nine.tab                     |\n|------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dr. Krauer | CHF        | /six.tab/zero.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab | /six.tab/zero.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab | /six.tab/zero.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab/zero.tab |\n\nDr. Alex Krauer, Honorary Chairman, was entitled to an amount of CHF/uni00A060 000 for annual periods from one AGM to the next. This amount was fixed in 1998 upon his departure from the Board in 1999, and has not been revised since that date.\n\n## 28. Commitments and contingencies\n\n## Research and development commitments\n\nThe Group has entered into long-term research and development agreements with various institutions related to intangible assets, which provide for potential milestone payments by Novartis. As of December 31, 2021, the Group's commitments to make payments under those agreements, and their  estimated timing, were as follows:\n\n| (USD millions)                      | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab                 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/two.tab   | /six.tab/zero.tab/two.tab                         |\n| /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/three.tab | /one.tab/space.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab/eight.tab   |\n| /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/four.tab  | /four.tab/seven.tab/two.tab                       |\n| /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/five.tab  | /six.tab/two.tab/nine.tab                         |\n| /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/six.tab   | /one.tab/one.tab/three.tab                        |\n| Thereafter                          | /three.tab/space.tab/eight.tab/three.tab/nine.tab |\n| Total                               | /six.tab/space.tab/seven.tab/four.tab/three.tab   |",

        "page_content": "## Commitments for capital calls\n\nThe Group holds investments in funds in which it has committed to invest further upon future capital calls. As of December 31, 2021, the total uncalled capital commitments for the Group's investments in funds amounts to USD 71 million. Note 29 contains further information on the Group's investments in funds.\n\n## Other commitments\n\nThe Group has entered into various purchase commitments for services and materials as well as for equipment in the ordinary course of business. These commitments are  generally entered into at  current market prices and reflect  normal business operations. For disclosure of property, plant and equipment purchase commitments, see Note 9.\n\n## Guarantees issued\n\nThe Group has issued guarantees to third parties in the ordinary course of business, mostly for tax, customs or other governmental agencies.\n\nIn addition, Novartis AG is guarantor of the Group's issued bonds, credit facilities and commercial paper programs.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nGroup companies have to observe the laws, government orders and regulations of the country in which they operate.\n\nA number of Novartis companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time, including proceedings regarding product liability; sales and marketing practices; commercial disputes; employment and wrongful discharge; and antitrust, securities, health and safety, environmental, tax, international trade, privacy and intellectual property matters. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that may not be covered by insurance and that could a/ffect our business, financial position and reputation. While Novartis does not believe that any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse e/ffect on its financial position, litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments sometimes occur. As a consequence, Novartis may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse e/ffect on its results of operations or cash flow.\n\nGovernments and regulatory authorities around the world have been stepping up their compliance and law enforcement activities in recent years in key areas, including marketing practices, pricing, corruption, trade restrictions, embargo legislation, insider trading, antitrust, cyber security and data privacy. Further, when one\n\ngovernment or regulatory authority undertakes an investigation, it is not uncommon for other governments or regulators to undertake investigations regarding the same or similar matters. Responding to such investigations is costly and requires an increasing amount of management's time and attention. In addition, such investigations  may  a/ffect  our  reputation,  create  a  risk  of potential exclusion from government reimbursement programs in the United States and other countries, and lead to (or arise from) litigation. These factors have contributed to decisions by Novartis and other  co mpanies in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest, to enter into settlement agreements with governmental authorities around the world prior to any formal decision by the authorities or a court. These government settlements have involved and may in the future involve large cash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other penalties, including treble damages. In addition, settlements of government healthcare fraud cases often require companies to enter into corporate integrity agreements, which are intended to regulate company behavior for a period of years. Our a/ffiliate Novartis Corporation is a party to such an agreement, which will expire in 2025. Also, matters underlying governmental investigations and settlements may be the subject of separate private litigation.\n\nWhile provisions have been made for probable losses, which management deems to be  reasonable or appropriate, there are uncertainties connected with these estimates.\n\nNote 20 contains additional information on these matters.\n\nA number of Group companies are involved in legal proceedings concerning intellectual property rights. The inherent unpredictability of such proceedings means that there can be no assurances as to their ultimate outcome. A negative result in any such proceeding could potentially adversely a/ffect the ability of certain Novartis companies to sell their products, or require the payment of substantial damages or royalties.\n\nIn the opinion of management, however, the outcome of these actions will not materially a/ffect the Group's financial position but could be material to the results of operations or cash flow in a given period.\n\nThe Group's potential environmental remediation liability is assessed based on a risk assessment and investigation of the various sites identified by the Group as at risk for environmental remediation exposure. The Group's future remediation expenses are a/ffected by a number of uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of material attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.\n\nNote 20 contains additional information on environmental liabilities.",

There are three hierarchical levels, based on increasing  subjectivity associated with the inputs to derive fair valuation for these assets and liabilities, which are as follows:\n\nThe assets carried at Level 1 fair value are equity and debt securities listed in active markets.\n\nThe assets generally included in Level 2 fair value hierarchy are foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives, and certain debt securities. Foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are valued using corroborated market data. The liabilities generally included in this fair value hierarchy consist of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives.\n\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability.

During 2021, there was a transfer of equity securities of USD 29 million from Level 1 to Level 3 due to de-listing (2020: nil).\n\nRealized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through the consolidated income statement are recorded in the consolidated income statement under 'Other income' or 'Other expense,' respectively. Realized gains and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are not recycled through the consolidated income statement but are instead reclassified to retained earnings.\n\nDuring the year, the net loss and net gain recorded on associated companies, fund investments and longterm financial investments at fair value through profit and loss were USD 173 million and USD 212 million, respectively.\n\nTo  determine  the  fair  value  of  a  contingent consideration, various unobservable inputs are used. A change in these inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The inputs used are, among others, the probability of success, sales forecast and assumptions regarding the discount rate and timing and di/fferent scenarios of triggering events. The inputs are  interrelated. The significance and usage of these inputs to each contingent consideration may vary due to di/fferences in the timing and triggering events for payments or in the nature of the asset related to the contingent consideration.\n\nIf the most significant parameters for the Level/uni00A03 input were to change by 10% positively or negatively, or where the probability of success (POS) is the most significant input parameter, 10% were added or deducted from the applied probability of success, for contingent consideration payables and contingent consideration receivables, this would change the amounts recorded in the 2021\n\nconsolidated income statement by USD/uni00A0246 million and USD/uni00A0198 million, respectively.\n\n## Equity securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nEquity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss. These are made up of individually non-significant investments. At December 31, 2021, the Group holds 60 nonlisted equity securities (December 31, 2020: 56) and 40 listed equity securities (December 31, 2020: 34) in this category with the following fair values:\n\n| (USD millions)               | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab            | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab         |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Listed equity securities     | /eight.tab/eight.tab/eight.tab               | /eight.tab/six.tab/two.tab                 |\n| Non-listed equity securities | /three.tab/zero.tab/seven.tab                | /two.tab/four.tab/nine.tab                 |\n| Total equity securities      | /one.tab/space.tab/one.tab/nine.tab/five.tab | /one.tab/space.tab/one.tab/one.tab/one.tab |\n\nDuring 2021, dividends received from these equity securities were insignificant (2020: nil). In 2021, in accordance with the consolidated foundations Alcon Inc. shares divestment plans, Alcon Inc. shares with a fair value of USD/uni00A09 million were sold (2020: USD 331 million), and the USD/uni00A01 million gain on disposal (2020: USD 13 million gain) was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings during 2021. In addition, in 2021, equity securities that were no longer considered strategic, with a fair value of USD/uni00A0254 million (2020: USD/uni00A0206 million), were sold, and the USD/uni00A0 211 million gain on disposal (2020: USD/uni00A0137 million gain) was transferred from other comprehensive income to retained earnings (see Note 8).",

        "page_content": "## Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk in general comprises currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, such as commodity and equity prices. Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and the market value of the investments. The Group actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures. It is the Group's policy and practice to enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the volatility of these exposures. It does not enter into any financial  transactions  containing  a  risk  that  cannot  be quantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In addition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or does not know it will have, in the future. The Group only sells existing assets or enters into transactions and future transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges) that it confidently expects it will have in the future, based on past experience.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n\nThe Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar and other currencies can have a significant e/ffect on both the Group's results of operations, including reported sales and earnings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly a/ffect the comparability of period-to-period results of operations.\n\nBecause our expenditures in Swiss francs are significantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, volatility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a significant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility can be di/fficult to predict.\n\nThere is also a risk that certain countries could devalue their currency. If this occurs, it could impact the e/ffective prices we would be able to charge for our products and also have an adverse impact on both our consolidated income statement and balance sheet.\n\nSubsidiaries whose functional currencies have experienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over the past three years apply the rules of IAS 29 'Financial  reporting  in  Hyperinflationary  Economies.'  The hyperinflationary economies in which Novartis operates are Argentina and Venezuela. Venezuela was hyperinflationary for all years presented, and Argentina became hyperinflationary e/ffective July 1, 2018, requiring retroactive implementation of hyperinflation accounting as of January 1, 2018. The impacts of applying IAS 29 were not significant in all years presented.\n\nThe Group manages its global currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where management deems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various contracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign currency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets, commitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also\n\nuses forward contracts and may enter into foreign currency option contracts to hedge.\n\nNet investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries are long-term investments. Their fair value changes through movements of foreign currency exchange rates. The Group has designated a certain portion of its longterm euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain of these net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. As of December 31, 2021, long-term financial debt with a carrying amount of EUR/uni00A01.8 billion (USD/uni00A02.1 billion; December 31, 2020: USD 2.3 billion), has been designated as a hedge instrument. During 2021, USD/uni00A0216 million of net of taxes unrealized income (unrealized loss in 2020: USD 201 million) was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in currency translation e/ffects in relation with this net investment hedge. The hedge remained e/ffective since inception, and no amount was recognized in the consolidated income statement in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Group has only a very limited exposure to price risk related to anticipated purchases of certain commodities used as raw materials by the Group's businesses. A change in those prices may alter the gross margin of a specific business, but generally by not more than 10% of the margin and thus below the Group's risk management tolerance levels. Accordingly, the Group does not enter into significant commodity futures, forward or option contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group addresses its net exposure to interest rate risk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial debt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it exchanges  periodic   payments  based  on  a  notional amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nThe Group may purchase equities as investments of its liquid funds. As a policy, it limits its holdings in an unrelated company to less than 5% of its liquid funds. Potential investments are thoroughly analyzed. Call options are written on equities that the Group owns, and put options are written on equities that the Group wants to buy and for which cash is available.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risks arise from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this risk, the Group periodically assesses country and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit limits, and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where appropriate.\n\nThe provisions for expected credit losses for customers are based on a forward-looking expected credit loss, which includes possible default events on the trade receivables over the entire holding period of the trade receivables.",

        "page_content": "In measuring the expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics (such as private versus public receivables) and days past due. In determining the expected credit loss rates, the Group considers current and forward-looking macroeconomic factors that may a/ffect the ability of the customers to settle the receivables, and historical loss rates for each category of customers.\n\nThe Group's largest customer accounted for approximately 17% of net sales, and the second largest and third largest customers accounted for 11% and 6% of net sales, respectively (2020: 17%, 11% and 6%, respectively; 2019: 18%, 13% and 8%, respectively).\n\nThe highest amounts of trade receivables outstanding were for these same three customers and amounted to 16%, 12% and 7%, respectively, of the Group's trade receivables at December 31, 2021 (2020: 14%, 12% and 6%, respectively). There is no other significant concentration of customer credit risk.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities and money market instruments; credit risk on cash, time deposits and derivatives; as well as settlement risk for di/fferent instruments. Issuer risk is reduced by only buying securities that are at least A- rated. Counterparty credit risk and settlement risk are reduced by a policy of entering into transactions with counterparties (banks or financial institutions) that feature a strong credit rating. Exposure to these risks is closely monitored and kept within predetermined parameters. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis, including financial statement and capital adequacy ratio reviews. In addition, reverse repurchasing agreements are contracted, and Novartis has entered into credit support agreements with various banks for derivative transactions. To further reduce the settlement risk, the Group has implemented a multi-currency system, Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS), providing multilateral netting (payment-versus-payment settlement) of cash flows from foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThe Group's cash and cash equivalents include shortterm highly rated government-backed debt securities, with an original maturity of three months or less, for approximately 16% (2020: nil) as well as cash and cash equivalents held with major regulated financial institutions; the three largest ones hold approximately 9.7%, 9.7% and 7.6%, respectively (2020: 14.1%, 12.6% and 9.7%, respectively).\n\nThe Group does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties and does not have any significant grouping of exposures to financial sector or country risk.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group could not be able to settle or meet its obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Group Treasury is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management. In addition, liquidity and funding risks, and related processes and policies, are overseen by management. Novartis manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis according to business needs and tax, capital or regulatory considerations, if applicable, through numerous sources of financing in order to maintain flexibility.\n\nCertain countries have legal or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Group in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, but these restrictions do not have an impact on the ability of the Group to meet its cash obligations.\n\nManagement monitors the Group's net debt or liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash flows.\n\nNovartis has two US commercial paper programs under which it can issue up to USD/uni00A09.0 billion in the aggregate  of  unsecured  commercial  paper  notes. Novartis also has one Japanese commercial paper program under which it can issue up to JPY/uni00A0 150 billion (approximately USD/uni00A01.3 billion) of unsecured commercial paper notes. Commercial paper notes totaling USD/uni00A00.9 billion under these three programs were outstanding as per December 31, 2021 (2020: USD/uni00A04.3 billion). Novartis further has a committed credit facility of USD/uni00A06.0 billion, which was renewed in September 2019. This credit facility is provided by a syndicate of banks and is intended to be used as a backstop for the US commercial paper programs. The facility matures in September 2024 and was undrawn as per December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n\nIn December 2019, Novartis entered into a short-term credit facility of USD 7 billion, with a maturity date of June 30, 2020, with a syndicate of banks. On January 7, 2020, Novartis borrowed USD 7 billion under the facility with interest based on the USD LIBOR. On February 14, 2020, Novartis repaid the full USD 7 billion initially borrowed. The facility expired on June 30, 2020.",

In managing its capital, Novartis focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, Moody's Investors Service rated the Company A1 for long-term maturities and P-1 for short-term maturities, and S&P Global Ratings rated the Company AA- for long-term maturities and A-1+ for short-term maturities.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group uses sensitivity analysis disclosures to provide quantitative information about market risks to which it is exposed.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis disclosures are in line with the  Group's  financial  risk  management  policy,  and enhance disclosures by moving to a one-parameter risk model that considers a one-factor linear relationship between risk factors and exposures, as compared to a",

The sensitivity analysis disclosures consider aggregated risk exposure arising from the most significant risk factors (currency risk, interest rate risk and equity prices risk) and includes all financial assets and financial liabilities as set forth in the table on page F-67.\n\nThe disclosures below illustrate the potential impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements as a result of hypothetical market movements in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. The range of variables chosen reflects management's view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period.\n\n## Foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity\n\nThe Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency. As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese and emerging market currencies, as well as in the Swiss franc. A strengthening (weakening) of the US dollar against these currencies as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 would have a/ffected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in these foreign currencies. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar would have impacted the Group's consolidated income statement as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                          | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| /five.tab/percent.tab increase in currency exchange rates   against USD | /three.tab                          | /five.tab                            |\n| /five.tab/percent.tab decrease in currency exchange rates   against USD | - /three.tab                        | - /five.tab                          |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Group designated EUR 1.8 billion (December 31, 2020: EUR 1.8 billion) of its longterm euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the translation risk arising on certain net investments in foreign operations with euro functional currency. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical 5% increase, or decrease, in the foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar, without considering the translation e/ffect of these net investments, would have impacted the Group's consolidated equity as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                                          | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| /five.tab/percent.tab increase in currency exchange rates   against USD | /nine.tab/nine.tab                  | /one.tab/zero.tab/eight.tab          |\n| /five.tab/percent.tab decrease in currency exchange rates   against USD | - /one.tab/zero.tab/four.tab        | - /one.tab/one.tab/four.tab          |\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nOur portfolio of fixed-income instruments as of December 31, 2021, was mainly composed of time deposits and debt securities.\n\nNovartis uses duration models to approximate the possible change in the value of fixed-income instruments. Based on these models, management believes that a 100-basis point change in interest is deemed a reasonable possible change over a one-year period.\n\nBased on exposures in 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical 100-basis point increase (decrease) in interest rates would  not  have  resulted  in  a  significant  increase (decrease) in the fair values of the fixed-income instruments.  In  addition,  a  hypothetical  100-basis  point increase (decrease) in interest rates would not have resulted in a material increase (decrease) of cash flows attributable to such fixed-income instruments.\n\nThe vast majority of our outstanding financial debts are with fixed interest rates and are therefore not a/ffected by movements in interest rates.\n\n## Equity price sensitivity\n\nFund investments and equity securities held by the Novartis Venture Fund are valued at fair value through profit and loss. Equity securities held as strategic investments, typically held outside the Novartis Venture Fund, are generally designated at date of acquisition as financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent recycling through profit and loss.\n\nThe fair value of these fund investments and equity securities was USD 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: USD 2.2 billion). The fair values of these investments are impacted by the volatility of the stock market, valuation parameters applied (for nonlisted equities) and changes in general economic factors. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Group's consolidated income statement as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                          | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab increase in equity prices | /one.tab/five.tab/four.tab          | /one.tab/five.tab/six.tab            |\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab decrease in equity prices | - /one.tab/five.tab/four.tab        | - /one.tab/five.tab/six.tab          |\n\nA hypothetical increase or decrease of 15% in the risk factors would have impacted the Group's consolidated equity as presented below:\n\n| (USD millions)                                          | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/one.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab increase in equity prices | /one.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab         | /one.tab/six.tab/seven.tab           |\n| /one.tab/five.tab/percent.tab decrease in equity prices | - /one.tab/seven.tab/nine.tab       | - /one.tab/six.tab/seven.tab         |",

The following additional significant accounting policies were applicable to discontinued operations.\n\n## Intangible assets available for use\n\nIn addition to currently marketed products, technologies and other intangible assets (including computer software), discontinued operations intangible assets available for use also included marketing know-how and the Alcon brand name.\n\nMarketing know-how represents the value attributable to the expertise acquired for marketing and distributing Alcon surgical products.\n\nThe Alcon brand name was shown separately, as it was the only Novartis intangible asset that was available for use with an indefinite useful life. Novartis considers that it was appropriate that the Alcon brand name had an indefinite life since Alcon-branded products had a\n\nhistory of strong revenue and cash flow performance, and Novartis had the intent and ability to support the brand with spending to maintain its value for the foreseeable future. The Alcon brand name was not amortized as it had an indefinite useful life, but was evaluated for potential impairment annually.\n\nThe following table shows the respective useful lives for available-for-use intangible assets and the location in the  consolidated income statement in which the respective amortization and any potential impairment charge were recognized:\n\n|                    | Useful life                           | Income statement location for amortization and impairment charges   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Marketing know-how | 25 years                              | 'Cost of goods sold'                                                |\n| Alcon brand name   | Not amortized, indefinite useful life | 'Other expense'                                                     |\n\nThe estimates used in calculating the net present values are highly sensitive and depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the activities and more specifically on appropriate royalty rate for the Alcon brand name.",

        "page_content": "## Revenue recognition\n\nIn the Alcon Division, which is reported as discontinued operations, surgical equipment may have been sold together with other products and services under a single contract. Revenues were recognized upon satisfaction of each of the performance obligations in the contract and the consideration was allocated based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\n\nFor surgical equipment, in addition to cash and installment sales, revenue was recognized under finance and operating lease arrangements. Arrangements in which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership transfers to the customer were treated as finance lease  arrangements.  Revenue  from  finance  lease arrangements was recognized at amounts equal to the fair value of the equipment, which approximated the present value of the minimum lease payments under the arrangements. As interest rates embedded in lease arrangements were approximately market rates, revenue under finance lease arrangements was comparable to revenue for outright sales. Finance income for arrangements longer than 12 months was deferred and subsequently recognized based on a pattern that approximated to the use of the e/ffective interest method and was recorded in 'Other income.' Operating lease revenue for equipment rentals was recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term.\n\n## Net income\n\nIncluded in net income from discontinued operations are:\n\n| (USD millions)                                     | /two.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/nine.tab   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment      | - /four.tab/two.tab                  |\n| Depreciation of right-of-use assets                | - /nine.tab                          |\n| Amortization of intangible assets                  | - /one.tab/seven.tab/four.tab        |\n| Equity-based compensation of Novartis equity plans | - /nine.tab                          |\n\n## Cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations\n\nCash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations include the investing activities of the Alcon business and cash outflows for transaction-related expenditures attributable to the series of portfolio transformation transactions completed in 2015.\n\n| (USD millions)                                                               | /two.tab/zero.tab/two.tab/zero.tab   | /two.tab/zero.tab/one.tab/nine.tab             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Payments attributable to the   spin-o/ff of the Alcon business               | - /three.tab/nine.tab                | - /two.tab/nine.tab                            |\n| Divested cash and cash equivalents                                           |                                      | - /six.tab/two.tab/eight.tab                   |\n| Cash flows attributable to the   spin-o/ff of the Alcon business             | - /three.tab/nine.tab                | - /six.tab/five.tab/seven.tab                  |\n| Other cash flows used in  investing activities, net                          | - /eight.tab/eight.tab               | - /five.tab/zero.tab/two.tab                   |\n| Net cash flows used in investing   activities from discontinued   operations | - /one.tab/two.tab/seven.tab         | - /one.tab/space.tab/one.tab/five.tab/nine.tab |\n\n## Cash flows from financing activities from discontinued operations\n\nIn 2020, the net cash outflows used in financing activities from discontinued operations of USD 50 million was for transaction cost payments directly attributable to the distribution (spin-o/ff) of the Alcon business to Novartis AG shareholders.\n\nIn 2019, the net cash inflows from financing activities from discontinued operations of USD 3.3 billion included mainly USD 3.5 billion cash inflows from Alcon borrowings in connection with the distribution (spin-o/ff) of the Alcon business to Novartis AG shareholders, partly o/ffset by USD 0.2 billion transaction cost payments directly attributable to the distribution (spin-o/ff) of the Alcon business to Novartis AG shareholders (see Notes 1 and 2).\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nIn many subsidiaries, employees are covered by defined contribution plans.

The amount consisted of an initial cash payment of USD 289 million and the fair value of the contingent consideration of USD 135 million, due to PowerVision shareholders, which they are eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified regulatory and commercialization milestones. The purchase price allocation resulted in net identifiable assets of USD 418 million, consisting of intangible assets of USD 505 million, net deferred tax liabilities of USD 93 million, other net assets of USD 6 million, and goodwill of USD 6 million. The 2019 results of operations since the date of the acquisition were not material.\n\nFor additional information related to the distribution (spin-o/ff)  of  the  Alcon  business  to  Novartis  AG shareholders,  e/ffected  through  a  dividend  in  kind distribution that was completed on April 8, 2019, refer to Note 1 and Note 2.",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n- \u00b7  Overall Group materiality was USD 575 million\n- \u00b7 We conducted full scope audit work at the Group's two operating divisions. We also conducted full scope audit work at four reporting entities in two countries. In addition, full scope audit work on account balances or\n\nspecified procedures was performed at 19 reporting entities in 13 countries.\n\n- \u00b7  Our audit scope addressed 64% of the Group's net sales and 86% of Group's total assets.\n\nAs key audit matters the following areas of focus have been identified:\n\n- \u00b7 Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments - Innovative Medicines Division Currently Marketed Products\n- \u00b7  US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid Rebates\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgment, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e/ffect of misstatements, if any, both individually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Overall Group materiality\n\nUSD 575 million\n\n## Benchmark applied\n\nProfit before tax\n\n## Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied\n\nWe chose income before taxes from continuing operations as the materiality measure because, in our view, it is the measure against which the performance of the Group is most commonly measured and it is a generally accepted benchmark.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above USD 25 million as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform su/fficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates.",

        "page_content": "The Group financial statements are a consolidation of over 200 reporting entities. We identified four reporting entities that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information due to their size or risk characteristics. We worked very closely with and received full scope reporting from the divisional audit teams for Innovative Medicines and Sandoz, each being a global business. To obtain appropriate coverage of material balances, we also received 19 full scope reports from reporting entity audit teams for the full scope audit work performed  on  account  balances  and  one  specified procedures  report.  None  of  the  reporting  entities excluded from our Group audit scope individually contributed more than 5% to net sales or total assets. Audit procedures were also performed by the Group audit team over the Group's Corporate activities, certain Group functions (including accounting for associated companies, taxation, treasury, certain employee benefits, government investigations and litigation) and Group consolidation.\n\nTo exercise the appropriate direction and supervision over the work of the divisional and reporting entity audit teams, the Group audit team reviewed audit working papers, virtually participated in meetings between the divisional and reporting entity audit teams, and virtually attended selected meetings between divisional management and divisional audit teams.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments Innovative Medicines Division Currently Marketed Products\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group has intangible assets in its Innovative Medicines Division other than goodwill totaling USD 32.4 billion at December 31, 2021, including currently marketed products of USD 25.9 billion. The Group recognized  impairments  of  intangible  assets  in  its Innovative Medicines Division other than goodwill of USD 367 million during the year. In most cases, no directly observable market inputs are available to measure the fair value less costs of disposal that is used to determine if the asset is impaired. Therefore, an estimate is derived indirectly and is based on net present value techniques utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. The estimates that management used in calculating the net present values depend on assumptions specific to the nature of the Innovative Medicines Division's activities with regard to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; long-term sales forecasts; actions of competitors (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives, etc.); sales erosion rates after the end of patent or other intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the\n\nentry of generic competition; outcome of research and development activities (compound e/fficacy, results of clinical trials, etc.); amount and timing of projected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products; profit margins; probability of obtaining regulatory approval; future tax rate; and discount rate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the intangible assets  impairment  assessments  of  the  Innovative Medicines Division currently marketed products is a key audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the net present value of the intangible assets. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and e/ffort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (specifically the long-term sales forecasts).\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the e/ffectiveness of controls relating to management's intangible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the Innovative Medicines Division currently marketed products. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the net present value techniques; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including the amount and timing of projected future cash  flows.  Evaluating  management's  assumptions related to the amount and timing of projected future cash flows involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the intangible assets, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n\nAs a result of our procedures, we did not propose any adjustments to the amount of impairment recognized in 2021. For Innovative Medicines Division currently marketed products where management determined that no impairment was required, we found that the assessments made by management were based upon reasonable assumptions, consistently applied.\n\n## US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid Rebates\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nAs described in Note 1 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the consideration Novartis receives in exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is only recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. Rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, managed healthcare organizations and other customers, as well as chargebacks are provisioned and recorded as a revenue deduction at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are o/ffered. They are calculated on",

The provision reported as of December 31, 2021 for revenue deductions amounted to USD 6.5 billion, a significant portion of which related to US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebates.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebates is a key audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these provisions, as the provisions are based on assumptions developed using historical experience, regulations, the specific terms in the individual agreements, product pricing and the mix of products, contracts, channels and payors. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and e/ffort in applying procedures relating to these assumptions.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the e/ffectiveness of controls relating to provisions for the US Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebate programs, including controls over the assumptions used to  estimate  these  rebates.  These  procedures  also included, among others, developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third-party information on price and market conditions in the US, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid; comparing the independent estimate to management's estimates; and testing rebate claims processed by the Group, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Group's rebate arrangements.\n\nWe did not identify any material di/fferences between our expectations and the accruals, and we found the\n\njudgments made by management to be reasonable.\n\n## Other information in the Annual Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the Annual Report. The other information comprises all information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements and the remuneration report of Novartis AG and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the Annual Report, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the Annual Report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have\n\nperformed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.",

Introduction\n\nThe financial statements of Novartis AG, with its registered o/ffice in Basel, comply with the requirements of the Swiss accounting legislation of the Swiss Code of Obligations (SCO).\n\n## 2. Accounting policies\n\n## Financial income and expenses\n\nCurrent assets and current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted at year-end exchange rates. Realized exchange gains and losses, and all unreali zed exchange losses arising from these as well as those from business transactions, are recorded net as financial income or financial expenses.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. These instruments are valued at fair value. When di/fferent accounting policies apply for the hedged item and the derivative financial instrument, hedge  accounting is applied through measuring the hedged item together with the derivative financial instrument.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are valued at acquisition cost less adjustments for foreign currency losses and any other impairment of value.\n\nNovartis AG is presenting consolidated financial statements according to IFRS. Therefore, Novartis AG has applied the exemption included in article 961d, paragraph 1 SCO, and has not prepared additional disclosures, a separate cash flow statement and a management report for SCO purposes.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are initially recognized at cost. Investments in Novartis Group subsidiaries are assessed annually and, in case of an impairment, adjusted to their recoverable amount within their category.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is capitalized and amortized over a period of 20 years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on a yearly basis. If necessary, an impairment loss is recognized.\n\n## Bonds\n\nBonds are valued at nominal value. Any bond premium is accrued over the duration of the bond so that at maturity, the balance sheet amount will equal the amount that is due to be paid.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are made to cover general business risks of the Group.",

Litigation and settlement costs\n\nIn 2020, Novartis resolved some legacy legal matters. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigations into Novartis are now closed, as settlements were reached with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of the settlements, Novartis AG agreed to pay USD 9 million to the DOJ and USD 113 million to the SEC.\n\nThe French Competition Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into Lucentis against several Novartis subsidiaries. Novartis AG was jointly held liable for a fine of EUR 308 million. As Lucentis is not commercialized by  Novartis  AG  itself,  but  by  Novartis  subsidiaries, Novartis AG was fully reimbursed by the operational subsidiary.\n\n## 5.

Novartis AG is able to cancel this arrangement at any\n\ntime but could be subject to a 90-day waiting period. The commitment under this arrangement therefore reflects the obligated purchases by the bank under such trading plan over a rolling 90-day period, or if shorter, until the maturity date of such trading plan. The commitment under this arrangement, based on Novartis AG share price at December 31, 2021, amounted to CHF 2.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.",

The determination also includes other shares and vested options of Novartis shares or ADRs that are owned directly or indirectly by 'persons closely linked' to an Executive Committee member. The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with the share ownership guideline on an annual basis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, all members who have served at least five years on the Executive Committee have met or exceeded their personal Novartis share ownership requirements.\n\n## Shares, ADRs, equity rights and share options owned by Executive Committee members\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, no member of the Executive Committee, either individually or together with 'persons closely linked' 1 to them, owned 1% or more of the outstanding shares (or ADRs) of Novartis. As at the same date, no member of the  Executive Committee held any share options to purchase Novartis shares.\n\nThe following table shows the total number of shares, ADRs  and  other  equity  rights  owned  by  Executive Committee members and 'persons closely linked' 1 to them as at December 31, 2021, and as at December 31, 2020.\n\n- 1 'Persons closely linked' are (i) their spouse, (ii) their children below age 18, (iii) any legal entities that they own or otherwise control, and (iv) any legal or natural person who is  acting as their fiduciary.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of\n\nour audit procedures and to evaluate the e/ffect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Overall materiality\n\nCHF 412 million\n\n## Benchmark applied\n\nProfit before tax\n\n## Rationale for the materiality benchmark applied\n\nWe  chose  income  before  taxes  as  the  benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which the performance of Novartis AG is most commonly measured, and it is a generally accepted benchmark.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee that we would report to them misstatements above CHF 23 million identified during our audit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Audit scope\n\nWe designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where subjective judgements were made; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform su/fficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the entity, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the entity operates.\n\n## Report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority\n\nWe have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",

        "page_content": "In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the entity's internal control.\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors, mostly through the Audit and Compliance Committee, regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\nIn accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers AG\n\nClaudia Benz Audit expert Auditor in charge\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBasel, February 1, 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKris Muller\n\nGlobal relationship partner",
