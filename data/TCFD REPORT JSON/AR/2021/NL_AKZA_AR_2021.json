While 2020 was marked by sudden shifts in demand across our paints and coatings market segments, 2021 was affected in a very different way.\n\nThis time, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 - combined with several extreme weather events early in the year - caused significant disruption across our supply chains. The overall availability and movement of raw materials was a real challenge for the whole paints and coatings industry. This resulted in significant shortages of key raw materials, which is still ongoing, and an unprecedented cost increase compared with 2020.\n\nSo 2021 was a real stress test for the operational resilience and can-do attitude we've been fostering over the last few years. We found ourselves climbing an unexpectedly high mountain as the business environment became increasingly difficult. However, our teams had the summit in sight, and while they were somewhat tired, I'm happy to report they're also in good spirits, as we're in an excellent position to accelerate along the other side of the slope.\n\nAlthough we were dealing with incoming supply chain disruption and inflation, demand for our paints and coatings remained strong. The vast majority of our markets continued to rebound well and we were able to expand our position in significant target markets. I'm very proud of how our teams demonstrated their new-found resilience. Our commercial teams responded quickly with pricing initiatives to compensate for the huge",

Meanwhile, our procurement, R&D and supply chain colleagues worked hard to continue serving customers in the face of the severe supply chain disruption.\n\nAs a result, despite these massive headwinds, we were able to safeguard our profitability and stay on track for defending or strengthening our market positions - our Grow & Deliver strategy has remained on course.\n\nA notable example of our 'Grow' mindset was our Powder Coatings business, which delivered another strong year of double-digit revenue growth. There were some exciting developments around electric vehicles, low temperature and UV-curing for powder on wood and the increasing trend of moving from liquid to powder, for example in the US architectural market.\n\nWe also achieved multiple proof points of growth across our Decorative Paints businesses. For example, in North Asia, we added the availability of Dulux to another 11,200 stores, delivered double-digit growth in the premium market segment and improved our profitability. In addition, we announced the acquisition of Colombia-based paints and coatings company Grupo Orbis, which will further expand our long-term leadership position in South and Central America.\n\nFrom a 'Deliver' perspective, we continued to improve our operational efficiency and effectiveness. Much of this work has involved streamlining end-toend processes, reducing unproductive product portfolio complexity and simplifying how we run the company in general. For example, almost 95% of the company now operates on just four major ERP systems.\n\nThe reinvention of AkzoNobel as a focused paints and coatings company, which started in 2017, is clearly on track to make us the reference in our industry.\n\nWe've kept a sharp focus on the business fundamentals, including cost discipline and cash generation.\n\nAnother key focus area is sustainability, which has been a core value for many years. So it was with a great sense of pride that we were one of the first recipients of the inaugural Terra Carta Seal - the only paints and coatings company to receive the honor. It's recognition of the positive action we're taking, driven largely by the fact that sustainability is embedded in our culture and fundamental to the way we operate. In 2021, we also committed to science-based sustainability targets, signaling our intention to take stronger action to tackle climate change. We're excited that this commitment will be an enormous innovation driver for what we do throughout our entire value chain with our customers and suppliers over the next few years.\n\nGiven our passion for making a genuine difference to customers, communities and the environment, we took a logical step in elevating People. Plant. Paint. to give it a much wider and deeper meaning for the company. So rather than only focusing on how we talk about sustainability, People. Planet. Paint. is now at the heart of everything we do. We've put solving globally relevant challenges at our very core, but recognize that we can't do it alone. So it's great to see how our teams are leading the way in collaborative innovation. Our Paint the Future innovation ecosystem is going from strength to strength, with a highly successful regional event staged in China in the first half of 2021, while our second global startup challenge bootcamp and finals event is set for 2022.\n\nThat collaborative spirit also featured prominently in several other highlights during the year. This included the results of the research phase of Operation Night Watch being announced (a partnership\n\n## CEO STATEMENT\n\nwith the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Meanwhile, our work with the Advanced Research Center Chemical Building Blocks Consortium (ARC CBBC) in the Netherlands - which strives to bridge bio-based sciences to competitively create paints and coatings building blocks - continues to excite and delight as we strive to remain a frontrunner in innovation. The work we're doing with Nobel Prize winner Ben Feringa is particularly promising.\n\nOf course, none of this would have happened without the 32,800 AkzoNobel employees around the world, who responded magnificently to the extreme challenges we faced in 2021. They held everything together inside our company and made sure that we stayed close to our customers, to help them get through their own tough times. And it was great to achieve more progress in organizational health, with our score improving once again (the participation rate reached an all-time high), suggesting that engagement is strong within the company and that we're in great shape for 2022.\n\nSo a heartfelt thank you to the whole organization. For myself and the whole Executive Committee, it's a real privilege - and fun - to be part of this journey as we advance further towards becoming the frontrunner in our industry.\n\n## Thierry Vanlancker\n\nCEO and Chair of the Board of Management and Executive Committee",

In 2021, an interim 2021 dividend of \u20ac0.44 per common share (2020: \u20ac0.43) was paid. A final 2021 dividend of \u20ac1.54 (2020: \u20ac1.52) per share is proposed, which would equal a total 2021 dividend of \u20ac1.98 (2020: \u20ac1.95).\n\n## Share buyback\n\nOn October 21, 2020, a \u20ac300 million share buyback program was announced, which was completed in 2021.

This increase was mainly caused by higher operating working capital (trade) and investments in non-current assets.\n\n## Sustainability progress\n\nWe've now set all our sustainability ambitions for 2025 and 2030 and are already making strong progress towards achieving them. This progress is highlighted in the People. Planet. Paint. charts in this section.\n\n## Employees\n\nIn 2021, the number of employees increased by 2% to 32,800 people (year-end 2020: 32,200 people). Acquisitions in 2021 added around 400 people.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe ongoing pandemic situation was closely monitored in 2021 and appropriate measures were taken to continue serving customers and control spend, while at the same time keeping the organization intact and able to respond quickly to changes in end market demand.\n\nAkzoNobel has a strong balance sheet and solid cash position. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were \u20ac1.2 billion and financial leverage (net debt/EBITDA) was 1.6. AkzoNobel is committed to retain a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, a detailed assessment was performed of potential valuation adjustments to the overall asset base, either due to the direct impact of COVID-19 or due to its impact on future profitability, which did not lead to significant valuation adjustments.\n\nThe ongoing pandemic situation was closely monitored in 2021 and appropriate measures were taken to continue serving our customers and control spend.\n\nGoodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in both years have been performed based on adjusted forecasts. Recoverability of deferred tax assets has also been reassessed based on these adjusted forecasts. Furthermore, an assessment was performed with regard to the allowance for impairment of trade receivables, also taking into account potential additional risk associated with COVID-19.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on the Consolidated financial statements has been considered for each of the relevant notes, and additional disclosures have been provided in case COVID-19 had a material impact on a specific section. Refer to the Consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nIn our 2021 and 2020 figures, all COVID-19 related impacts have been treated as normal operations; none of these impacts has been included in identified items. Employee benefit costs in 2020 included \u20ac33 million compensation related to government support measures for COVID-19. For 2021, this number is not material.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAkzoNobel targets to grow at or above its relevant markets, in line with its Grow & Deliver strategy. Trends differ per region and segment, while raw material cost inflation and supply constraints are expected to gradually ease by mid-2022. Plans are in place to deliver the \u20ac2 billion adjusted EBITDA target for 2023, and an average annual 50 basis points increase in return on sales over the period 2021-2023. AkzoNobel targets a leverage ratio of 1-2 times net debt/EBITDA and commits to retain a strong investment grade credit rating.",

Our world class portfolio of established brands is trusted by customers around the world and we continue to be guided by a strong set of core values - safety, integrity and sustainability. In fact, our People. Planet. Paint. approach to sustainable business has now become the overarching mantra for everything we do.\n\nOur Grow & Deliver strategy balances growth with further profitability improvement, building on the strong foundation we now have in place. Ultimately, our goal is to be the frontrunner - both in terms of size and performance - among leading players in the industry.\n\nOur fundamentals remain the same: passion for paint, precise processes, powerful performance, proud people; while key behaviors guide our ways of working: be customer focused, execute with discipline, deliver on commitments, take ownership.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPassion for paint\n\nBe customer focused\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growth drivers\n\nWe're well placed in the approximately \u20ac140 billion paints and coatings industry. Our balanced geographic presence and strong portfolio of brands - with leading positions in most market segments - offers multiple opportunities for growth.\n\nWe have a significant presence in the higher-growth South Asia Pacific region, where we generate around 12% of total revenue. We're the leader in the fastgrowing and sustainable powder coatings market, which currently accounts for 14% of our revenue. Other market segments and regions also offer exciting growth opportunities, such as packaging coatings - being driven by a shift away from single use plastics to metal cans - along with aerospace coatings, yacht coatings and our Decorative Paints business in South America.\n\nStrategic mandates - per market seg ment and region - are used to provide clear direction for each of our businesses, including relative priorities for growth and profitability improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrecise processes\n\nExecute with discipline\n\n## Ambitions for 2021-2023 *\n\n- Revenue growth at least in line with our relevant markets\n- ROS \u25ca (return on sales) improvement of an average 50 basis points per year\n- Adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac2 billion for 2023\n- \u25ca ROS is calculated as adjusted operating income (operating income excluding identified items) as a percentage of revenue from third parties.\n\nMarket segments and regions representing around one third of our total revenue have clear growth mandates. For example, we're growing our Decorative Paints business in China by leveraging our premium Dulux brand to serve customers in a greater number of cities with more innovative and sustainable solutions.\n\nWith stakeholders increasingly demanding more sustainable solutions, we're well placed to capitalize on this trend by leveraging our widely recognized leadership position when it comes to sustainability.

For us, this means going beyond when it comes to providing customers with products and services, as well as understanding and anticipating their changing needs and expectations. Revenue from new product introductions was around 20% during the past five years. Our industry-leading Paint the Future collaborative innovation ecosystem is just one example of how our pioneering spirit is helping us to continue pushing boundaries.\n\nWe have a strong balance sheet and clear capital allocation priorities, providing a solid platform for adding to organic growth - in a disciplined way - with targeted acquisitions, which are both value-creating and aligned with our strategic mandates. In 2021,\n\nwe completed the acquisition of Titan decorative paints in Spain, while New Nautical Coatings was added to our presence in yacht coatings, and we announced the acquisition of Grupo Orbis, to expand our presence in South America.\n\n## Delivering performance improvement\n\nTo help drive our Grow & Deliver strategy, we're evolving our operating model, moving from functional excellence in silos to driving cross-functional collaboration, with an emphasis on end-to-end processes and becoming even more customer focused.\n\nStrong margin management is particularly important when facing significant raw material cost inflation. We're building on our experiences from 2017-2018, with faster and even more robust pricing initiatives for 2021-2022 and setting ourselves up to deal with future cycles.\n\nIt's not just the livery of this China Southern Airlines 'Youth Zhuhai' themed Boeing 737-800 that's breathtaking. So is the lightning fast speed it took to paint it. With only 14 days and 34 new colors to develop, our color lab in India and Aerospace Coatings production team in DongGuan, China, rose to the challenge.\n\nWe're building product management capabilities, which are necessary to deliver the products our customers desire and win in the market - at the most competitive cost, with less complexity and increased collaboration with our suppliers.\n\nCreating a world class supply chain requires more efficiency and effectiveness - built on strong planning processes - in order to meet customer needs with superior service levels. Meanwhile, our manufacturing network will be optimized via three supply models: simple and efficient, managed complexity, agile and adaptive.\n\nWe're also continuing with several initiatives, for example integrating our systems and applications, designed to deliver seamless business services that are effective and cost competitive, allowing for greater focus on what matters most.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMake our processes and systems work for our customers and us\n\n* Profit = adjusted EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->",

They\n\nconsistently guide us on our journey to making\n\na sustainable and long-lasting difference to our\n\ncustomers and the planet.\n\nIn early 2020, we made a commitment to reduce the\n\ncarbon footprint of our own operations by 50% by\n\n2030. This year, we extended that ambition to include\n\nour entire value chain (see page 40). However, this will\n\nonly be possible if we innovate and collaborate with\n\nour value chain partners. The good news is that several\n\ninitiatives are already underway.\n\nMaintaining the momentum\n\nBuilding on the success of our industry-first Paint the\n\nFuture startup challenge, we maintained the momentum\n\nby staging a fully virtual challenge event attended by\n\n90 suppliers, which resulted in around 100 possible\n\nsolutions being submitted.\n\nMeanwhile, our regional startup challenge in China\n\nyielded 210 submissions and reached an audience of\n\nmore than 178 million. Four winning teams entered the\n\naccelerator program. We also launched a second global\n\nstartup challenge, which attracted 245 submissions.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the pandemic, we had to post-\n\npone the bootcamp and finals event planned for\n\nNovember 2021 until early 2022.\n\nOur ambition is to emulate the success of the first\n\nglobal challenge in 2019, which has since resulted in\n\nexciting go-to-market developments for two of the\n\nwinning companies: we've partnered with Qlayers\n\nfollowing a series of commercial successes for their\n\nrobotic paint application, and we successfully reached\n\nthe pilot phase for a new pre-deco filler based on\n\nAlucha's circular raw material (see case study in the\n\nSustainability statements).\n\nCollaboration was also a prime objective for founding\n\nthe ARC Chemical Building Block Consortium, which\n\nwas set up in 2016 together with various partners,\n\nincluding a number of Dutch universities. We're seeing\n\nsome very interesting leads starting to emerge, such\n\nas a new photochemistry-based technology for\n\nproducing novel (coatings) polymers. This research was\n\npublished in Science magazine - the peer-reviewed\n\nacademic journal of the American Association for the\n\nAdvancement of Science - with Nobel Prize laureate\n\nBen Feringa (pictured below) as co-author.\n\nOur partnership with the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam,\n\nthe Netherlands, on Operation Night Watch also\n\ncontinued. One of our main projects has focused on\n\nunlocking the secrets behind Rembrandt's famous\n\nimpasto technique - the way he was able to apply paint\n\nto give an almost 3D effect. Using the most modern\n\nanalytical and digital techniques, we've been able to\n\ndesign paint formulations that mimic those used by the\n\n17\n\nth\n\ncentury master.\n\nProduct and service innovation in 2021\n\nLet's take a quick look at some of the innovations we\n\nlaunched during the year. We pioneered a new 'Tinder-\n\nstyle' digital tool for finding your ideal decorative paint\n\ncolor match. By swiping a range of interior colors and\n\ndesigns, the intelligent software provides customers\n\nwith a perfect palette of their favorite shades.\n\nWe also brought several products to market with anti-\n\nviral properties; developed advanced technologies to\n\nprotect the motors, battery systems and storage units\n\nused in electric vehicles; and introduced chrome-free\n\nprimers to the coil market in China.\n\nAnother notable launch was the Intertrac HullCare\n\nsustainable hull management package from our Marine\n\nand Protective Coatings business, which you can read\n\nabout in more detail on page 24.\n\n## INNOVATION",

Our Consumer Electronics and Film businesses both had a record year, while there was an impressive recovery in Aerospace Coatings and we increased prices across all our market segments. Our teams showed great resilience as we pushed ahead with the company's Grow & Deliver strategy, once again proving that teamwork can overcome many hurdles. We're well prepared to keep that momentum going.\n\n## 2021 HIGHLIGHT\n\nWe introduced innovative film technology that allows automotive manufacturers to hide radar sensors behind decorative metallic parts. The radar-transparent bright film - perfected by working together with our customers - means vehicle makers no longer have to worry about hiding sensors behind solid metal, which can block the signals of safety features such as anti-collision warnings.

While some countries started to re-open, it was at different speeds around the world. Many economies continued to experience various stages of containment, which was reflected in the activity across our main marine and protective markets. Orders for new ships improved compared with the previous year, albeit from the bottom of the cycle, while the recreational boating market continued to be buoyant. This gives us confidence in the fundamentals of our yacht market. 2020 was a low in terms of oil and gas investment, and although this improved by comparison in 2021, the revival in oil and gas was tempered by a gradual demand side recovery and improving commodity prices.\n\nAlthough global supply chain disruptions brought different challenges to those we experienced in 2020, demand for our high quality products, services and people expertise remained positive. Our teams worked quickly and effectively to remain proactive and support continuity on our customers' projects. We continued to work closely with industry partners to find new ways of delivering product and service innovations, which provided both financial and sustainability improvements for our customers, as well as the wider industry.\n\n## Revenue by destination in %\n\n| A  EMEA         |   34 |\n|-----------------|------|\n| B  Americas     |   22 |\n| C  Asia Pacific |   44 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 HIGHLIGHT\n\nWe continued to find new ways to support customers and the marine industry's net zero ambition with the introduction of the most sustainable hull management package yet - Intertrac HullCare.

The business will share its expert knowledge and insight to help create a more sustainable yacht industry. The code of conduct is made up of ten commitments that will make a real difference in reducing the environmental footprint of the superyacht industry and restoring the world's oceans.

Our three priorities are:\n\n- \u00b7  Fostering an inclusive culture\n- \u00b7  Building and expanding our internal diversity and inclusion networks\n- \u00b7  Strengthening our leadership diversity and focus on gender balance\n\nWe've continued to make progress on our commitment to diversity and inclusion (D&I). We rolled out our inclusive and respectful workplace training and continued to promote 'I Belong', a guide to help managers lead in an inclusive way. We've also introduced our inclusive language guidelines.\n\nD&I has become a growing topic of interest across our organization. There's a growing number of True Colors chapters (focused on leading inclusion for our LGBTI+ colleagues) and our Women Inspired Network operates in many different countries. Our Equal Access Board has established strategic points of contact at senior executive level, who will help ensure equality in the workplace for all employees with disabilities.\n\nIn 2021, we set gender targets for all our businesses and functions to increase female representation as part of leadership accountability. This will contribute to our goal of having 30% female executives by 2025. In 2021, we had 22% female executives, with 33% in the Supervisory Board and 43% in the Executive Committee.\n\nThis year, we joined the UN Global Compact program Target Gender Equality to support our efforts in increasing female representation.\n\n## Culture and change network\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur CEO, Thierry Vanlancker, signed the program's Women Empowerment Principles to show our commitment and engagement.

Ultimately, our vision is to achieve zero injuries and harm through operational excellence.\n\nWe do this through initiatives in the areas of people safety and health, process safety, and security. We report, analyze and learn from all our health and safety incidents to continuously improve our safety performance. Our commitment is underpinned by our Life-Saving Rules and Golden Principle to stop work if conditions or behavior are unsafe.\n\n## People safety and health\n\nIn 2021, we focused our people safety program on forklift truck safety and safe driving in general. We also accelerated our life-critical procedures and Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSE&S) roadmap program. We identified areas that need improvement in our own operations and put them on the roadmap with targeted plans and governance. In addition, we continued to invest in functional excellence and the development of our capability in the area of root cause analysis.\n\nTo ensure healthy working conditions for all our employees, we continue to actively manage occupational illnessrelated absenteeism. We've piloted a Wellness Checkpoint which supports the evaluation of psycho-social risk factors.\n\nWe've leveraged the company-wide digital compliance assurance process to underpin our industrial hygiene and occupational health approach.\n\nIn 2021, the total reportable rate (TRR) for employees and temporary workers improved to 0.21 (2020: 0.23), meeting the target level set for 2021 (0.21). In total, 66% of our manufacturing sites have been reportable injury-free for over a year. The most frequent causes of reportable injuries are slips, trips and falls, struck by or caught in-between objects and manual handling. The most frequent injuries are strains/sprains, cuts/ lacerations and fractures.\n\nOur contractor performance improved in 2021, with a contractor reportable injury rate of 0.12 (2020: 0.17). The contractors lost time injury rate decreased to 0.08 (2020: 0.11).\n\nUnfortunately, there were two major incidents this year. A fatal injury involving an electronic pallet lift truck in Jakarta, Indonesia, and a pedestrian sustaining life-changing injuries after being hit by a forklift truck in Machelen, Belgium.\n\n## Process safety\n\nIn 2021, we continued our dedicated Process Safety Management (PSM) improvement project. This project is designed to strengthen our PSM program and processes to achieve leading standards in process safety. It focuses on high quality hazard studies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe total reportable injury rate (TRR) is the number of injuries resulting in a medical treatment case, restricted work case, lost time case or fatality, per 200,000 hours worked.

This is supported by harmonized leading metrics. The project will continue in 2022.\n\nSeveral activities took place to strengthen our culture of commitmentbased process safety. We launched a successful global campaign to demonstrate leadership commitment and explain how all employees can contribute to process safety. We also introduced Basis of Safety (BOS) standards for resin manufacturing, aluminum bonding and high-speed dispersers that addressed these higher risk processes and defined company expectations for these activities. Various engineering standards have been adopted: for grounding and bonding; flexible hose management; and maintenance of solvent storage tanks.\n\nWe'll start 2022 by implementing a training plan for Process Safety Fundamentals - focusing on capability building of front-line workers and proactively developing task-safe behaviors. We'll also continue designing and implementing BOS and engineering standards.\n\nOur loss of primary containment (LoPC) Level 1 and 2 (number of spills) was higher than last year. The increased focus on process safety also resulted in a higher number of Level 3 (near miss) reports. These give essential input to our continuous improvement processes. The direct causes identified by our incident investigations mainly attributed the number of spills to operational discipline (35%) and asset integrity (42%). We saw an increasing trend during 2021 in spills related to handling of drums and IBCs (intermediate bulk containers) by lift trucks. In total, 69% of our manufacturing locations didn't have LoPCs, demonstrating our vision of zero spills is achievable. However, 20% of our locations have caused 76% of our spills\n\nover the last three years. In our roadmap approach, we focus on those locations, ensuring the improvement plans act upon the underlying root cause.\n\n## Security\n\nOur security program protects people, information, assets and critical business processes, both on and off-site. We updated the classification for security incidents in 2021, creating four severity levels (from 0 to 3 based on severity of the impact of an incident). Incidents are also separated into three categories crime against a person, property crime and financial crime.\n\nGlobally, there were 160 security incidents reported in 2021, broadly in line with previous years. Four were Level 3 (most severe events), of which the most severe incident was the looting of our manufacturing site in Umbogintwini (South Africa), resulting from organized political unrest in the region.\n\nTheft and vandalism at our stores represented the highest incident sub-type - similar to wider society.\n\n## HSE&S management foundation\n\nOur company-wide HSE&S management system is globally certified to ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards, with ongoing transfer to ISO 45001. It includes policies, procedures, best practice and learnings. In 2021, we updated the self-assessment questionnaire used for continuous improvement and audits.\n\nHSE&S audits are performed in threeyear (for high hazard sites) to five-year (other sites) cycles. Due to COVID-19, we conducted the 2021 audit plan with minor amendments, including changing over to remote (55%) and/or hybrid audits (35%) when it was not possible for (all) auditors to visit a site.\n\nCompliance assurance is a key HSE&S priority. It's particularly important for ensuring our license to operate and\n\nbusiness continuity, due to the fastchanging regulatory environment in which we operate. We take a proactive approach to implementing necessary changes, from both a risk mitigation and advocacy perspective. We continue to use a company-wide digital compliance assurance process, which includes a regulatory monitoring and alert system. It also features a self-assessment tool, which helps us to identify compliance with existing regulatory frameworks and stay up-to-date with the latest changes, as well as enabling proactive responses to new requirements.\n\n## Safety Day 2021\n\nWe invest in visible safety leadership and initiatives to foster employee engagement. During our 11 th annual Safety Day, the theme was 'Be human - Be safe', which focused on three key messages:\n\n- \u00b7  Everyone makes mistakes - they happen because we're human\n- \u00b7  We can design for error - we'll work to limit the consequences\n- \u00b7  Learning is vital for improvement - ask 'what failed?' rather than 'who failed?'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees and contractor partners around the world took part in our 11 th annual Safety Day.

As well as being used on 398 houses, the paint helped to revive various other buildings, such as schools and art centers. Twenty volunteers from AkzoNobel were also involved in the 'Let's Colour' project.\n\n## Responding to COVID-19\n\nWe assessed and responded to changing circumstances throughout the year. Our regional and local response structure proved invaluable, given the major regional differences regarding the impact of COVID-19. Central health and safety guidelines remained intact, supported by our Behavior Based Safety (BBS) program. Our guidelines were expanded by promoting the need for vaccination. We also supported our employees in receiving the vaccine and gaining access to adequate medical care in case of illness. In some areas, lockdowns caused our staff to remain at company premises overnight. In other areas, return-to-office/site was introduced in phases. We continue to monitor conditions and make adjustments where necessary.\n\nWe're also supporting local communities in urgent need around the world. In Brazil, we donated food baskets to underprivileged communities struggling with unemployment. In Michigan, US, we supported the cultivation of more than 5,000 pounds of produce to meet the high demand for food. We also provided digital tools for children in India to ensure they could access online classes and continue to study while schools were closed. Meanwhile, in the UK, we supported STARS (Sexual Trauma and Recovery Services), based in Dorset. STARS offers support - such as free counseling and workshops - to help educate young people in schools, the vulnerable and victims of sexual and domestic abuse, who have been increasingly reaching out for support since the start of the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCaring for society and the communities in which we operate is a vital part of our global activity.

We aim to initiate more than 1,000 projects through AkzoNobel Cares and train more than 35,000 people in the community between 2020 and 2025.\n\nAkzoNobel Cares is focused on uplifting and renovating communities through our 'Let's Colour' initiative, as well as educating, mentoring and training future generations, unlocking possibilities for people who need them most.\n\nIn 2021, we staged 182 projects and trained 11,193 people in the community in various disciplines, such as painting, entrepreneurship and soft skills.\n\n## 'Let's Colour'\n\nThrough our 'Let's Colour' program, we continued to transform lives by revitalizing communities and making living spaces more liveable and inspiring. In 2021, we donated 237,000 liters of paint to renovate community living spaces in 31 countries, with more than 1,100 employees volunteering their time. In one of the projects, we used the transformative power of paint to help residents of Manavgat in Turkey rebuild their lives after the area was devastated by forest fires.

As a member of the YouthCan! platform, we helped to create more employment opportunities for 2,236 young people at risk by providing training in painting and offering soft skills programs, mentor and traineeships. The living spaces for SOS beneficiaries were also renewed and improved. In addition, we welcomed four more countries to our global partnership, bringing the total number of countries involved to 23.\n\n## Education Fund\n\nThrough our Education Fund, we continued to support Plan International's gender-transformative STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education in rural China. AkzoNobel colleagues participated in online sessions with the students, enabling them to benefit from insights and experiences they wouldn't gain at school. The girls in particular were able to meet female role models, who gave them extra motivation to pursue a career of their own choosing.\n\nIn India, we continued to run the AkzoNobel Paint Academy in four cities, offering skills development to young people in need. Once the training is completed, participants will have opportunities to gain employment with paint contractors and automotive body shops. During 2021, we also continued to promote diversity and inclusion focused skill training to disadvantaged groups and sections of society in order to help bridge inequality. For example, we gave training to women and found them jobs as painters. Another project involved training prisoners and inmates of juvenile homes, with a number of them having gone on to start new careers as painters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 around the world brought a new reality and meant there were other potential human rights issues we needed to address. As a result, and in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles to continuously assess a company's salient human rights issues, we finalized our second in-depth salient human rights issues assessment. While we respect all human rights equally, we prioritized certain issues based on their severity and likelihood. These were established following internal data analysis, external trends and engagement with our stakeholders. For example, we held two (digital) workshops in China and India with external stakeholders, including NGO representatives and human rights experts.\n\nOur salient human rights issues remain much the same, although we better understand in which part(s) of the value chain the highest risks could occur, and which ones will shape our main focus.\n\nFor example, 'Negative impact on local communities' is now a stand-alone issue instead of a sub-issue under Health and Safety (the negative impacts can be broader than just health and safety). Our next steps include assessing our human rights initiatives and addressing them together with AkzoNobel's other functions and businesses. We've also created a new, more diverse Human Rights Committee, with a more robust governance (see Integrity and compliance management), and updated our human rights position statement.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nOur top priority is the safety of our people, those we work with and those who our products are offered to. This means we carry out due diligence on thousands of raw materials - some of which are high risk - looking at how they can impact our people, our sites and the communities around them.

For example, we're introducing our own Global Working Hours standard, ensuring that everywhere in the world, we're working a safe number of hours, even if local laws allow people to work longer. We're also reinforcing our efforts to integrate water, sanitation and hygiene assessments and audits into our Health, Safety and Security suite to ensure good sanitary conditions, the importance of which has been re-emphasized by COVID-19.\n\n## Discrimination and harassment\n\nEveryone should be comfortable in their working environment and feel they're treated with dignity and respect. In 2021, we signed up to the UN Women's Empowerment Principles. Our plans for the immediate future include rolling out a global 'trusted person' network, which involves having a trusted person at each location with over 100 employees. We're also aiming for at least 90% of online employees to complete inclusive behavior training and 70% of sites to have run our inclusive behavior workshop.\n\n## Impact on local communities\n\nWe aim to be a good neighbor and contribute to the well-being of communities. We work closely with local neighborhoods to manage the social impact of our business activities, address any concerns about our operations and enhance\n\nthe benefits we're able to bring. We're currently conducting due diligence into our sites to identify where we have risks in order to address any possible negative impact.\n\n## Modern slavery\n\nWe have zero tolerance for modern slavery, such as child or forced labor, and conduct relevant due diligence into our high risk supply chains. In 2021, we conducted in-depth research into our raw materials portfolio and added barytes, calcium carbonate, copper, fluorspar and talcum to our human rights due diligence in the supply chain. These were added to cobalt, mica minerals and tin, which were already in scope. We've surveyed all suppliers that directly, or indirectly, supply us these materials. By the end of the year, we had an 85% response rate. For cobalt and tin, we surveyed all 132 identified suppliers, using templates from the Responsible\n\nMinerals Initiative. Of those suppliers who confirmed using high risk materials necessary for the functionality of the product, 90% disclosed their smelters. In total, 87% of these smelters were either listed as active or conformant smelters in the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process. Suppliers with a 'conflict-free statement', but who didn't disclose the smelters in their supply chain, haven't been included, since our due diligence is based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply Chains. For the other materials, a third party sent out surveys to 180 suppliers to increase transparency of these supply chains. The results gave us further insight into our supply chain complexity and risks.

The RMI's mission is to establish a fair, responsible and sustainable mica supply chain in India that's free of child labor by 2030.\n\nUsed in a wide range of industries, mica minerals are mined extensively in India, where a variety of factors contribute to poor working conditions, including the use of child labor. Our leverage to change the situation is somewhat limited, due to our position in the supply chain several steps away from the mica mines and processing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nunits - and the relatively small amount of indirect mica sourcing.\n\nRather than deciding to stop sourcing products that contain mica from India - thereby eliminating the risk of indirectly sourcing products containing mica mined and processed under poor working conditions - we opted to increase our leverage through our RMI membership and do our utmost to bring about change.\n\nFollowing the RMI's pilot year, we continued to focus on\n\nthe issue and a commitment was made to conduct serious due diligence and look for creative ways to contribute to the initiative - which has now resulted in full membership.\n\n'Formalizing our membership demonstrates that we take our responsibility to respect human rights across our value chain very seriously and we're determined to be part of the solution,' says Anja Verbeke, AkzoNobel's Global Director of Integrity and Compliance.\n\nAkzoNobel closely monitors how mica is sourced and works hard to ensure that the supply chain which uses the mineral is made transparent, traceable and sustainable.",

In 2021, we reduced carbon emissions in our operations by 3% (relative) versus 2020, mainly through conversion to renewable electricity and footprint optimization. This means we've achieved a reduction of 21% compared with the 2018 baseline - bringing us closer to our 2025 interim ambition of 25%./uni00A0\n\n## Renewable electricity\n\nBy 2030, we aim to have shifted to 100% renewable electricity at all our locations. We've been installing solar panels at multiple sites and purchasing renewable electricity with certificates of origin. Our current total share of renewable electricity use is 45% globally, approaching our 2025 interim target of 50%. In total, 44 of our locations now use 100% renewable electricity, with 23 sites using solar panels as a supplementary source of energy. We plan to increase this number in the near future.\n\n## Energy reduction\n\nWe're aiming to cut our energy use by 30% by 2030 (baseline 2018). Initiatives such as using LED lighting systems,\n\n## 100% renewable electricity in Europe in 2022\n\nOur ambition to transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2030 is progressing well, with our operations in Europe having fully switched over by January 2022.\n\nConverting to renewable electricity is key to our overall ambition of halving carbon emissions in our own operations by 2030.\n\nWe first announced our ambition in 2020, with several\n\nEuropean countries among the first to achieve the 100% milestone, including the Netherlands, the UK, Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Spain, Germany and Sweden. We've since added more countries to the list, notably France, Poland, Russia and Italy.\n\nReaching 100% renewable electricity in Europe brings our total share to 45%, close to meeting our 2025 interim global target of 50%.\n\nreplacing chillers, optimizing compressed air systems and shutdown management have contributed greatly to this already.\n\nSo far, we've reduced energy per ton of production by 1% (relative) versus our 2018 levels. In 2021, our overall relative energy use remained at 1.83 TJ per ton of production, compared with 2020. However, due to the centralization of electricity procurement, part of the stores organization was elevated above the materiality threshold and was therefore included in our energy reporting as of 2021. This resulted in an increase of 3.5%, leading to the reported 1.89 TJ per ton of production. Structural energy efficiency improvements/uni00A0were offset by adverse effects (including product mix and inefficiencies due to raw material shortages), resulting in a 0.5% net increase. We also installed thermal oxidizers to reduce VOC emissions, as well as solvent recovery units to reduce our waste. Although these improvement projects led to an increase in energy use, they positively impacted our VOC emissions reduction and waste circularity (see Waste management).\n\nDriving energy efficiency and using\n\nmore renewable electricity across all our sites globally will have a significant impact on reducing our carbon emissions from our own operations - and will ultimately help to mitigate climate change.\n\n## Volatile organic compounds\n\nThe production of paints and coatings means we have emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which is included in our cradle-to-grave carbon footprint. We achieved a 6% (relative) improvement versus 2020 in VOC emissions per ton of product in our own operations, and a total of 41% (relative) versus the 2018 baseline.",

We continue to promote a circular economy as part of our focus on reducing waste in our manufacturing processes, and we're committed to reusing and recycling obsolete materials.\n\nFor waste, this means we're well on our way to zero waste to landfill (defined as <1% of total waste). In 2021, our waste to landfill reduced by 77% (absolute) versus 2020 (1,500 tons) to 2% of total waste in 2021. In total, there's been an 87% (absolute) reduction in waste to landfill versus the 2018 baseline.\n\nIn 2021, we achieved circular use for around 59% of our obsolete materials. We've identified new outlets for materials that would otherwise be disposed of as waste. Overall, this has resulted in waste avoidance of 9,460 tons, otherwise our total waste would be 14% (absolute) higher.\n\nOur relative waste (kg/ton of material produced) didn't improve (0%), and as a result, we didn't meet our 2021 internal goal of 5% overall. The reasons for this include new acquisitions - which may sometimes need to align with corporate standards - raw materials shortages (which can lead to manufacturing inefficiencies), and operational and supply chain challenges. We're driving various global programs, such as wash water recycling and solvent recovery units, to further reduce our waste.\n\nOur ambition is to reuse water at all our most water intensive sites. We mainly use water for cooling (77%, chemically unchanged) at a handful of our production locations in low water risk areas. Water is also used as a raw material in production and for cleaning. A site is considered water intensive if it uses more than 15,000m 3 per year, excluding cooling water. Currently, we have 47 sites that are considered water intensive per the definition,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n31.4*\n\nNon-reusable\n\nWaste",

In 2021, this was achieved by 14 out of those 47 sites.\n\nWe're improving by focusing on recycling and reusing process water by treating our wastewater on-site, or via third parties. We also adapt formulations, enabling us to reuse water and reduce our freshwater consumption, and we're moving towards waterless cleaning to help reduce our freshwater consumption.\n\nTwo major projects to install around 8,000 solar panels were completed at sites in China - helping to accelerate our ambition of cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030. The panels were installed at two of our Decorative Paints plants - more than 5,000 in Shanghai and almost 3,000 in Guangzhou representing further progress for our greener manufacturing plans.\n\n## Climate change adaptation and water risk\n\nAs recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we continue to monitor our risks and opportunities related to climate change. As a company, we're exposed to physical risks - such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events. We also consider transitional risks that can lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations.\n\nFor the last six years, we've implemented an internal carbon price for investment decisions, anticipating the impact of any future carbon pricing. We have sustainability assessments in place for investment projects, including water risk assessment for new locations. Annually, we also quantify the potential transitional risk impact of any global carbon taxation by multiplying our carbon footprint with the internal carbon price. The financial impact is well below 1% of revenues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continue to work closely with our suppliers to create value and continuously improve both our sustainability and their own. Collaborating and innovating with our suppliers is key to achieving our ambition to reduce carbon emissions across the whole value chain (see Carbon emissions in our value chain).\n\nIn 2021, we continued to assess and improve our suppliers' sustainability practices using programs and partners provided by Together for Sustainability (TfS). Since 2019, we've lowered our spend threshold from \u20ac1 million to \u20ac250,000 for our multi-year supplier sustainability risk program.\n\nWe have kept suppliers in the sustainability assessment program, even if their spend temporarily dropped below our spend threshold, due to the impact of COVID-19. We also added logistics providers and suppliers in low risk regions, but with significant spend\n\nWe continue to assess risks related to water. We use the Aqueduct water risk atlas developed by the World Resources Institute to assess the level of risk related to water at our production locations. Around 10% of our sites are in areas rated 'extremely high' for overall water risk (with standard weighting factors). Aqueduct is also used to assess current climate related risks (coastal flooding, river flooding and drought). Around 14% of our locations are in areas rated 'extremely high'. These account for 3% of our fresh water use.\n\nFuture risks for 2030 were also evaluated using Aqueduct (water stress, business as usual). Around 25% of our locations are in areas rated 'extremely high', accounting for 7% of our fresh water use. All locations confirmed as 'extremely high' in any of these assessments will develop a risk mitigation plan.\n\nWe continued to assess our suppliers in 2021 and challenged them on their water risk, particularly in regions affected by river or coastal flooding. We're working with them to look for solutions to these challenges.",

We've started to roll out this recycled content in our plastic packaging in various European markets.\n\nIn 2022, we'll accelerate the implementation of plastic packaging containing recycled content together with our suppliers.\n\nAll the pieces fell perfectly into place when our Inca brand supported a project to celebrate diversity in Uruguay. Artist Ximena Fern\u00e1ndez Castro used our products to paint a colorful puzzle mural onto a wall surrounding a children's play area in the La Blanqueada district of Montevideo. The 'Let's Colour' project was promoted by the local municipality. A great way to use color to communicate an important message.",

Given our focus on sustainability, overall ownership of sustainability is with the CEO.\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nWe use the principle of materiality to review our strategic priorities and assess the topics included in the Sustainability statements of this Report 2021. During 2021, we updated the methodology to\n\n## Materiality matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndetermine and prioritize those topics most material to our company and our stakeholders. We've determined the most material topics for a company in our industry, based on the material topics identified by reporting frameworks (e.g. GRI and SASB) and sustainability indexes (e.g. EcoVadis, Sustainalytics). The internal and external importance for each of these material topics are determined and validated annually and reported in our annual report. More details can be found on our website.\n\nBased on the assessment to determine the most material topics for our industry, biodiversity and land use do not show as a material topic. Nevertheless, we recognize the importance of this in society. We continue to disclose metrics related to biodiversity - such as emissions (carbon, NOx, SOx, and VOC) and pollutant emissions (COD) on our website and in our annual report. We continue to further investigate the materiality of biodiversity and land use.\n\n## Topic\n\n## Report 2021\n\n## Reporting principles and frameworks\n\nWhen combining disclosures in this Report 2021 with disclosures on our website, we report in accordance with 2021 GRI standards. We're also in the process of fully implementing the recommendation of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the World Economic Forum (WEF). In addition to an index table for GRI, TCFD and WEF, we provide an index table on the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) on our website.\n\nWe use our internally developed reporting principles to make our reporting more precise and better aligned with our business and operations. They are aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. The complete reporting principles can be found on our website, while a summary is included in the Appendix of this Report 2021.\n\n| A   Climate change adaptation                     | Climate change adaptation and water risk                                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| B   Diverse, inclusive and   healthy organization | Employees                                                                   |\n| C   Emissions and energy                          | Carbon emissions in own operations and  carbon emissions in our value chain |\n| D   Health and safety   employees and customers   | Health and safety                                                           |\n| E   Human rights                                  | Human rights                                                                |\n| F   Sustainable product   portfolio               | Sustainable solutions                                                       |\n| G   Community involvement                         | AkzoNobel Cares                                                             |\n| H   Materials and waste                           | Waste and water management                                                  |\n| I Responsible procurement                         | Responsible procurement                                                     |\n| J   Water and wastewater                          | Waste and water management                                                  |",

More details on the methodology and significant assumptions can be found in the reporting principles on our website.\n\n## EU taxonomy disclosure\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation establishes the framework for the EU taxonomy by setting out four conditions that an economic activity must meet in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable. A qualifying activity must:\n\n- \u00b7   Contribute substantially to one or more of six environmental objectives, being:\n- 1.  Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. Transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n- \u00b7   Do no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives\n- \u00b7   Be carried out in compliance with minimum (social) safeguards\n- \u00b7   Comply with technical screening criteria. The technical screening criteria specify the performance requirements for any economic activity that determine under what conditions that activity makes a substantial contribution to a given environmental objective and does not significantly harm the other objectives\n\nThe above environmental objectives are/will be further detailed out with technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the six\n\nobjectives. For the financial year 2021, two of the six objectives listed above have been further detailed out and are applicable for reporting in 2021: climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. Companies are required to report on the proportion of turnover (revenues), capital expenditures (Capex) and operating expenditures (Opex) that is associated with environmentally sustainable economic activities. For the purpose of the calculation of eligible activities, the following financial information has been derived from AkzoNobel's 2021 financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7   Revenues is consolidated external revenues as reported in our consolidated statement of income\n- \u00b7   Capital expenditures is the sum of additions in property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets from both investments and acquisitions resulting from business combinations. Note that capital expenditures as included in the 2021 financial statements excludes the impact from right-of-use assets, as well as the impact from acquisitions resulting from business combinations\n- \u00b7   Operating expenditures is calculated in accordance with the EU taxonomy as direct non-capitalized costs incurred for the day-to-day servicing of assets, consisting of research and development costs, short-term leases, maintenance and repair costs and other similar costs. This definition differs from operating expenses as included in our consolidated statement of income. As the operating expenses in accordance with the EU taxonomy are not significant for AkzoNobel, we make use of the exemption in the EU taxonomy and disclose 0% eligibility for Opex\n\nThe core activities of AkzoNobel, being the manufacturing of paints and coatings, are not considered to be among the largest potential contributors to climate change mitigation and climate change adaption by nature. Therefore, AkzoNobel's core activity (manufacturing\n\nof paints and coatings) is not defined as an eligible activity for EU taxonomy by the legislator. As a result, the company does not have any eligible revenues under the EU taxonomy.\n\nThe outcomes of the EU taxonomy assessment for 2021 in relation to the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation environmental objectives can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7   Revenues: Per the EU taxonomy definitions, AkzoNobel does not have any eligible activities and therefore no eligible revenues\n- \u00b7   Capex: Eligible activities amount to 3% of Capex\n- \u00b7   Opex: Eligible activities amount to 0% of Opex\n\nAlthough we have limited eligible activities under the current EU taxonomy, which mainly consist of investments in water treatment units and solar panels, around 39% of our revenue comes from sustainable solutions (see Paint section) and our current total share of renewable electricity use is 45% globally (see Planet section). In addition, our innovation investments are focused around increasing sustainable solutions in our product portfolio.\n\nIn addition, in 2021, our carbon reduction target of 50% reduction by 2030 for the full value chain was assessed and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. Our ambition is in line with the 1.5\u02daC pathway, as defined in the Paris Agreement and demonstrates our clear commitment to climate change mitigation. For our own operations, we have already reduced our relative carbon footprint by 21%, closing in on our 2025 interim target of 25% (see Planet section).\n\nWe also continued to monitor the risks and opportunities related to climate change following the recommendations of the TCFD (see Planet section).",

It's the\n\nstory of how Dutch startup Alucha entered our inaugural\n\nglobal challenge in 2019 and, two years later, is engaged\n\nin a pilot project with AkzoNobel to supply a circular raw\n\nmaterial - extracted from paper sludge - which is being\n\nused in one of our products.\n\nBased in Arnhem, Alucha develops innovative waste\n\nrecycling solutions. They entered our first ever Paint the\n\nFuture startup challenge hoping to generate interest for\n\ntheir circular alternative to calcium carbonate, a mineral\n\nwhich is applied in paint and fillers. After being named\n\nas one of the five winners, a sourcing agreement was\n\nput in place and we started working together.\n\nThe potential was obvious. They were developing an\n\nextraction technology for recovering minerals and bio-oil\n\nfrom paper sludge which promised major sustainability\n\nbenefits. Using Alucha's circular solution can take\n\nmining of calcium carbonate out of the equation.\n\nWith the feedstock being paper sludge, it also upcycles\n\npart of a waste stream, contributing to the circular\n\neconomy. All important factors when considering our\n\nscience-based target of reducing carbon emissions by\n\n50% across the full value chain by 2030.\n\n'Calcium carbonate traditionally comes out of mines\n\nand quarries in great quantities and is used in a variety\n\nof everyday products, many of which are eventually\n\nwatch video\n\nthrown away,' explains Alucha CEO, Gijs Jansen\n\n(pictured). 'Either way, you lose the calcium carbonate,\n\nwith any subsequent burning through waste incineration\n\ngenerating carbon emissions. Our technology to\n\nrecover calcium carbonate means less waste and less\n\nreliance on mining.'\n\nAs part of a pilot project, we carried out extensive\n\ntesting with Alucha to find a suitable product. Their\n\ncircular mineral is now being used as an alternative\n\nfor mined calcium carbonate and clay in one of our\n\npre-deco exterior/masonry fillers. The launch product\n\nwill become available as part of our Moltofill Aussen\n\nrange in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and as part\n\nof our Polyfilla Exterior Plaster range in France, Italy and\n\nBelgium. The product meets our criteria of 'reduced,\n\nreused and renewed material use', qualifying as a\n\nsustainable solution and helping our customers to work\n\nwith more circular products.\n\nOur ongoing work with Alucha clearly illustrates that\n\nachieving our People. Planet. Paint. ambitions relies\n\nheavily on collaborative innovation, and it will help to\n\nguide our future partnerships.\n\nAlucha is now planning to open its first circular calcium\n\ncarbonate production facility. The aim is to start with\n\na small scale operation (75 tons), and increase this to\n\n13 kilotons per year in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## STATEMENT OF CHAIR OF SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nOver the last two years, COVID-19 has impacted the world, people, habits and businesses in a massive way. It has created unpredictability, volatility, challenges and opportunities to varying degrees across industries.\n\nFor AkzoNobel, the lockdowns resulted in a surge in demand for decorative paints, initially in the do-it-yourself sector. More recently, demand also increased in professional channels, with people deciding to invest in upgrading their homes as they were spending more time in them. The market for performance coatings - AkzoNobel's largest business area - suffered during 2020, but is now showing signs of rebounding as investment in construction and other industries starts to return.\n\nHaving navigated supply chain issues and various other challenges in 2020 to successfully deliver on its 15 by 20 ambition, 2021 was the first year that AkzoNobel could fully focus on its new Grow & Deliver strategy. Building on the progress made during the last five years, the attention is now on returning the company to growth rates that are at least at industry levels, and growing margins with an ambition of delivering significant progress in earnings and strengthened market positions over the coming years.\n\nFrom an operations perspective, 2021 proved to be just as challenging as 2020. The many headwinds resulting from COVID-19 persisted, with the stress on the global supply chain having a particular impact. The company responded well, however, and was able to limit most of the effects that the restricted supplies of raw materials could have had on service levels to our customers.\n\nThe biggest challenge in 2021 came from the almost unprecedented increases in costs and transportation, which put our margins and profitability\n\nunder severe pressure. Management identified these challenges very early on and implemented significant price increases, which were needed to protect profitability and the health of the company in a timely and highly professional manner. As a result of this, and the strong implementation of strategic and operational initiatives, the company was able to deliver a significant increase in turnover, driven by both higher prices and increasing volumes. The company's absolute results from operations were in line with last year's strong performance, although the operating margin was, as expected, lower than 2020. The Supervisory Board is very satisfied with the result and the fact that AkzoNobel's ability to compete and win in its global markets has been further strengthened.\n\nMuch of the management focus during the year had to be on operating margin and ensuring that customer demand was met. However, securing long-term progress on the company's Grow & Deliver strategy was also a priority and we were gradually able to shift our attention back to this as we spent more time discussing growth opportunities and progress on strategic initiatives in Supervisory Board meetings. It's important that the company continues to move forward and we were impressed with the progress made in a number of important areas, where we saw the organization stepping up despite various distractions.\n\nParticipation in the company's organizational health survey hit an all-time high, as did engagement levels.

If Supervisory Board members are unable to attend a Supervisory Board or committee meeting, they inform the relevant Chair of their reasons.

In 2021, the Board of Management attended all regular and all additional meetings. The Executive Committee attended the majority of the meetings. Almost all plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board were preceded or succeeded by executive sessions of the Supervisory Board, with or without the CEO in attendance. The Chair had regular one-on-one calls with all Supervisory Board members to discuss individual impressions on the functioning of the Supervisory Board and items covered.\n\nThe Supervisory Board aims for all (regular) meetings to be held physically.

During 2021, the Supervisory Board continued to assess sustainability as part of strategy and targets. During the semi-annual progress updates on sustainability, the Supervisory Board reviewed and advised on the ambitions set out by the company's People. Planet.

The Supervisory Board reviewed the company's response to climate change, focusing on efforts to reduce emissions across the whole value chain (including Scope 1, 2 and 3) to achieve the announced sciencebased targets. Other topics discussed included the further strengthening of our sustainability governance by introducing the NextGen Sustainability Council.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was pleased to see the company continuing to benefit from management's strategic initiatives, including cost savings.\n\nThe company's People.

Forward looking targets were also addressed in light of these reviews, and both the proposed budget and operating plan for 2022 were diligently reviewed by the Supervisory Board in Q4, taking into account the supply chain situation and other prevailing market conditions. Following this assessment, the Supervisory Board has approved the proposed budget and operating plan for 2022.\n\nDuring the year, the Supervisory Board was pleased to see the company continuing to benefit from management's strategic initiatives, including its focus on strong margin management when facing significant raw material cost inflation. The nature of this performance and the company's capital allocation priorities were all considered in the Supervisory Board's approval of the dividend proposal (further details on the 2021 dividend proposal can be found in the Financial information).\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Supervisory Board views risk management as an essential mechanism to safeguard the business and assets of the company, and to secure long-term performance and value creation.

Michael Friede was appointed as Chief Commercial Officer - Performance Coatings per July 1, 2021, with the CEO continuing to represent all commercial aspects of Decorative Paints in the Executive Committee.

Each member of the Supervisory Board meets the independence requirements of the Corporate Governance Code and completed the annual independence questionnaire addressing the relevant requirements for independence.\n\n## Supervisory Board evaluation\n\nTo assess its effectiveness, the Supervisory Board carried out an internal performance evaluation of itself, its individual members, its Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the Chair, as well as the relationship with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. The process consisted of Supervisory Board members completing a confidential questionnaire.\n\nThe Chair had one-on-one calls with all Supervisory Board members to discuss individual impressions on the functioning of the Supervisory Board and items covered in 2021. In a separate meeting without the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board discussed the results of the evaluation questionnaires. The Supervisory Board also discussed the functioning of the Board of Management, the performance of its individual\n\nmembers and reflected on the improvement areas agreed during last year's evaluation.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is pleased to confirm the evaluation concluded that the Supervisory Board and its committees continue to operate proficiently. There's a dynamic and open atmosphere between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Committee. Sufficient time was allocated to discuss the topics that reflected the future strategic priorities for the company. Adequate time was spent on the different business units and (virtually) meeting with AkzoNobel's people around the world.

(PwC).\n\nThe financial statements and the report were extensively discussed by the Audit Committee with the external auditors,\n\nin the presence of the CFO, and by the full Supervisory Board with the Board of Management and the Executive Committee. Based on these discussions, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the 2021 financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.\\/. form an adequate basis to account for the supervision provided (see the Financial information). The Audit Committee monitors the follow-up by management on the recommendations made by the external auditors. The Supervisory Board recommends that the AGM adopts the financial statements as presented in this Report 2021 and, as proposed by the Board of Management, the proposed total dividend for 2021 of \u20ac1.98 (2020: \u20ac1.95), including a final dividend of \u20ac1.54 per share. An interim dividend of \u20ac0.44 (2020: \u20ac0.43) per share was paid in November 2021. This reflects the continued commitment to providing a stable to rising dividend. The dividend will be paid in cash.\n\nIn addition, it is requested that the AGM discharges the members of the Board of Management from their responsibility for the conduct of business in 2021 and the members of the Supervisory Board for their supervision in 2021.\n\n## AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nAll Audit Committee members have extensive accounting and financial management expertise.

The Audit Committee held independent meetings with the external auditor and critically reviewed and constructively challenged their audit approach, fees, risk assessment and audit plan for the year ahead.\n\nThe Audit Committee performed an annual review of the services of the external auditor, and at each meeting considered and assessed the status of the auditor's independence. Further details on the external auditor can be found in the Corporate governance statement.\n\n## Risk management and internal control systems\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the company's overall approach to governance, risk management and internal controls, its processes,\n\noutcomes, financial reporting and disclosures. It received regular updates from auditors and functions and was provided with comprehensive risk and internal control reports during the year. In its review, the Audit Committee considered the impact of changes to systems and processes, such as the IT landscape rationalization and the implementation of regional accounting centers on the internal controls. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed the annual operating plan (including budget) and AkzoNobel's dividend proposals, as well as multiple IT security and control updates. During 2021, the Audit Committee received and reviewed several updates on AkzoNobel's Internal Control Framework. The Audit Committee also met regularly with senior executives.

The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees this responsibility.\n\n## Business and function reviews\n\nIn fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in relation to risk management and internal control systems, the Audit Committee also received updates from functions such as Finance, Treasury, Information Management and Tax throughout the year. These updates also inform the\n\nAudit Committee's review of the annual operational plan, including budget. During 2021, the Audit Committee reviewed and advised on the company's roadmap on sustainability reporting.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Auditor presented all main audit findings to the Audit Committee and discussed the progress of the audit plan. During the year, the Audit Committee approved Internal Audit's plan and strategy, and also agreed on the budget and resource requirements for the function. The Audit Committee also met separately with the Internal Auditor during the year to discuss the results of the audits performed and the status of the follow-up on action plans identified. In 2021, the Audit Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function.\n\n## Results and financial statements\n\nBefore each publication of the quarterly results and the financial statements, the Audit Committee reviewed the financial results. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed and commented on the interim and final dividend proposals and on reports and press releases to be published. This was in addition to the work undertaken by the company's Disclosure Committee in reviewing the company's disclosure of potentially price sensitive information.

        "page_content": "AkzoNobel aspires to the highest standards of corporate governance and seeks to consistently enhance and improve corporate governance performance, emphasizing transparency and a sustainable culture of longterm value creation.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a public limited liability company (naamloze vennootschap) established under the laws of the Netherlands, with common shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam. AkzoNobel has a sponsored level 1 American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program and ADRs can be traded on the international OTCQX platform in the US.\n\nThe company's management and supervision are organized under Dutch law in a so-called two-tier system, comprising a Board of Management (solely composed of executive directors) and a Supervisory Board (solely composed of non-executive directors). The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Board of Management and ensures a strong external presence in the governance of the company. The two Boards are independent of each other and are accountable to the annual general meeting of shareholders (AGM) for the performance of their functions.\n\nOur corporate governance framework is based on the company's Articles of Association, the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') and all applicable laws and regulations, including securities laws. The Code contains principles and best practices for Dutch companies with listed shares. Deviations from the Code are explained in accordance with the Code's 'comply\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nor explain' principle. For the full version of the Code, visit www.mccg.nl\n\nWith the exception of those aspects of our governance which can only be amended with the approval of the AGM, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board may make adjustments to the way the Code is applied, if this is considered to be in the best interests of the company. Where changes are made, these will be reported and explained in the annual report for the relevant year and discussed at the subsequent AGM.\n\n## BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. When it comes to the management of our business, it operates in the context of an Executive Committee. The Executive Committee comprises the members of the Board of Management (currently the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)), the Chief Supply Chain Officer, Chief Manufacturing Officer, Chief Commercial Officer - Performance Coatings, the General Counsel and the Chief Human Resources Officer.\n\nThe composition of the Executive Committee ensures that functional,\n\noperational and commercial expertise is entrenched at the highest level of the organization. Among other responsibilities, the Board of Management defines the company's strategic direction. It establishes and maintains internal policies and procedures for effective risk management and control, manages the realization of the company's operational and financial targets, its sustainability performance and its pursuit of longterm value creation. In fulfilling their duties, Board of Management members are assisted by the Executive Committee and guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprises, taking into consideration the relevant interests of the company's stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of Management and Executive Committee promote openness and engagement through a SpeakUp! grievance mechanism and have established a Code of Conduct, policies, rules and procedures incorporated in the company's Policy framework, in order to drive a culture of good governance, consistency and functional excellence. The values of good governance, sustainability and teamwork adopted by the Board of Management are incorporated in these documents. The Board of Management believes these values contribute to a culture focused on long-term value creation",

Since 2018, Insight surveys have been performed involving all employees, focused on our wider organizational health (see the Sustainability statements). The Executive Committee and Supervisory Board regularly discuss the results of the survey, the targets and the actions taken to achieve such targets.\n\nThe Board of Management takes precedence; all Executive Committee decisions require a majority of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Management can decide to reserve decisions for itself. The members of the Board of Management remain accountable for all decisions made by the Executive Committee. The Board of Management is accountable for its performance to the Supervisory Board and is accountable to the shareholders of the company at the AGM. The Executive Committee members who are not also members of the Board of Management report to the CEO.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has regular, direct interaction with all members of the Executive Committee and all Executive Committee members attend most Supervisory Board meetings.\n\nThe CEO leads the Executive Committee in its overall management of the company. He is the main point of liaison with the Supervisory Board. The CFO is responsible for overseeing AkzoNobel's\n\nfinances, its corporate control, investor relations and information management.\n\nThe tasks, responsibilities and procedures of the Board of Management and Executive Committee are set out in their Rules of Procedure. These rules have been approved by the Supervisory Board and are available on our website. Authority to represent the company is vested in the two members of the Board of Management, acting jointly. The Board of Management has also delegated a level of authority to corporate agents, including the other members of the Executive Committee. The list of authorized signatories is filed with, and available from, the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Directors of the company's business units and the Corporate Directors in charge of the different functions report to individual Executive Committee members with specific responsibility for their activities and performance.\n\n## Appointment\n\nBoard of Management members are appointed and removed from office by the AGM. The current Board of Management members were first appointed by EGMs (Extraordinary General Meetings) held in 2017, with the CEO being reappointed for another two-year term at the AGM in 2021. The other members of the Executive Committee are appointed by the CEO, after consultation with the Supervisory Board. Board of Management members are appointed for a term not exceeding four years, with the possibility of reappointment.\n\nAs described later in this section, the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares has the right to make binding nominations for the appointment of members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. However, as the company subscribes to the principles of the Code in general, members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are (with the exception\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe extended our successful partnership with Mercedes-Benz, one of the world's most renowned automotive brands. Through our Sikkens brand, we'll continue to be a recommended supplier of vehicle refinish products and services in China and a preferred partner in Indonesia for another four years.\n\nof those circumstances described later in this section) appointed on the basis of non-binding nominations by the Supervisory Board. In such cases, resolutions to appoint a member of the Supervisory Board or the Board of Management require a simple majority of the votes cast by shareholders.\n\nUnder certain conditions specified in the Articles of Association, shareholders may also be entitled to nominate Supervisory Board or Board of Management members for appointment. Such appointments require a two-thirds majority, representing at least 50% of the outstanding share capital, in order to be adopted at an AGM (or EGM).\n\n## Diversity\n\nAkzoNobel believes in the strength of diversity and, in accordance with the Code, a Diversity Policy has been adopted for the composition of the Board of Management and Executive Committee. The objective of the Diversity Policy is to enrich the Board of Management's perspective, improve performance, increase member value and enhance the probability of achievement of the company's goals and objectives. The Diversity Policy addresses concrete targets relating to diversity, including nationality, age, gender, education and work background. More information on the",

        "page_content": "progress on our commitment to diversity and inclusion can be found in the Sustainability statements.\n\nA consistent and structured approach is applied to succession planning for the Board of Management and Executive Committee, taking into account the implementation of the Diversity Policy. AkzoNobel currently diverges from the gender target of at least 30% female and at least 30% male Board of Management members.\n\nIt is believed that due to the size of the Board of Management (being only two members), this divergence is justified and has ensured the best candidates for the roles were nominated by the Supervisory Board and appointed by shareholders. Following the appointment of Michael Friede, Karen-Marie Katholm and Hilka Schneider as new Chief Commercial Officer - Performance Coatings, Chief Supply Chain Officer and\n\nCommittee had a conflict of interest which was of material significance to the company and to the relevant member.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe current remuneration policy for the Board of Management was last amended following approval by the AGM held on April 22, 2021. The details of this policy can be found in the Remuneration report. The service contracts of the members of the Board of Management contain change of control provisions. Further details can be found in the Remuneration report and Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements. The service contracts of the Board of Management are compliant with the Code. The main elements of these contracts are available on our website.\n\n## Operational Control Cycle\n\nThe Executive Committee holds regular meetings to discuss the implementation\n\n## AkzoNobel has a gender diversity of 43% female representatives at Executive Committee level\n\nGeneral Counsel respectively, AkzoNobel has a gender diversity of 43% female representatives at Executive Committee level. More information on AkzoNobel's overall diversity and inclusion efforts can be found in the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Outside directorships\n\nSpecific rules on outside board positions of members of the Executive Committee - which are more stringent than the requirements of the Dutch Civil Code can be found in the Rules of Procedure.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nDuring 2021, no transactions were reported under which a member of the Board of Management or Executive\n\nof the company's strategy and functional agendas. Additional meetings are held to discuss specific topics as required. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have delegated authorities to individual Executive Committee members and to certain\n\ncommittees and councils. To help plan for success and ensure alignment within the entire AkzoNobel organization on the strategic and operational plan, an Integrated Business Planning (IBP) process across the company's global businesses and functions is in place. IBP provides, on a monthly basis, visibility on the long-term integrated business and financial plan, which covers the product portfolio, demand and supply. It therefore ensures early attention and remedial actions, where appropriate, on any potential gaps. The monthly IBP cycle ends with the Corporate Management Business Review (CMBR), which is chaired by the CEO. The Executive Committee attends the CMBR meetings, where\n\nit reviews the consolidated long-term company perspective, including risks and opportunities, decides on escalation and possible scenarios and supervises the key performance indicators with corrective actions, if applicable.\n\n## COMMITTEES\n\n## Sustainability Council\n\nThe Executive Committee has established a Sustainability Council to advise on sustainability developments. The council monitors the integration of sustainability into management processes and oversees the company's sustainability targets and performance. It further ensures the alignment of sustainability activities across functions and businesses. The council, which meets quarterly, consists of business unit and functional directors, as well as the CEO. As of 2021, the Chair of the NextGen Council is also part of the Sustainability Council.\n\nSignificant sustainability aspects material to the company are reviewed annually,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur CEO, Thierry Vanlancker, attended a meeting of the European CEO Alliance - a cross-industry effort to fight climate change, build economic resilience and help make a success of the EU Green Deal. He gave his backing to policy recommendations supporting a progressive and ambitious push to achieve climate neutrality. Proposals included facilitating the transformation of the buildings sector - which is of particular interest to AkzoNobel - and speeding up the restructuring and renewal of the energy system in all EU member states.",

The Audit Committee takes an active role in assessing the quality and reliability of sustainable performance reporting and PwC has been engaged to perform an assurance engagement on specific indicators included in the Sustainability statements. Their report can be found in the Financial information.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee\n\nThe Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee reviews investigations into material violations of laws, regulations and internal rules, as well as SpeakUp! reports. It also decides on disciplinary measures and control improvement actions, and monitors and responds to any trends or irregularities. By submitting these cases through a central Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee, the company ensures transparency and consistency of measures throughout the organization. More details can be found on page 78.\n\n## Executive Pensions Committee\n\nThe Executive Pensions Committee oversees the general pension policies of AkzoNobel's various pension plans and their financial consequences for the company. The committee is chaired by the CFO and includes the Chief Human Resources Officer, the General Counsel and Corporate Directors of Treasury, Pensions and Rewards.\n\n## Disclosure Committee\n\nThe Board of Management has established a Disclosure Committee, which consists of senior executives with a\n\nbackground in corporate law, finance and investor relations. The task of the Disclosure Committee is to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures, and to advise the CEO, CFO and General Counsel on the accurate and timely disclosure of material financial and non-financial information.\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nThis section provides an overview of the responsibilities and governance of the Supervisory Board. For an understanding of the activities of the Supervisory Board over the past year, refer to the Statement of the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Report of the Supervisory Board. The responsibility of the Supervisory Board is to supervise the policies adopted by the Board of Management and the Executive Committee and to oversee the general conduct of the business of the company. In practice, this means supervising:\n\n- \u00b7   The corporate strategy\n- \u00b7  The achievement of the company's operational and financial objectives\n- \u00b7  The design and effectiveness of internal risk management and control systems\n- \u00b7  The main financial parameters, compliance with applicable laws and regulations and risk factors\n\nThe Supervisory Board advises the Board of Management and Executive Committee, while taking into account the interests of the company and its stakeholders. Major investments, acquisitions and functional initiatives are subject to Supervisory Board approval.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is governed by its Rules of Procedure (available on our website). The Rules of Procedure include the profile and the charters of the Committees, which set out the tasks and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board, as well as its operational processes.\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Composition\n\nIn compliance with the Dutch Civil Code, the Supervisory Board has a balanced composition reflecting the nature and variety of the company's businesses, their international spread and expertise in fields such as finance, economics, information technology (IT), societal, environmental and legal aspects of business, government and public administration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board maintains a skills matrix, which provides an overview of the skills and experience of the individual members. The skills matrix can be found in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, in accordance with the Code, a Diversity Policy has been adopted for the composition of the Supervisory Board in its Rules of Procedure. The objective of this policy is to ensure a balanced composition, taking account of nationality, age, gender, education and work background. For 2021, there are no divergences to report.\n\nWhen nominating and selecting new candidates for the Supervisory Board,",

It means we've now coated four of the world's most iconic observation wheels, the others being the London Eye, Melbourne Star Observation Wheel and Singapore Flyer.\n\nidentical to those previously outlined for the members of the Board of Management. In accordance with the Code, Supervisory Board members are eligible for re-election once for a period not exceeding four years. Members may be re-elected a second time for a period of two years. This period may be extended by two years at the most. In the event of a reappointment after an eight-year period, reasons must be given in the Report of the Supervisory Board. Terms of appointment are based on a reappointment scheme, available on our website. In 2021, one reappointment to the Supervisory Board was proposed to, and approved by, the AGM held on April 22, 2021.\n\n## Induction and training\n\nFollowing appointment to the Supervisory Board, new members\n\nsenior management, as well as site visits. This enables new Supervisory Board members to quickly build up an understanding of AkzoNobel's businesses and strategy, as well as the key risks and issues the company faces. In addition, the Chair ensures the Supervisory Board is provided with regular updates, attends business unit deep dives and ensures that the Supervisory Board undertakes training, for example in the area of compliance and ethics.\n\n## Conflict of interest\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board shall not participate in the discussions and decision-making on a subject or transaction in relation to which they have a conflict of interest with the company. Decisions to enter into transactions under which Supervisory\n\nBoard members have conflicts of interest that are of material significance to the company, and to the relevant Supervisory Board member, require the approval of the Supervisory Board. Any such decisions will be recorded in the annual report for the relevant year, with reference to the conflict of interest and a declaration that the relevant best practice provisions of the Code have been complied with. During 2021, no transactions were reported under which a member had a conflict of interest which was of material significance to the company and to the relevant member.\n\n## Remuneration of the Supervisory Board\n\nSupervisory Board members receive a fixed annual remuneration and attendance fee, which is determined by the AGM. According to the Code, it is not possible for members to be remunerated in shares. An amendment to the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board was approved at the AGM held on April 22, 2021. More information on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the Remuneration Policy of the Supervisory Board can be found in the Remuneration report and Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established three permanent committees - the Audit Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee. Information on the activities, composition and attendance of the Supervisory Board members at the meetings of the committees during the year is set out in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nEach committee has a charter describing its role and responsibilities, as well as the manner in which it discharges its duties and reports to the full Supervisory Board.

The committees report on their deliberations and findings to the full Supervisory Board.\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS AND THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\nThe AGM is an integral part of the governance of the company and its system of checks and balances. The AGM reviews the annual report and decides on the adoption of the financial statements and the dividend proposal, as well as the discharge and (re)appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management.\n\nThe AGM is convened by public notice and the agenda, notes to the agenda and the procedure for attendance and voting at the meeting are published in advance and posted on our website. Matters proposed for consideration, approval or adoption are tabled as separate agenda items and explained in writing in advance of the meeting.\n\nThese proposals include, where relevant:\n\n- \u00b7  Adoption of the financial statements\n- \u00b7  Dividend proposal\n- \u00b7  Discharge of members of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management\n- \u00b7  (Re-)election of members of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board\n- \u00b7  Advisory vote on the Remuneration report\n- \u00b7  Other important matters, such as major acquisitions or the sale or demerger of a substantial part of the company, as required by law\n- \u00b7  Authorization of the Board of Management to issue new shares\n- \u00b7  Authorization of the Board of Management to repurchase shares\n- \u00b7  Remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board\n- \u00b7  Material changes to the remuneration policy of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Amendments to the Articles of Association (for more details see\n\nart. 57 of the Articles of Association, available on our website)\n\nThe company provides remote voting possibilities to its shareholders. Holding shares in the company on the record date determines the right to exercise voting rights and other rights relating to the AGM. All resolutions are made on the basis of the 'one share, one vote' principle (assuming an equal par value for each class of shares). All resolutions are adopted by absolute majority, unless the law or the company's Articles of Association stipulate otherwise.\n\nHolders of common shares in aggregate representing at least 1% of the total issued capital, or, according to the Official List of Euronext Amsterdam N.V., representing a value of at least \u20ac50 million, may submit proposals for the AGM agenda. Such proposals must be adequately substantiated and submitted in writing, or electronically, to the company at least 60 calendar days in advance of the meeting. Draft minutes of the AGM are made available on the company's website within three months of the meeting date. The final minutes are made available online within six months of the meeting date.\n\n## Share classes\n\nAkzoNobel has three classes of shares: common shares, cumulative preferred shares and priority shares. Common shares are traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Common shares are also traded over-the-counter on OTCQX in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts (each American Depositary Receipt representing one-third of a common share). On December 31, 2021, a total of 181.6 million common shares and 48 priority shares had been issued. This includes shares held in treasury which cannot be voted on and which are not eligible for dividend. Shareholders owning 3% or more of the issued capital and/or voting rights must report this to the Dutch Authority for\n\nthe Financial Markets (AFM) as soon as the threshold is reached or exceeded. Relevant reporting by shareholders can be found in the 'Register of substantial holdings and gross short positions' at www.afm.nl\n\nThe majority of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V. are included in a global certificate and held through the system maintained by the Dutch Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Nederland). In the past, Akzo Nobel N.V. also issued (physical) bearer share certificates (Bearer Certificates). A limited number of Bearer Certificates have not yet been surrendered to Akzo Nobel N.V., although holders of Bearer Certificates are entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V. It is noted that, as a result of Dutch legislation which became effective as of July 2019, the relevant shares were registered in the name of Akzo Nobel N.V. by operation of law as per January 1, 2021. Pursuant to this legislation, owners of Bearer Certificates will continue to be entitled to a corresponding number of shares in Akzo Nobel N.V. until January 2, 2026. On that date, their entitlement will expire by operation of law.\n\n## Related information\n\nFor more details about AkzoNobel shares and Bearer Certificates, contact Investor Relations:\n\ninvestor.relations@akzonobel.com\n\nThe priority shares are held by the Foundation Akzo Nobel (Stichting Akzo Nobel). The priority shares are limited in transferability and profit entitlement (see Note F of the Company financial statements). The Foundation's Board consists of members of AkzoNobel's Supervisory Board who are not members of the Audit Committee. The Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares has the nomination right for the appointment of members of the Board of Management",

Cumulative preferred shares merely have a financing function, which means if necessary, and possible, they will be issued at or near the prevailing quoted price for common shares.\n\nThe AGM held on April 22, 2021, authori zed the Board of Management for a period of 18 months after that date or, if earlier, until the date on which the AGM again extends the authorization - subject to approval from the Supervisory Board - to issue shares in the capital of the company free from preemptive rights, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital. The Board of Management was also given a mandate to acquire and to cancel held or acquired common shares in the company's share capital. The maximum number of shares that the company will hold in its own share capital at any time shall not exceed 10% of its issued share capital.\n\n## Anti-takeover provisions and control\n\nAccording to the Code, the company is required to provide an overview of its actual or potential anti-takeover measures, and to indicate in what circumstances it is expected that they may be used.\n\nThe priority shares may be considered to constitute a form of anti-takeover measure, in relation to the right of the Meeting of Holders of Priority Shares to make binding nominations for appointments to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The Foundation Akzo Nobel has confirmed that it intends to make use of such rights in exceptional circumstances only. These circumstances include situations where, in the opinion of the Board of the Foundation, the continuity of the company's management and policies is at stake.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA stylish mural was created at a multicultural center for women in the Netherlands, thanks to help from our Flexa brand. Six of our colleagues took part in the 'Let's Colour' project, which was all about brightening up the interior of the Jasmijn center in Groningen. Around 500 women from different backgrounds and cultures regularly use the center, which now has more inspiring surroundings in which to meet each other and follow a series of courses and activities.\n\nThis may be the case if a public bid for the common shares of the company has been announced, or has been made, or the justified expectation exists that such a bid will be made, without any agreement having been reached in relation to such a bid with the company. The same shall apply if one shareholder, or more shareholders acting in a concerted way, hold a substantial percentage of the issued common shares of the company without making an offer. Or if, in the opinion of the Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel, the exercise of the voting rights by one shareholder or more shareholders, acting in a concerted way, is materially in conflict with the interests of the company. In such cases, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management, in accordance with their statutory responsibility, will evaluate all available options with a view to serving the best interests of the company, its shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThe Board of the Foundation Akzo Nobel has reserved the right to make use of its binding nomination rights for the appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and of the Board of\n\nManagement in such circumstances. Although a deviation from provision 4.3.3 of the Code, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are of the opinion that these provisions will enhance the continuity of the company's management and policies.\n\nIn the event of a hostile takeover bid, or other action which the Board of Management and Supervisory Board consider adverse to the company's interests, the two Boards reserve the right to use all available powers (including the right to invoke a response time in accordance with provisions 4.1.6 and 4.1.7 of the Code), while taking into account the relevant interests of the company and its affiliate enterprises and stakeholders.\n\n## AUDITORS\n\nThe external auditor is appointed by the AGM on proposal of the Supervisory Board. The appointment is reviewed every four years and the results of this review and assessment are reported to the AGM. The external auditor attends all meetings of the Audit Committee, and the meeting",

In particular, the key audit matters are highlighted. The auditor receives the financial information and underlying reports of the quarterly figures and can comment on and respond to this information. The external auditor is present at the AGM and shareholders may ask questions with regard to the audit.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nThe Audit Committee and Board of Management report their dealings with the external auditor to the Supervisory Board annually, and also discuss the auditor's independence.\n\n## Other services\n\nOne area of particular focus in corporate governance is the independence of the auditors. The Audit Committee has been delegated direct responsibility for the compensation and monitoring of the auditors and the services they provide to the company. Pursuant to the Audit Profession Act, the auditors are prohibited from providing the company with services in the Netherlands other than 'audit services aimed at providing assurance concerning the information supplied by the audited client for the benefit of external users of this information and also for the benefit of the Supervisory Board as referred to in the reports mentioned.'\n\nThe company has taken the position that no additional services may be provided by the external auditor and its global network that do not meet these requirements, unless local statutory requirements so dictate. In order to anchor this in our procedures, the Supervisory Board adopted the AkzoNobel Rules on External Auditor Independence and Selection and the related AkzoNobeI Procedure on Auditor Independence. These documents are available on our website.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit function is mandated to provide the Board of Management, Executive Committee and Audit Committee with independent, objective assurance on the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness of the internal control framework described below. The Internal Auditor reports to the Board of Management and has direct access to the Audit Committee and its Chair. The function performs its mandate based on a risk-based audit plan, which is approved by the Board of Management and the Audit Committee. It reports a summary of the audit findings quarterly to the Board of Management and Executive Committee, and the Audit Committee, which culminates in an annual assessment of the quality and effectiveness of the company's internal control systems.\n\n## SHARE DEALING RULES AND RULES ON DISCLOSURE CONTROL\n\nIn accordance with Dutch Iaw and regulations (including the European Market Abuse Regulation), the company maintains insider lists and exercises controls around the dissemination and disclosure of potentially price sensitive information.\n\nAll employees and the members of the Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board, are subject to the AkzoNobel Share Dealing Rules, which limit their opportunities to trade in AkzoNobel securities. Transactions in AkzoNobeI shares carried out by Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board members (including their closely associated persons) are, as and when required, notified to the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM).\n\nThe Board of Management, Executive Committee and Supervisory Board members require authorization from the General Counsel prior to carrying\n\nout any transactions in respect of AkzoNobeI securities, even in a so-called 'open period'. In relevant cases, the General Counsel can prohibit carrying out transactions in respect of other companies' securities. In addition, all employees are subject to the AkzoNobeI Rules on Disclosure Control.\n\n## INTERNAL CONTROLS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe company has adequate procedures for internal controls. The Board of Management and Executive Committee have established several Risk, Control and Compliance Committees, which are explained on page 76. In 2021, we invested in enhancing our Internal Control Framework and process, alongside the continued work on system embedded controls, standard role design and segregation of duty monitoring. An integrated Risk and Internal Control department supports all businesses and functions in their work.\n\n## Risk management\n\nOur risk management system is explained in more detail in the next chapter.

We continue to further advance and expand our Integrity and Compliance program to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations, empower and enable our employees to make fair and honest decisions and bring integrity to life.\n\nBelow is a summary of the 2021 priorities and key activities, and the outcomes thereof, as required pursuant to the Dutch Decree on the publication of non-financial information.\n\n## GOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATION\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for maintaining a culture of integrity and ensuring an effective Integrity and Compliance program and control framework. The Supervisory Board's Audit Committee oversees this responsibility. The Executive Committee has delegated certain responsibilities to the following working committees.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance governance committees\n\nWe've redesigned the Integrity and Compliance governance model and have Integrity and Compliance governance committees in place in all eight business units, Global Manufacturing, Global Supply Chain and our key countries. These committees consist of business unit leadership and key corporate function leaders, including the Integrity and Compliance Manager. The Integrity and Compliance governance committees identify, discuss and address trends, risks and best practices,\n\nand drive the operationalization of the\n\nIntegrity and Compliance program into the organization, with a strong focus on prevention. All committees meet at least on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee\n\nReviews investigations into SpeakUp! reports involving alleged violations of the Code of Conduct and material violations of laws and regulations. Also decides on disciplinary measures and control improvement actions, as well as monitoring and responding to any trends or irregularities identified in investigations. By submitting these cases through a central Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee, the company ensures transparency and consistency of measures throughout the organization. There have been no individual matters or disciplinary actions discussed with the Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp! Committee that would warrant separate disclosure in the annual report. Should there be material compliance matters, or material internal control weaknesses or improvements in the future, these would be addressed through the RCCs (see below) and discussed with the Audit Committee and external auditor, and where appropriate disclosed in accordance with the applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Risk, Control and Compliance Committees (RCC)\n\nResponsible for supervising the effectiveness of the control environment and reviewing weaknesses in this environment, as well as progress on improvement actions. There are eight business unit RCCs and seven functional RCCs, in addition to a group RCC. They each met quarterly in 2021.\n\n## Human Rights Committee\n\nResponsible for supervising the company's human rights control framework and driving further expansion of the human rights program. We have strengthened the governance of our human rights program. For more information on our human rights\n\nframework and program, see the Sustainability statements.\n\n## Privacy Committee\n\nResponsible for supervising the\n\ncompany's privacy control framework and driving further expansion of the data privacy program. Several critical projects were successfully delivered in 2021. These included the introduction of a new program for the international transfer of personal data in order to comply with the Schrems II verdict of the EU Court of Justice, and the creation and submission of stand-alone Binding Corporate Rules for the UK due to Brexit. Throughout the year, a lot of work was carried out on digital privacy compliance - e.g. cookie compliance and social media (marketing) activities - as well as the implementation of new local privacy laws, such as in Brazil, South Africa and more recently in Saudi Arabia and China.\n\n## Integrity and Compliance function\n\nDay-to-day management of our Integrity and Compliance program is delegated to the Integrity and Compliance team. The function is led by the Director of Integrity and Compliance, who reports to the General Counsel. This team includes experts in integrity and compliance program design, legal experts in the field of competition law, anti-bribery and anticorruption, export control and sanctions, data privacy and human rights, and the regional Integrity and Compliance managers in all regions driving the implementation of the program.\n\nTo ensure the company maintains and strengthens its culture of integrity, the Integrity and Compliance team - together with various other functions and stakeholders across the organization - focuses its efforts on the following key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  Help leaders set a strong tone at the top and lead by example\n- \u00b7  Drive awareness and ownership of all employees through effective policy management, training and communication",

In 2021, the heads of Integrity and Compliance, Internal Control and Internal Audit met at least quarterly to discuss findings and trends, and to align actions.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nEvery year, each business unit and major function identifies its key compliance risks and defines actions to mitigate these risks. These actions form part of the business unit/function integrity and compliance plan, which in turn forms part of a larger BU/function legal plan.\n\n## POLICY MANAGEMENT\n\nWe continued to improve and expand our Policy Portal, a one-stop-shop for key policies, rules and procedures relating to our global processes and key topic areas. By reducing complexity and increasing transparency and consistency, it's easier for employees to access and understand which rules apply to their job. As part of our policy lifecycle management, we revised, for example, rules and procedures on various anti-bribery and anti-corruption risks. We also distributed businessfriendly practical guidance, one pagers and do's and don'ts, for example regarding conflicts of interest, customer incentive programs and pricing. Our policies and supporting tools drive awareness and knowledge within the\n\nbroader organization; no major risks or issues have been identified in the aforementioned compliance fields.\n\n## COMMUNICATION\n\nWe launched a new tagline for Integrity and Compliance - Bring integrity to life - as it's everyone's responsibility to do business the right way. In order to increase awareness and ownership among all employees on integrity and compliance topics, we redesigned the Integrity and Compliance monthly communication campaigns to address a specific topic through a quiz, reflecting lessons learned from real-life cases. We also launched '3P Guidance (Purpose, Process and Perception)' to help the organization think through the ethical dilemmas shared on a quarterly basis through our Integrity and Compliance governance committee meetings, and through various other channels. In addi tion, we celebrated another global Integrity Week, with the 2021 theme being: 'Conflict of interest - Be an open book'.\n\n## TRAINING AND EDUCATION\n\nWe continued to counsel and educate employees on integrity and compliance rules and controls through e-learnings and in-person sessions. Due to the challenges posed by COVID-19, only a limited number of face-to-face trainings took place. Virtual and video conference trainings were offered to help increase employee engagement. Employees are also required to follow mandatory role-based and risk-based e-learnings. Training included our Code of Conduct, fraud, operating a diverse and respectful workplace, competition law, export control, information security and data privacy. We focused in particular on our blue collar workers, as we designed a new, short and interactive Code of Conduct training covering topics of special relevance to them, leading to >90% completion rates.\n\n## THIRD PARTY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nWe conducted a current state assessment to establish the maturity of our current third party risk management program and all related processes. In addition, we completed an assessment of our current in-use technology. We further expanded the scope of our third party screening to address recent regulatory developments. For example, in line with new legislation in Colombia, we put in place risk-based screening of our business partners in order to prevent money laundering, financing of terrorism, and financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (in addition to bribery and corruption).\n\n## MONITORING\n\nWe have several processes to monitor compliance by employees and business partners with our rules and procedures. Managers are also required to self-assess and confirm compliance with company rules and procedures as part of the internal control selfassessment. Our supplier performance is monitored through the EcoVadis self-assessments and on-site third party audits that we carry out via the Together for Sustainability initiative. From a competition law perspective, we also ran amnesty programs for newly acquired businesses as part of the integration process into the wider group.\n\nThe Internal Audit function performs numerous audits on our operations. Their audit plan is risk-based and takes account of prior compliance and internal control findings. Several internal audits were held at the request of the Integrity and Compliance function to validate compliance with our rules and procedures in certain units or on certain risk areas. We have also further advanced our Gift and Conflict of Interest Register, and designed automated key anti-bribery and anti-corruption controls to increase control efficiency.",

        "page_content": "## GRIEVANCE AND INVESTIGATION\n\nWe were highlighted by Transparency International NL as having the number one whistleblowing framework in its most recent study of top companies in the Netherlands. Our SpeakUp! grievance mechanism offers employees and third parties a means to raise concerns relating to compliance with our Code of Conduct. In 2021, we created a dedicated investigation team, who follow an investigation protocol which adheres to strict principles of confidentiality, respect for anonymity, non-retaliation, objectivity and the right to be heard. The investigation program is being evaluated to reflect the EU Whistle-blower Directive as transposed into national laws.\n\nIn 2021, the total number of reports across all channels increased slightly, driven by a number of factors, including increased communication on the SpeakUp! process, COVID-19 related concerns and use of the system to make general enquiries unrelated to the Code of Conduct. We continue to see higher levels of reporting through our SpeakUp! hotline, web portal and mailboxes, as opposed to reports to/by management. All reports and alerts led to 19 dismissals and various other disciplinary measures and control improvements, confirming the value of the company's grievance framework.\n\n## REPORTING\n\nDuring 2021, the Director of Integrity and Compliance reported every four months to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on material developments of the Integrity and Compliance program. Should there be any material investigation matters, these are discussed with the external auditor on a quarterly basis.\n\nVisit the SpeakUp! reporting website https://akzo.no/SpeakUp\n\n## SpeakUp! reports\n\n|                                                                | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total reports and alerts registered                            | 222    | 250    | 305    |\n| Reports received through SpeakUp!                              | 164    | 180    | 232    |\n| Integrity                                                      | 59     | 61     | 94     |\n| Safety                                                         | 5      | 21     | 17     |\n| Sustainability                                                 | 100    | 98     | 121    |\n| Dismissals resulting from SpeakUp! reports                     | -      | 6      | 6      |\n| Conclusions to SpeakUp! reports closed in  calendar year 2021: |        |        |        |\n| Substantiated                                                  | 28     | 27     | 33     |\n| Unsubstantiated                                                | 82     | 70     | 50     |\n| Other (e.g. referred)                                          | 54     | 46     | 106    |\n\nThe number of dismissals from investigations was not centrally tracked in 2019.\n\nThere have been no individual matters or disciplinary actions discussed with the Integrity and Compliance SpeakUp!

This called\n\nfor a special celebration during 2021 with the opening\n\nof the All Eyes jubilee exhibition at the company's head\n\noffice in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nThe exhibition showcases works from past and present and offers a contemporary look at the world around us, with new and experienced talent hanging side by side. The works on display unfold to present a diverse spectrum of images and stories, constantly giving rise to new connections.\n\nAll Eyes shares a compelling mix of styles, including special treasures from the collection, works of art fresh from the studio and early acquisitions that proudly justify their position as milestones in the changing spirit of the age.\n\n'Since the AkzoNobel Art Foundation was established in 1995, our aim has been to acquire works that reflect the world as we experience it,' says Hester Alberdingk Thijm, Director of AkzoNobel's Art Foundation (pictured below). 'We look for artists who are questioning and transforming our global society. All Eyes is the\n\nculmination of more than 25 years of powerful images and stories.'\n\nArtists on display include Otobong Nkanga, Remy Jungerman, Melanie Bonajo, Afra Eisma, Ger van Elk, Susan Hiller, Louise Giovanelli, Yael Bartana, Emma Talbot, Roger Hiorns and Jan Andriesse.\n\nIn line with AkzoNobel's proud heritage, color, innovation and technology are among the main collecting themes. 'The AkzoNobel Art Foundation is generally regarded as being one of the most progressive corporate collections in Europe - partly because it has always regarded diversity as an important principle,' adds Thierry Vanlancker, AkzoNobel CEO and Chair of the AkzoNobel Art Foundation. 'Out of more than 1,800 artworks, half have been created by women and many are by non-Western artists. With this new exhibition, we're proud to celebrate that diversity and the pioneering spirit we share in art, science and business.'\n\nThe All Eyes exhibition was opened by Rein Wolfs, Director of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (pictured below on the left along with Hester Alberdingk Thijm and Thierry Vanlancker).\n\nArtwork pictured left: Yael Bartana | What If Women Ruled The\n\nWorld | neon | 260 x 98 cm | AkzoNobel Art Foundation\n\n## CASE STUDY",

        "page_content": "## REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThis report includes both a summary of our Board of Management and Supervisory Board remuneration policies, and our annual report on remuneration, which sets out how our policy was applied in 2021 - and how it will be applied in 2022. On April 22, 2021, the AGM approved the new remuneration policies for the Board of Management, with a majority of 86.3% of the votes, and for the Supervisory Board, with a majority of 99.0% of the votes.\n\nChanges in the remuneration policy for the Board of Management compared with the previous policy are as follows:\n\n- 1.  We decided to update the labor market peer group and only include EU peers.\n\n## Dutch\n\n## European\n\n- \u00b7 ASML\n- \u00b7 Air Liquide\n- \u00b7 DSM\n- \u00b7 Arkema\n- \u00b7 Philips\n- \u00b7 Clariant\n- \u00b7 Randstad\n- \u00b7 Covestro\n- \u00b7 RELX\n- \u00b7 Evonik Industries\n- \u00b7 Signify\n- \u00b7 Givaudan\n- \u00b7 Wolters Kluwer\n- \u00b7 Henkel\n- \u00b7 Lafarge Holcim\n- \u00b7 Sika\n- \u00b7 Solvay\n\nAs AkzoNobel seeks to outperform its sector peers and aims to attract high caliber members of the Board of Management, a competitive reference point for total remuneration is set between median and third quartile of the European peer group: median for base salary and STI and between median and third quartile for LTI. Remuneration increases above the median market level are reserved for Board of Management members who consistently outperform their targets.\n\n- 2.  To support transparency and alignment with the strategic plan, the list of STI metrics chosen from each year is being replaced by specific STI metrics that will be applicable throughout the effective period of the policy. Metrics for the STI and LTI are directly derived from the strategic plan and have been updated compared with the previous policy.\n\n- 3.  In order to reach the competitive total compensation level, and in line with market practice, the on-target value of the variable remuneration has been adjusted. For the CFO, the on-target short-term incentive (STI) level has been increased from 65% to 80% of base salary. For the CEO, the LTI has been increased from 150% to 200% of base salary, emphasizing the longterm focus of the pay-for-performance relationship.\n- 4.  As the Performance Incentive Plan concluded in 2020, from 2021 onwards, the temporary suspension of the Share-Matching Plan is being lifted as planned. This reiterates the importance of share ownership, which underpins alignment over the long term. The Share-Matching Plan is being simplified by removing the link between allowed investment and the share-matching level, and the fulfillment of the Share Ownership Requirement (SOR).\n\nChanges in the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board compared with the previous policy are summarized below:\n\nAn external consultant has carried out an external benchmark of Supervisory Board membership fees versus AEX companies and AkzoNobel's European remuneration peer group. Based on this benchmark, the Board concluded that the level of the fixed fees - which have remained unchanged since 2014 fell short of a competitive level. The fixed fees for Supervisory Board members have therefore been increased: by \u20ac20,000 for the Chair and the Deputy Chair, and by \u20ac15,000 for the other members. Committee fees and the attendance fee for meetings outside the country of residence remain unchanged.\n\nVisit our website for a full description of the remuneration policy for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe 2020 Remuneration report received 49.7% of favorable votes at the AGM (advisory vote). Investors and other stakeholders explained they would have liked more details on the Board of Management's personal objectives relating to the short-term incentive. They also perceived a lack of transparency on the discretionary adjustment to evaluate performance against the ROI target for long-term incentives, which was set at the beginning of 2018 to align with the new Grow & Deliver strategy. This 2021 report includes improvements in transparency on the relevant personal objectives, as requested, and is subject to an advisory vote at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Strategic focus\n\nWe have a clear strategic focus to become the reference in paints and coatings, with strong global brands, leading market positions and a balanced geographic exposure across all regions. We strive to outperform our competitors, to deliver a solid return to our shareholders and to achieve longterm sustainable value creation for all our stakeholders.\n\nOur Grow & Deliver strategy is aimed at achieving growth at least in line with our relevant markets, while delivering further profitability improvement. Revenue growth, EBITDA and return on investment are the prime success indicators of this balanced approach. The Supervisory Board closely monitors realization of the strategy and regularly discusses progress with the Board of Management.\n\nThe overriding importance of our long-term sustainable value creation is reflected in the composition of the remuneration packages for members of our Board of Management and Supervisory Board, as it is essential to attracting and retaining high caliber members to our Board of Management and Supervisory Board.

REMUNERATION FOR THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nThe remuneration policy is designed to incentivize the Board of Management to achieve the company's objectives, while balancing the perspectives of shareholders and other key stakeholders. The focus on performance is achieved by including both short and long-term incentives that are aligned with the company strategy to realize longterm sustainable value creation. Variable remuneration provides an incentive to realize long-term value creation. For the short term, the Supervisory Board sets operational targets over a one-year period that are crucial to the company\n\nand are pre-conditions to value creation. The biggest portion of the remuneration packages of Board of Management members is directly aimed at strategic priorities that contribute to building sustainable long-term value creation, with targets for return on invested capital, adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth and specific environmental, social and governmental (ESG) goals.\n\nPrior to agreeing on incentives, the Remuneration Committee conducted scenario analyses of the possible financial outcomes of meeting different performance levels, and how they may affect the structure and value of the Board of Management's total remuneration.\n\nThe scenarios that have been evaluated by the Remuneration Committee involve the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Threshold or below: Underperformance or performance at threshold level, no STI pay-out and no vesting of LTI shares\n- \u00b7  Target: Performance broadly in line with expectations, STI pay-out and vesting of LTI shares at target\n- \u00b7  Maximum: Exceptional performance, STI pay-out and vesting of LTI shares at maximum\n- \u00b7  Maximum plus: Same as maximum scenario, but a share price increase after three years of 10% is considered\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has concluded that, based on the scenarios considered and the total remuneration level in each scenario, there's a strong relationship between pay and performance for the Board of Management. The remuneration policy also helps avoid any unintended",

The Supervisory Board sets goals, their respective weight and targets (i.e. metrics) for the respective performance year under the STI and LTI scheme, considering: (1) Company strategy (2) Focus on long-term value creation (3) Historical performance, business future outlook and circumstances and priorities (4)\n\nStakeholder expectations. Goals must be stretching yet achievable.\n\nWhen implementing the policy, the Remuneration Committee consults external remuneration professionals to obtain appropriate benchmark data, and independent advice on other matters as required.

This provides a shared sense of purpose and direction at different management levels and a shared reward when success is achieved.

The test also included an assessment of the progress made with the strategic objectives under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee subsequently determined that bonus payments for the Board of Management would be:\n\n- \u00b7  Thierry Vanlancker, CEO: \u20ac888,950 (77.3% of salary)\n- \u00b7  Maarten de Vries, CFO: \u20ac439,064 (61.84% of salary)\n\nNo matching shares were granted to the CEO or CFO in 2021, as this arrangement was suspended for STI payments made in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The value of the ShareMatching Plan for these three years was invested in the 2020 Performance Incentive Plan.\n\n## LONG-TERM INCENTIVES (LTI)\n\n## Conditional grant LTI share plan 2021-2023\n\nThe Remuneration Committee determines the grant levels to be made in respect of members of the Board of Management, within the limits and plans that have been approved by shareholders. In 2021, the CEO received a conditional grant of shares equivalent to the face value of 200% of his annual base salary and the CFO received a conditional grant of shares equivalent to the face value of 150% of his annual base salary. The grant price was determined based on the average share price of an AkzoNobel common share in the two weeks following publication of the annual results on February 17, 2021:\n\n- \u00b7  26,713 shares were conditionally granted to Thierry Vanlancker, CEO\n- \u00b7  12,369 shares were conditionally granted to Maarten de Vries, CFO\n\nVesting of the conditional grant is linked to four performance metrics:\n\n| Measure                                    | Weight   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| AkzoNobel adjusted EBITDA (in mln)         | 40%      |\n| AkzoNobel return on investment (in %)      | 20%      |\n| AkzoNobel revenue growth (in %)            | 20%      |\n| Environmental, social and governance (ESG) | 20%      |\n\nRevenue growth is compared with a defined industry peer group, consisting of the following companies in the paints and coatings sector: Sherwin-Williams, Nippon Paint, PPG, Axalta and BASF Coatings.\n\nOrganic growth rates to calculate the performance take into consideration price, mix, volume growth and exclude the effects of exchange rates and mergers and acquisitions.

As part of his reappointment, Mr. Vanlancker was granted a special grant of 17,500 AkzoNobel shares to compensate for the loss of shares due to the two-year reappointment and the fact that shares granted as from 2021 will only vest on a pro-rated basis. As the special grant was not subject to performance conditions, it was decided to apply a 30% discount on the 'on-target' value.\n\nThe special share grant came into effect on July 21, 2021 (i.e. the first day of the open window after the AGM) following a notification to the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financi\u00eble Markten, 'AFM') and vested in full that same day. The shares have a restriction date of April 20, 2023 (or the actual date of the AGM at which Mr. Vanlancker will relinquish his position as CEO).\n\n## Vesting of the LTI share plan 2019-2021\n\nUnder the LTI share plan 2019-2021, conditional grants of 21,379 shares\n\nwere made to the CEO and 14,387 shares to the CFO.\n\nIn line with the remuneration policy, vesting of 50% of the shares conditionally granted in 2019 was linked to AkzoNobel's ROI performance, which was reviewed at the end of the performance period by the Supervisory Board. The targeted ROI of 25% - which was also applicable to the share grant in 2019 as part of the 15 by 20 strategy - was intended to deliver profitability in line with leading peers. It was initially announced by previous management in April 2017.\n\nWhen the Grow & Deliver strategy was launched, the company updated its ROI ambition in 2020 from 25% to 20%, taking into account lower revenue growth, the impact of IFRS 16 and recent bolt-on acquisitions. As a result, as they did last year, the Supervisory Board recognized that the 2019 ROI pay-out curve, with an ambition of 25%, no longer aligned with the new strategy.\n\nThey applied their discretionary power to evaluate performance against the 2020 ROI pay-out curve, with an ambition of 20%. In both pay-out curves ROI is excluding unallocated cost (the metric for the LTI plans up to 2020; as of 2021, the metric is including unallocated costs). Actual AkzoNobel ROI excluding unallocated cost performance in 2021 was 19.5%. On a linear pay-out curve, with a threshold of 17%, corresponding to a pay-out of 50%, an on-target of 20%, and a maximum of 25%, this resulted in a vesting of 91.67% for this specific part of the long-term incentive.\n\nFor the 2019 conditional grant, 50% was linked to AkzoNobel's relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance compared with the companies in a defined industry peer group consisting of the following nine companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Asian Paints\n- \u00b7 PPG\n- \u00b7 Axalta\n- \u00b7 RPM\n- \u00b7 Masco Corp\n- \u00b7 Sherwin-Williams\n- \u00b7 Nippon Paint\n- \u00b7 Tikkurilla\n- \u00b7 Kansai Paint International\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Tikkurilla by PPG, the Remuneration Committee decided to freeze Tikkurilla's share price at \u20ac14.23.

        "page_content": "## Loans\n\nThe company does not grant loans, advance payments or guarantees to members of the Supervisory Board, members of the Executive Committee or any family member of such persons.\n\n## Shareholding requirements and share matching\n\nBoard of Management members are expected to build up a share-holding requirement in the company. The minimum shareholding requirement must be accrued within five years. This includes  privately purchased shares, and vested shares granted under AkzoNobel share-based compensation plans. The minimum shareholding requirement is 300% of annual base salary for the CEO and 150% of annual base salary for the CFO. As of December 31, 2021, CEO Thierry Vanlancker held 74,598 shares. Shares acquired in 2021 by the CEO contribute towards his required shareholding. On December 31, 2021, he fulfilled this requirement by holding the equivalent of 626% of his annual base salary in shares. As of December 31, 2021, CFO Maarten de Vries held 14,643 shares.  Shares acquired by the CFO during 2021 contribute towards his required shareholding. On December 31, 2021, he fulfilled this requirement by holding the equivalent of 199% of his annual base salary.\n\nShares obtained by Board of Management members under the performance-\n\nrelated share plan are taken into account for share ownership purposes once they have become unconditional. This includes vested shares to be retained during the two-year blocking period after vesting. In 2021, CEO Thierry Vanlancker received 1,720 matching shares that were conditionally granted in 2018 under the Share-Matching Plan. On December 31, 2021, there were no shares that qualified for share-matching under the Share-Matching Plan.\n\n## Board contracts\n\nAgreements for Board of Management members are concluded for a period not exceeding four years. After the initial term, reappointments may take place for consecutive periods of up to four years each. At the 2021 AGM, CEO Thierry Vanlancker was reappointed for a two- year period. His reappointment was supported with 97.5% of the votes at the AGM.\n\nAt the AGM to be held in 2022, the reappointment of the CFO, Maarten de Vries, will be scheduled. The notice period by the Board member, and by the company, shall be subject to a six-month term. Members of the Board of Management normally retire in the year they reach legal retirement age.\n\n## Comparative information\n\nInternal pay ratios are a relevant input factor for determining the appropriateness of the implementation of the remuneration policy, as recognized in\n\nthe Dutch Corporate Governance Code. In 2021, the ratio between the annual total compensation for the CEO and the average annual compensation for an employee was 115.7 (2020: 99.2). Further details on the development of these amounts and ratios over time can be found on the previous page.\n\nOver the last few years of transition, the company's financial performance fluctuated significantly as the table on the previous page shows. In 2018, net profits increased sharply, mainly due to the divestment of Specialty Chemicals, with a deal result of \u20ac5,811 million after tax. The transition was also reflected in the development of remuneration. In 2018, the increase in average salary was influenced by the inclusion of a one-off \u20ac57 million pension cost for the UK guaranteed minimum pension equalizations.\n\nIn 2020, total rewards (including benefits) for the Board of Management included a one-off special payment for the 2020 Performance Incentive Plan, which incentivized improvement on the company's return on sales (ROS). The plan was put in place and approved by the AGM following the divestment of Specialty Chemicals. In 2021, total rewards (including benefits) for the CEO included a one-off special share grant  to compensate for the loss of shares due to the two-year reappointment and the fact that shares granted as from 2021 will only vest on a pro-rated basis.\n\n## 2021 Remuneration of the Supervisory Board\n\nCommittee\n\n| in \u20ac                            | Remuneration   | Attendance fee   | allowance fees   | Total remuneration   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Nils Smedegaard Andersen, Chair | 150,000        | 2,500            | 20,000           | 172,500              |\n| Byron Grote, Deputy Chair       | 93,000         | 2,500            | 25,000           | 120,500              |\n| Pamela Kirby                    | 80,000         | -                | 15,000           | 95,000               |\n| Dick Sluimers                   | 80,000         | -                | 20,000           | 100,000              |\n| Sue Clark*                      | 24,835         | -                | 4,657            | 29,492               |\n| Patrick Thomas                  | 80,000         | 2,500            | 20,000           | 102,500              |\n| Michiel Jaski*                  | 24,835         | -                | 6,209            | 31,044               |\n| Jolanda Poots-Bijl              | 80,000         | -                | 20,000           | 100,000              |\n| Total 2021                      | 612,670        | 7,500            | 130,866          | 751,036              |\n| Total 2020                      | 618,536        | 45,000           | 168,489          | 832,025              |\n\n*  Until April 22, 2021.",

REMUNERATION FOR THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\nSupervisory Board members receive a fixed annual fee for their membership and one or more fixed committee fee(s). In addition, Supervisory Board members receive an attendance fee for any Supervisory Board or committee meetings they attend outside their country of residence. Travel expenses and facilities are borne by the company and reviewed by the Audit Committee. Implementation of the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board in 2021 resulted in the pay-out shown in the table on page 86. According to the Code, members are not remunerated in shares. A five-year overview of the total remuneration of the Supervisory Board is presented in the table above.\n\n## 3.  REMUNERATION POLICY FOR THE YEAR 2022\n\nThe remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board were reviewed by the Supervisory Board in 2020/2021 and approved at the AGM in 2021, taking into consideration input from stakeholders, the requirements of the EU Directive on the encouragement\n\n- 5 Until April 24, 2020.\n- 6 From November 30, 2017, until April 22, 2021.\n- 7 As of November 30, 2017.\n- 8 From May 1, 2016, until December 1, 2017.\n\nof long-term shareholder engagement (SRD II) and the Dutch regulation implementing this Directive.\n\n## Remuneration policy for the Board of Management\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded that the remuneration policy for the Board of Management - approved at the AGM on April 22, 2021 - is in line with the company's objectives. The remuneration it provides is balanced and adequate and will remain unchanged. The disclosure on the policy has been extended to provide additional insight to comply with SRD II.\n\nFor implementation in 2022, the Supervisory Board has decided that:\n\n- \u00b7  The base salaries of the Board of Management will be increased in line with the salary adjustments applied for AkzoNobel employees in the Nether-lands, including those who are covered by a collective agreement. Increases\n\nto the value of 2.5% of base salary will be effective as of January 1, 2022:\n\n- -  Thierry Vanlancker, CEO: \u20ac1,178,750\n- -   Maarten de Vries, CFO: \u20ac727,750\n- \u00b7  Metrics applied for STI in 2021 were adjusted OPI and OCF, as per the\n\nremuneration policy, to support the company's strategy. Going forward, it is being proposed to replace OCF by free cash flow (FCF) as a metric for STI. The reason is that OCF is an internal metric and focuses only on adjusted EBITDA, Capex and working capital. FCF, on the other hand, is externally published and therefore very well recognized by investors. Ultimately, the Board of Management is expected to steer on FCF, as it also includes elements such as interest, tax and cash out from provisions. This suggested change will be submitted to shareholders for their approval\n\n- \u00b7  Metrics applied for LTI will remain the same, in line with the strategic direction of the company, and will continue to include ESG\n\n## Remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded that the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board - approved at the AGM on April 22, 2021 - is in line with the objectives of the company.

The address of our registered office is Christian Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam; the Chamber of Commerce number is 09007809. We have attached a list of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures, drawn up in conformity with Articles 379 and 414 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, as an appendix to our annual report. The principal activity of AkzoNobel is the production and selling of paints and coatings.\n\nWe have prepared the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. They also comply with the financial reporting requirements included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, resulting from management's assessment of the ability of AkzoNobel to continue its operations for the foreseeable future. This assessment includes, among others, an evaluation of our financial position, expected future cash flows and market developments. The Management report within the meaning of Article 391 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code consists of the following parts of the annual report:\n\n- \u00b7  2021 results at a glance\n- \u00b7  CEO statement\n- \u00b7  How we created value\n- \u00b7  Strategy and operations\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Our Board of Management and Executive Committee\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Statement of the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Corporate governance statement\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Risk management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Integrity and compliance management\n- \u00b7  Leadership and governance: Remuneration report\n- \u00b7  Financial information: Note 6 Operating income\n- \u00b7  Financial information: Note 27 Financial risk management\n\nThe section 'How we created value' provides information on the developments during 2021 and the results. This section also provides information on cash flows and net debt, capital expenditures, innovation activities and employees.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, the Board of Management authorized the financial statements for issue. The financial statements as presented in this report are subject to adoption by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on April 22, 2022.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Akzo Nobel N.V. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are companies over which Akzo Nobel N.V. has control, because it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect returns through its power over the subsidiary. Non-controlling interests in equity and in results are presented separately.\n\n## CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND FIRST TIME APPLICATION\n\nAccounting pronouncements, which became effective for 2021 (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2' and the amendment to IFRS 16 'COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021') had no material impact on our Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of our business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed\n\nof or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale if it is highly probable that the carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction within one year rather than through continuing use. When reclassifying assets and liabilities as held for sale, we recognize the assets and liabilities at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale are not depreciated and amortized but tested for impairment. In case of discontinued operations, the comparative figures in the Consolidated statement of income and Consolidated statement of cash flows are represented. The balance sheet comparative figures are not represented.\n\n## ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES (NOTE 4)\n\nOur Alternative Performance Measures (APM) are based on IFRS measures and exclude so-called identified items. Identified items are special charges and benefits, results on acquisitions and divestments, major restructuring and impairment charges, and charges and benefits related to major legal, environmental and tax cases.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are used to judge the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most critical accounting policies involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of valuation and for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those recorded in the financial statements are the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Scope of consolidation (Note 2)\n- \u00b7  Income tax and deferred tax assets, including uncertain tax positions (Note 9)\n- \u00b7  Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (Note 11, 12, 13)",

The pandemic has not impacted our going concern assumption.\n\nAkzoNobel has a strong balance sheet and solid cash position. At December 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents were \u20ac1.2 billion and financial leverage (net debt/ EBITDA) was 1.6. AkzoNobel is committed to retain a strong investment grade credit rating. In 2021 and 2020, a detailed assessment was performed of potential valuation adjustments to the overall asset base, either due to the direct impact of COVID-19 or due to its impact on future profitability, which did not lead to significant valuation adjustments. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests in both years have been performed based on adjusted forecasts. Recoverability of deferred tax assets has also been reassessed based on these adjusted forecasts. Furthermore, an assessment was performed with regard to the allowance for impairment of trade receivables, also taking into account potential additional risk associated with COVID-19.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on the Financial Statements has been considered for each of the relevant notes, and additional disclosures have been provided in case COVID19 had a material impact on a specific Financial Statements section in 2020 or 2021. The Financial Statements sections for which this is relevant include:\n\n- \u00b7  Government support received and recorded as credit to employee benefits (Note 7)\n- \u00b7  Income tax and the valuation of deferred tax assets (Note 9)\n- \u00b7  Intangible assets and the annual impairment testing process (Note 11)\n\nIn our 2021 and 2020 figures, all COVID-19 related impacts have been treated as normal operations; none of these impacts has been included in identified items.\n\n## STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n\nWe have used the indirect method to prepare the statement of cash flows. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated at transaction rates. Acquisitions or divestments of subsidiaries are presented net of cash and cash equivalents acquired or disposed of, respectively. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of cash flows in the same category as those of the hedged items.\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nWe determine and present operating segments based on the information that is provided to the Executive Committee, our chief operating decision-maker during 2021, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Segment results reported to the Executive Committee include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly comprise of corporate assets and corporate costs and are reported in 'Corporate and other'.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCIES\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the foreign exchange rate at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Resulting foreign currency differences are included in the statement of income in financing income and expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at acquisition date.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of entities with other functional currencies are translated into euros, the functional currency of the parent entity, using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The income and expenses of entities\n\nwith other functional currencies are translated into the functional currency, using the exchange rates at transaction date.\n\nWhen a subsidiary is operating in a hyperinflationary country, the financial statements of this entity are restated into the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period. Hyperinflation accounting is applied for Argentina.\n\nForeign exchange rate differences resulting from translation into the functional currency of investments in subsidiaries and of intercompany loans of a permanent nature with other functional currencies are recorded as a separate component (cumulative translation reserve) within other comprehensive income. These cumulative translation adjustments are reclassified (either fully or partly) to the statement of income upon disposal (either fully or partly) or liquidation of the foreign subsidiary to which the investment or the intercompany loan with a permanent nature relates. Foreign currency differences arising on the translation of a financial liability designated as an effective hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in the cumulative translation reserve (in other comprehensive income).\n\n## EXCHANGE RATES OF KEY CURRENCIES\n\nThe principal exchange rates against the euro used in preparing the balance sheet and the statement of income are:\n\n|                |   Balance sheet |   Balance sheet | Balance sheet   |   Statement of income |   Statement of income | Statement of income   |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                |        2020     |        2021     | %               |              2020     |              2021     | %                     |\n| US dollar      |           1.229 |           1.131 | (8.0)           |                 1.143 |                 1.182 | 3.4                   |\n| Pound sterling |           0.9   |           0.837 | (7.0)           |                 0.889 |                 0.86  | (3.3)                 |\n| Chinese yuan   |           7.992 |           7.197 | (9.9)           |                 7.875 |                 7.626 | (3.2)                 |\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION (NOTE 5)\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nAkzoNobel's main business consists of straightforward selling of goods (paints and coatings) to customers at contractually determined prices and conditions without any additional services.

        "page_content": "and rewards is not the only criterion to be considered to determine whether control over the goods has transferred, it is in most situations considered to be the main indicator of the customer's ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits from the asset and largely also coincides with the physical transfer of the goods and the obligation of the customer to pay.\n\nVariable considerations, including among others rebates, bonuses, discounts and payments to customers, are accrued for as performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized. Variable considerations are only recognized when it is highly probable that these are not subject to significant reversal. In case of expected returns, no revenue is recognized for such products, but a refund liability and an asset for the right to recover the to be returned products are recorded. A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, generally based on historical warranty data.\n\nRevenue is recognized net of rebates, discounts and similar allowances, and net of sales tax.\n\n## Equipment provided to customers\n\nAkzoNobel regularly provides mixing machines, store interior and other assets to its customers at the start of a paints or coatings delivery contract. The delivery of such assets qualifies as a separate performance obligation. Revenue can only be recognized at the moment of transfer of such assets, when there is an agreed sales price or when there is a binding take-or-pay commitment for a minimum quantity of paints or coatings to be acquired by the customer.\n\n## Services\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain training, technical or support services to customers as well as shipping and handling activities for its customers. Service revenue is recognized over time when the related services are being provided. When not separately invoiced, part of the sales price of paints or coatings is allocated to such services.\n\n## POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS (NOTE 7, 19)\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of income as incurred.\n\nMost of our defined benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated in a trust or foundation. We also provide post-retirement benefits other than pensions to certain employees, which are generally not funded. Valuations of both funded and unfunded plans are carried out by independent actuaries based on the projected unit credit method. Postretirement costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial present value of the obligation for projected benefits based on employee service during the year and interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset. When the calculation results in a benefit to AkzoNobel, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on the settlement of the plan liabilities. The effect of these so-called asset ceiling restrictions and any changes therein are recognized in other comprehensive income. Remeasurement gains and losses, which arise in calculating our obligations, are recognized in other comprehensive income. When the benefits of a plan improve, the portion of the increased benefits related to past service by employees is recognized as an expense in the statement of income immediately. We recognize gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nInterest on the net defined benefit liability/asset is included in financing expenses related to post-retirement benefits. Other charges and benefits recognized are reported in operating income, unless recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n## OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (NOTE 7, 20)\n\nProvisions for other long-term employee benefits are measured at present value, using actuarial assumptions and methods. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\n## SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION (NOTE 7)\n\nAkzoNobel has a performance-related and a restricted share plan as well as a share-matching plan, under which shares are conditionally granted to certain employees. The fair value is measured at grant date and amortized over the three-year period during which the employees normally become unconditionally entitled to the shares with a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. Amortization is accelerated in the event of earlier vesting or settlement.\n\n## INCOME TAX (NOTE 9)\n\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax, including effects of changes in tax rates. In determining the amount of current and deferred tax we also take into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes may be due. Income tax is recognized in the statement of income, unless it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or equity.\n\nCurrent tax includes the expected tax payable and receivable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at reporting date, as well as (any adjustments to) tax payables and receivables with respect to previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated financial statements. We do not recognize deferred tax for the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future and we can control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized.\n\nMeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed.",

        "page_content": "Income tax consequences are taken into account in the determination of deferred tax liabilities to the extent earnings are expected to be distributed by subsidiaries in the foreseeable future and AkzoNobel has control over dividend distribution. Deferred tax positions are not discounted.\n\n## EARNINGS PER SHARE (NOTE 10)\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the period attributable to shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for any repurchased shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year for the diluting effect of the shares of the performance-related share plan, the restricted share plan and the share-matching plan.\n\nAdjusted earnings per share represents the basic earnings per share from continuing operations excluding identified items, after taxes.\n\n## GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n\nGovernment grants related to costs (including grants related to COVID-19) are deducted from the relevant costs to be compensated in the same period. Government grants to compensate for the cost of an asset are deducted from the cost of the related asset. Emission rights granted by the government are recorded at cost. A provision is recorded if the actual emission is higher than the emission rights granted.\n\n## INTANGIBLE ASSETS (NOTE 11)\n\nIntangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill and certain brands, are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually using the value-in-use method. Goodwill in a business combination represents the excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of\n\nan acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the statement of income.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite useful life, such as licenses, know-how, certain brands, customer relationships, intellectual property rights, emission rights, software expenditures (in as far as AkzoNobel controls the software configured or customized) and capitalized development costs, are capitalized at historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which generally ranges from 5 to 40 years for brands with finite useful lives, 5 to 25 years for customer lists and 3 to 15 years for other intangibles. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Research expenditures are recognized as an expense as incurred.\n\n## PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (NOTE 12)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including borrowing cost of capital investment projects under construction.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life of the asset components.The useful life of plant equipment and machinery generally ranges from 10 to 25 years, and for buildings ranges from 20 to 50 years. Land is not depreciated. In the majority of cases, residual value is assumed to be not significant. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.\n\nCosts of major maintenance activities are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life. Maintenance costs which cannot be separately defined as a component of property, plant and equipment are expensed in the period in which they occur. We recognize conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the cash outflow.\n\n## LEASES (NOTE 13, 21)\n\nWe assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative standalone prices. However, for the leases of cars we have elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nWe recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the present value of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset value contains lease prepayments, lease incentives received, the initial direct costs and an estimate of restoration, removal and dismantling costs. For deferred taxes associated with lease accounting under IFRS 16, AkzoNobel determines the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of the right-ofuse asset and the lease liability on a net basis. It is the company's view that these are integrally linked. As a result, a deferred tax position is reported on the net temporary differences of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n\nThe right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straightline method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term or shorter economic life. In addition, the value of right-ofuse assets is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe net present value of the lease liability is measured at the discounted value of the lease payments. The liability includes payments to be made in optional periods if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease. The lease payments comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives\n- \u00b7  Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate\n- \u00b7  The exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7  Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease; and\n- \u00b7  Amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees\n\nThese lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease contract, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate is used. We determine our incremental borrowing rates by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and make certain adjustments to reflect the term of the lease and type of the asset leased. At the lease commencement dates, we assess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. We reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options, if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within our control.\n\nAt the commencement date, we assess whether it is reasonably certain that:\n\n- \u00b7  An option to extend is exercised; or\n- \u00b7  An option to purchase is exercised; or\n- \u00b7  An option to terminate the lease is not exercised\n\nIn making these assessments, all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for us to exercise, or not to exercise, the option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option are considered.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nWe do not record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. We recognize the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## IMPAIRMENTS (NOTE 11, 12, 13)\n\nWe assess the carrying value of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable as a result of e.g. changes in cash flow forecasts, damages, market developments or environmental and climate\n\nchange risks. In addition, for goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, the carrying value is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of income on the function level of the asset impaired. The assessment for impairment is performed at the lowest level of assets generating largely independent cash inflows. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life, we have determined this to be at business unit level (one level below operating segment).\n\nExcept for goodwill, we reverse impairment losses in the statement of income if and to the extent we have identified a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.\n\n## ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (NOTE 14)\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Consolidated financial statements include our share of the income and expenses of the associates and joint ventures, whereby the result is determined using our accounting principles. When the share of losses exceeds the interest in the investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, unless we have further legal or constructive obligations.\n\n## INVENTORIES (NOTE 16)\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of inventories comprise all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. The costs of inventories are determined using weighted average cost.\n\n## PROVISIONS (NOTE 20)\n\nWe recognize provisions when a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits is required\n\nto settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at net present value. The increase of provisions as a result of the passage of time is recognized in the statement of income under financing income and expenses.\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities are recognized when a detailed and formal restructuring plan has been approved, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. We do not provide for future operating costs.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Classification\n\nAll assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income. Financial assets are classified according to a model based on:\n\n- \u00b7  A contractual cash flow characteristics test\n- \u00b7  A business model dictating how the reporting entity manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows as either:\n- 1. Hold to collect contractual cash flows\n- 2. Collect contractual cash flows and sell\n- 3. Neither 1 or 2\n- \u00b7  Election of the fair value option in some specific cases in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch\n\nThe classification of a financial asset is determined at initial recognition, but if certain conditions are met, an asset might be subject to reclassification.\n\n## Valuation and impairment\n\nFinancial assets are assessed for impairment either according to the general approach or a simplified approach.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the general approach uses the following stages:\n\n- \u00b7  12-month expected credit losses; taking in account possible default events within one year\n- \u00b7  Lifetime expected credit losses in case of an increase in credit risk; through recognition of expected credit losses over the remaining life of the exposure\n- \u00b7  Lifetime expected credit losses, where interest is calculated on the net amount of the receivables less impairment loss",

        "page_content": "In all above stages, the impairment calculation used at AkzoNobel is based on external credit ratings of involved parties or default rates published by well-known credit risk agencies.\n\nThe financial assets included in the general impairment approach are long-term loans and other long-term receivables.\n\nThe calculation of impairment under the simplified approach requires recognition of lifetime expected credit loss (no tracking of changes in credit risk). The financial assets included in the simplified impairment approach are trade receivables and the remaining financial assets.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegular purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized on trade date. The initial measurement of all financial instruments is at fair value. Except for derivatives and cash and cash equivalents, the initial measurement of financial instruments is adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments (Note 27)\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair values are derived from market prices and quotes from dealers and brokers or are estimated using observable market inputs. When determining fair values, credit risk for our contract party, as well as for AkzoNobel, is taken into account.\n\nChanges in the fair value are recognized in the statement of income, unless cash flow hedge accounting or net investment hedge accounting is applied. In those cases, the effective part of the fair value changes is deferred in other comprehensive income and released to the related specific lines in the statement of income or balance sheet at the same time as the hedged item.\n\nFinancial non-current assets (Note 15) and Trade and other receivables (Note 17)\n\nLoans and receivables are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.\n\nCash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments (Note 21)\n\nCash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are measured at fair value. Cash and cash equivalents include\n\nall cash balances and other investments that are directly convertible into known amounts of cash. Changes in fair values are included in financing income and expenses.\n\nLong-term and Short-term borrowings (Note 21, 27) and Trade and other payables (Note 22)\n\nLong-term and short-term borrowings, as well as trade and other payables, are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. The interest expense on borrowings is included in financing income and expenses. The fair value of borrowings, used for disclosure purposes, is determined based on listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, the fair value is calculated based on the present value of principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the interest rate at the reporting date, considering AkzoNobel's credit risk.\n\n## NEW IFRS ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\n\nIFRS standards and interpretations thereof not yet in force, which may apply to our Consolidated financial statements for 2022 and beyond, have been assessed for their potential impact.\n\nThese include among others amendments to IFRS 3 'References to the Conceptual Framework', amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use', amendments to IAS 37 'Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract', AIP IFRS 9 'Financial instruments - Fees in the '10 percent' test for derecognition of financial liabilities', IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts', amendments to IAS 1 'Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current', amendments to IAS 8 'Definition of Accounting Estimates', amendments to IAS 12 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction', amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 'Disclosure of Accounting Policies' and amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 'Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture'. These changes are not expected to have a material effect on AkzoNobel's Consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Material subsidiaries\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 261 legal entities. We consider legal entities material when they represent, for at least two subsequent years, more than 5% of either revenue or adjusted operating income or based on qualitative aspects. Material subsidiaries included in the table in this Note are fully owned at year-end 2021.\n\n## Material subsidiaries related to continuing operations\n\n| Legal entity                         | Principal place of  business/country of  incorporation   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings Inc.             | US                                                       |\n| Akzo Nobel Paints (Shanghai) Co Ltd. | China                                                    |\n| Imperial Chemical Industries Limited | UK                                                       |\n| Akzo Nobel Decorative Coatings B.V.  | Netherlands                                              |\n| Akzo Nobel Coatings SPA              | Italy                                                    |\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn March 1, 2021, we acquired 100% of the shares of Industrias Titan S.A.U. (Titan Paints) in Spain, for \u20ac83 million. The acquisition strengthens our paints business and footprint in Spain. The transaction included three production facilities and seven logistics and service centres for decorative paints. Titan Paints generated revenues of around \u20ac80 million in 2020. The transaction resulted in \u20ac15 million of goodwill (non-deductible for tax purposes), \u20ac20 million of other intangible assets and \u20ac47 million of property, plant and equipment. The goodwill is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from integrating the company into the group.\n\nOn June 29, 2021, AkzoNobel announced to further expand its long-term position in South and Central America after reaching an agreement to acquire 100% of the Colombia-based paints and coatings company Grupo Orbis, with consolidated revenues of approximately \u20ac260 million (in 2020). Completion is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected in the first quarter of 2022.",

These alternative performance measures should not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measures and should be used as supplementary information in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nmeasures. Alternative performance measures do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Where a non-financial measure is used to calculate an operational or statistical ratio, this is also considered an alternative performance measure. The following tables reconcile the alternative performance measures used in the segment information (Note 3) to the nearest IFRS measure.\n\n## Transformation costs\n\nTransformation costs include costs related to the strategy to create a focused high-performing Paints and Coatings business and primarily relate to costs for restructuring activities.\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                                                | Continuing  operations   | Discontinued  operations   | 2020  Total   | Continuing  operations   | Discontinued  operations   | 2021  Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| Operating income                                                             | 963                      | -                          | 963           | 1,118                    | -                          | 1,118         |\n| APM adjustments to operating income                                          |                          |                            |               |                          |                            |               |\n| - Transformation costs                                                       | 121                      | -                          | 121           | 28                       | -                          | 28            |\n| -  Brazil ICMS case                                                          | -                        | -                          | -             | (42)                     | -                          | (42)          |\n| - UK pensions past service credit                                            | -                        | -                          | -             | (23)                     | -                          | (23)          |\n| - Acquisition related costs                                                  | 4                        | -                          | 4             | 11                       | -                          | 11            |\n| - Other                                                                      | 11                       | -                          | 11            | -                        | -                          | -             |\n| Total APM adjustments (identified  items) to operating income                | 136                      | -                          | 136           | (26)                     | -                          | (26)          |\n| Adjusted operating income                                                    | 1,099                    | -                          | 1,099         | 1,092                    | -                          | 1,092         |\n| Profit for the period attributable to  shareholders of the company           | 637                      | (7)                        | 630           | 823                      | 6                          | 829           |\n| Adjustments to operating income                                              | 136                      | -                          | 136           | (26)                     | -                          | (26)          |\n| Adjustments to interest                                                      | (3)                      | -                          | (3)           | (29)                     | -                          | (29)          |\n| Adjustments to income tax                                                    | (28)                     | -                          | (28)          | (15)                     | -                          | (15)          |\n| Adjustments to discontinued operations                                       | -                        | -                          | -             | -                        | (8)                        | (8)           |\n| Total APM adjustments                                                        | 105                      | -                          | 105           | (70)                     | (8)                        | (78)          |\n| Adjusted profit for the period  attributable to shareholders of the  company | 742                      | (7)                        | 735           | 753                      | (2)                        | 751           |\n\n## Brazil ICMS case\n\nIn May 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court (STF) recognized the right to deduct state tax on goods and services (ICMS) from the calculation basis of the Social Integration Program-PIS (Programa de Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social) and the Financing of Social Security-COFINS (Contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para Financiamento da Seguridade Social). This STF decision covers a multi-year period prior to 2018. As a result, a fullyear net gain of \u20ac64 million was recognized in net income, of which \u20ac42 million in Other results (in operating income), \u20ac28 million in interest income, \u20ac14 million in income tax (loss) and (net) \u20ac8 million in discontinued operations.\n\n## UK pensions past service credit\n\nFollowing a court decision in April 2021, which allows the amendment of the scheme documentation of one of the company's UK pension funds, a past service credit (gain) was recognized.\n\n## APM adjustments to interest\n\nAdjustments on interest includes an interest gain of \u20ac28 million from the Brazil ICMS case.\n\n## APM adjustments to income tax UK ACT case\n\nAPM adjustments to income tax include a \u20ac29 million net tax benefit for the UK Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT) case. In July 2021 the UK Supreme Court issued a further decision in a group litigation case the company participates in ('Franked Investment Income'; filed in 2003). The company assessed the consequences of this judgement and performed a further file review which, taking into account legal advice, resulted in the recognition of a net tax benefit of \u20ac29 million.\n\n## APM adjustments to income tax Other items\n\nFurthermore, APM adjustments to income tax include a gain of \u20ac12 million for the (net) re-recognition of deferred tax assets, as well as \u20ac8 million of tax benefits related to transformation costs. These gains were partly offset by the income tax (loss) related to the Brazil ICMS case (\u20ac14 million) and the impact from tax rate changes (\u20ac19 million).",

Charges recognized in the 2021 statement of income for share-based compensation amounted to \u20ac18 million and are included in salaries and wages (2020: \u20ac14 million).\n\n## Performance-related and restricted share plan\n\nUnder the performance-related share plan and the restricted share plan, a number of conditional shares are granted to the members of the Board of Management, members of the Executive Committee, executives and certain other employee categories each year. The number of participants of the performance-related share plan and the restricted share plan at year-end 2021 was 479 (2020: 335). The shares of the performance-related share plan series 2018-2020 have vested and were delivered to the participants in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Mr. Vanlancker was granted a special grant of 17,500 shares to compensate for the loss of shares due to the two-year re-appointment and the fact that shares granted as from 2021 will only vest on a pro-rated basis. The special grant was not subject to performance conditions, but a restriction date of April 20, 2023 applies.\n\n## Fair value performance-related shares in \u20ac\n\n| Series      | Opening share   price per:   |   Fair Value | Market condi- tion (TSR) 3   |   Non-market  based   performance  conditions 4 |   Share price | Expected   volatility   | Risk free   interest rate   |\n|-------------|------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2018-2020 1 | April 26, 2018               |        71.65 | 67.51                        |                                           75.78 |         75.78 | 22.66%                  | (0.04)%                     |\n| 2019-2021   | January 2, 2019              |        61.09 | 52.57                        |                                           69.6  |         69.6  | 20.12%                  | (0.04)%                     |\n| 2020-2022 2 | April 21, 2020               |        53.42 | 42.95                        |                                           63.88 |         63.88 | 21.42%                  | (0.33)%                     |\n| 2021-2023 1 | April 22, 2021               |       103.2  | NA                           |                                          103.2  |        103.2  | NA                      | NA                          |\n\n- 1 Date of the AGM at which the new LTI performance criteria for the Board of Management were approved.\n- 2 Date on which the Supervisory Board approved the use of the average share price calculation method to determine the number of shares granted.\n- 3 50% for the 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 grants, no longer applicable for the 2021-2023 grant.\n- 4 50% for the 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 grants, 100% for the 2021-2023 grant.\n\nThe performance targets for the conditional grant of performance-related shares of the 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 plans for the Board of Management and the Executive Committee are linked for 50% to the relative TSR performance of the company compared with the peer group and for 50% to the ROI performance of the company. The targets for the 2021-2023 performance related share grant are for 20% linked to Revenue Growth, for 40% to Adjusted EBITDA, for 20% to ROI and for 20% to performance against Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) KPI's. A two-year holding restriction applies.\n\nThe plan for the executives and certain other employee categories is a restricted share plan without any performance conditions, whereby the conditional grant of shares will vest upon the condition that they remain in service with the company during the three-year vesting period. A oneyear holding restriction applies for the executives.\n\nThe conditional shares of the 2019-2021 performance share plan vested for 58.33% (series 2018-2020: 78%), including a dividend yield of 13.14% (series 2018-2020: 14.37%), the final vesting percentage amounted to 66.00% (series 2018-2020: 89.21%).\n\n## Share plans of AkzoNobel executives\n\nSubject\n\n| Plan                             | Performance/ Vesting   period   | Award  date   | Vesting  date   | End of  holding  period   | Balance at  January 1,  2021   | Awarded  in 2021   | Vested in  2021   | Forfeited   in 2021   | Dividend in  2021   | to per- formance  condition   | Unvested in  2021   | Subject  to holding  period   | Balance at  December  31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 2018-2020 Restricted Share Plan  | 3 years                         | 1/1/2018      | 1/1/2021        | 1/1/2022                  | 167,020                        | -

As for the 2021-2023 grant of performance-related shares all conditions are non-market based performance conditions, the fair value of the performance related shares is based on the share price as per April 22, 2021, the date of the AGM at which the new LTI performance criteria for the Board of Management were approved. In the same meeting, the special grant to Mr. Vanlancker was also approved, therefore the same fair value applies for these shares. The fair value of the performance-related shares of the 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 grant is for 50% based on a market condition (TSR) and for 50% based on a non-market-based performance condition (ROI).\n\nThe TSR part of the award is valued applying a Monte Carlo simulation model and the other part is valued based on the share price at grant date. The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at grant date (opening of first trading date from grant date), expected volatility (based on the share price development over the past three years of AkzoNobel), and risk-free interest rate (based on a Dutch zero-coupon government bond).\n\n## Share-matching plan\n\nThe members of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee are eligible to participate in the share-matching plan. However, they will not be eligible for matching shares for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021. Under certain conditions, members who invest part of their short-term incentive in AkzoNobel shares may have such shares matched by the company. During 2021, 1,720 potential matching shares were matched based on the conditional share matching grants of the 2018 series, leading to no potential matching shares on December 31, 2021. In 2022, the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Executive Committee will become eligible for matching shares by investing part of their 2021 short-term incentive that is paid in 2022 in AkzoNobel shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financing income and expenses\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                         | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financing income                                      | 14     | 12     |\n| Financing expenses                                    | (66)   | (74)   |\n| Net interest on net debt                              | (52)   | (62)   |\n| Other interest                                        |        |        |\n| Financing income related to post- retirement benefits | 14     | 13     |\n| Interest charges on provisions                        | (10)   | 3      |\n| Other items                                           | (21)   | 7      |\n| Net other financing credit/(charges)                  | (17)   | 23     |\n| Total financing income and  expenses                  | (69)   | (39)   |\n\nNet financing expenses for the year were \u20ac39 million (2020: \u20ac69 million).

The ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent\n\nupon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences, losses, and credits become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could change in the near term if future estimates of projected taxable income during the carryforward period are revised. The majority of the amount of the non-current portion of deferred or current taxes will be recovered or settled after more than 12 months.\n\n## Expiration year of loss carryforwards 2021\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                             | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | Later   | Unlimited   | Total   | Deferred  tax   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Total loss carryforwards                                  | 1      | -      | 1      | -      | 3      | 17      | 3,131       | 3,153   | 795             |\n| Loss carryforwards not recognized in  deferred tax assets | (1)    | -      | (1)    | -      | -      | (9)     | (2,204)     | (2,215) | (558)           |\n| Total loss carryforwards recognized                       | -      | -      | -      | -      | 3      | 8       | 927         | 938     | 237             |\n\n## Expiration year of loss carryforwards 2020\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                             | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | Later   | Unlimited   | Total   | Deferred  tax   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Total loss carryforwards                                  | 2      | 6      | 1      | 108    | -      | 124     | 2,898       | 3,139   | 645             |\n| Loss carryforwards not recognized in  deferred tax assets | -      | (6)    | -      | -      | -      | (2)     | (2,134)     | (2,142) | (428)           |\n| Total loss carryforwards recognized                       | 2      | -      | 1      | 108    | -      | 122     | 764         | 997     | 217             |\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, deferred tax asset recoverability has been assessed using taxable profit forecasts, which take the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on future results into account. These assessments showed sufficient taxable profit to recover deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions, whilst in some jurisdictions this resulted in derecognitions or re-recognitions. In 2021, these assessments resulted in a net re-recognition of deferred tax assets of \u20ac18 million (2020: net re-recognition of \u20ac4 million).\n\nDeferred tax assets not recognized fully relate to tax loss carryforwards in 2021. The losses in the tables on tax losses carried forward are gross amounts, with the tax impact included in the last column of the table.\n\nFrom the total amount of recognized net deferred tax assets, \u20ac151 million (2020: \u20ac196 million) is related to entities that have suffered a loss in either the current of the previous year and where utilization is dependent on future taxable profit in excess of the profit arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.This assessment is based on management's long-term projections and tax planning strategies.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognized for taxable temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements, to the extent that it is probable that these will reverse in the foreseeable future. The expected net tax impact of the remaining differences for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognized is \u20ac31 million (2020: \u20ac33 million).",

Brands with indefinite useful lives are almost fully related to Dulux, which is the major brand, due to its global presence, high recognition and strategic nature. Other intangibles include licenses, know-how, intellectual property rights, software and development cost. Both at year-end 2021 and 2020, there were no material purchase commitments for individual intangible assets. No intangible assets were registered as security for bank loans.\n\n## Annual impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment per business unit (one level below segment level) annually or whenever an impairment trigger exists, applying the value-in-use method. The impairment test is in principle based on cash flow projections of the five-year plan. Elements considered to determine if a different approach would be more appropriate are, among others, high growth/emerging economies, geo expansion opportunities, introduction of new product ranges and opportunities from market consolidation. In 2021, the above exception was applied for Decorative Paints Asia and Decorative Paints South America, for which the revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA-margin development projections were extrapolated beyond the five-year explicit forecast period for another five years, applying reduced average growth rates.\n\nThe situation around COVID-19 is closely monitored; the impact on the estimated future cash flows is reflected in the models which are used to assess the valuation of the carrying value of AkzoNobel's asset base.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the projections for annual impairment testing are:\n\n- \u00b7  Revenue growth per year: based on actual experience, analysis of markets and GDP growth and expected market share developments\n- \u00b7  Adjusted EBITDA-margin development per year: based on actual experience and management's long-term projections\n- \u00b7  Weighted average cost of capital per year: the pretax discount rate determined per business unit, reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifically associated with the business units\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                            | Goodwill   | Brands   | Customer  lists   | Other  intangibles   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------|\n| Balance at January 1, 2020                               |            |          |                   |                      |         |\n| Cost of acquisition                                      | 1,121      | 2,208    | 940               | 175                  | 4,444   |\n| Cost of internally developed intangibles                 | -

These sensitivity tests show that reasonably possible changes in these key assumptions would not cause carrying amounts to exceed recoverable amounts for any of the business units.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, no impairment charges were recognized in relation to the annual impairment test.\n\n## Specific asset impairments\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, no impairment charges were recorded in relation to specific assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investments in property, plant and equipment\n\nWe thoroughly assess all investment proposals to ensure the right capital and capacity allotment and take decisions accordingly. To reinforce our capability to support customers and enhance our manufacturing and supply chain, we have invested in our sites to support the Grow and Deliver objectives. Large investments projects are ongoing amongst others at our Highpoint, US, Wood Coatings site, and at our Como, Italy, Powder Coatings site. Further investments include the setup of a new powder coatings manufacturing line at our Hanoi, Vietnam, site, and the setup of a texture making workshop at our Shanghai site to support the Deco project business growth in China.\n\nAs we strongly believe in the importance of innovation to keep AkzoNobel at the forefront of the paints and coatings industry, we have also continued to invest in RD&I, amongst others in our Deco R&D facility in Slough, UK. We have furthermore invested in capacity increases to support the liquid coatings to powder coatings evolution, an example of our increasing focus on sustainable solutions.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn March 1, 2021, we acquired Industrias Titan S.A.U. (Titan Paints) in Spain. The acquisition strengthens our paints business and footprint in Spain.\n\n## Impairments\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, no significant impairments were recognized.",

For details on share-based compensation, refer to Note 7.\n\n## Dividend\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay a stable to rising dividend. In 2021, an interim dividend of \u20ac0.44 (2020: \u20ac0.43) per common share was paid. We propose a 2021 final dividend of \u20ac1.54 (2020: \u20ac1.52) per common share, which would equal a total 2021 dividend of \u20ac1.98 (2020: \u20ac1.95).\n\n## Share buybacks\n\nOn October 23, 2019, a \u20ac500 million share buyback program was announced, for which 0.4 million common shares were acquired in 2019 and 6.2 million shares in 2020, which have all been cancelled. On October 21, 2020, a \u20ac300 million share buyback program was announced which was completed in 2021. On February 16, 2021, a \u20ac1 billion share buyback program was announced, which was completed in January 2022. This program started in April 2021. As at December 31, 2021, a total of 8.6 million shares had been acquired under this program, of which 5.9 million were cancelled.\n\nDuring 2021, 11,992,059 common shares were repurchased, of which 9,247,849 shares (2020: 9,331,481) were cancelled. For further details on weighted average number of shares, refer to Note 10.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNone of the non-controlling interests are considered individually material to the group. The effects of all transactions with non-controlling interest shareholders are recorded in equity if there is no change in control.",

The largest defined benefit pension plans are the ICI Pension Fund (ICIPF) and the Akzo Nobel (CPS) Pension Scheme in the UK which together account for 87% of defined benefit obligations (DBO) and 91% of plan assets. Other pension plans include among others the largely unfunded plans in Germany, the plans in the US and certain other smaller plans in the UK. The benefits of these pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees' compensation. The funding policy for the plans is consistent with local requirements in the countries of establishment. We also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands.\n\nValuations of the obligations under the plans are carried out regularly by independent qualified actuaries. We accrue for the expected costs of providing such post-retirement benefits during the service years of the employees. Governance of the benefit plans is the responsibility of the Executive Committee Pensions. This committee provides oversight of the costs and risks of the plans including oversight of the impact of the plans on the company in terms of cash flow, pension expenses and the balance sheet. The committee develops and maintains policies on benefit design, funding, asset allocation and assumption setting.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nAlmost all of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new members since the early to mid-2000s, although in many plans long-serving employees continue to accrue benefits. For plans in the US, benefit accrual is frozen and employees participate in defined contribution plans for future service. In countries where plans are closed, new employees are eligible to join a defined contribution arrangement. In countries in high growth markets, pension schemes currently are not material. Unless mandated by law, it is our policy that any new plans are established as defined contribution plans.\n\nThe most significant risks that we run in relation to defined benefit plans are investment returns falling short of expectations, low discount rates, inflation exceeding expectations, retirees living longer than expected and\n\nlegislation changes. The assets and liabilities of each of the funded plans are held outside of the company in a trust or a foundation, which is governed by a board of fiduciaries or trustees, depending on the legal arrangements in the country concerned. The primary objective with regards to the investment of pension plan assets is to ensure that each individual plan has sufficient funds available to satisfy future benefit obligations in accordance with local legal and legislative requirements. For this purpose, we work closely with plan trustees or fiduciaries to develop investment strategies. Studies are carried out periodically to analyze and understand the trade-off between expected investment returns, volatility of outcomes and the impact on cash contributions. We aim to strike a cautious balance between these factors in order to agree affordable contribution schedules with plan fiduciaries.\n\nPlan assets principally consist of insurance (annuity) policies, long-term interest-earning investments and (investment funds with holdings primarily in) quoted equity securities. Our largest plans use derivatives (such as index futures, currency forward contracts and swaps) to reduce volatility of underlying variables, for efficient portfolio management and to improve the liability matching characteristics of the assets. Limits have been set on the use of derivatives which are periodically subject to review for compliance with the pension fund's investment strategy.\n\nIn line with our proactive pension risk management strategy, we seek to reduce risk in our pension plans over time. We evaluate potential de-risking opportunities on an ongoing basis. Future de-risking transactions may have both cash flow and balance sheet impacts which may be substantial, as had some of the de-risking actions already taken. The cost of fully removing risk would exceed estimated funding deficits.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021, ICIPF and a smaller UK plan, the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund (ISCPF), have invested in annuity buy-in contracts that aim to hedge all key risks related to their pensioner populations. In 2021, the Trustee of the ICIPF entered into a further annuity buy-in agreement with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited. It covers, in aggregate, \u00a3127 million (\u20ac150 million) of pensioner liabilities (insurer valuation). The buy-in involved the purchase of a bulk annuity policy under which the insurer will pay to ICIPF amounts equivalent to the benefits payable to members who have recently become\n\npensioners. The pension liabilities remain with, and the matching annuity policies are held within, ICIPF. The accounting impact of the transaction is a lower valuation of the plan assets giving a reduction in Other comprehensive income of \u00a325 million (\u20ac30 million). By purchasing bulk annuities, the ICIPF and ISCPF Trustees have both taken significant steps in actively de-risking liabilities and reducing the risk that AkzoNobel will be required to contribute additional cash in the future.\n\nCPS has an insurance contract to hedge longevity risk in respect of a portion of its pensioners.\n\nIn October 2018, the UK High Court provided clarity for trustees and employers on providing equal pension benefits for men and women where they are in receipt of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions ('GMPs') as a result of the Lloyds Banking Group judgment. According to this judgment, pension schemes were required to retrospectively equalize GMPs by uplifting pensions to the same level, as far as needed, for men and women. On November 20, 2020, the High Court ruled that pension schemes will need to revisit individual transfer payments made since May 17, 1990, to check if any additional value is due as a result of GMP equalization. As a result, in 2020 a past service cost of \u00a35 million (\u20ac6 million) has been charged across the AkzoNobel pension schemes in the UK.\n\nIn setting the discount rate assumption for calculating the DBO of each plan, the so called Willis Towers Watson (WTW) RATE:Link model is used for the majority of the plans in the group. RATE:Link had previously been using a Bloomberg fixed income securities Bloomberg Industry Classification Standard (BICS) framework to provide the relevant inputs. However, due to a change in the Bloomberg BICS framework in 2020, this framework was no longer deemed suitable and RATE:Link now uses the Bloomberg Classification System (BCLASS) framework.\n\nAlthough the curve-fitting methodology had not changed in 2020, the change in Bloomberg framework used by RATE:Link resulted in an estimated net \u20ac170 million remeasurement gain included in Other comprehensive income in 2020. The impact of the change in accounting estimate in relation to bond inclusion in 2020 is included in the reconciliation balance sheet table as a \u20ac270 million gain within the overall actuarial loss due to liability financial assumption changes in the DBO, partially offset by a",

Until 2030, the CPI inflation assumption is calculated as 1% below RPI and from 2030 onwards as 0.1% below RPI. The impact has been recognized within remeasurements in Other comprehensive income in 2020. The impact on the actuarial loss due to liability financial assumption changes in the DBO is partially offset by an impact on the experience gain in plan assets in respect of the UK buy-in annuity policies and is not material.\n\nOn April 22, 2021, a court ruling resulted in a \u00a320 million (\u20ac23 million) past service credit in one of the UK pension plans, the J.P. McDougall & Co Limited Staff Pension & Life Assurance Scheme. The court ruling rectified a deed change with respect to the retirement ages from which members will receive benefits. This past service credit was booked as an identified item and included in Note 4 on Alternative Performance Measures.\n\nThe remaining pension plans primarily represent plans accounted for as defined contribution plans. This includes, among others, the Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands and the 401k Plan in the US. The ITP2 plan in Sweden is financed through insurance with the Alecta Tj\u00e4nstepension \u00d6msesidigt (i.e. 'Alecta pension insurance, mutual') (Alecta) insurance company and is classified as a multiemployer defined benefit plan. As AkzoNobel does not have access to sufficient information from Alecta to enable defined benefit accounting treatment, it is accounted for as a defined contribution plan. Contributions in 2021 were \u20ac2 million (2020: \u20ac1 million). Alecta's funding ratio is normally allowed to vary between 125% and 175%. The most recently quoted ratio at December 2021 stood at 172%. The expenses of all plans accounted for as defined contribution plans in AkzoNobel totaled \u20ac83 million in 2021 (2020: \u20ac82 million).\n\n## DBO at funded and unfunded pension plans*\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Wholly or partly funded plans   | 13,854 | 14,005 |\n| Unfunded plans                  | 194    | 179    |\n| Total                           | 14,048 | 14,184 |",

        "page_content": "## Other post-retirement benefit plans\n\nAkzoNobel provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the US and the Netherlands. The risks to which the US healthcare plans expose AkzoNobel include the risk of future increases in the cost of healthcare which would increase the cost of maintaining the plans. The benefit payments to retirees under the Dutch plan are frozen. Both plans expose AkzoNobel to the risk of a further decline in discount rates, which increases the plan obligations, and longevity risk as the plans generally pay lifetime benefits.\n\n## Reconciliation balance sheet\n\nThe closing net balance sheet position of \u20ac1,017 million (2020: \u20ac827 million) includes the pension plans (\u20ac1,143 million net asset; 2020: \u20ac963 million net asset) and other post-retirement plans (\u20ac126 million liability; 2020: \u20ac136 million liability).\n\n## Administrative expenses\n\nIn addition to the expenses borne by the funds themselves, some expenses are borne directly by AkzoNobel. Administrative expenses are incurred, especially for the UK pension funds, of \u20ac22 million (2020: \u20ac18 million), which are included in operating income. In addition, we directly incurred asset management expenses of \u20ac3 million (2020: \u20ac2 million),  which have been included in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Interest costs\n\nInterest costs on the DBO for both pensions and other post-retirement benefits, together with the interest income on plan assets, comprise the net financing income related to postretirement benefits of \u20ac13 million (2020: \u20ac14 million), refer to Note 8.\n\n## Pension plans in asset position\n\nPension balances recorded under Financial non-current assets totaled \u20ac1,638 million (2020: \u20ac1,543 million). The \u20ac95 million increase in 2021 was due to \u20ac117 million of exchange rate translation gains, \u20ac48 million of employer contributions and net income of \u20ac14 million, partially offset by \u20ac84 million of net actuarial losses in the relevant plans. These assets could be recognized under IFRIC 14 because economic benefits are available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, either during the life of the plan or on the (final) settlement of the plan liabilities.\n\n## Plan assets\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31          | Total   |   2020 Percentage of total | Total   |   2021 Percentage of total |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------|---------|----------------------------|\n| Equities                               | 366     |                          2 | 332     |                          2 |\n| Debt - fixed interest government bonds | 1,315   |                          9 | 1,444   |                          9 |\n| Debt - index-linked government bonds   | 3,121   |                         21 | 3,221   |                         21 |\n| Debt - corporate and other bonds       | 1,798   |                         12 | 1,770   |                         12 |\n| UK buy-in annuity policies             | 7,595   |                         51 | 7,698   |                         50 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents              | 215     |                          1 | 204     |                          1 |\n| Other                                  | 604     |                          4 | 661     |                          5 |\n| Total                                  | 15,014  |                        100 | 15,330  |                        100 |\n\n## Cash flows\n\n|                       |      |   Pensions | Other post-retirement benefits   | Other post-retirement benefits   |\n|-----------------------|------|------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| In \u20ac millions         | 2021 |       2022 | 2021                             | 2022                             |\n| Regular contributions |   43 |         43 | 10                               | 11                               |\n| Top-ups               |   41 |         13 | -                                | -                                |\n| Total                 |   84 |         56 | 10                               | 11                               |\n\n## Sensitivity of DBO to change in assumptions\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                  | ICIPF  UK   | CPS  UK   | Other  pension plans   | Other post- retirement  benefits   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------------|---------|\n| Discount rate: 0.5% decrease                   | 542         | 300       | 140                    | 6                                  | 988     |\n| Price inflation: 0.5% increase*                | 291         | 169       | 73                     | -                                  | 533     |\n| Life expectancy: one year increase from age 60 | 705         | 135       | 75                     | 6                                  | 921     |\n| Maturity information                           |             |           |                        |                                    |         |\n| Weighted average duration of DBO (years)       | 11.8        | 15.3      | 14.8                   | 9.3                                | 13.1    |\n\n- *  The sensitivity to price inflation assumption includes corresponding changes to all inflation-related compensation increases, pensions in payment and pensions in deferment.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe equities and government bond debt assets have quoted prices in active markets, although most are held through funds comprised of such instruments which are not actively traded themselves. The total value of plan assets not quoted in active markets is \u20ac8,420 million (2020: \u20ac8,354 million), including the UK buy-in annuity policies totaling \u20ac7,698 million (2020: \u20ac7,595 million), investments in real estate, totaling \u20ac469 million (2020: \u20ac381 million) and other investments in infrastructure, catastrophe bonds, insurance policies and highyield credit strategies. The UK buy-in annuity policies have a value that is equal to the DBO of the pensioners\n\ncovered by the policies. Plan assets did not directly include any of AkzoNobel's own transferable financial instruments, nor any property occupied by or assets used by the company.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nIn 2022, we expect to contribute \u20ac56 million (2021: \u20ac88 million) to our defined benefit pension plans, including \u00a34 million (\u20ac5 million) of top-up contributions to the CPS plan, paid from an escrow account, in line with the agreed recovery plan following the March 31, 2020 triennial valuation. We expect to pay a further \u20ac11 million (2021: \u20ac11 million) to our other post-retirement benefit plans.",

While this table illustrates the overall impact on DBO of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the total DBO. In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for each plan. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty\n\nin the valuation of the DBO under market conditions at the measurement date. Its results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in the key actuarial assumptions may have on the total DBO. Furthermore, the analysis does not indicate a probability of such changes occurring and it does not necessarily represent our view of expected future changes in DBO. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-retirement defined benefit plans are not reflected in this analysis, as they would normally be reflected in plan asset changes rather than DBO changes.\n\nThe sensitivities in the table only apply to the DBO and not to the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet. Movements in the fair value of plan assets (which include\n\nthe de-risking instruments) would, to a significant extent, be expected to offset movements in the DBO resulting from changes in the given assumptions. At ICIPF, the annuity buy-in contracts cover 99% of pensioner liabilities (2020: 99%) and 84% of total liabilities (2020: 83%).\n\nAt CPS, the longevity hedge contract covers 48% of pensioner liabilities (2020: 49%) and 30% of total liabilities (2020: 30%).",

General\n\nProvisions are recognized when an outflow of economic benefits for settlement is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated. It should be understood that, in light of possible future developments, such as: (a) potential additional lawsuits; (b) possible future settlements; and (c) rulings or judgments in pending lawsuits, certain cases may result in additional liabilities and related costs. At this point in time, we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts with sufficient certainty to allow such amount or range of amounts to be meaningful. While the outcome of said cases, claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe, based upon legal advice and information received, that the final outcome will not materially affect our consolidated financial position but could be material to our results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period.\n\n## Provisions for restructuring of activities\n\nProvisions for restructuring of activities comprise of accruals for certain employee benefits and for costs which are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific activities and closing down of facilities. For all restructuring provisions, a detailed formal plan exists and the implementation of the plan has started or the plan has been announced before the balance sheet date. Most restruc-",

Proceedings involving environmental matters, such as the alleged discharge of chemicals or waste materials into the air, water, or soil, are pending against us in various countries. In some cases, this concerns sites divested in prior years or derelict sites belonging to companies acquired in the past.\n\nThe provision has been discounted using an average pre-tax discount rate of 1.0% (2020: 0.3%).\n\n## Liabilities to (former) employees\n\nLiabilities to (former) employees consist of employer liability plans, jubilee plans and other long-term compensation plans. The majority of the cash outflows related to liabilities to (former) employees is expected to be after five years. In calculating the liabilities to (former) employees, a pretax discount rate of on average 1.5% (2020: 0.6%) has been used.\n\n## Sundry provisions\n\nSundry provisions relate to a variety of provisions, including provisions for (customer) claims, sales returns, guarantees and other operational provisions. The majority of the cash outflows related to sundry provisions is expected to be within one to five years. In calculating the sundry provisions, a pre-tax discount rate of on average negative 1.0% (2020: 0.2% negative) has been used.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nEnvironmental liabilities can change substantially due to the emergence of additional information on the nature or extent of the contamination, the geological circumstances, the necessity of employing particular methods of remediation, actions by governmental agencies or private parties, or other factors. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental exposures, it is reasonably possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs which, in management's opinion, based on information currently available, would not have a material effect on the company's financial position but could be material to the company's results of operations in any one accounting period.\n\nA number of claims against AkzoNobel are pending, many of which are contested. We are also involved in legal disputes and disputes with tax authorities in several jurisdictions. AkzoNobel has provided various indemnities and guarantees in respect of past divestments to the relevant\n\npurchasers and their permitted assigns (if applicable), which in general are capped in time and/or amount (in proportion to the value received). The provided guarantees and indemnities have varying maturity periods. AkzoNobel has received various claims under such indemnities and guarantees. In some instances, AkzoNobel has been named as a direct defendant despite the divestments.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has withdrawn its declarations of joint and several liability under Article 403 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for certain Dutch former Specialty Chemicals subsidiaries divested as per October 1, 2018, and is following the procedures to terminate its residual liability under those declarations under Article 404 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. One objection against the termination of residual liability is still pending and AkzoNobel, Nouryon and Nobian continue to cooperate to get this resolved.\n\n## Current portion of provisions\n\nThe current portion of post-retirement benefit provisions (\u20ac43 million) and the current portion of other provisions (\u20ac106 million) add up to \u20ac149 million (2020: \u20ac232 million), as reflected in the balance sheet.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe discount rates used in calculating the provisions recognized at December 31, 2021 are mentioned in the paragraphs on provisions for environmental costs, liabilities to (former)  employees and sundry provisions. Changes in discount rates will affect our consolidated financial position. A sensitivity test showed that a one percentage point increase or decrease of discount rates will have an impact down or up, respectively, of \u20ac8 million on the provisions recognized at December 31, 2021.",

These risks are inherent to the way we operate as a multinational with a large number of locally operating subsidiaries. Our overall risk management program seeks to identify, assess, and - if necessary - mitigate these financial risks in order to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance.\n\nOur risk mitigating activities include the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The Board of Management is ultimately responsible for risk management. We centrally identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks, and monitor compliance with the corporate policies approved by the Board of Management, except for commodity risks, which are subject to identification, evaluation, hedging and monitoring in the businesses. We have treasury hubs located in Brazil and China that are primarily responsible for regional cash management and short-term financing. We do not allow extensive treasury operations at subsidiary level directly with external parties.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe primary objective of liquidity management is to provide for sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all times and any place in the world to enable us to meet our payment obligations. We aim for a well-spread maturity schedule of our long-term borrowings and a strong liquidity position. At year-end 2021, we had \u20ac1.2 billion available as cash and cash equivalents (2020: \u20ac1.6 billion) and \u20ac58 million available as short-term investments (2020: \u20ac250 million), refer to Note 21.\n\nIn addition, we have a multi-currency revolving credit facility of \u20ac1.3 billion which was extended in 2021 to 2026.

        "page_content": "facility is not used. We had \u20ac371 million commercial paper outstanding at year end 2021 (2020: \u20acnil) against an average negative interest rate of 0.5%. At year-end 2021, we had a \u20ac300 million short-term bank loan outstanding (2020: \u20acnil) against a negative interest rate of 0.6%. Both facilities have a maturity of less than a year. Neither of these facilities contains financial covenants. The table on maturity of liabilities and cash outflows in this Note shows our cash outflows per maturity group. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.\n\n## CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCredit risk arises from financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, deposits with financial institutions, money market funds, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. We have a credit risk management policy in place to limit credit losses due to non-performance of financial counterparties and customers. We monitor our exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis at various levels. We only deal with financial counterparties that have a sufficiently high credit rating. Generally, we do not require collateral in respect of financial assets. Investments in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and transactions involving derivative financial instruments are entered into with counterparties that have sound credit ratings and a good reputation. Derivative transactions are concluded mostly with parties with whom we have contractual netting agreements and ISDA agreements in place. We set limits per counterparty for the different types of financial instruments we use. We closely monitor the acceptable financial counterparty credit ratings and credit limits and revise where required in line with the market circumstances. We do not expect non-performance by the counterparties for these financial instruments. Due to our geographical spread and the diversity of our customers, we were not subject to any significant concentration of credit risks at balance sheet date.\n\nThe credit risk from trade receivables is measured and analyzed at a local operating entity level, mainly by means of ageing analysis, refer to Note 17. Additionally, trade receivables and financial assets measured at amortized cost are subject to the expected credit loss impairment model either using the general or the simplified approach.\n\nFor more information on the applied impairment approaches per financial asset type, refer to Note 1.\n\nGenerally, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of financial assets in the balance sheet.\n\nAt year-end 2021, the credit risk on consolidated level was \u20ac3.9 billion (2020: \u20ac4.2 billion) for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, loans, trade and other receivables. Our credit risk is well spread among both global and local counterparties. Our largest counterparty risk amounted to \u20ac301 million at year-end 2021 (2020: \u20ac450 million).\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nTrade and financing transactions\n\nWe operate in a large number of countries, where we have clients and suppliers, many of whom are outside of the local functional currency environment. This creates currency exposure which are partly netted out on group level. The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the functional currency net cash flows resulting from trade or financing transactions are adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Our policy is to hedge our transactional foreign exchange rate exposures above predefined thresholds from recognized assets and liabilities. Hedge accounting is generally not applied for foreign currency hedging activities, except for certain specific forecast transactions. In 2021, we applied cash flow hedge accounting on a COP 1.600 billion hedge of the foreign currency risk related to the intended acquisition of Grupo Orbis. The fair value of the hedge at year-end 2021 was \u20ac19 million negative and the spot result related to this hedge was recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. The hedge will mature mid-March 2022. During 2021, the hedge was fully effective.\n\nIn general, our forward exchange contracts have a maturity of less than one year. When necessary, forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity.\n\n## Hedged notional amounts at year-end\n\n| In \u20ac millions   |   Buy 2020 | Sell 2020   | Buy 2021   | Sell 2021   |\n|-----------------|------------|-------------|------------|-------------|\n| US dollar       |        174 | 379         | 263        | 413         |\n| Pound sterling  |        485 | 31          | 601        | 45          |\n| Chinese yuan    |         31 | -           | 179        | 145         |\n| Colombian peso  |          1 | 2           | 348        | 1           |\n| Other*          |        204 | 491         | 391        | 745         |\n| Total           |        895 | 903         | 1,782      | 1,349       |\n\n## Currency derivatives are not used for speculative purposes.\n\nInvestments in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, net investment hedge accounting was applied on hedges of certain net investments in foreign operations, which were partly hedged. The main net investments included were related to Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, Indonesian rupiah and Vietnamese dong (2020: Chinese yuan and Vietnamese dong), which were hedged with forward exchange contracts for the same currencies. The spot results related to these hedges were recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cumulative translation reserves. At year-end 2021, hedges of net investments Chinese yuan were outstanding, which were not material to the financial statements. During 2021 and 2020, these hedges were fully effective.\n\n## INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nWe are partly financed with debt in order to obtain more efficient leverage. Fixed rate debt results in fair value interest rate risk. Floating rate debt results in cash flow interest rate risk. We treat fixed rate debt maturing within one year as floating rate debt for debt portfolio purposes. At the end of 2021, the fixed/floating ratio of our outstanding bonds was 70 percent fixed as we have one outstanding bond maturing within one year (2020: 100 percent fixed). During 2021 and 2020, we have not used any interest rate derivatives.",

        "page_content": "IBOR reform refers to the global reform of interest rate benchmarks, which includes the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBOR) with alternative benchmark rates. Our long-term borrowings have fixed interest rates and we currently do not have any interest related hedging instruments. Fallback language has been added to our contracts while preparing for the transition to new rates. Based on this and following an internal assessment of the impact of the IBOR reform, we conclude that the interest rate benchmark reform does not have a material impact on the company's financial statements.\n\n## CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOur objectives when managing capital are to safeguard our ability to satisfy our capital providers and to maintain a capital structure that optimizes our cost of capital. For this we maintain an adequate financial strategy, with the objective to retain a strong investment grade credit rating as assigned by the rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The capital structure can be altered, among others, by adjusting the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return of capital to capital providers, or issuance of new debt or shares. Consistent with other companies in the industry, we monitor capital headroom based on the leverage ratio net debt/EBITDA, for which we have set a target range of 1 to 2. The ratio was 1.6 in 2021 (2020: 0.8). EBITDA is the sum of operating income, depreciation and amortization; for 2021 amounting to \u20ac1,469 million (2020: \u20ac1,324 million). Net debt is calculated as the total of long and short-term borrowings less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments; for 2021 amounting to \u20ac2,340 million (2020: \u20ac1,034 million).\n\nThe part of long-term borrowings that is due within one year is presented under short-term borrowings. Shortterm borrowings include the \u20ac750 million bond maturing in 2022.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments and IFRS 9 categories\n\nIn the table 'Fair value per financial instrument category' insight is provided in the recognition of the respective financial instruments per IFRS 9 category. The total carrying value is based on the accounting principles as outlined in Note 1. Financial instruments are recognized at fair value and subsequently recognized either at fair value or at\n\n## Fair value per financial instrument category\n\n## Carrying value per IFRS 9 category\n\n| In \u20ac millions                  | Carrying  amount   | Out of scope   of IFRS 7 1   | Measured at  amortized  cost   | Measured  at fair value  through profit  or loss   | Total   carrying value   | Fair value  of items  measured at  amortized cost   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| 2020 year-end                  |                    |                              |                                |                                                    |                          |                                                     |\n| Financial non-current assets   | 1,951              | 1,669                        | 202                            | 80                                                 | 282                      | 237                                                 |\n| Trade and other receivables    | 1,994              | 121                          | 1,863                          | 10                                                 | 1,873                    | 1,863                                               |\n| Short-term investments         | 250                | -

The estimate is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt with similar maturities.\n\nA level 2 valuation method was used to determine the fair value of marketable securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments by obtaining the market price at reporting date. The fair value of foreign currency contracts and swap contracts was determined by level 2 valuation techniques using market observable input (such as foreign currency interest rates based on Reuters) and by obtaining quotes from dealers and brokers. A level 2 valuation method was used to determine the fair value of time deposits included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments using the market interest rate. The carrying amounts of cash and banks, trade receivables less allowance for impairment, other short-term borrowings and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity period of those instruments and were determined using level 2 fair\n\nvalue methods.

In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of transactions outstanding in the same currency may be aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances - e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs - all outstanding transactions under the agreement may be terminated, the termination value is assessed and a net amount is payable in settlement of the transactions. We have evaluated the potential effect of netting agreements, including the effect of rights of set-off and concluded the impact is immaterial. We did not offset any amounts regarding derivative transactions.\n\n## Sensitivities on financial instruments at year-end 2021\n\n| Sensitivity object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Sensitivity                                                            | Hypothetical impact                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Foreign currencies:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Foreign currencies:                                                    | Foreign currencies:                                                                                       |\n| We perform foreign currency sensitivity analysis  by applying an adjustment to the spot rates  prevailing at year-end.

The address of our registered office is Christian Neefestraat 2, Amsterdam; the Chamber of Commerce number is 09007809.\n\nThe financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. have been prepared in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, making use of the option of Article 362 of the Code, meaning that the accounting principles used are the same as for the Consolidated financial statements. Foreign currency amounts have been translated, assets and liabilities have been valued, and net income has been determined in accordance with the principles of valuation and determination of income presented in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor the Company financial statements, revenue mainly concerns service contracts and royalty related revenue from third parties; other income mainly concerns intercompany royalty income.\n\nConsolidated subsidiaries are all entities (including intermediate subsidiaries) over which the company has control. The company controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Subsidiaries are recognized from the date on which control is transferred to the company or its intermediate holding entities. They are derecognized from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe company applies the acquisition method to account for acquiring subsidiaries. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of assets transferred by the company, liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the company. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, and are subsumed in the net asset value of the investment in consolidated subsidiaries. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nInvestments in consolidated subsidiaries are measured at net asset value. Net asset value is based on the measure-\n\nment of assets, provisions and liabilities and determination of profit based on the principles applied in the consolidated financial statements. When an acquisition of an investment in a consolidated subsidiary is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured to fair value on the date of acquisition. The remeasurement against the book value is accounted for in the income statement. When the company ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any retained interest is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount to be accounted for in the income statement.\n\nWhen parts of investments in consolidated subsidiaries are bought or sold, and such transaction does not result in the loss of control, the difference between the consideration paid or received and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired or sold, is directly recognized in equity.\n\nThe remuneration paragraph is included in Note 26 of the Consolidated financial statements. The number of employees having a contract with the Company at year-end 2021 was 6 (2020: 6). All employees are based in the Netherlands.\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is head of the Dutch fiscal unity for corporate income tax. Members of the fiscal unity are taxed on the basis as if they are taxable on a standalone basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther items in 2021 and 2020 mainly include foreign currency results related to financing activities.\n\n## Financing income and expenses\n\n| In \u20ac millions                         | 2020   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financing income - third parties      | 2      | 2      |\n| Financing income - subsidiaries       | 91     | 77     |\n| Financing expense - third parties     | (49)   | (94)   |\n| Financing expense - subsidiaries      | (6)    | (6)    |\n| Net Interest on net debt              | 38     | (21)   |\n| Other items                           | 12     | (4)    |\n| Net other financing income/(expenses) | 12     | (4)    |\n| Total                                 | 50     | (25)   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntangible assets include (internally developed) software and other intangibles, mainly licenses.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\n| In \u20ac millions                            | Other intangibles   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Balance at January 1, 2020               |                     |\n| Cost of internally developed intangibles | 51                  |\n| Accumulated amortization                 | (6)                 |\n| Carrying value at January 1, 2020        | 45                  |\n| Movements in 2020                        |                     |\n| Additions                                | 31                  |\n| Amortization                             | (5)                 |\n| Total movements                          | 26                  |\n| Cost of internally developed intangibles | 82                  |\n| Accumulated amortization                 | (11)                |\n| Balance at December 31, 2020             | 71                  |\n| Movements in 2021                        |                     |\n| Additions                                | 31                  |\n| Amortization                             | (11)                |\n| Total movements                          | 20                  |\n| Cost of internally developed intangibles | 113                 |\n| Accumulated amortization                 | (22)                |\n| Balance at December 31, 2021             | 91                  |",

Due to an intra-group funding restructuring, several intercompany loans were transferred in 2020 and 2021 from certain foreign subsidiaries to Akzo Nobel N.V. This intra-group funding restructuring has been finalized in 2021. Intercompany loans are priced at arm's length, taking factors like the credit quality of AkzoNobel and the counterparty, country and currency risks into consideration. The fair value of the loans to subsidiaries approximates the book value.\n\nLoans to subsidiaries that will mature in 2022 amounted to \u20ac202 million, and \u20ac1,481 million will mature between 2023 and 2026 and an amount of \u20ac74 million after 2026.

Shortterm borrowings include the \u20ac750 million bond maturing in 2022.\n\nFor the fair value of the bonds issued, refer to Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements. We estimated the fair value of the bonds issued based on the quoted market prices (level 1) for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt with similar maturities. At year-end 2021, the fair value of the bonds included in long-term and short-term borrowings was \u20ac2,624 million (2020: \u20ac2,710 million).\n\nWe have a multi-currency revolving credit facility of \u20ac1.3 billion which was extended in 2021 to 2026. This facility does not contain financial covenants or acceleration provisions that are based on adverse changes in ratings or material adverse change. At year-end 2021 and 2020, this facility has not been drawn.\n\nAt year-end 2021 and 2020, none of the borrowings was secured by collateral.\n\nIn 2022, an amount of \u20ac216 million of debt from subsidiaries will mature and and amount of \u20ac1 million of debt from subsidiaries will mature after 2026. The remainder of the loans to subsidiaries has no fixed repayment schedule.\n\n## Short-term borrowings\n\nIn July 2022, a bond of \u20ac750 million will mature. This bond is classified as a short-term borrowing. We have US dollar and euro commercial paper programs in place, which can be used to the extent that the equivalent portion of the \u20ac1.3 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility is not used. We had \u20ac371 million commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2021 (2020: \u20acnil) against an average negative interest rate of 0.5%. At year-end 2021, we had a \u20ac300 million short-term bank loan outstanding (2020: \u20acnil) against a negative interest rate of 0.6%. Neither of these facilities contains financial convenants.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nShort-term investments almost entirely consist of time deposits, money market funds and marketable securities with a life time at investment date longer than three months but shorter than twelve months. At year-end 2021, we had no short-term investments outstanding (2020: \u20ac245 million).\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nDeposits and money market funds within cash and cash equivalents almost entirely consist of time deposits immediately convertible into known amounts of cash and with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase and marketable securities that can be redeemed immediately when called.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31                                            |   2020 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash on hand and in banks                                                |    427 |    304 |\n| Deposits and money markets funds  with a maturity less than three months |    309 |    100 |\n| Included in cash and cash equiva- lents in the balance sheet             |    736 |    404 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other current liabilities\n\n| In \u20ac millions, at December 31   |   2020 | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Payables to subsidiairies*      |     63 | 30     |\n| FX contracts                    |      7 | 27     |\n| Debt related to pensions        |      3 | -      |\n| Other suppliers                 |     58 | 1      |\n| Interest payable                |     22 | 22     |\n| Other liabilities               |     60 | 17     |\n| Total                           |    213 | 97     |\n\n- * The fair value of the payables to subsidiaries approximates the book value.\n\nOther current liabilities are expected to fall due in less than one year.",

('the company') give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as at December 31, 2021, and of its result for the year then ended in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n\n## What we have audited\n\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements 2021 of Akzo Nobel N.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The financial statements include the Consolidated financial statements of the Group and the Company financial statements.\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7  The Consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2021\n- \u00b7  The following statements for 2021: the Consolidated statement of income; the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income; of changes in equity and of cash flows and\n- \u00b7  The notes, comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information\n\nThe Company financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7  The Balance sheet as at December 31, 2021\n- \u00b7  The Statement of income for the year then ended\n- \u00b7  The notes, comprising the accounting policies applied and other explanatory information\n\nThe financial reporting framework applied in the preparation of the financial statements is EU-IFRS and the relevant provisions of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Consolidated financial statements and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the Company financial statements.\n\n## The basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. We have further described our responsibilities under those standards in the section 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with the European Union 'Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities', the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\n## Our audit approach\n\nWe designed our audit procedures with respect to the key audit matters, fraud, going concern and the findings resulting thereof in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and our forming of an opinion thereon. The information we use in support of our opinion, such as our findings and observations related to individual key audit matters, the audit approach to fraud risk and the audit approach to going concern, was addressed in this context. We do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n## Overview and context\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. is a global paints and coatings company headquartered in the Netherlands and with operations in over 150 countries. Our group audit scope and approach are set out in the section 'The scope of our\n\ngroup audit'. In our audit we paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group, as set out below.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where the Board of Management made important judgments, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, the company describes areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. We consider the valuation of the post-retirement benefit provisions and the valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions to be key audit matters as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report, given the significant estimation uncertainty, the judgemental nature and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement.\n\nThe new 'Grow & Deliver' strategy of Akzo Nobel N.V. aims to balance growth with further profitability improvements. Due to the new strategy, we discontinued the prior year key audit matter 'Transformation to deliver towards the 'Winning together: 15 by 20' strategy'. Over the past years, the company executed a wide range of transformational projects impacting the company's systems, processes and controls.\n\nThese projects continued in 2021, with the goal to align to the company's evolving operating model, focusing on end-to-end processes and to increase operational efficiencies and effectiveness. Inherently, transformation processes encompass changes in the organization, systems, processes and controls. We therefore extended our audit procedures to evaluate the impact of the transformation on our audit. Due to the significance of the ongoing transformation to the company and the extended audit procedures, we included 'Ongoing transformation of the organization, systems, processes and controls' as a new key audit matter, as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report.\n\nThe ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with several extreme weather events early in the year, caused disruption across the company's incoming supply chains. This resulted in shortages of key raw",

        "page_content": "materials and input cost increase compared with 2020. The company responded with pricing initiatives to compensate for the raw material cost inflation. We considered the impact of these developments on our audit approach, including our scoping, materiality and risk assessment. In particular, we assessed the impact on significant management accounting judgments, including future business and cash flow projections underpinning impairment assessments, deferred tax asset recoverability and the going concern assumption. We concluded this to be an area of focus, that is not considered as a key audit matter.\n\nAkzoNobel N.V. assessed the possible effects of climate change and their plans to meet emissions reduction commitments. The company considered, among others, physical risks, such as those associated with water scarcity, flooding and weather events, as well as transitional risks that can lead to changes in technology, market dynamics and regulations. Management also assessed the resulting impact on the financial position, including underlying assumptions and estimates. As part of our audit risk assessment, we gained an understanding of the company's strategy and sustainability targets, evaluated the potential impact on the financial statements and discussed this with management. We concluded that the impact of climate change is not considered a key audit matter.\n\nOther areas of focus that we do not consider to be key audit matters were related to the impairment testing of goodwill and brands with indefinite useful lives, testing of valuation of the other provisions and information technology general controls (ITGCs).\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams at both group and component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of the Group. We therefore included in our team experts in the areas of pensions, share-based payments and valuations and specialists in the areas of tax, IT and treasury.\n\nThe outline of our audit approach was as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7  Overall materiality: \u20ac55 million (2020: \u20ac45 million)\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u00b7  We conducted audit work at 49 components in 18 countries\n- \u00b7  Site reviews were virtually conducted to 9 countries (39 components)\n- \u00b7  Audit coverage: 64% of consolidated revenue, 68% of consolidated total assets and 60% of consolidated profit before tax\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7  Ongoing transformation of the organization, systems, processes and controls\n- \u00b7  Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions\n- \u00b7  Valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by the application of materiality, which is further explained in the section 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements'.\n\nBased on our professional judgment we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to evaluate the effect of identified misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole and on our opinion.\n\n| Overall group  materiality          | \u20ac55 million (2020: \u20ac45 million).                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basis for  determining  materiality | We used our professional judgment to determine  overall materiality.

The financial information of this Group is included in the Consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting",

In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at component level by the group engagement team and by each component auditor.\n\nThe group audit includes 24 components which were subjected to audits of their complete financial information, selected on the basis of the relative size of their operations. None of the components are individually financially significant to the group. We further subjected 13 components to specific focused audit procedures on individual financial statement line items, such as post-retirement benefit provisions, tax, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, based on the relative size or related higher inherent risks of material misstatement.\n\nAdditionally, we selected 12 components for audit procedures to achieve appropriate audit coverage on financial line items in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:\n\n| Revenue           | 64%   |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Total assets      | 68%   |\n| Profit before tax | 60%   |\n\nNone of the remaining components represented more than 3% of total group revenue or total group assets or profit before tax. For those remaining components we performed, among others, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within those components.\n\nFor all components we used component auditors who are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform the audit work. We collectively performed hard close audit procedures on the interim October balance sheet positions and results. These hard close audit procedures included substantive audit work on certain material balances and transactions. Roll-forward procedures and top-up testing were performed at year-end to cover the full year period.\n\nWhere component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a basis for our opinion on the Consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe issued instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included, among others, our risk analysis, materiality and the scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified, the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We had individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams throughout the audit. During these calls, we discussed the significant accounting and audit matters identified by the component auditors, their reports, the findings of their procedures and other matters that could be of relevance for the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe group engagement team virtually attended site review meetings with a selection of the component teams and local management. During these meetings we discussed the strategy and financial performance of the local businesses, as well as the audit plan and execution, significant risks and other relevant audit topics. The most significant components are selected every year and other components are selected depending on specific considerations which include, among others, audit observations, specific risks identified and other major events. In the current year, components in the following countries were selected: United States, China, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy, India, Sweden and the Netherlands. Finally, for all in-scope components in Europe we set-up a physical site visit to the company's Regional Accounting Center ('RAC') in Poland, to increase our and the component teams' understanding of the developments and processes in the RAC.\n\nThe group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a number of more complex items and processes controlled and monitored centrally by Akzo Nobel N.V. These include impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, share-based payments, valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain\n\ntax positions, other provisions (i.e. corporate material claims), treasury, ITGCs and the Akzo Nobel N.V. standalone entity.\n\nBy performing the procedures outlined above at the components, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group's financial information, as a whole, to provide a basis for our opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Audit approach fraud risks\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has an integrity and compliance program, which includes a governance structure, policies and procedures around risk management, policy management, communication, training and education, third party risk management, monitoring, grievance and investigation and reporting.\n\n## Our risk assessment\n\nWe identified and assessed the risk of material misstatements to the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the elements of the system of internal control, in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as among others, the Code of Conduct, procedures on various anti-bribery and anti-corruption risks, the SpeakUp! program and incident registration and reporting. This includes the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes thereof.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets, and bribery and corruption. Together with our forensic specialists, we evaluated the risk of material misstatement due to fraud to the financial statements. We conducted interviews with both members of the Board of Management, with members of the Executive Committee, with members of the Supervisory Board and others within the company, including the Internal Audit and Integrity and Compliance function, to obtain an understanding of the company's fraud risk assessment and the processes for identifying and responding to the risks of fraud and the internal control that management has established to mitigate these risks.",

        "page_content": "As described in the auditing standards, management override of controls and risk of fraud in revenue recognition are presumed risks of fraud.\n\nInherently, management of a company is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of management's ability to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively. We addressed this risk of management override of controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of potential bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud (for examples of our audit response refer to the key audit matters 'Valuation of post-retirement benefit provisions' and 'Valuation of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions'). The audit procedures to respond to the assessed risks include, among others, evaluation of the design and the implementation of internal controls that intend to mitigate fraud risks (such as processing and review of journal entries). In addition, we performed retrospective review of prior year's estimates, and procedures on unexpected journal entries with the support of data analytics. Furthermore, we, together with our forensic specialists, assessed matters reported on the Group's whistleblowing and complaints procedures and results of management's investigation of such matters, if deemed applicable, and discussed this with the Audit Committee. We also paid attention to significant transactions outside the normal course of business.\n\nWith regard to the risk of fraud in revenue recognition, based on our risk assessment procedures, we concluded that this risk is related to the occurrence of revenue transactions. We instructed our components to perform procedures over this risk, including evaluation of the design and implementation of relevant internal controls, tracing a sample of revenue transactions to the supporting documents and validating unusual journal entries. As described in the section 'The scope of our group audit' we reviewed the audit procedures performed by our component teams. We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non compliance.\n\n## Audit approach going concern\n\nAs disclosed in Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements, management performed their assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future and has not identified events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern (hereafter: going concern risks). Our procedures to evaluate management's going concern assessment included, among others:\n\n- \u00b7  Considering whether management's going concern assessment includes the relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit, inquiring with management regarding management's most important assumptions underlying their going concern assessment\n- \u00b7  Analyzing the financial position per balance sheet date, such as financial leverage and cash positions, in relation to the financial position per prior year balance sheet date to assess whether events or circumstances exist that may lead to a going concern risk, and liquidity management as disclosed in Note 27 of the Consolidated financial statements\n- \u00b7  Evaluating management's current budget, including expected future cash flows in comparison with last year, market developments (for example, development in raw materials), credit ratings and the relevant information of which we are aware as a result of our audit, including, among others, the cash flow projection of the five-year plan obtained as part of the goodwill impairment testing\n- \u00b7  Performing inquiries of management as to their knowledge of going concern risks beyond the period of management's assessment\n\nOur procedures did not result in outcomes contrary to management's assumptions and judgments used in the application of the going concern assumption.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.\n\nWe addressed the key audit matters in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon. We do not provide separate opinions on these matters or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any comment or observation we made on the results of our procedures should be read in this context.",

This followed the passing of a resolution by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on April 29, 2014, and effective January 1, 2016. Our engagement has been renewed annually.\n\n## European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\nAkzo Nobel N.V. has prepared the annual report, including the financial statements, in ESEF. The requirements for this format are set out in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (these requirements are hereinafter referred to as: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report prepared in XHTML format, including the partially tagged Consolidated financial statements as included in the reporting package by Akzo Nobel N.V., has been prepared in all material respects in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for preparing the annual report, including the financial statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby the Board of Management combines the various components into a single reporting package.

Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Board of Management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the Board of Management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion.

Our audit consisted, among others, of the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control\n- \u00b7  Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Management\n- \u00b7  Concluding on the appropriateness of the Board of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation\n\nConsidering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the Consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the\n\naudit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the Audit Committee in accordance with article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

('AkzoNobel' or 'the company'). Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected non-financial performance indicators in the Sustainability statements of the annual report 2021 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the AkzoNobel's Reporting principles Sustainability statements 2021.\n\n## What we have examined\n\nThe object of our assurance engagement concerns the selected non-financial performance indicators in the Sustainability statements of the annual report 2021 marked with the symbol ' ' ('the Indicators') for the year ended December 31, 2021.

This engagement is aimed to provide limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities for the examination' of our report.\n\nWe believe that the assurance information we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Independence and quality control\n\nWe are independent of Akzo Nobel N.V. in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional conduct).\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for quality systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Applicable criteria\n\nThe Indicators need to be read and understood in conjunction with the reporting criteria. The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Indicators are AkzoNobel's Reporting principles Sustainability statements 2021 developed by the company, as disclosed in the 'Managing sustainability' paragraph of the annual report 2021 and further elaborated in the document 'Reporting principles Sustainability statements 2021' which was made available online* at www.akzonobel.com/en/about-us/sustainability-/ reporting-principles-.

They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users taken on the basis of the Indicators. Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our assurance procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion.\n\n## Procedures performed\n\nWe have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the examination in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3000A, ethical requirements and independence requirements.\n\nOur examination consisted, among other things of the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures to the Indicators. This includes the evaluation of the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of Management.\n- \u00b7  Obtaining an understanding of the reporting process for the Indicators, including obtaining a general understanding of internal control relevant to the examination in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing a conclusion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. Identifying areas of the Indicators with a higher risk of a material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n- \u00b7   Designing and performing assurance procedures responsive to those risks and obtaining evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. These procedures consisted, among others, of:\n- -  Interviewing management (and/or relevant staff) at corporate level responsible for the sustainability strategy, policy and results;\n- -  Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data resulting in the Indicators;\n- -  Determining the nature and extent of procedures relating to group components and locations. For this, the nature, extent and/or risk profile of these components are decisive. Based thereon, we selected a component and location (Chengdu, China) for which we performed remote review procedures to validate our understanding of local processes and internal control, and validated selected source data\n- -  Obtaining assurance evidence that the Indicators reconcile with underlying records of the company;\n- -  Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation;\n- -  Performing an analytical review of the data and trends of the Indicators submitted for consolidation at corporate level.\n- \u00b7  Evaluating the consistency of the Indicators with the information in the annual report 2021, which is not included in the scope of our review.\n- \u00b7  To consider whether the Indicators as a whole, including the disclosures, reflect the purpose of the reporting criteria used.\n\nWe communicated with the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the review and significant findings that we identified during our review.\n\nAmsterdam, February 28, 2022\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.\n\nOriginal has been signed by Fernand Izeboud RA",
