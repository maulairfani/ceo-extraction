That focus on sustainability was especially appropriate as 2021 marked CLP's 120 th anniversary,\n\n2021 Annual Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na milestone that gave us the opportunity to reflect on a proud history and make plans for future growth so that we can serve our communities for generations to come.\n\nThis report is a record of our performance in a turbulent landmark year. It acknowledges the many challenges we faced as a business, and highlights the resilience of our people and the dependable results delivered by our teams across Asia Pacific.\n\nOver the course of the year, we conducted a comprehensive review of our suite of reports to align our disclosure with evolving standards, and to maximise the integration between the Annual Report and the Sustainability Report. We aimed to produce a truly integrated Annual Report that meets - and in many respects exceeds - statutory and regulatory requirements and accounting standards, such as the Hong Kong Listing Rules and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). As a result, a number of new features were introduced and improvements were made. One such was the launch of a standalone Climate-related Disclosures Report which is in line with the TCFD recommendations and a testament to our commitment to address climate change and keep our stakeholders informed of our progress.\n\nThe review also led us to adopt an approach of double materiality - the concept that companies should report on sustainability matters from the viewpoints of both their impact on enterprise value and their impact on people, the environment and the economy. Based on that approach, the Annual Report focuses on environment, social and governance (ESG) topics that potentially create or erode enterprise value. ESG topics that have an impact on people, the environment and the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neconomy, meanwhile, are discussed in the Sustainability Report. More information about the assessment, the double materiality concept and the material topics can be found in the new chapter titled 'Sustainability as Our Business Strategy' on page 22.\n\nWe have streamlined the five sections under Business Performance and Outlook by focusing on issues surrounding high-level financial, operational and ESG performance. At the same time, we have enhanced the content of the six Capitals sections, with a focus on ESG topics that are financially material.\n\nThe result, we hope, is an informative yet focused Annual Report that provides readers with a comprehensive account of our resilient performance in areas of materiality. Please also take the time to read the complementary Sustainability Report to get a full and detailed understanding of our ESG performance, as well as the inaugural Climate-related Disclosures Report to review how CLP manages the energy transition in light of a changing climate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA Snapshot of 2021 Annual Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021 Sustainability Report\n\n2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report\n\nC\n\nL",

We have been adapting and building our resilience to COVID-19, sustaining operational excellence and strengthening our commitment to decarbonisation.\n\nMore than two years into the pandemic, we continued to make it our priority to look after people - our colleagues, customers and the communities. Many of our markets have seen the beginning of their economic recovery from COVID-19 although a recent surge in variant cases is disrupting the course.\n\nThe lingering impact of the pandemic and other challenges such as the energy crisis and high fuel prices impacted CLP's financial performance in Australia and our thermal assets in Mainland China. However our main Hong Kong operation was largely dependable. We remain cautiously\n\noptimistic on the region's economic outlook, especially given the strengths of our position in our home market Hong Kong alongside our long-term commitment in Mainland China.\n\nIn 2021, the Group's operating earnings decreased 17.8% to HK$9,517 million, while total earnings fell 25.9% to HK$8,491 million from 2020. The drop in total earnings was primarily due to significantly lower earnings from the generation portfolio of our Australian business and high coal prices in Mainland China. There were also several one-off charges including settlement of a long-running litigation in Australia and costs in ensuring the safe operation of the Yallourn mine following the impact caused by extreme weather.\n\nNotwithstanding this, the Board is confident in the Group's ability to maintain the integrity of its operations and has approved a fourth interim dividend payment for 2021 of HK$1.21 per share, in line with the same period in 2020. Total dividends per share for 2021 are maintained at HK$3.10.",

Given the complexity of the issue and the diversity of stakeholders involved, we welcome the progress that emerged from the summit and the strengthened commitments many countries made in 2021. In spite of the progress and commitments demonstrated so far, more needs to be done. We must all recognise that success will not appear overnight, and we are just embarking on this long journey.\n\nIn September, we unveiled our updated Climate Vision 2050 with a commitment to achieving net-zero emissions across our business by 2050. We brought forward the date of the complete phase-out of the coal-fired generation assets in our portfolio to 2040, a decade earlier than previously pledged.\n\nWe have set new targets for 2030 and further strengthened our 2040 targets to align with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of limiting global warming to well-below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. To pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, we remain committed to strengthening our decarbonisation targets at least every\n\nfive years. As we race against time and move towards net zero, careful long-term planning and coordination to balance different interests as well as large-scale investments to support the transition will become ever more critical.\n\nAs one of the largest integrated utility companies in the Asia-Pacific region, CLP's approach to tackling the threats of climate change has a dual focus: to progressively decarbonise our business operations while providing sustainable and commercially viable energy solutions that will deliver netzero for this generation and the next. We are also keenly aware that once our industry is decarbonised, greater use of electricity can enable other sectors in the economy such as transportation and manufacturing to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nWe ended 2021 with the Group's commitment to capital expenditure at a high level, mainly driven by the decarbonisation investments in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia and India. While these investments reflect our commitment to decarbonisation and confidence in the economic prospects of our markets, they also highlight the importance of partnerships given the significant capital required.\n\nThe new gas-fired generation unit at Black Point Power Station marks an important milestone in Hong Kong's transition towards a zero-carbon future.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our collaboration since 2018 has enabled Apraava Energy - the new brand of our Indian business - to venture into new industry segments and secure a number of significant investments including two transmission projects.\n\nThis business model of bringing in new capital to fund the investments required for the energy transition in our markets has proven effective. CLP is open to replicate this in other markets to draw on support from investors and financiers.\n\nCloser to home we are witnessing the growth opportunities created by a rise in the demand for smart, green energy services in the Greater Bay Area. We believe innovation will be at the epicentre of the energy transition and CLP is keen to leverage technology and our expertise in Hong Kong to bring sustainable energy solutions to a wider audience.\n\n2021 is a year to be remembered. It was CLP's 120 th anniversary - an opportune time to reflect on our long history in Hong Kong, our growing capabilities in Mainland China and other territories, and the abilities to deliver in such fast-changing markets. During our anniversary year, we took the opportunity to reinforce our long-standing commitment to Hong Kong and deepen our connections with the communities of which we have been a proud member since 1901. In October, I had the pleasure - together with the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region The Honourable Mrs Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor - to officiate the opening of a state-of-the-art gas-fired generation unit at our Black Point Power Station. The addition of this new facility is a strong testament to our dedication to continue to serve this city with less carbon emission.\n\nOur resilience today, just like our historic successes, is of course built on the people who make up this business. To the 8,116 CLP colleagues around the world, whose passion and expertise inspire us every day, may I thank you.\n\nAs we look forward to 2022 and many more years ahead, I am pleased to say that we shall be moving our head office to a brand new building in the Kai Tak Development Area which will provide an exciting and truly modern place to work for our colleagues. In the last decade, this site of Hong Kong's famous old airport at Kai Tak has seen its own transformation to a modern business hub - a shining representation of Hong Kong's dynamic, digital future. The new head office project underlines our confidence in Hong Kong and commitment to continue to support the sustainable growth of our city.\n\nIn the face of the challenges and opportunities of this decade that are becoming increasingly clear, our focus and priorities are also well-defined. Working closely with partners and governments in our markets to support the realisation of climate targets, deliver a credible decarbonisation plan and leverage technology to serve growing demand for energy solutions are top of mind. But most important of all, building and organising an agile, innovative workforce with the right values and ability to thrive regardless of the external environment will come to define what CLP truly stands for as a Utility of the Future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Honourable Sir Michael David Kadoorie Hong Kong, 28 February 2022",

I am pleased that the business continued to exercise the agility and dedication to maintain a high level of resilience across our operations during the year.\n\nClimate change, with the associated natural disasters becoming more severe and frequent, represents a specific risk to our communities and our operations. CLP's strategy recognises not just our own important journey to net zero, but our ability to play a key role in supporting decarbonisation of the wider society wherever we operate.\n\nThe energy crisis in Europe, a power crunch in China and higher fuel prices in many regions have re-emphasised the need for careful planning and coordination to manage the energy transition smoothly. Any significant shocks to reliability, price\n\nand employment in the energy sector could easily threaten the necessary collaboration between energy companies, their customers and governments in delivering the energy transition.\n\nIt is reassuring that our Climate Vision 2050 is laying out a clear decarbonisation roadmap for the business. In 2021, we conducted a strategic review of Climate Vision 2050, taking into account a comprehensive range of factors including the latest climate science, technology trends, the regulatory environment, the risks and opportunities to the business and the views of key internal and external stakeholders, not least our investors. The updated document includes more ambitious targets and our pledge to accelerate the phase-out of coal. To deliver a safe, reliable and cost-effective energy transition, targeted investments in new low-carbon opportunities and close partnerships on the decarbonisation journey will now constellate.\n\nIn 2021, our partnerships with governments in markets where we operate have proved fruitful. Through these collaborations, we were able to contribute the most of our experience and expertise to support the achievement of national climate targets and the coordination of an orderly energy transition that leaves no one behind.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "On an industry level, our partnerships with like-minded organisations helped galvanise the efforts required to enable solutions at scale. During COP26, CLP joined 27 other companies in making pledges to drive growth in demand for, and supply of, hydrogen. The pledges we made, through the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and The Sustainable Markets Initiative, sent a clear signal for an increased use of hydrogen as a low-carbon fuel in generation and transportation and a prompt to hydrogen producers to develop additional capacity at scale. As with any new lowand zero-carbon technology, scale will bring commercial viability. This will be key for the gradual introduction of hydrogen into our gas-fired power plants in Australia as well as Hong Kong.\n\n## Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong remains the cornerstone of our business and the city's gradual economic recovery from COVID-19 last year lifted electricity demand across sectors. In 2021, operating earnings from Hong Kong's electricity business increased 4.7% to HK$8,189 million as we continued to make investments to support the city's energy transition.\n\nTwo of the most important new projects being developed are the second combined-cycle gas turbine unit at Black Point Power Station and the new offshore LNG terminal. Both will facilitate the higher use of natural gas - an important\n\nbridging fuel - and play key roles in delivering the Hong Kong Government's long-term decarbonisation strategy outlined in its Climate Action Plan 2050. In spite of the global supply chain disruptions brought by the pandemic, good progress was made with the construction of these projects during the year.\n\nOur focus on promoting local renewable and zero-carbon energy continued, including supporting customers and businesses to improve their energy efficiency even further. We are also pressing ahead with a feasibility study on building an offshore wind farm in Hong Kong's waters. In September, we reached a Memorandum of Understanding with GE to develop a decarbonisation roadmap to use hydrogen in CLP's gas-fired power generation facilities in Hong Kong.\n\nWe continued our digitisation journey including the further roll-out of smart meters and enhancing customer experience with greater digital interactions. The growing digitalisation of the overall economy - including, for example, the increased use of data centres - offers a significant opportunity for growth. In response to new electricity requirements from our customers, the Hong Kong Government in November approved an additional capital expenditure of more than HK$3 billion under the Development Plan for 2018-2023 for us to reinforce our network to meet the expected increase in demand.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The electrification of transportation is a trend we watch closely. CLP welcomes the Hong Kong Government's announcement in 2021 of a roadmap to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). We continued to support this policy direction by providing free EV charging facilities and offering support to private residential buildings interested in applying for government funding to install charging infrastructure.\n\nAs one of the city's two electricity providers, CLP operates within a regulatory framework which in turn provides stability and visibility to strategically plan investments, which are often made for decades. We will continue to invest for the long term to support the Hong Kong Government's climate targets and the city's digitalisation pathway, and act as an orchestrator to facilitate our customers to decarbonise, electrify or improve their energy efficiency.\n\n## Mainland China\n\nWe maintained output during the challenging time to support the Chinese economy. While our non-carbon portfolio continued to perform reliably, the coal-based assets were impacted negatively by notably higher fuel prices. Although coal assets are only a small part of our generation portfolio, they saw a loss in 2021 due to high fuel prices and sustained periods of use. This weighed on Mainland China's operating earnings, which decreased 25.7% from a year ago to HK$1,660 million. As coal prices continued to stabilise, we do not expect this particular issue to repeat in 2022.\n\nBesides the higher contributions from our nuclear portfolio, there were steady operations from our wind and solar energy assets, including the new Laiwu III wind farm in Shandong province. We also saw the completion of our first grid-parity wind project which does not rely on government subsidies Qian'an III in Jilin province - with an accompanying battery storage.\n\nIn a good example of innovative business model we expect to see thrive in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), we have signed our first contract to invest in and operate a centralised cooling system at a shopping centre in Guangzhou, a city near Hong Kong. We are exploring other emerging smart energy opportunities including more work with data centres and energy management systems. Retail energy also remains an area of potential interest especially as the industry continues to reform, opening up more opportunities for private investment.\n\nThe adoption rate for EVs in China is one of the highest in the world. We will continue to analyse the scale and nature of the opportunity for us to participate in this sector, and invest in the right way at the right time.\n\n2022 will see us maintain our focus on restoring the financial performance of our coal-fired assets and pursuing new grid-parity renewable energy projects, as well as continuing to explore smart energy opportunities and strengthen collaboration across the GBA, aligned with the Government's 14 th Five-Year Plan.\n\n## Australia\n\nDuring the year we continued to look after our customers and maintained our focus on the ongoing energy transition commencing major decarbonisation projects.\n\nThere was significant progress on EnergyAustralia's future clean energy portfolio with the support of Federal and State Governments, all of which have in place net zero by 2050 as a policy and this is helping to create a clearer energy policy environment, something that is most welcome. In a highlight of EnergyAustralia's own efforts, the company updated its Climate Change Statement with enhanced commitments mirroring those in the Group's Climate Vision 2050.\n\nAs part of our commitment to phase out coal, we collaborated with the Victorian Government to advance the retirement of Yallourn Power Station to 2028. We have progressed our investments in the Wooreen battery storage project which is expected to support the Victorian electricity system's reliable supply. EnergyAustralia also secured a market operational agreement related to Kidston pumped hydro energy storage project which will commence once that facility is commissioned in 2024.\n\nWe announced an expansion of Tallawarra Power Station located in New South Wales which will be capable of running with 5% hydrogen in its fuel mix from day one. This will be the first net-zero emissions hydrogen and gas capable power plant in Australia, with direct carbon emissions from the project offset over its operational life.\n\nTo support Australia's energy transition, significant capital will be needed for major infrastructure projects. We will consider tapping into available funding in the market in order to deliver on lower- and zero-carbon investments.",

Furthermore, total earnings were impacted by the one-off settlement of the Iona gas plant disposal litigation and the expenses related to the extreme rainfall event in June, which damaged the Morwell River Diversion at the Yallourn mine and led to a temporary suspension of mine production, resulting in the aforementioned lower generation.\n\nAs the pace of the energy transition in Australia increases, the industry as a whole will face volatile and uncertain operating conditions including an increasingly competitive landscape. Against that backdrop, EnergyAustralia may continue to be affected by challenging market conditions during 2022 including the continuation of low realised wholesale electricity prices, higher gas costs and intense competition in retail energy markets.\n\nProfessor Paul Lam Kwan-sing President, Hong Kong\n\nMetropolitan University\n\n## India\n\nOur partnership with CDPQ, which has a 40% stake in our business in India, continued to function well and deliver stable business performance during the year. Our focus operationally was on protecting the health of employees amid a severe second wave of COVID-19 in India in the second quarter of the year. We continued to make contributions to relief efforts at both the Group and national levels. The recovery in overall electricity demand in India reflected a gradual easing of the pandemic towards the end of 2021.\n\nWe continued to work with the Indian Government to seek clarifications of the new foreign investment laws and were pleased to receive requisite regulatory approvals to acquire a 49% shareholding in Kohima-Mariani Transmission Limited (KMTL), the beneficial owner of an interstate transmission project in northeastern India, as well as a registration which enables Apraava Energy to participate in new greenfield bidding opportunities.\n\nRichard Lancaster Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDecarbonisation is going to bring lots of changes to society and CLP. How can CLP remain competitive? And who will benefit from these changes?\n\nClimate change is real and happening. You can look at it and say this is going to impact what I currently do and it's going to take away some value from what I've already invested in, but that's a very negative way of looking at it. If CLP can decarbonise electricity as quickly as possible, more people will want to use electricity, which is actually a positive story for CLP and for the economy.\n\nAnd for many businesses, if you accept that climate change is happening, if you accept that this is something that you have to prepare yourself for, you owe it to yourself to look for the opportunities offered by the energy transition. These opportunities may come in the form of smart technologies. For example, we have much more sophisticated control systems now and we make much greater use of data analytics. Hydrogen is another example. So there are new technologies that we're adopting here. And if Hong Kong is looking at developing itself as an innovation and technology hub, then there may well be great opportunities for Hong Kong businesses here.\n\nIf you look at climate change as a massive transition with new infrastructure, and lots and lots of changes in all of that, there will be opportunities. And for those that are quick to act and quick to deploy their skills or adjust their businesses, they will be the ones that benefit most from this.",

The Jhajjar coal-fired station continued to demonstrate robust operations despite growing coal costs, although contributions were slightly lower due to a reset in tariff. Overall, Apraava Energy's operating earnings were 26.3% higher at HK$221 million.\n\nThe rebranding from CLP India to Apraava Energy - a name inspired by the combination of four Sanskrit words - Agni (Fire), Prithvi (Earth), Ambu (Water) and Vayu (Wind), is symbolically significant as it represents the growth potential that will come from renewable energy. India is on an ambitious drive to be one of the world's leading centres of clean energy and Apraava Energy is well placed to be an important contributor to that new energy future. With a strategic focus on clean energy and customer-focused energy businesses, we aim to see Apraava Energy double the size of its portfolio in the next two to three years.\n\n## A New Era of Changes and Opportunities\n\nAlthough the impacts of climate change have no regard for borders, we do not expect all our markets to be the same on their energy transition. In a world where energy transitions will move at different paces, our strategy will see us flexing what we do in each territory to deliver solutions adapted to each localised context.\n\nOur core markets of Hong Kong and Mainland China will continue to see growth in our asset base. The energy transition continues to present new business opportunities in the GBA, not least as we see more regional integrations across the energy industry. Our Hong Kong business is naturally well placed to extend, given our expertise and capabilities across retail, generation, nuclear and smart energy services.\n\nThis new growth cycle is reflective of the whole energy market being in transition. The world's biggest challenge decarbonising electricity - is also our biggest opportunity. The more successful we are at decarbonising electricity, the stronger our markets and our business will be.\n\nCompanies like CLP that are at the forefront of the energy transition must themselves transition and transform to embrace these challenges and opportunities while keeping the best interest of the customers in mind. We will adapt the way we operate and organise ourselves as appropriate to ensure we deliver against our strategy at the right pace. We will also instil new ways of working among our people, emphasising on agility and the capability to leverage cutting edge technologies.\n\nI am delighted by the ongoing partnerships we are seeing in 2021 - from national, local and regional governments to private sector partnerships that will power our transition forward. We look forward to working even more closely with the public and private sectors as well as the broader finance industry on this journey. Our investors are our key partners and we welcome their ongoing, positive engagement with our transition.\n\nCLP brings energy expertise and continual evolution stretching back more than 120 years. In the face of crises like COVID-19 and climate change, our long-term thinking and resilience will become ever more critical. In the coming years, we will strengthen our capability, agility and adaptability to identify and provide the energy solutions suitable for each of our markets and create most value from one generation to the next.\n\nRichard Lancaster Hong Kong, 28 February 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

With a proud history of more than 120 years, CLP is committed to creating long-term value for stakeholders.\n\nThe longevity of CLP is grounded in a clear sense of purpose. We exist to provide sustainable energy solutions that create value for shareholders, customers, employees, business partners and the communities in which we operate. This sense of purpose has guided us through the decades, and will remain our mainstay in the decades to come.\n\nLong-term success requires a flexible strategy capable of evolving with time and taking into consideration broadening sustainability challenges. Recognising this, we regularly review our strategic priorities against environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant social and economic disruption, presented myriad challenges and opportunities, and accelerated pre-existing trends. In an environment of acute uncertainty, companies have\n\nbeen forced to re-evaluate their strategic priorities and face intense scrutiny from shareholders and other key stakeholders over their adaptability and resilience. CLP is no exception.\n\nWe conducted our first double materiality assessment in late 2021. This revised approach to materiality - based on best practice from global reporting standard setters allows us to better reflect ESG risks and opportunities in our business strategy from both a financial and an impact perspective:\n\n- Financially material topics , which potentially create or erode enterprise value, are covered in this Annual Report. The key audience is providers of financial capital.\n- Impact material topics , which reflect significant positive or negative impacts on people, the environment and the economy, are covered in the Sustainability Report.

CLP must respond accordingly to remain competitive. Our focus is on reducing stranded asset risk for fossil fuel-powered assets and supporting our reputation as a responsible energy provider.\n\n- Investments in non-carbon assets and transition enablers are drawing increasing interest from a broad spectrum of investors who share our Climate Vision 2050 objectives, creating the environment for CLP to attract capital and gain support from the insurance market. Also enhanced is CLP's attractiveness as a commercial partner for private sector and government joint ventures.\n\n## Pursuing growth opportunities in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area\n\nElectricity demand is expected to increase as specific market segments electrify, presenting opportunities for CLP to access new markets, establish partnerships in high-growth\n\n- segments and diversify earnings streams. We operate in different geographies, allowing us to attract capital, technology and talent globally. The energy transition presents new opportunities to CLP through customer-facing solutions and expansion into high-growth market segments by providing different energy services, such as district cooling.\n\n## Building an agile and innovative workforce\n\nFostering an agile, innovative and safe work environment increases the quality and productivity of CLP's workforce. Enhancing physical and digital skills within the business is necessary to capture growth opportunities in China and supports the uptake of new business models. Gender and ethnic diversity also increase the likelihood of financial outperformance.\n\n## Reinforcing resilience in a changing operating environment\n\nBusiness resilience is an important component of sustainable value creation and helps protect CLP's assets and cash flows. Negative risks associated with damage to physical assets and operations caused by global warming and cybercrime require careful management. As countries begin to plan for a post-pandemic future, we have a role to play in rejuvenating the economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the Capitals chapter on page 64, discussion will focus on how we utilise our various capitals to address these four financially material topics that impact on enterprise value.

As stated in our updated Climate Vision 2050, we are accelerating our plans to phase out coal-based assets by 2040, a decade earlier than previously pledged, while investing in other streams of business, including power transmission, distribution and retail, renewable and other non-carbon emitting energy, as well as energy and infrastructure services. At the same time, we have maintained our focus in ensuring a reliable and affordable supply of energy in the region, creating longterm value for our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress on the Execution of Our Strategy\n\nIn 2021, CLP's transition to low-carbon energy focused on investments to decarbonise the electricity supply in Hong Kong. Construction of the second CCGT and the offshore LNG terminal progressed well. In addition, more than 1.2 million smart meters have been installed and 265MW of capacity has been approved or connected to the grid under the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff scheme by the end of 2021.\n\nIn Australia, we also progressed on our decarbonisation journey with earlier closure of Yallourn in 2028 and the earlier exit of Mount Piper in 2040. Additionally, we approved and commenced the preparation works of Australia's first net zero emissions power plant, Tallawarra B. In Mainland China, we completed the construction of Qian'an III Wind Farm, CLP's first grid-parity project, and in India, we acquired our second transmission project in late December and progressed the construction of Sidhpur Wind Farm, amid restrictions posed by COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adequate Resources to Support Our Strategy\n\nFree cash flow represents the cash that can be used by a company after taking care of its operations. It can be used to remunerate equity and debt holders and to grow the business.\n\nWhile a dependable operating inflow from the SoC business remained the key source of funds for our capital investment programme and dividend in 2021, our free cash flow outside Hong Kong was adversely impacted by challenging market conditions. Sustainable financing for our decarbonisation projects, such as the second CCGT and installation of smart meters, have been arranged under the Climate Action Finance Framework and through emission-reduction linked bank facilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Where We Stand\n\n- Grow our business sustainably with capital investments in cleaner power and energy infrastructure\n- Development of new business initiatives in the Greater Bay Area including the joint design and development of Hong Kong's largest battery energy storage system and operation of a centralised cooling system at a shopping centre in Guangzhou\n- Expansion of our non-carbon emitting generation portfolio, now accounting for one quarter of our generation (including long-term capacity and energy purchase arrangements) with earnings increased to HK$2,417 million\n- Solid investment grade credit ratings maintained and emission-reduction linked facilities arranged for the first time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Earnings and Dividends\n\nCLP's Dividends Policy aims to provide reliable and consistent ordinary dividends with steady growth when supported by our earnings whilst ensuring that a solid financial position can be maintained to fund our business growth.\n\nThe Group's financial performance and ultimately, the Group's operating earnings are of paramount importance in CLP's ability to adhere to the Group's Dividends Policy. Despite earnings reduction in 2021, dividend was maintained at the same level backed by a solid financial position and adequate financial resources.\n\nMore analysis on the value we created for our shareholders can be found on pages 36 and 37.",

Costs in respect of examination of the extent of the damage along with potential rectification options were recognised in 2021 (Note 5(e) to the Financial Statements)\n- India: Due to the change in the long-term outlook for coal generation in India, an impairment assessment of Jhajjar Power Station has been performed and a write down was recognised in 2021\n- Southeast Asia and Taiwan: Remaining consideration received from the sale of our entire interest in a Vietnam project upon its financial close in 2021\n- Southeast Asia and Taiwan: Substantial decrease in Ho-Ping's results due to higher coal prices, particularly in the second half of the year, and lower energy tariff (reflecting the lagging effect of prior year's lower coal prices); Lopburi solar farm operated steadily with stable solar resource\n\n## Fair Value Adjustments (2021: Loss of HK$497 million; 2020: Gain of HK$460 million)\n\n- Mostly related to the fair value changes of energy derivative contracts (e.g. swaps and options) used to hedge the volatility of energy prices in Australia which do not qualify for hedge accounting\n- Higher forward electricity prices in 2021 resulted in unfavourable fair value adjustments on sold energy derivative contracts, compared to the favourable impact of falling forward prices in 2020",

However, the spread of new variants across the globe and lingering international travel restrictions have made the timeline for full recovery uncertain, with some sectors particularly badly hit. Meanwhile, volatile international fuel prices and supply chain issues led to surging electricity tariffs and even the collapse of some overseas energy companies. Against this challenging backdrop, CLP took decisive and timely steps to ensure the impact of international fuel market volatility could be minimised while its customers continued to receive a stable, safe electricity supply with a world-class 99.999% reliability rate.\n\nElectricity sales in Hong Kong rose 4.1% to 35,355 gigawatt hours (GWh) as easing social restrictions and increased consumer spending spurred economic activity, lifting demand in all sectors. The infrastructure, public services and commercial sectors saw the biggest increases in demand as schools, social activities and government services gradually resumed normal after disruptions caused by the pandemic since 2020. Restaurants, shops and hotels saw increased activity from a low base at the beginning of 2021 as the COVID-19 situation eased. Record temperatures in March, May and September also contributed to higher electricity sales.\n\nIn 2021, the number of customer accounts rose to 2.71 million, compared with 2.67 million in 2020.\n\nOperating earnings of Hong Kong electricity business increased 4.7% to HK$8,189 million from a year earlier on the back of higher investment. The performance of the business is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To ease the financial burden on customers, a total of around HK$2.5 billion was drawn from the Tariff Stabilisation Fund, the Fuel Clause Recovery Account and the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund, combined with a Rent and Rates Special Rebate. These measures resulted in a freeze in the Basic Tariff, while the deployment of two special rebates reduced the increase in the Average Net Tariff from 10.5 HK cents (8.6%), to 7.1 HK cents (5.8%). CLP also announced a HK$220 million package of community support programmes for 2022 to encourage energy saving, help people in need and accelerate Hong Kong's economic recovery.\n\n## Laying Foundations for Growth\n\ninvestment aimed at ensuring the demand could be met with high levels of safety and reliability, while moving Hong Kong towards a lower-carbon, smart city consistent with the Government's policy objectives.\n\nAs part of its ongoing review of CLP's capital expenditure programmes, the Government approved additional projects to meet evolving electricity demand requirements from customers. This will raise the total capital expenditure for the 2018 Development Plan, covering the period of October 2018 to the end of 2023 from HK$52.9 billion to HK$56.1 billion.\n\nThe Government also announced a number of long-term large-scale infrastructure projects, including the Northern Metropolis Development Strategy and the Lantau Tomorrow Vision, which are expected to create additional growth momentum. CLP will provide the energy infrastructure needed to support these developments as they take shape.\n\nCLP continued to benefit from increased demand created by new projects such as data centres and government infrastructure projects. To meet new growth, CLP expanded\n\nCLP has teamed up with the Airport Authority Hong Kong to design and develop the city's largest battery energy storage system combined with a predictive control system for air conditioning.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Cultivating a Greener Future\n\nAt home and overseas, 2021 saw landmark moments in the battle against climate change. Internationally, the 26 th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) was attended by thousands of world leaders, policymakers, business executives, negotiators, scientists and activists. In Hong Kong, the Government published its Climate Action Plan 2050, setting out a clear roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nCLP gave its wholehearted support to Hong Kong's longterm decarbonisation strategy, following the Group's earlier announcement of the updated Climate Vision 2050 with targets to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the energy value chain by 2050 and phase out coal in all operations by 2040. CLP will work closely with the Hong Kong Government and its customers to find the best ways to introduce new zero-carbon energy sources, reduce the carbon intensity of the power supply and speed up electrification to reduce carbon emissions from transport and other sectors.\n\nIn October, CLP held an official launch ceremony for D1, a combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) unit at Black Point Power Station using new generation technology. Unit D1 has been in operation since mid-2020 and lifted the ratio of natural gas in CLP's fuel mix from below 30% in 2019 to around 50% in 2020. D2, a second CCGT unit on an adjacent site due to go into service in 2023, will further add to CLP's gas generation capacity. Construction of unit D2 progressed on schedule in 2021, with CLP deploying mitigation strategies to minimise pandemic-related supply chain disruptions.\n\nCLP meanwhile moved forward with the construction of an offshore LNG terminal in the south-western waters of Hong Kong, which will allow for increased reliability, diversity and competitiveness of our gas supply arrangements. Considerable progress was made with the jacket structures on the jetty site, and subsea pipelaying works were completed. The LNG terminal is expected to go into service in 2022.\n\nCoal-fired generation facilities will be retired in stages as the use of natural gas increases. CLP plans to gradually phase out units at Castle Peak A Power Station in the coming years as it reaches the end of its commercial life. It will stop using coal for day-to-day electricity generation at Castle Peak B Power Station by 2035.\n\nAt the same time, CLP is promoting the development of renewable energy. Pre-development studies continued into the feasibility of an offshore wind farm in the south-eastern waters of Hong Kong. Early findings indicate improvements in turbine technology and costs will make offshore wind farms an increasingly viable option in the medium term.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 265MW of capacity had been approved or connected to the grid under the Renewable Energy Feedin Tariff scheme, up from 175MW a year earlier. Renewable Energy Certificates received an increasingly positive response with sales growing 185% as more customers committed to larger and longer-term purchases. The biggest buyer, Hang Seng Bank, committed to purchase nearly 154GWh of renewable energy over a 10-year period from 2021, equivalent to a reduction of over 60,000 tonnes of carbon emissions from electricity use.\n\nCLP's waste-to-energy generation station at the West New Territories (WENT) landfill site - Hong Kong's biggest facility using landfill gas for electricity generation which began operations in 2020 - provided 38GWh of clean energy to the grid. Construction meanwhile progressed on Hong Kong's first integrated waste management facility, which will burn municipal waste to produce energy. The facility on an offshore island will be connected to CLP's grid by a subsea cable.\n\nCLP continued to work with the Government to explore ways to enhance regional cooperation on zero-carbon energy and to identify sources of carbon-free energy from neighbouring regions, including joint investment and development opportunities as well as zero-carbon energy projects near Hong Kong. The company will continue to explore emerging technologies and is looking at opportunities to convert its gas generation infrastructure to support the use of green fuels such as zero-carbon hydrogen. Towards this end, the CLP Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with GE, a multinational company, to jointly develop a decarbonisation roadmap for CLP's gas-fired generation facilities at Black Point Power Station and to explore new technologies for the use of low-carbon fuels such as hydrogen.",

CLP promotes energy efficiency to reduce overall electricity demand and is rolling out smart meters across its supply area to allow customers to better manage their electricity use. Smart meters give customers access to detailed consumption data and allow them to participate in demand response programmes. Despite a shortfall in the supply of new meters resulting from a global chip shortage, CLP had connected more than 1.2 million smart meters by the end of 2021. Its goal of replacing conventional electricity meters with smart meters for all customers by 2025 remains on track.\n\nAn illustration of the benefits of energy saving by customers came on 27 July when electricity demand reached a new peak of 7,477MW. CLP managed its system load by incentivising more than 30,000 of its commercial, industrial and residential customers to take part in a demand response programme and reduce their energy use in the most critical hours. Without the demand response programme, peak power demand would have been over 70MW higher.\n\nOther smart solutions were deployed to help larger businesses become more energy efficient. CLP teamed up with the Airport Authority Hong Kong to jointly design and develop the city's largest battery energy storage system (BESS) combined with a predictive control system for air conditioning in one of the airport's terminals. With a maximum power output of 4MW, the BESS serves as an emergency back-up power supply system, storing electricity produced by the existing generators during routine testing. The BESS operates without fuel and is more environmentally friendly than existing back-up generators.\n\nThe predictive control system, meanwhile, uses big data analytics tools to anticipate the cooling needs of the terminal building 24 hours in advance, then automatically adjusts the air conditioning system to provide the right amount of cooling and eliminate unnecessary energy consumption. The system, co-developed by CLP, the Airport Authority Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Observatory, was named Energy Project of the Year for the Asia-Pacific Rim region by the US-based Association of Energy Engineers.\n\nCLP launched an Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme in 2018 to provide subsidies for commercial and industrial customers to replace or upgrade lighting systems, air conditioners and other electrical equipment with more energy-efficient models. Increased awareness of the programme led to a rise of applications and a total energy saving of 33GWh in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, a new CLP website was successfully launched in October, upgrading the website from legacy technology to a modern, secure, and scalable cloud-based platform that offers better browsing experience and a new level of digital customer service. Customers are empowered to carry out more self-service in a shorter time thanks to a new help and support centre, personalised content based on their online behaviour, friendly chatbot assistance and a faster loading website. Responses have been positive with increases recorded in new visitors, unique sessions and time spent browsing pages. Feedback on web content and potential improvements will be constantly monitored to keep pace with customer expectations.\n\nCLP continued to support the use of electric vehicles in Hong Kong by providing free charging facilities. In 2020, the company launched a programme called Eco Charge 2.0 to provide one-stop technical and customer support to owners and managers of private residential buildings interested in applying for government funding to install charging infrastructure in car parks. By the end of 2021, CLP had completed preliminary assessments for around 94% of the 451 applications received so far, covering proposals for around 119,000 parking bays.\n\n## Outlook\n\nPower generation currently accounts for about two-thirds of Hong Kong's carbon emissions. As the city's largest electricity supplier, CLP has a key role to play in supporting Hong Kong's journey to a carbon-free future. CLP will continue to focus on the construction and realisation of a number of major decarbonisation infrastructure projects, including the offshore LNG Terminal, the D2 unit at Black Point Power Station, the enhancement of the Clean Energy Transmission System connecting the CLP grid to Guangdong and the possibility of an offshore wind farm.\n\nThe commissioning of the offshore LNG Terminal planned for 2022 will mark a significant step forward in the procurement of natural gas, and CLP is determined to work towards the project's successful completion and smooth operation. The company will also explore opportunities in zero-carbon hydrogen and other technologies to further reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation.\n\nAs it takes the next steps on the journey to net zero, CLP will continue to encourage customers and the community to be more energy efficient and accelerate the installation of smart meters. CLP is also committed to exploring new technologies to further enhance its digital capabilities, operational reliability and customer service, while promoting energy education and caring for people in need through a broadening range of community initiatives.",

With environmental sustainability being increasingly crucial, how can CLP help us decarbonise and become more climatefriendly? And how can CLP ensure a reliable power supply to support our 24/7 mission-critical operations?\n\nA sufficient and reliable power supply is essential for uninterrupted data centre operations. To help reduce carbon footprint, CLP has a key role to play from the power supply side. Currently, over 80% of the electricity we provide in Hong Kong comes from low- or zero-carbon fuel sources, including natural gas and nuclear energy. And we have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Hong Kong Government's decarbonisation target. Unit D1 at Black Point Power Station, commissioned in 2020, helps cut 1 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually already. With the commissioning of unit D2 at Black Point in 2023 and our plans to use more renewable energy, we will continue to improve our emissions performance.\n\nIf our data centre customers like SUNeVision want to accelerate decarbonisation, we also have a range of solutions. You could make use of our Renewable Energy Certificates programme to support clean energy generation in a simple and flexible way. CLP works with innovators from around the globe to bring in the best technologies that assist you to conduct building asset health monitoring, optimise energy usage, automate system operations and enhance building management - many of which through artificial intelligence software platforms powered by big data analytics. In addition, we launched the Retro-commissioning (RCx) Charter Programme in 2021 to encourage customers to optimise your buildings' operational performance without the need to replace equipment. Eligible customers can apply for subsidies from the CLP Eco Building Fund to carry out retro-commissioning works at their properties. As of the end of 2021, we have received 130 applications from businesses and organisations from various sectors and have trained 270 of their representatives to help them design suitable RCx solutions for their properties. For data centres, our solutions include intelligent air flow control to optimise cooling efficiency and equipment settings modification to improve energy efficiency.\n\nData centres are a vital 24/7 business, and it is down to us to provide a secure, reliable power supply as we continue to decarbonise. To do that, we are committed to continued investments to make our services more robust and resilient, including strategies to mitigate the potential impact of extreme weather events as they become more frequent and severe.",

        "page_content": "## Mainland China\n\n## Overview\n\nChina's economy rebounded strongly in 2021 from the early impact of the pandemic, growing 8.1% year on year and driving a 10.3% increase in electricity consumption to meet rising industrial demand, albeit from a low base. However, higher fuel prices put heavy pressure on the margins of CLP's coal operations. Although the performance of the company's non-carbon portfolio was satisfactory, operating earnings in Mainland China decreased 25.7% to HK$1,660 million because of a loss in the thermal energy segment.\n\nThe performance of the business is summarised below:\n\n| Operating Earnings                    | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   | Change %   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Nuclear Energy                        | 1,908       | 1,594       | 19.7       |\n| Renewable Energy                      | 545         | 565         | (3.5)      |\n| Thermal Energy                        | (572)       | 203         | N/A        |\n| Operating and Development Expenditure | (221)       | (129)       | 71.3       |\n| Total                                 | 1,660       | 2,233       | (25.7)     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020 Operating Earnings\n\nNuclear: Higher sent-out\n\nRenewables: Lower hydro and loss on divestment of two minority-owned wind projects, partially offset by higher solar and contribution from Laiwu III Wind Farm\n\nThermal: Higher coal costs partly compensated by higher tariff effective last quarter of 2021\n\nOthers: Mainly lower Renminbi appreciation\n\n2021 Operating Earnings\n\n## Nuclear Energy Brings Stable Contributions\n\nNuclear power is a clean energy source that plays a key role in reducing carbon emissions, and its contribution accounted for the bulk of CLP's operating earnings in Mainland China in 2021. Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station reported record generation as users switched to nuclear energy for electricity at a stable cost in times of volatile fuel prices.\n\nThe output from Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station remained stable and utilisation was high. The operation of both nuclear plants in Guangdong province remained safe.\n\n## Green Energy Gathers Momentum\n\nCLP's renewable energy projects in Mainland China saw stable operations and benefited from the addition of a new wind project. The Laiwu III wind farm in Shandong province, which began commercial operations in September 2020, ran smoothly and provided impetus for additional earnings. The performance of solar projects was sound due to good resources, particularly in Yunnan and Jiangsu provinces.\n\nHydro projects suffered from decreased water flow, however, and their reduced contributions - combined with CLP's decision to withdraw from two ageing minority-owned wind projects in Liaoning province - contributed to a slight decline in operating earnings from renewable energy projects.\n\nCLP continued to expand its renewable energy portfolio in support of China's decarbonisation strategy. In a milestone for the company, Qian'an III wind farm in Jilin province (100MW) was connected to the grid five months ahead of schedule in December, despite COVID-19 restrictions, torrential rainfall and record-breaking snowfall. The threephase project, with a combined capacity of 199MW, is the biggest wind farm in the company's Mainland China portfolio and the first CLP project of its kind equipped with a battery energy storage system. Qian'an III is also the company's first grid-parity renewable energy project in the country which does not rely on national subsidy payments. In addition, CLP committed to invest in two more grid-parity wind farms - the 50MW Xundian II farm in Yunnan province and the 150MW",

Construction is expected to begin in 2022.\n\nBy the end of 2021, delayed national subsidy payments for CLP's renewable energy projects amounted to HK$2,302 million, compared with HK$1,774 million at the end of 2020. CLP has been receiving continuous settlements over the years.\n\n## Coal Costs Weigh Heavily on Thermal Projects\n\nCoal-fired projects in Mainland China had a challenging 2021 with volatile coal costs - which hit a record high during the year - resulting in both majority-owned and minority-owned projects reporting a loss for the year.\n\nFangchenggang Power Station in Guangxi recorded stable operations, although output was lower than in 2020 because of limited coal supplies. The power station completed the retrofitting of two units to allow it to provide steam to industry users nearby as it transforms itself into an integrated energy provider. When a pipeline to the plant is completed, the power station will be able to sell steam as well as electricity.\n\nMainland China launched the world's largest carbon market in July to contribute to its decarbonisation objectives. All coalfired projects are required to participate, and are assigned specific allowances based on the types and capacities of their\n\ngeneration units. Fangchenggang Power Station conducted a number of transactions in the market to familiarise itself with the process, ensure it has a robust internal process in place and equip employees with the necessary knowledge. While the power station has a slight surplus allowance because of its advanced technology, it is studying ways to raise efficiency levels as the Government is likely to continue to tighten emission control measures.\n\n## Greater Bay Area Opportunities\n\nCLP has set out a strategy to establish a greater presence and pursue opportunities in the Greater Bay Area (GBA). In line with that strategy, CLP signed a contract to invest in and operate a centralised cooling system at Po Park Shopping Plaza in central Guangzhou until 2036. CLP took over the operation of the chilling plant at the 20-year-old complex in November and began modernising it, with retrofitting work expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022. The project offers a steady income stream and represents the first step into a field with high business potential.\n\nCLP's investment to provide electricity supply services to customers in the Fangchenggang Hi-Tech Zone, which began operations in January 2020, meanwhile continued to attract new users.\n\nCLP's renewable energy portfolio in Mainland China saw stable operations in 2021 as good resources contributed to sound performance of solar projects.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the coming years, CLP will focus on expanding its renewable energy portfolio by adding more grid-parity wind and solar projects, including the Xundian II and Bobai wind farms.\n\nTo help meet China's climate targets, the use of CLP's nuclear energy projects is likely to remain at a very high level. However, Yangjiang Nuclear Power Station will be exposed to higher market risk as the plant is going to offer more of its output through market sales.\n\nCoal supply shortages combined with strong industrial demand resulted in a severe power crunch in China in 2021. CLP is working closely with the Guangxi Government to support the community and meet demand for electricity. Fangchenggang Power Station will endeavour to maintain stable operations to fulfil its sales commitments, and utilise its jetty to import coal and lower fuel costs. As coal prices\n\nMr Ronnie Kong CLP Shareholder\n\nstabilise in 2022, the performance of CLP's coal portfolio in Mainland China is expected to improve. However, to meet CLP's own target to phase out all coal-fired assets by 2040, CLP will start planning ahead for the next step for Fangchenggang Power Station and other minority-owned coal projects.\n\nIn the GBA, CLP will explore investment opportunities in two main business models - Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS), and energy infrastructure. The recent investment in Po Park Shopping Plaza highlights a growing potential for centralised cooling systems. Other EaaS solutions under consideration include charging facilities for electric vehicles and energy management systems. CLP is also looking to invest in energy infrastructure projects for industrial parks and commercial sites, including district and multi-building cooling systems as well as data centres. These efforts will be supported by CLP's investment in the CSG Energy Innovation Equity Investment Fund set up by China Southern Power Grid in 2020 which is expected to bring new smart energy and innovation-related opportunities.\n\nSH Chan Managing Director - China\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow can CLP develop stronger partnerships in China and the Greater Bay Area in particular to bring more returns to shareholders in the long-term?\n\nCLP entered the Mainland Chinese market in 1979, and our success has been built on the many partnerships we have forged over the years to meet the country's growing energy needs. One of our earliest projects back in the 1980s was our collaboration with China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) to develop Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in Guangdong province, which continues to contribute strongly to our non-carbon portfolio.\n\nThe Chinese Government has committed to reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, and we will continue to work closely with our partners to support the country's decarbonisation efforts and focus on innovative ways to meet energy needs.\n\nWe will seek to deepen our partnerships with leading energy companies, including CGN and China Southern Power Grid (CSG). Meanwhile, we are investing in the CSG Energy Innovation Equity Investment Fund and forming new partnerships such as TUS-CLP Smart Energy Technology Co. Ltd. - a joint venture with an affiliate of Tsinghua University - to make full use of the latest energy technologies and develop new products, services, and business models to capture growing demand for smart, sustainable energy solutions.\n\nOur recent investment in a centralised cooling project for Po Park Shopping Plaza in Guangzhou is typical of the new opportunities available to us. We are also keen to be more active in market segments such as electric transport, data centres and energy management, particularly in the Greater Bay Area.",

Despite the pandemic, the company remained focused on developing a portfolio of new projects to provide clean, flexible generation in support of the country's energy transition.\n\nThe Customer business improved as levels of bad and doubtful debts related to COVID-19 fell. However, earnings in the Energy business were adversely affected by reduced wholesale electricity prices, accelerated depreciation costs resulting from the advanced retirement plans for Yallourn Power Station, and the replacement of expiring gas purchasing arrangements at higher prices. In addition, roughly one third of the decline in EnergyAustralia's earnings was related to non-cash changes in the fair value of energy hedging contracts. As a result, EnergyAustralia reported an operating loss of HK$83 million in 2021.\n\nEnergyAustralia's underlying operating performance in 2021 is summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting and Retaining Customers\n\nEnergyAustralia continued to provide extensive support for customers struggling with the financial pressures of the pandemic. More than 50,000 new payment plans were set up and more than 200,000 payment extensions arranged for residential customers and small businesses under the 'EnergyAssist' and 'Rapid Business Assist' programmes.\n\nThe company continued to record improvements on Net Promoter Score as an increased proportion of its retail customers said they were willing to recommend EnergyAustralia to others. Although overall market churn increased year on year, EnergyAustralia improved its customer churn performance, widening the gap between its own churn rate and the rest of the market to a favourable 2.6%. EnergyAustralia's focus on continuous improvement in customer service led to a record low number of customer complaints, contributing to the overall improved performance. However, total customer accounts fell marginally to 2.44 million in the face of ongoing and intense competition.\n\n## Ensuring High Reliability\n\nMajor planned maintenance works were carried out at Yallourn Power Station in Victoria between September and December, ahead of the summer peak demand period, to help ensure supply reliability. The critical and complex works were significantly adjusted to ensure the health and safety of the workforce and community in view of the COVID-19 situation.\n\nEarlier in the year, exceptionally heavy rainfall resulted in heightened water flows through the Morwell River Diversion which runs through the mine at Yallourn. The plant was run at restricted capacity for around two weeks as the nearterm impact on the Morwell River Diversion was assessed. A comprehensive damage assessment was launched to determine what long-term repairs are required at a cost of A$78 million (HK$452 million). Water diversions were constructed to enable inspection and repairs of the Morwell River Diversion structure over the 2021/22 summer. Despite the disruption, the power station's output was only 4.9% lower than in the previous year.",

        "page_content": "The Victorian Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) informed EnergyAustralia in February 2022 that it considered a dust complaint against the Yallourn mine in October 2021 to be a licence non-compliance. EnergyAustralia is of the view that it has met relevant obligations as the incident took place on an extremely windy and dry day while all of its operational control measures were in use at the time to minimise fugitive dust emissions. EnergyAustralia is currently liaising with the EPA for a review of the case.\n\nMajor planned works at Mount Piper Power Station in New South Wales were deferred to 2022 to ensure the safety of employees, contractors and the community from the escalating COVID-19 situation in the state at the time. Output from the power station increased year on year and works were undertaken to ensure sufficient coal supply to enable uninterrupted running in 2022 and beyond. During the year there were two environmental licence limit exceedances at the plant, relating to total particulates emissions and surface water turbidity respectively. The EPA was notified, and corrective actions have been taken to prevent a repeat of these incidents. There were also two licence non-compliances. One was related to the loss of environmental data associated\n\nwith continuous air emissions monitoring for five days following an equipment malfunction. The other case was related to a localised damage to the liner of a brine pond. The damage was detected in an adjacent monitoring bore that is used to ensure integrity of the pond liner. Given the liner is a core element to prevent water pollution, the EPA was notified as a precautionary approach and there has been no further action.\n\nEnergyAustralia's gas-fired power facilities in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia operated with a high degree of reliability, supporting the company's generation portfolio through a period of fluctuating market conditions. The company has dispatch rights to two grid-scale batteries which helped ensure stability in the National Electricity Market during periods of high volatility.\n\nForward wholesale electricity prices in Victoria and South Australia remain well below historic levels primarily because of increases in renewable energy generation. In Queensland and New South Wales, prices have recently returned to historic levels, reflecting the higher fuel costs and transmission constraints to deliver excess energy from the south.\n\nThe table below shows the performance of EnergyAustralia's renewable energy and thermal energy generation assets:\n\n|                 | Installed Capacity   Equity MW   | Electricity Sent Out Equity GWh   | Electricity Sent Out Equity GWh   | Availability   %   | Availability   %   | Utilisation   %   | Utilisation   %   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                 |                                  | 2021                              | 2020                              | 2021               | 2020               | 2021              | 2020              |\n| Wind            |                                  |                                   |                                   |                    |                    |                   |                   |\n| Cathedral Rocks | 32                               | 64                                | 73                                | 98.8               | 79.3               | 23.5              | 26.7              |\n| Gas             | 1,595                            | 1,035                             | 1,268                             | 81.8               | 91.1               | 7.7               | 9.4               |\n| Newport         | 500                              | 256                               | 310                               | 75.2               | 93.1               | 6.3               | 7.8               |\n| Jeeralang       | 440                              | 99                                | 75                                | 89.7               | 90.7               | 2.6               | 2.0               |\n| Hallett  1      | 235                              | 45                                | 27                                | 76.0               | 85.8               | 2.2               | 1.4               |\n| Tallawarra      | 420                              | 636                               | 856                               | 84.8               | 92.1               | 17.7              | 23.7              |\n| Coal            | 2,910                            | 14,705                            | 14,725                            | 80.7               | 71.7               | 62.6              | 63.2              |\n| Mount Piper  2  | 1,430                            | 6,737                             | 6,346                             | 87.8               | 71.4               | 57.4              | 55.2              |\n| Yallourn        | 1,480                            | 7,969                             | 8,378                             | 73.8               | 72.0               | 67.7              | 70.8              |\n\nAny minor discrepancies in totals are due to rounding of figures.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 The plant's capacity increased by 32MW in early 2020 following successful commissioning of a new additional gas turbine.\n- 2 The plant's capacity increased by 30MW in Jan 2021 following successful upgrade works.",

The retirement of the power station will reduce EnergyAustralia's direct carbon dioxide emissions by about 60% compared with current levels. To help ensure stability of energy supply in the state and allow for the use of more renewable energy, EnergyAustralia is developing the Wooreen Energy Storage System, which will be the first four-hour utility-scale battery with a 350MW capacity - larger than any battery system operating in Australia today. The Wooreen system is scheduled to go into operation by the end of 2026, ahead of the closure of Yallourn Power Station.\n\nThe transition to low-carbon energy inevitably affects lives and has a profound impact on power station employees and communities. EnergyAustralia is committed to providing support for employees and communities throughout the transition. EnergyAustralia will provide a comprehensive package of transitional services at Yallourn including training and skills development, career planning, assistance for redeployment and financial counselling.\n\nEnergyAustralia began preparation works on Tallawarra B, a power plant designed to be net-zero by offsetting its\n\ndirect carbon emissions over its operational life, and to use a blend of green hydrogen and natural gas. With a generation capacity of more than 300MW, Tallawarra B is scheduled to enter service in time for the 2023/24 Australian summer, helping provide reliable, affordable and cleaner electricity as coal-fired generation is phased out.\n\nIn Queensland, construction began on a 250MW pumped hydro energy storage project on the site of a disused gold mine in Kidston. EnergyAustralia is underpinning the project through a long-term energy dispatch agreement with the developer. The plant is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nEnergyAustralia continued to assess potential investments in flexible generation and storage projects to accelerate the integration of solar and wind power into the National Electricity Market. One such opportunity is a potential pumped hydro energy storage facility at Lake Lyell, which currently supplies water to Mount Piper Power Station. Early estimates suggest the facility would be capable of producing 350MW of electricity with around eight hours of storage.\n\nIn addition, EnergyAustralia has in place power purchase agreements representing a total of more than 870MW of large-scale wind and solar projects in the National Electricity Market. The performance of renewable energy projects for which EnergyAustralia is an offtaker is set out in the table below:\n\n|              | Offtake for  EnergyAustralia  MW   | Electricity   Sent Out GWh   | Electricity   Sent Out GWh   |    |\n|--------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----|\n|              |                                    | 2021                         | 2020                         |    |\n| Wind         |                                    |                              |                              |    |\n| Boco Rock    | 113                                | 335  1                       | 379  1                       |    |\n| Bodangora    | 68                                 | 201  1                       | 212  1                       |    |\n| Gullen Range | 165.5                              | 480  1                       | 463  1                       |    |\n| Mortons Lane | 19.5                               | 62  1                        | 63  1                        |    |\n| Taralga      | 107                                | 292  1                       | 284  1                       |    |\n| Waterloo  2  | 111                                | 281                          | 158  3                       |    |\n| Solar        |                                    |                              |                              |    |\n| Coleambally  | 105                                | 218                          | 219                          |    |\n| Gannawarra   | 50                                 | 107                          | 87                           |    |\n| Manildra     | 46                                 | 69                           | 96                           |    |\n| Ross River   | 93                                 | 208                          | 223                          |    |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Publicly available data from the Australian Energy Market Operator.\n- 2 EnergyAustralia has been taking 100% output from the plant since Nov 2020.\n- 3 Reinstated to denote increase in offtake.",

Energy not consumed within each home is stored at a centralised battery and controlled by an intelligent microgrid platform that manages energy flow across the estate. Any energy generated within the microgrid but not consumed is fed back into the national grid.\n\nEnergyAustralia launched a new product through its 'On by EnergyAustralia' platform in September called 'Stack On' a bundled offer that allows customers to pick, mix, and save by choosing from electricity, broadband internet, mobile data, mobile voice and data, and car and home insurance products. The products are all available through one online self-service portal and the more products customers choose, the more they can save.\n\n'On by EnergyAustralia' is also offering eligible homeowners in New South Wales a new integrated solar-plus battery system with no upfront costs called 'Solar Home Bundle'. This follows a successful trial of the new proposition in 2020. EnergyAustralia uses smart software to balance customers' electricity supply from the grid, solar and battery. The battery setup will form part of EnergyAustralia's Virtual Power Plant - a network of batteries helping to support the grid and meet customer energy needs.\n\nEnergyAustralia's 'Go Neutral' remains the leading carbon offsetting programme offered by any energy retailer or generator in Australia and one of the largest certified carbon offset products in the country. About 134,000 residential and small business customers were added to 'Go Neutral' in 2021, taking the total to 444,000 since the programme started in 2016. Building on this success, 'Business Carbon Neutral' was launched in September 2021, offering the opportunity for commercial customers to offset their carbon emissions.\n\nEnergyAustralia's partnership with the Startupbootcamp programme which fast-tracks new energy-related start-up businesses, continued into its fourth year and its second year online. A total of nine start-ups chosen from an initial pool of 82 shortlisted applicants pitched their concepts from home in a live-streamed demo day in December. EnergyAustralia has been in further discussions with three of those candidates to explore collaboration opportunities.\n\n## Ensuring a Safe Working Environment\n\nWorkSafe Victoria, the Victorian health and safety regulator, in December charged EnergyAustralia with three breaches of the Occupational Health and Safety Act in relation to a fatal incident in 2018.\n\nGraeme Edwards's loss is deeply felt by his friends at Yallourn and by everyone who knew him.\n\nEnergyAustralia offers eligible homeowners a smart solar and battery system with no upfront costs, making access to solar and batteries easy and affordable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Intense retail competition, meanwhile, is likely to continue from both existing participants and new market entrants, maintaining pressure on margins.\n\nOn the energy policy front, policymakers in Australia have continued to recognise the need for greater levels of investment in low-carbon, reliable power generation.\n\nThe Energy Security Board released a study in April proposing four reform pathways to address Australia's energy transition needs beyond 2025. The document, to which EnergyAustralia contributed, is part of a broad\n\nMs Gayle McAllister Operations Leader, Yallourn Power Station\n\nproposal advocating the timely entry of new generation capacity and steps to ensure existing facilities remain until they are no longer required to support system stability. The Federal Budget in May also included initiatives to support investment in new and emerging low-emission technologies prioritised under the Government's Technology Investment Roadmap.\n\nEnergyAustralia will continue to invest in the energy transition. Deployment of customer solutions like the Solar Home Bundle will provide customers with the opportunity to see the transition come to life in their home. EnergyAustralia's large projects including the Tallawarra B power plant, Wooreen Energy Storage System and the Kidston pumped hydro energy storage facility will support the broader grid. The company will also continue to assess the potential of the Lake Lyell pumped hydro energy storage facility, and carefully manage the retirement of Yallourn Power Station.\n\nIn addition, EnergyAustralia is exploring potential synergies from working with the CLP Group on technologies including hydrogen, microgrids, batteries and energy storage, further strengthening its capability to help build a cleaner energy future for Australia underpinned by renewable energy.\n\nMark Collette Managing Director, EnergyAustralia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI understand Yallourn Power Station will be retired in mid-2028. What support will EnergyAustralia give to the power station's employees and the community of the Latrobe Valley?\n\nWhile it is still six years away, it is important to recognise that the retirement of Yallourn will mean different things to different people, and we will work to ensure our approach is a respectful and collaborative one that addresses individual needs.\n\nFor our people, we will be supporting them through a multi-million dollar package, which will include training and skills development, career planning, assistance for redeployment and financial counselling. Our trainee and apprenticeship programmes will also continue through to the power station's retirement, and we will maintain our focus on the safety, health and wellbeing of our people.\n\nFor the wider community, we will ensure our approach over the next six years delivers on the high standards the community expects of us. We will hold forums and smaller face-to-face sessions so that people within the community and interest groups are clear about our plans, and so that we can manage the impact of the closure sensitively. In addition, we will continue to invest in the Latrobe Valley with the construction and ongoing operation of a utility-scale battery storage facility alongside Jeeralang Power Station.",

With increased precautions and comprehensive protection for employees, CLP's rebranded business in India, Apraava Energy, was able to maintain stable operations, although the construction and approval of new projects were affected by strict lockdown measures.\n\nThe economy rebounded sharply in the final quarter as the pandemic situation stabilised. However, the resumption of economic activities - combined with coal production and dispatch issues resulting from heavy monsoon rainfall - led to a severe power crunch and rolling blackouts in some areas.\n\nAs one of India's top 10 private power producers, Apraava Energy worked hard to ensure it could meet surging demand, although its performance was limited by coal shortages. The earnings of Jhajjar Power Station were affected by lower capacity tariff, the level of which was reduced by about 10% from April 2020 under its long-term power purchase agreements. However, thanks to better efficiency at Jhajjar and a higher level of output from renewable projects, CLP's operating earnings in India increased 26.3% to HK$221 million. The performance of the business is summarised below:\n\n| Operating Earnings  1   |   2021 HK$M |   2020 HK$M | Change %   |\n|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Renewable Energy        |         186 |         104 | 78.8       |\n| Thermal Energy          |          28 |          66 | (57.6)     |\n| Transmission            |           7 |           5 | 40.0       |\n| Total                   |         221 |         175 | 26.3       |\n\nNote:\n\n- 1 Net of the 40% share held by Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Wind and Solar Projects Flourish\n\nOutput from Apraava Energy's renewable energy portfolio rose, with both wind and solar projects performing well. Wind projects benefited from good resources in all states and higher availability. Upgrading works to wind farms in Tejuva, Chandgarh and Harapanahalli also boosted productivity.\n\nConstruction of a wind power plant in Sidhpur in Gujarat state moved forward, although some work was held up by the pandemic. The project is expected to go into operation in the second half of 2022 after the Government agreed to extend its commissioning deadline.\n\nThe addition of two new plants in Telangana state in 2020, meanwhile, contributed to increased solar power generation. Output from other plants was lower, partly because of land disputes affecting the Tornado and Gale projects in Maharashtra state which are now nearing resolution.\n\nApraava Energy continued to receive payments from local distribution companies for the purchase of renewable energy. However, the level of outstanding receivables rose 14.5% to HK$883 million, largely because of disruption caused by the pandemic.",

approvals under the new foreign investment rules for it to complete the acquisition of a 49% stake in KohimaMariani Transmission Limited (KMTL), owner of an interstate transmission project which began operations in northeast India in 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, Apraava Energy will acquire the remaining stake in two tranches by December 2025.\n\nThe company first entered the power transmission sector in November 2019 by taking a 100% stake in Satpura Transco Private Limited (STPL), which owns an intrastate project in Madhya Pradesh state. The operational performances of both the KMTL and STPL projects have been in line with forecasts, with close to 100% availability.\n\n## Power Station Sets New Standards\n\nApraava Energy's only coal-fired project in India - Jhajjar Power Station in Haryana state - recorded its highest utilisation rate to date following the successful completion of a major planned outage on one of the generation units in the first quarter. Despite low coal supplies because of a national shortage, the power station managed to increase output in response to rising electricity demand. Jhajjar Power Station is one of the few plants with flue gas desulphurisation equipment installed in the northern National Capital Region, which enabled the plant to meet the new and more stringent sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission limit introduced in February 2019. It had four minor licence limit exceedances for SO 2 during the year due to equipment failure or malfunction. However, the units remained operational as requested by",

The rebranded company aims to double the size of its energy portfolio over the next two to three years, driven by greenfield renewable energy investments and acquisitions. As a strong support to reach this goal, in December Apraava Energy received\n\nMr Joe Phelan Director, WBCSD India\n\nits registration under India's new foreign investment rules, which enables it to participate in all public auctions in the fields of generation, transmission and distribution in the years ahead.\n\nApraava Energy will continue to expand its non-generation business such as transmission amid the ongoing privatisation of India's power sector, explore diversification into power distribution and other customer-focused business and encourage greater participation from local shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRajiv Mishra\n\nManaging Director, Apraava Energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow will Apraava Energy help India meet its people's growing energy needs and its net-zero commitments?\n\nA 2020 research by the International Energy Agency shows that India's population is continuing to grow, and its economic development is accelerating. As a result, energy demand is expected to double by 2040. On the other hand, according to information published by the Ministry of Power of the Government of India, the country's energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels which had an installed capacity of about 235GW in December 2021, or about 60% of the total. The installed capacity of renewables, meanwhile, stood at about 151GW. Currently, solar and wind contribute just 10% of India's electricity generation, while coal accounts for about 70%. This energy mix is undergoing a rapid transition driven by government policy including a target to install 500GW of renewables by 2030.\n\nKeeping pace with this transition and the climate strategy of our investors, the CLP Group and CDPQ, we at Apraava Energy have been steadily decarbonising our energy portfolio for more than a decade with the current balance at 37% wind, 10% solar and 53% coal. Our rebranding in 2021 also heralded a new strategy under which we plan to double our existing business by 2024 through the addition of only low-carbon activities. Marching down this path of low carbon growth, we have committed to a business ambition which supports the well-below 2\u00b0C climate change scenario. We are developing an emissions reduction target aiming towards net zero that will be validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nAlong with the shift to a low-carbon portfolio, we are taking additional small steps to reduce our carbon footprint. For example, during COP26, we signed the WBCSD's India's Electric Vehicle Ambition Statement, which aims to enable the energy transition in mobility. In this direction, we have added two electric cars to our office fleet, and I am currently driving an electric vehicle myself.\n\nApraava Energy is a budding, clean energy company that aims to produce more clean and affordable energy and has a vision of a low-carbon business.

Sustainable, diversified and costeffective financing is vital to support investments in clean, reliable energy infrastructure . CLP further broadened its sources of debt funding through innovative green financing instruments under its Climate Action Finance Framework (CAFF). The Group also remained committed to prudent financial management amid the ongoing global pandemic and high financial market volatility. The continued financial strength and flexibility provided strong foundations to CLP's ongoing transition towards a net-zero emissions future. Financerelated highlights of 2021 included:\n\n- Capital investments of HK$14,198 million - including decarbonisation projects in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia and India - compared with HK$11,691 million in 2020.\n- Sustainable financing arranged at very favourable commercial terms, before the rise in inflation and interest rates later in 2021.\n- Successful issuance of CLP Power Hong Kong's US$300 million 10-year public bond for general corporate purpose in July at commercially-attractive pricing.\n- Strong liquidity maintained with undrawn bank facilities of more than HK$28 billion and bank balances of more than HK$8 billion for the Group as of 31 December 2021.\n- Solid credit ratings well within investment grade for CLP's major entities by S&P and Moody's.\n\n## Green Financing Empowering Climate Actions\n\nAs one of the largest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions, the electricity sector has a critical role in efforts to combat climate change. Power companies such as CLP need to increase investment in low- or zero-carbon emitting electricity infrastructure and help customers reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts that annual clean energy investment will need to accelerate to around US$4 trillion by 2030 to support the transition to a net-zero global economy by 2050. As capital providers increasingly recognise the benefits of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments, there is growing alignment between the financial industry and the power sector in concerted efforts to accelerate the pace of energy transition. Clean energy infrastructure must be built and integrated into the electricity market to enable the phase-out of coal-based power generation in an orderly manner. Meanwhile, the economics of clean energy are becoming more favourable because of the fall in the costs of renewable power.\n\nCLP committed in 2021 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its value chain by 2050. Supported by a sound financial position, CLP worked closely with investors and financial institutions to ensure strong fund flow and adequate liquidity for its operations and growth, while maintaining sufficient reserves for contingencies. The establishment of CAFF in 2017 was testament to CLP's pioneering green financing with demanding standards of corporate governance. The Group remained focused on improving the sustainability, diversification and cost efficiency of debt financing to support investments in lowcarbon energy and associated infrastructure in the energy transition.\n\nIn financial markets, 2021 was marked by unpredictability and challenges as the ongoing pandemic and the emergence of coronavirus variants led to an uneven recovery in the global economy. Massive monetary easing and subsequent inflationary pressures triggered debates over the need for quantitative tapering. With continuing uncertainties over the direction of central bank policies, yields of benchmark 10-year US Treasury Notes surged from 0.91% in January 2021 to 1.74% in March, before softening to 1.19% in July. The yields then rebounded to 1.52% in December and were above 1.96% at the beginning of February 2022, at a time of increased market concerns over inflation and the COVID-19 variants. Such volatilities highlighted the need for continuing vigilance, meticulous planning, effective risk management and timely implementation of financing initiatives, as an uncertain economic environment became the 'new normal'.",

CLP is committed to working with key stakeholders, including capital providers and financial services companies, on the development of clear frameworks and practices for ESG financing following the successful introduction of CAFF more than four years ago. The framework was updated in 2020 to incorporate a broader range of sustainable financial instruments, diversifying from bonds to loan facilities.\n\nThere are two types of climate action finance transactions under CAFF: New Energy Finance Transactions, which are green bonds or loans for renewable energy and energysavings projects, and Energy Transition Finance Transactions, which are bonds or loans to fund projects that deliver significant emission reductions.\n\nIn February 2021, CAPCO successfully issued a US$300 million (HK$2.3 billion) 10-year, 2.125% Energy Transition Bond to partially fund the construction of D2, a new combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) generation unit at Black Point Power Station. The bond carried a 0.875% spread over 10-year US Treasury Notes, the narrowest of all 10-year bonds previously offered by CLP and reportedly the tightest among all non-public sector debt offerings by corporations in Hong Kong at the time of issuance. The bond, under CAPCO's Medium Term Note (MTN) programme, was more than 4.6 times oversubscribed, attracting more than US$1.4 billion in orders from investors globally. In addition, CAPCO arranged a total of HK$3.7 billion of three-year energy transition revolving loan facilities, in addition to a HK$1.6 billion 15year energy transition loan facility covered by export credit agency Euler Hermes, to complete the financing for D2's project cost at competitive rates.\n\nIn July, CLP Power Hong Kong issued a US$100 million (HK$777 million) New Energy Bond under CAFF to support the continued rollout of smart meters in Hong Kong. More than 1.2 million smart meters have been connected at the end of 2021, offering customers the ability to improve energy efficiency with greater accessibility to data. Issued under the MTN programme, the bond carried a 2.25% coupon rate and was competitively priced at a 0.9% spread over 10-year US Treasury Notes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee CLP Climate Action Finance Report 2021.\n\nMore information about CLP Climate Action Finance Framework can be found on our website.\n\nCAFF helps attract socially-responsible, sustainable financing to support CLP's decarbonisation investments, and the Group is committed to the highest standards of governance on its implementation. Governance of CAFF aligns with the Green Bond Principles, a set of voluntary guidelines that recommend transparency and disclosure and promote integrity in the development of the international green bond market. CAFF also covers Energy Transition Financing for funding of government-supported investments that can achieve significant environmental benefits. Such financing is not included in the list of project categories under the Green Bond Principles.\n\nAll eligible CAFF projects undergo a rigorous review and approval process within a transparent framework and clear guidelines. All transaction proceeds must clearly deliver environmental benefits through investments in qualified projects identified by an unequivocal screening process. A committee chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and comprising senior management from departments including Treasury, Sustainability and Legal, is responsible for CAFF's governance, including approval of Climate Action Finance Transaction and determination of the proposed use of proceeds. Independent consultant DNV, a leading provider of sustainable finance assessments, has been commissioned by CLP to provide second-party opinion.\n\nInformation and post-issuance reports on CLP's Energy Transition Bonds and New Energy Bonds are available on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's (HKSE) Sustainable and Green Exchange (STAGE) platform for assessment by investors and analysts. CLP joined STAGE when the platform was launched in 2020 to provide a repository of information for sustainability, green and social bonds listed on the HKSE.",

As CLP continues to decarbonise under its Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement with the Government, the increasing ESG capital flow is being channelled into clean energy projects through the Group's Climate Action Finance Framework (CAFF), as well as new sustainable finance instruments on the market.\n\nIn 2021, 58% of the financing needs of CLP's SoC businesses in Hong Kong were met by sustainable sources of funding, increasing from 22% in 2017 when the establishment of CAFF enabled Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) to issue a US$500 million Energy Transition Bond. The bond was the first transaction under CAFF, and helped finance D1, a more efficient combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) unit at Black Point Power Station, to reduce the carbon intensity of electricity generation. Since then, CLP has made rapid progress on its sustainable finance journey.\n\nCAFF was updated in 2020 to support a broader range of sustainable finance transactions beyond bond issuances, allowing CAPCO to arrange a HK$2 billion long-term Energy Transition Loan Facility covered by China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). This was the first loan facility under CAFF covered by an export credit agency (ECA). In 2021, CAPCO arranged another ECA-covered loan - a HK$1.6 billion 15-year facility with Euler Hermes.\n\nSustainability elements were included in almost all newly-arranged financing facilities by CLP's SoC businesses in 2021, with the exception of short-term money market line facilities. CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO together arranged HK$4.4 billion of emission reduction-linked facilities with eight banks. The terms of the facilities included performance targets linked to levels of air emissions, including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and respirable suspended particulates, within a reducing annual maximum output level. Sustainable financing by CLP's SoC businesses in 2021 also included the US$300 million Energy Transition Bond issued by CAPCO in February, with 50% of the issuance allocated to ESG-focused investors globally. In July, the US$100 million New Energy Bond issued by CLP Power Hong Kong also received strong support from green bond investors, with 70% of the issuance allocated to ESG-focused capital providers. Financings in 2021 were arranged at very conducive transaction windows which offered very favourable commercial terms as CLP took timely action in the market and well ahead of the surging inflation and interest rates in the latter part of the year.\n\nCLP works closely with banks in due diligence and financing initiatives in alignment with the Equator Principles, which provide a common baseline and risk management framework to identify, assess and manage environmental and social risks.",

Capital investments increased 21.4% to HK$14,198 million, with CLP focused on progressing decarbonisation projects in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia and India. Investments in coal-based assets were limited to their maintenance, safety and emissions management. Despite a drop in operating cashflow to HK$18,078 million due primarily to reduced contributions from EnergyAustralia, strong financing capabilities allowed CLP to continue to maintain adequate financial resources to support its investments.\n\nThe largest proportion of CLP's operating earnings was generated by the transmission, distribution and retail of electricity in 2021. Coal assets contributed 10% of operating earnings before unallocated expenses, reduced from 23% in 2020. Under Climate Vision 2050, CLP is committed to expanding operations in lower-carbon segments, with a pledge to phase out coal-fired assets by 2040. This transition will help CLP manage the risks of climate change, and allow the Group to capitalise on opportunities in the net-zero transition.\n\nEnsuring a high degree of financial integrity is vital for CLP to meet its business and climate objectives. CLP strives to maintain a strong balance sheet with robust financial structure, supported by adequate cash flow with good investment grade credit ratings, providing the Group and its subsidiaries with access to global capital markets and bank funding.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO have well-established MTN programmes in place under which bonds in aggregate amounts of up to US$4.5 billion and US$2.0 billion\n\nrespectively may be issued. As of 31 December, notes with an aggregate nominal value of around HK$29 billion and HK$9.1 billion respectively were issued by the two companies.\n\nIn July, CLP Power Hong Kong successfully issued a US$300 million (HK$2.3 billion) 10-year public bond for general corporate purposes at a 2.25% coupon rate. It was competitively priced at a 0.9% credit spread over 10-year US Treasury Notes. The proceeds of all foreign currency bonds were swapped into Hong Kong dollars at favourable fixed rates to fully mitigate foreign exchange and interest rate risks. In May, CLP Power Hong Kong also issued A$24 million (HK$144 million) 15-year private bond at a 2.99% coupon rate for general corporate purposes. Both bonds were issued under the MTN programme.\n\nEnergyAustralia extended the maturity date of a A$300 million (HK$1.7 billion) working capital facility by three years to June 2024, and a A$500 million (HK$2.8 billion) bank guarantee and reimbursement facility by three years to March 2024, both at competitive terms. EnergyAustralia aims to diversify its debt portfolio through green and energy transition financing to meet the needs of clean energy projects, including battery storage and green hydrogen.\n\nIn Mainland China, CLP executed a RMB300 million (HK$360 million) two-year offshore revolving bank loan facility and a RMB587 million (HK$705 million) 15-year onshore project loan facility at competitive terms, as its renewable assets portfolio in the country grows.\n\nIn India, Apraava Energy arranged a total of Rs31.9 billion (HK$3.3 billion) of bank facilities as the business continued to expand its investments in clean energy, including wind and solar energy, as well as power transmission.\n\n| Debt Profile as of 31 December 2021   | CLP   Holdings HK$M   | CLP Power  Hong Kong HK$M   | CAPCO HK$M   | Other  Subsidiaries HK$M   | CLP Group HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n| Availability Facility  1              | 8,200                 | 34,273                      | 26,740       | 17,078                     | 86,291           |\n| Bank Loans and Other Borrowings       | -                     | 29,219                      | 17,132       | 11,864                     | 58,215           |\n| Undrawn Facility                      | 8,200                 | 5,054                       | 9,608        | 5,214                      | 28,076           |\n\nNote:",

CLP will continue to take pre-emptive, timely actions to arrange major financing activities with sustainability or ESG elements, to the extent appropriate, in line with the Group's decarbonisation strategy.\n\nThe Group maintained a high level of interest rate and foreign currency hedging at commercially-acceptable terms to cover committed and highly probable financial obligations, enabling it to withstand financial market volatility and pursue its business objectives. This included the use of natural hedge and approved financial derivative instruments with straightforward, easy-to-understand features that can qualify for effective accounting hedge with no adverse profit-and-loss impact to manage obligations and risks. For counterparty exposure, CLP transacts only with\n\ncredible financial institutions and financially sound business counterparts with strong credit ratings. These measures help ensure CLP's businesses do not face undue residual financial or credit risks and provide confidence to stakeholders, including governments, customers, shareholders, financial institutions, bond investors and business partners. This risk management approach is well established and has been continually enhanced, benefitting the Group in the volatile market environment in 2021. CLP's robust financial position provides with reasonable degree of predictability for future planning and equips the Group with the necessary resources to finance capital investments, creating value in the lowcarbon transition and increasing business resilience.\n\nCLP is committed to strengthening its reporting in line with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). To provide transparent, reliable and consistent information to stakeholders, the Group continued to focus on enhancing its climate-related risk assessment and developing bespoke climate scenarios for its markets.

In May and June 2021, Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Moody's affirmed the credit ratings of CLP Holdings (A and A2), CLP Power Hong Kong (A+ and A1) and CAPCO (AA- and A1) with stable outlooks. In October 2021, S&P revised the rating outlook of EnergyAustralia to negative from stable and affirmed the BBB+ credit rating. The rating agency expressed the view that EnergyAustralia would be affected by a challenging market and weak operating conditions, including ageing coal-based generation assets and depressed wholesale electricity prices.\n\nMoody's and S&P published ESG credit scores for the utility and power generation sectors in 2021 to provide more transparency on how key sustainability drivers will be factored into their credit analysis. CLP Holdings was assigned E-3, S-2 and G-1 by S&P, and E-3, S-3 and G-2 by Moody's, on a scale of 1 (highest score) to 5 (lowest score). Both agencies recognised CLP's credible commitment to taking action on climate change and the capital spending for energy transition to meet its netzero emission targets.

Amid the accelerating energy transition, the Group remained focused on maintaining its world-class level of supply reliability and building resilience in a changing climate . CLP also continued to reinforce cyber resilience and data protection at a time when cybersecurity is an increasing global concern. Highlights in 2021 included:\n\n- Full implementation of a data analytics platform to monitor performance of wind and solar energy assets across Mainland China and India.\n- Resilience studies conducted across the Group's operations.\n- Planning for a new cyber monitoring centre in Shenzhen to support CLP's expansion in the Greater Bay Area.\n\n## Managing the Energy Transition\n\nEnergy disruption affected millions of households and businesses as electricity providers across Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas struggled to maintain stable supplies in a year of global fuel shortages and extreme weather events.\n\nDecarbonising the electricity sector is central to international efforts to tackle climate change. As investment in renewable energy continues to grow, solutions such as battery energy storage systems (BESS) are essential to manage the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy and strengthen the reliability of electricity supplies.\n\nEnergy companies also need to invest in reinforcing the resilience of their supply infrastructure against the escalating risk of extreme weather events linked to climate change, and improve their protection against online attacks.\n\n## Investing in Clean, Reliable Energy\n\nCLP is determined to make the energy transition reliable and affordable to customers as it decarbonises its electricity supply. In Hong Kong, CLP is currently building a second new combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) unit at Black Point Power Station. This follows the commissioning of the first 550 megawatt (MW) CCGT unit in 2020. The new units, D1 and\n\nD2, will play a significant role in reducing the carbon intensity of Hong Kong's power supply, while maintaining reliability as CLP prepares to phase out its remaining coal-fired capacity at Castle Peak A Power Station.\n\nThe advanced CCGT technology of unit D1 gives it an efficiency rate of around 60%, far higher than the other eight gas-fired units currently in operation at Black Point Power Station. It has cut carbon emissions by about one million tonnes a year, equivalent to the planting of more than 42 million trees, as compared to coal-fired generation. As zero-carbon hydrogen becomes available in the future, CLP expects to be able to use this to fuel D1 and D2 units and further reduce carbon emissions.\n\nEnergyAustralia's planned Tallawarra B generator in New South Wales, scheduled to go into operation in time for the 2023/24 Australia summer, will also use technology supporting the use of a blend of green hydrogen and natural gas for cleaner power generation.\n\n## Raising Performance Levels\n\nCLP continued to upgrade its generation assets in Asia Pacific to optimise their performance and raise reliability levels, despite the challenges of the pandemic. Electricity sent out for the Group increased 6.1% to 91,183 gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2021 on an equity plus long-term capacity and energy purchase basis.\n\nThe performance of all CLP wind and solar energy assets in Mainland China and India are now monitored continuously by an advanced analytics platform. The system incorporates digital technologies, including big data and artificial intelligence, and gives CLP real-time data to help it monitor and manage almost 2 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy assets.\n\nIn India, Apraava Energy launched programmes to upgrade wind farms in Tejuva in Rajasthan state, Harapanahalli in Karnataka state, and Chandgarh in northern India. The upgrades involve the installation of generators with larger capacity, improvements to the aerodynamic performance of turbine blades, and new software to help maintain generation in high wind periods. The wind farms recorded significantly improved energy output and plant availability.\n\nMajor maintenance programmes were carried out at EnergyAustralia's Yallourn Power Station to enhance its reliability and performance. Works are also planned at Mount Piper Power Station to reduce the minimum stable load at which it can operate. This will make the plant more responsive to demand and more cost-effective in a market in which increasing renewable energy penetration is driving down wholesale electricity prices.",

This increases the commercial viability of CLP's first grid-parity project - a renewable energy project not reliant on Government subsidies.\n\nConnected to the grid in December 2021, Qian'an III is adjacent to the existing Qian'an I and II projects. Together, the three wind farms constitute the largest single-site operational wind energy asset in CLP's portfolio with a combined capacity of 199MW.\n\nIn its planning for Qian'an III, CLP drew on the experience of EnergyAustralia, which has agreements to operate and dispatch two BESS projects in the state of Victoria - the 30MW Ballarat project and the 25MW Gannawarra project.\n\nEnergyAustralia has now committed to developing the much larger 350MW Wooreen battery project, co-located with its Jeeralang Gas-fired Power Station. It is scheduled to go into service by 2026 and will bolster supply reliability in Victoria in the run-up to the planned retirement of Yallourn Power Station in 2028.\n\nIn Hong Kong, meanwhile, CLP and the city's Airport Authority jointly designed and developed a 4MW BESS system which went into service in June 2021 at the Hong Kong International Airport.\n\nGlobally, energy storage installations will increase to a cumulative 358 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, more than 20 times the 17GW of projects online at the end of 2020, according to forecasts by strategic research provider BloombergNEF.\n\nQian'an III Wind Farm in Mainland China is the first CLP project of its kind equipped with a battery energy storage system.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These included comprehensive assessments of extreme weather events, including floods and landslides, for CLP's renewable energy assets in Mainland China. Similar climate resilience studies were carried out for assets in Hong Kong, with a specific focus on the integrity of power transmission and distribution assets in severe weather events such as Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018. In India, Apraava Energy assessed the risk of heat stress and drought at Jhajjar Power Station. These studies will help inform investment decisions to protect assets against future climate events.\n\nCLP also developed a climate risk due diligence tool to assist in risk assessment of new energy infrastructure projects. The tool enables the screening of climate-related incidents that might disrupt project progress or operations, helping project teams develop measures to minimise the assessed impact. Further details on how CLP manages climate risks are available in CLP's 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\nWith more than 5,600 suppliers under its management in 2021, CLP has continued to develop the Group's procurement capabilities to strengthen the resilience of its operations. This has included a raised focus on upstream supply chains to manage risks and issues associated with external factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, rising commodity prices, deglobalisation, physical climate risk, trade sanctions and sovereign risk.\n\n## Strengthening Cybersecurity\n\nCLP further strengthened protection of its operations against potential cybersecurity risks. As part of a holistic and coordinated strategy, CLP deployed new technologies including improved software to detect cyber threats and automated technology to isolate devices when threats are detected. The Group also broadened its range of firewalls and threat-scanning technologies.\n\nA cyber monitoring centre is planned in Shenzhen to support CLP's push to capture growing business opportunities in the Greater Bay Area. The centre will improve liaison with CLP's businesses in Mainland China and establish protocols for localised cybersecurity products and practices, particularly as the need for compliance with new cyber regulations increases.\n\nCLP also continued to raise the awareness of employees, providing training to develop their ability to recognise and respond to online threats. Detailed reviews were conducted in partnership with external consultants to explore ways to further improve awareness of cybersecurity and incident response capability.\n\nCLP is committed to protecting the data of its customers at all times. In 2021, a notifiable data breach associated with an email containing private information sent incorrectly to an EnergyAustralia customer's old email account was reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. The breach did not result in any penalty or sanction and EnergyAustralia has been working with the customer on a solution to the matter. In Hong Kong, no customer data loss case was reported in CLP's operations in 2021.",

CLP joined the Hong Kong Government's vaccination programme, arranging for more than 1,200 employees and their family members to receive vaccinations on Company premises. Similar programmes helped employees in Mainland China and India to get vaccinated.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of increased project activity, operational health and safety performance improved. There were reductions in both TRIR and LTIR as CLP continued to improve health and safety outcomes for employees and contractors. A primary focus was on addressing risks associated with high-consequence events. Through targeted employee engagement and worker insights, CLP developed more comprehensive and effective incident prevention\n\nprogrammes, aimed at eliminating fatalities, life-changing injuries and significant Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) events.\n\nCLP is investing in the redesign and re-engineering of high risk activities in order to materially reduce risk. CLP continued to eliminate the need for diving through the use of robotic technologies. This strategic and systematic approach to improving the safety of high risk tasks will also be applied across CLP's operations in the Asia Pacific to tasks which carry a risk of serious injury, such as working at height.\n\nThe Group is upgrading its management system to provide\n\nclear standards to manage HSE risks across its business units, with a particular focus on high risk operational activities. During 2021, workshops were held with workforce personnel from all business units. These workshops contributed to a deeper understanding of the controls and internal best practices for priority high risk operational activities. The outputs are now aiding the development of revised Groupwide standards.\n\nTo help build a protective barrier against COVID-19 in Hong Kong, CLP has taken a host of measures to encourage its employees to receive vaccination.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hence, the above 2021 LTIR and TRIR are for work-related injury only. There are 2 work-related ill health injuries and 2 commuting injuries in 2021.\n\n## Resourcing for Energy Transition and Growth\n\nRetaining the wealth of knowledge among CLP's employees, together with transferring skills to a new generation of managers and team members, is essential to CLP's long-term success, as is developing skills for a zero-carbon, digitally enabled future.\n\nInvesting in building pipelines of skilled engineers and technicians in preparation for the energy transition and to address future skills shortages continue to be a key priority. New and refreshed Graduate Trainee and Leaders of the Future development programmes aimed at meeting future managerial engineering needs continued in 2021, with increased female participation aligned to CLP's long-term aspiration to significantly increase the proportion of women in engineering and leadership roles. These programmes build technical, innovation, project, commercial and change leadership skills at different career stages, and provide exposure to the Group's operations in Mainland China and overseas. A new framework was developed for the Hong Kong business to assist in strengthening operational engineering competency. CLP continued to support engineers in the China business to attain nationwide professional engineering and international qualifications with over 330 employees qualified to date. Investment in study awards for students, internships and mentoring also increased to strengthen pipelines to the Graduate programme, and support Hong Kong's young people during the pandemic.\n\nTo prepare for the opportunities that spring from greater regional integration, CLP extended internships to the GBA under the Hong Kong Government's Youth Employment Scheme, and increased entry level and experienced-hire recruitment in Hong Kong and the Mainland. Around 70 employees participated in cross-cultural training on national affairs, business leadership and management offered by institutions including the Tsinghua School of Economics and Management and Ivey Business School. Job rotations for engineers between Mainland China and Hong Kong also increased. Webinars and virtual tours were launched in late 2021 to allow employees to gain insights into CLP's renewable energy development and power industry reforms in Mainland China.",

The programme combines leadership, energy transition and business simulation elements, and was conducted virtually in partnership with the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and Tilt Global.\n\nTo support these efforts, talent development and mobility policies were updated, and talent acquisition capability was enhanced. CLP continued to strengthen resourcing for innovation, major projects, business development and energy transition-related activities and projects, with 24 senior appointments into critical roles. EnergyAustralia launched a refreshed performance and development framework to continuously improve and sustain high levels of team and individual performance, providing employees access to LinkedIn Learning to support current and future roles.\n\nEmployees received an average of 51.6 hours of internal and external training and development compared with 42.5 hours in 2020. The increase reflects a pivot to delivering training virtually on topics of critical health and safety, operational and compliance, as well as new training initiatives such as wellbeing and resilience.\n\n| Employee Training        | Average   Training Hours   per Employee   | % of   Employees   Trained   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| By Gender                |                                           |                              |\n| Male                     | 58.2                                      | 98.7%                        |\n| Female                   | 33.3                                      | 97.7%                        |\n| By Professional Category |                                           |                              |\n| Managerial               | 29.5                                      | 94.2%                        |\n| Professional             | 41.2                                      | 98.5%                        |\n| General and Technical    | 65.8                                      | 99.0%                        |\n| By Region                |                                           |                              |\n| Hong Kong                | 60.8                                      | 97.8%                        |\n| Mainland China           | 77.8                                      | 100.0%                       |\n| Australia                | 26.8                                      | 100.0%                       |\n| India                    | 48.8                                      | 95.9%                        |\n| Group Total              | 51.6                                      | 98.5%                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender Distribution by Region\n\nNote:  Data of other gender identities is tracked.

CLP's Graduate Trainee programme was extended to graduates from Mainland China universities, and job fairs\n\nwere organised at institutions including Shandong University, Hunan University and the South China University of Technology. Over 500 applications from Mainland students were received for the programme.\n\nCLP also supported the Hong Kong Government's Greater Bay Area Youth Employment Scheme, providing opportunities for five Hong Kong graduates to work on projects in the Chinese energy market. CLP actively promoted the scheme by sharing its benefits with other companies to encourage them to participate.\n\nCLP stepped up efforts to source targeted talent to help capture new business opportunities in the GBA. Resources from China and Hong Kong businesses were mobilised to support and win GBA projects including a centralised cooling project at the Po Park Shopping Plaza in Guangzhou.\n\nCLP also developed programmes to deepen employees' understanding of the Chinese energy market. A series of webinars and virtual tours was launched in late 2021 to allow employees to explore CLP's renewable energy development in Mainland China, and reforms in the Chinese power industry, as well as challenges and opportunities in the market. More than 200 Hong Kong-based employees took part in the first webinar.\n\nOver 200 colleagues joined the first 'CLP - Our Journey Towards Zero Carbon' webinar in December 2021 to learn about solar energy in Mainland China.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employees need to develop capabilities to adapt to shifts in the market and collaborate effectively to find innovative solutions. CLP's organisational style and associated methodologies need to adapt to help it respond quickly to the changing needs of customers and employees, and to the needs of new business models.\n\nA key initiative to foster agility is CLP's Design Thinking programme, which is intended to nurture a people-centric innovation culture at CLP, providing practical problem-solving frameworks for product and service development, with users' needs in mind. More than 4,200 Hong Kong employees have participated in Design Thinking training since its launch in early 2019. Employees have applied Design Thinking in projects ranging from digital transformation and productivity to safety and customer service.\n\nCLP is also investing in programmes to develop innovation and digital capabilities, including the International Institute for Management Development's (IMD) online Digital Disruption and Innovation Programme, and bespoke courses on data analytics and Robotics Process Automation. At the end of 2021, almost 400 employees had taken part.\n\nCLP's workforce is distributed, with employees working in office, plants, work sites, in mobile field roles and from home. Changes to ways of working to introduce more flexibility have accelerated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including new ways for employees to connect virtually and collaborate. In the evolving pandemic situation, the focus has shifted to embedding flexible working options. Following a review of current policy and practices, enhanced flexible working and wellbeing policies were developed for employees in Hong Kong, including new part-time work options and work-fromhome arrangements.\n\nMore agile team structures and working environments were established in Hong Kong and in EnergyAustralia to encourage closer collaboration on growth opportunities and to speed up decision-making.\n\n## Supporting CLP's People to Thrive in Change\n\nAs the energy industry and the operating environment evolves at unprecedented pace, CLP is committed to supporting all its people to thrive in change. This calls for increased engagement and support for employees to embrace change, strengthening their wellbeing and resilience, and developing a more inclusive workplace, as well as\n\nproviding support and reskilling to employees whose jobs are affected by the transition to net zero or other business restructuring.\n\nAn engaged workforce is critical to CLP's long-term success. CLP conducted its most recent employee engagement survey for Hong Kong and China assets in late 2020. Pleasingly, there was a very strong 85% response rate, and CLP moved into the second quartile of engagement versus Hong Kong benchmarks and remained at the threshold of the top quartile for China assets, with improvements in most areas since the prior survey in 2017. Following the survey, focus groups were set up to help CLP better understand and address employee concerns; these will form the basis of further work to evolve culture in 2022. EnergyAustralia continued to progress actions identified following its engagement survey, with engagement increasing over the past two years.\n\nCLP is committed to helping employees embrace change, strengthening their wellbeing and resilience as the business evolves, and creating a more inclusive workplace culture. Execution of the Company's health and wellbeing strategy was supported through the launch of the Virgin Pulse digital health and wellbeing platform to help employees improve their physical and mental wellbeing. To increase managers' awareness of, and ability to manage, mental health and emotional issues in the workplace, more than 250 mid-level managers attended resilience programmes. Family-friendly and flexible working policies were enhanced.\n\nCLP continued to help employees in Hong Kong address housing affordability issues through its Home Loan scheme, which provides additional financial support for employees seeking to buy a first home. Since the scheme was launched in early 2019, a total of 146 employees have received assistance.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, EnergyAustralia announced plans for the closure of Yallourn Power Station in mid-2028, together with building and commissioning a utility-scale battery. EnergyAustralia will provide significant financial support to Yallourn's workforce to help them plan, reskill or retrain for their future. This support is in addition to worker entitlements. EnergyAustralia will continue to engage with the Victorian state government and the local community to ensure an orderly closure and detailed plans will be developed and made available to its people with inputs from the workforce. Separately, EnergyAustralia successfully concluded collective bargaining negotiations for its Tallawarra plant and for operations in the Geelong region. All agreements were reached without the occurrence of protected industrial action.",

A Virgin Pulse digital health and wellbeing platform connected to a wearable fitness device was offered to employees in Hong Kong to promote healthy lifestyles by allowing them to track and monitor their daily activities.\n\nMental health was another key focus in 2021. The Mental Health First Aid training programme was updated under a new framework combining online and physical interactions. More than 250 employees in Hong Kong have participated in the programme, equipping themselves with the knowledge to identify and address early signs of mental health issues.\n\nLeaders can build psychological safety by creating the right climate, mindsets and behaviours within the organisation. To empower and enable senior leaders, a new series of wellbeing, mindset, resilience and high-performance programmes was launched in 2021 and will continue in 2022. The programmes help participants to understand the importance of wellness for self and in leading teams, to see wellness and resilience in action and role-model leadership accountabilities and behaviours.\n\nAdditionally, a review was conducted in Hong Kong on psychologically healthy and safe workplace practices, with the aim to cultivate a sustainable approach to enhance employees' mental health and wellbeing. A roadmap has been developed to embed psychological health in CLP's policies and systems, and to plan for the objective of attaining ISO45003 certification for psychological health and safety at work from the International Organisation of Standardisation.",

This section discusses how these stakeholder relationships consolidated CLP's reputation as a trusted partner in an evolving policy and regulatory landscape . The social impact of decarbonisation was a major consideration for CLP in managing its business through the energy transition. As the pandemic persists, the wellbeing of the communities served by CLP is crucial to the Group's efforts to build resilience in a changing climate . Key initiatives covered in this section include:\n\n- Strengthening engagement with policymakers and stakeholders on the path toward net-zero including coal phaseout.\n- Educating the public and enabling customers in efforts towards greater energy efficiency and decarbonisation.\n- Providing continued community support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\n\n## Rising to the Climate Challenge\n\nGovernments around the world, including China, the US, Australia and India, continued to strengthen their climate and environmental policies in 2021, anchored by the agreement reached by more than 190 countries at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November. Managing climate change is central to the sustainability and resilience of economies and communities. To convert policies into action, broad societal support is needed, and businesses have a leading role to play.\n\nIncreasing disruption and volatility in energy markets across Asia and Europe towards the end of the year underscored the importance of maintaining supply reliability in the accelerating energy transition. To maintain public trust and support for building the net-zero economy of the future, careful planning and coordination is crucial. This approach will also help manage the pace of the energy transition and balance the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nWorking towards a lower-carbon future requires a collective effort, and in 2021, CLP continued to contribute to discussions on energy-sector decarbonisation at major international forums and to promoting closer industry cooperation. Highlighting the Group's thought leadership in this field, CLP Holdings Chief Executive Officer Richard Lancaster became a member of the CNBC ESG Council, a new global forum for discussion and cooperation between international business executives and industry leaders.\n\nMr Lancaster and other CLP executives spoke at a number of events including the Energy Transitions LIVE conference organised by the UK's Chatham House in March, the International Emissions Trading Association's North America Climate Summit in New York in September, the Accelerating Asia's Energy Transition conference at The Economist's Future of Energy Week conference in October, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's Roadmap to Net Zero with Hydrogen event at COP26 in November. Mr Lancaster also delivered a public lecture on climate action at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University in November, and was a keynote speaker at events including the Transforming Business for Sustainability conference, organised by the Business Environment Council in December. Flexible digital formats allowed CLP representatives to participate in overseas events remotely, despite international travel restrictions.\n\n## Working with Governments to Ensure a Smooth, Just Transition\n\nClear and stable policy frameworks are vital to facilitate the long-term infrastructure investments needed for a coordinated energy transition. CLP was engaged in discussions with the Hong Kong Government to contribute to the development of a decarbonisation roadmap and welcomed the Climate Action Plan 2050 released in October. As the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Hong Kong, the electricity industry has a key role to play in realising the Government's climate policies and helping customers to decarbonise. CLP firmly supports Hong Kong's goal of achieving carbon neutrality before 2050.\n\nIn Mainland China, CLP continued to work closely with stakeholders in support of the Chinese Government's target of achieving peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Together with China National Offshore Oil Corporation, Shenzhen Energy Group and Siemens Energy, CLP set up the Joint Initiative on Accelerating Energy Transformation in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in April. Under the initiative, the four companies are strengthening collaboration to address key energy industry trends in the GBA including decarbonisation and digitalisation.",

        "page_content": "EnergyAustralia contributed to ongoing discussions with policymakers on national and state levels to help shape the energy transition in Australia, including proposed reforms to the National Electricity Market drawn up by the Energy Security Board. As more renewable energy is brought into the electricity grid, EnergyAustralia remains committed to supporting a market design that delivers reliable energy at least cost to consumers.\n\nPlans to retire Yallourn Power Station in Victoria were brought forward to mid-2028, four years before the end of the plant's technical life. By providing seven years' retirement notice, EnergyAustralia signalled its determination to work closely with the Victorian Government, suppliers and stakeholders to identify potential impacts and ensure a smooth transition. Yallourn Power Station and its mine have played a major role in the Latrobe Valley community for the past 100 years, and EnergyAustralia will maintain its operations until the plant's retirement, delivering continuing economic opportunities for local suppliers and workers.\n\nAs part of an agreement with the State Government, EnergyAustralia committed to building the new 350MW Wooreen utility-scale battery, co-located with Jeeralang Power Station, further advancing the transition to cleaner energy in Victoria. Plans for the construction of the new Wooreen battery energy storage system will provide a boost to the local economy, as EnergyAustralia is committed to maximising the role of suppliers in the Latrobe Valley and the broader Gippsland region.\n\nEnergyAustralia reached an agreement with the State Government of New South Wales in May over the Tallawarra B Power Station. Due to enter service in time for the\n\n2023/24 Australian summer, it will be the country's first net-zero emissions power plant to use a blend of green hydrogen and natural gas, with greenhouse gas emissions fully offset over its operational life. The project will help the State Government towards its net-zero goal, as well as strengthening supply security and reliability.\n\n## Balancing Decarbonisation Demands\n\nBuilding a low-carbon economy requires support from all sectors of society, along with a balanced decarbonisation approach that aligns the interests of different stakeholders. An orderly energy transition depends upon careful planning to ensure electricity supplies remain reliable and affordable to consumers, while taking into account the interests of workers and communities affected by the closure of carbonintensive power stations.\n\nCLP announced a range of special rebates in Hong Kong to minimise the impact of surging fuel costs on 2022 power tariffs, as electricity utility companies worldwide faced rising fuel prices. Underprivileged groups in Hong Kong were given additional support through electricity subsidies.\n\nA new offshore LNG terminal is expected to increase the diversity of natural gas supply for electricity generation in Hong Kong when construction is completed this year. CLP continued dialogue over environmental issues with stakeholders, including fishermen and community groups. Meanwhile, grants totalling HK$27 million have been provided to 19 projects to enhance the marine environment in southern and western Hong Kong waters, drawn from the Marine Conservation Enhancement Fund and Fisheries Enhancement Fund which were established in 2020.\n\nThe We Love Dance programme in Hong Kong encourages everyone to dance, save energy and help the underprivileged.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The liaison group provides a platform for the exchange of views on environmental issues raised by the project during its design, construction and operation.\n\nGreater public awareness of the importance of zero carbon energy is central to the success of the energy transition. The CLP E-Playground, opened in April, is Hong Kong's first environment-themed outdoor playground, providing an interactive educational resource for the public to learn about energy conservation and the electricity industry. The new CLP Power Engineering Laboratory, run by the Vocational Training Council with support from CLP, opened in the same month, offering an advanced facility for power engineering students to find out about the latest smart grid technologies supporting the transition to cleaner energy.\n\nIn India, Apraava Energy launched a new programme to support the use of solar energy in nine villages near its power transmission infrastructure in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The initiative also provides training on the maintenance of solar power projects and supports educational projects on renewable energy in schools and kindergartens.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lightening the Carbon Load\n\nCLP expanded its range of services for customers to improve their energy efficiency as more businesses and organisations looked at ways to reduce their energy expenses and carbon footprint. The Company strengthened its support for commercial and industrial customers in Hong Kong, helping them take advantage of increased electrification to decarbonise and participate in the transition to a net-zero economy. By providing more diversified services, including consultancy and energy-saving solutions, CLP aims to deepen customer relationships in key sectors including catering, data centres, hospitals and transport, evolving from a traditional transaction-based electricity utility business model.\n\nCLP launched a Retro-Commissioning Charter programme to support businesses in Hong Kong seeking to optimise the performance of electrical equipment, such as air conditioning systems. Typically, retro-commissioning projects do not involve the replacement of equipment and can be deployed more quickly to improve energy efficiency. The new programme adds to an existing range of energy-saving offerings, including the CLP Eco Building Fund and the Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme.\n\n## Solutions for a Greener Hong Kong\n\nHong Kong's Hang Heung Cake Shop, a traditional Chinese bakery founded in 1920, installed state-of-the-art ovens and air conditioning systems in a makeover of its workshop after receiving energy saving tips from CLP to make its business more sustainable.\n\nCLP conducted an energy audit for Hang Heung and worked closely with the bakery on a thorough redesign of the workshop that has cut its annual electricity consumption by 20%. To ensure the quality of its cakes and pastries, the workshop's smart sensors allow chefs to keep temperatures and humidity at optimum levels through a mobile app. The project was funded by CLP's Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme.\n\n'Our team took a lot of care to get the design right and, as a result, our new facilities are more energy-efficient and use 50% less space, while our production capacity has increased,' said Hang Heung Chief Executive Desmond Wong.\n\nCLP has conducted energy audits for more than 2,000 business customers since the current Scheme of Control Agreement began in October 2018.\n\nForward Living, an elderly home operator in Hong Kong, worked with CLP to install new technology to help track and reduce energy consumption at a new residential care home. Through a simple-to-use, integrated mobile app, the technology enables staff at Forward Living to monitor the energy use of kitchen appliances, and the temperature inside refrigerators. The system also supports indoor air quality measurements and allows residents to check vital signs using cloud-based technology. Information from the system enables Forward Living to save energy and improve operational efficiencies.\n\nFunding from the Electrical Equipment Upgrade Scheme supported Forward Living in purchases of more energy-efficient lighting and air-conditioning systems to help save 200,000kWh of energy.\n\nHang Heung and Forward Living were among the 49 winners in the 2021 CLP Smart Energy Awards programme, which recognises excellence in energy efficiency.",

This followed a strong response from residential customers to the Go Neutral programme which, since its 2016 launch, has grown to become the largest carbon offset programme in Australia's retail energy market.\n\n## Foundations for a Resilient Future\n\nThe resilience of CLP's business depends on the continued health and wellbeing of the communities in which it operates. CLP distributed retail and catering coupons to almost 800,000 residential customers in Hong Kong, including lowincome families, elderly people and tenants of subdivided units, in an initiative aimed at supporting people through the pandemic while promoting consumer spending to boost the city's economic recovery. Each beneficiary of the CLP Retail and Catering Coupons programme received vouchers worth HK$100 to spend in more than 2,800 participating\n\n## Community Initiatives and Volunteering\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote:\n\n- 1 Figures include rounding adjustments.\n\nshops and restaurants as part of a HK$160 million package of initiatives funded by the CLP Community Energy Saving Fund. CLP announced a further HK$220 million package for 2022 from the same fund for initiatives including a new coupon programme and electricity subsidies for selected customers. CLP volunteers meanwhile organised virtual visits to elderly homes and day care centres, using video conferencing technologies to provide support to people affected by social distancing restrictions during the pandemic.\n\nIn Australia, as lockdowns and economic restrictions continued to affect large swathes of the population, EnergyAustralia continued to provide support to people struggling financially, setting up flexible payment plans and providing bill extensions to thousands of residential customers.\n\nIndia was hit by a severe wave of COVID-19 in the second quarter. CLP and its Indian subsidiary responded by committing Rs 68 million (HK$7 million) to relief efforts and the delivery of critical health supplies. Apraava Energy worked with non-profit organisations based near its operations to improve hygiene and increase the availability of anti-virus supplies to strengthen the resilience of communities. It also encouraged people to participate in vaccination programmes.",

In 2021, CLP accelerated its decarbonisation plans while pursuing new investments in clean energy infrastructure and supporting the energy transition in its markets as the regulatory landscape continued to evolve . With climate change creating a widening range of risks for businesses, CLP took steps to enhance disclosure of the impact on its operations. Key climaterelated performance highlights in 2021 included:\n\n- Updated Climate Vision 2050 with strengthened decarbonisation targets, including the commitment to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across CLP's value chain by the middle of the century.\n- Expansion of CLP's renewable energy portfolio by 6.7% to 3,624MW.\n- Enhanced climate reporting based on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the International Sustainability Standards Board's Climate-related Disclosures Prototype.\n\n## An Escalating Climate Crisis\n\nAccording to Climate Change 2021: the Physical Science Basis report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, huge cuts in carbon emissions need to take place in order to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. An increasing occurrence of some extreme events are expected even at warming within that level.\n\nAt the COP26 summit in November, nearly 200 nations signed the Glasgow Climate Pact, committing to establish more ambitious emissions reduction goals and finalise global rules for carbon trading. It was the first international climate agreement with specific plans to reduce the use of coal for power generation, demonstrating increasing international resolve to accelerate the energy transition. Despite concerns that COP26 fell short of expectations and failed to impose more stringent limits on fossil fuel use, the pact nevertheless put governments worldwide on urgent notice to develop stronger and more effective climate policies in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\nCLP became the first Asian power company to set voluntary carbon intensity reduction targets in 2007 with the launch of Climate Vision 2050 - a strategy which has since guided the Group's approach to business and investments. CLP has continued to strengthen its climate targets, progressively decarbonising its business and fulfilling its interim targets to reduce carbon intensity in both 2010 and 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The Road to Net-zero Emissions\n\nIn the latest update of Climate Vision 2050 in 2021, CLP committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, encompassing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. This comprehensive target covers CLP's value chain, including the emissions of customers and suppliers.\n\nThe update of Climate Vision 2050 followed a strategic review in which CLP weighed up a comprehensive range of factors, including the latest climate science, technology trends, industry best practices and government policies. The review also considered the evolving expectations of investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders.\n\nAs well as the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, CLP set new decarbonisation targets for 2030 to align with the objective of limiting global warming to well-below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. CLP also stepped up plans to phase out coal-based assets, bringing the target date forward by a decade to 2040, while also significantly strengthening its emissions reduction targets for that year.\n\nCLP recognises the need to continue to raise its targets and to help limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The Climate Vision 2050 goals will be reviewed every five years at least going forward.\n\nCLP's subsidiary EnergyAustralia released an update to its Climate Change Statement, reinforcing the commitment it made in 2020 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and to transition out of coal assets by 2040. Apraava Energy is also committed to decarbonising its operations in India, in line with the worldwide Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nThe Group's greenhouse gas emissions intensity of electricity sold was maintained at 0.57kg CO 2 e/kWh in 2021, the same as in 2020. Over the course of the year, CLP's total Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions increased to 65,017 kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (ktCO 2 e) on an equity basis. While the generation mix remained stable, higher sent out amid the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in part led to an increase in CLP's absolute emissions from 2020, although markedly lower than the 2019 levels. In the coming years, CLP will continue to focus efforts on progressively phasing out coal for power generation, including honouring its commitment to the early closure of Yallourn Power Station in 2028, to bring the Group in line with its decarbonisation targets. It will also seek to widen deployment of renewable energy and keep assessing new energy technologies such as green hydrogen and energy storage solutions in its transition underway.\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP's greenhouse gas emissions intensity of electricity sold was 0.39kg CO 2 e/kWh in 2021, comparable\n\nto the 2020 level of 0.37kg CO 2 e/kWh. The emissions intensity level was affected by a host of factors including CLP customers' electricity consumption, the fuel mix for electricity generation and the operational requirements such as regular inspection and maintenance arrangements for the generation units.\n\n## Greenhouse Gas Emissions (on an Equity Basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Sent Out by Asset Type (on an Equity Plus Long-term Capacity and Energy Purchase Basis)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Numbers have been subject to rounding. Any discrepancies between the total shown and the sum of the amounts listed are due to rounding.\n- 2 Starting from 2020, a new \"Energy Storage' asset category has been added, under which pumped storage and battery storage are included.

CLP's 100MW Qian'an III Wind Farm in Jilin province was completed five months ahead of schedule and connected to the grid in December.\n\nMeanwhile, CLP also committed to two new wind energy projects in Mainland China: the 150MW Bobai farm in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the 50MW Xundian II farm in Yunnan province. Similar to Qian'an III, both new wind farms are grid-parity projects designed to operate without government subsidies, and construction is expected to begin in 2022.\n\nApraava Energy made progress with the construction of its 251MW Sidhpur wind farm in India's Gujarat state, which is due to go into operation in 2022. In December, the company acquired a 49% stake in a 254-kilometre interstate power transmission project in northeast India, and plans to purchase the remaining equity of the project at a later date.\n\nIn Hong Kong, CLP moved forward with pre-development studies into the feasibility of an offshore wind farm in the territory's south-eastern waters. Improvements in turbine technology and costs are expected to make offshore wind farms an increasingly viable option in the medium term.\n\nEnergyAustralia announced the construction of a 350MW battery energy storage system, adjacent to Jeeralang Power Station in Victoria. The Wooreen project is expected to be completed by the end of 2026 to strengthen supply reliability in the run-up to the closure of Yallourn Power Station in 2028. The closure of Yallourn Power Station will reduce EnergyAustralia's carbon emissions by about 60% compared to 2021 levels, helping support the Victorian Government's climate policies.\n\nIn New South Wales, EnergyAustralia began an assessment of a potential pumped hydro energy storage facility at Lake Lyell near Mount Piper Power Station.\n\n## Policies for Energy Transition\n\nThe Hong Kong Government unveiled its Climate Action Plan 2050 in October, setting out a host of decarbonisation strategies, including an interim target of reducing carbon emissions in the city by 50% before 2035 compared with 2005 levels. The action plan further strengthens the Government's climate policies, providing increased regulatory clarity for CLP's long-term planning and investment decisions to support the city's goal to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050.\n\nThe Government's Climate Action Plan 2050 stresses the importance of maintaining a proportion of local power generation to maintain a reliable electricity supply. New types of zero-carbon energy, such as green hydrogen, offer a potential option for power generation which - combined with more renewable energy and regional cooperation - can form the foundations for a net-zero power sector in Hong Kong by 2050.\n\nTrading of carbon allowances under the Chinese Government's National Emissions Trading Scheme began in 2021. More than 2,000 power stations including CLP's Fangchenggang plant were among the programme's first participants. With its portfolio of renewable energy resources across the Mainland, CLP is expected to benefit from the future expansion of the scheme to allow for participation by non-thermal power producers. CLP is committed to deploying advanced technology at its power plants, in support of the Chinese Government's goals of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.",

The technology is still in early stages of development in Asia Pacific, although the pace has been accelerating.\n\nIn the Climate Action Plan 2050 strategy announced by the Hong Kong Government in October, hydrogen produced by renewable energy was identified as a potential source of zero-carbon energy for local electricity generation.\n\nEnergyAustralia's new Tallawarra B project is the country's first net-zero emissions hydrogen and gas-capable power plant. When it begins operations in time for the 2023/24 Australian summer, the power station will be capable of using a blend of green hydrogen and natural gas, with the plant's direct carbon emissions fully offset over its operational life. EnergyAustralia will offer to buy 200,000 kg of green hydrogen per year from 2025.\n\nIn November, CLP became one of the 28 founding members of H2Zero, a new global initiative launched by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Markets Initiative to accelerate the production and use of green hydrogen.\n\n## Transparency for the Net-zero Transition\n\nThe TCFD's framework for translating climate-related information into financial metrics has played a central role in enabling investor dialogue over the financial implications of climate change.\n\nCLP is committed to continuously enhancing its disclosures, and has introduced the in-depth 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report to provide climate-related financial information to stakeholders. The report follows the TCFD's recommendations and the International Sustainability Standards Board's Climate-related Disclosures Prototype. It covers governance of CLP's response to climate change and management of climate-related transition and physical risks,\n\nwhile offering relevant metrics and targets. It also includes information on the climate scenario analysis conducted by CLP for its portfolio across different markets, and details of how CLP mobilises resources to implement Climate Vision 2050 and identify opportunities presented by the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nView more information in CLP's 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report",

We welcome this development and are pleased to report that in 2021 CLP has made clear progress in these areas.\n\nClimate change is the biggest environmental issue facing the world and is one of the most material risks to CLP's business. We continue to take steps to proactively address this risk while also exploring ways to seize the opportunities that will come from the energy transition.\n\nIn 2021, we strengthened our Climate Vision 2050 targets as outlined extensively in this Report. These significant long-term commitments were determined after a thorough strategic review involving the CLP Holdings Board, the Sustainability Committee and the Sustainability Executive Committee. The review process undertaken illustrates the high degree of focus that our Board and management apply to this very important ESG topic.\n\nWe have always regarded transparency and accountability as fundamental principles of good governance and in this year's Annual Report, we have further sharpened on how we report on the ESG topics with a double materiality approach.\n\nhas on people, the environment and the economy. We believe that this reporting approach will more clearly articulate how CLP as an organisation impacts our ESG stakeholders and those ESG issues that impact on CLP's enterprise value.\n\nAs our business evolves, our Board and governance practices are regularly reviewed to ensure that they continue to best serve CLP. The regular refresh of our Board and Board Committees is an important element of this process and this is an ongoing commitment of our Board to ensure that we have the best people, skills and experience to lead CLP through the challenges that we face.\n\nWhile the outlook remains uncertain, we remain confident that CLP's long-term focus and commitment to good governance will hold us in good stead to manage our business in an ever dynamic environment.\n\nDavid Simmonds Company Secretary\n\nThe 2021 Annual Report focuses on those material ESG issues that have an enterprise value impact on CLP and the Sustainability Report discusses the impact that CLP\n\nCLP is proud to be recognised in our efforts in our Corporate Governance and Annual Report. In 2021, we are very honoured to have received the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Platinum Award in the newly established Most Sustainable Companies / Organisations Awards in the Hang Seng Index category.\n\nThe new category was reserved for companies with outstanding performance in both corporate governance and ESG, and the aim to reflect 'sustainability' in its broadest sense, not merely focusing on ESG.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2021 At a Glance\n\n## Climate Vision 2050 ESG Governance and KPIs\n\n## Hong Kong Stock Exchange Amended Corporate Governance Code\n\n## Internal Board Survey\n\nCLP's Climate Vision 2050 sets out the blueprint of the Group's transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century.\n\nIn 2021, the key targets and commitments in the Climate Vision 2050 have been updated and strengthened. Details of these are set out on page 18 of the Annual Report.\n\n## From a governance perspective:\n\n- KPIs - these targets and commitments are KPIs for our ESG disclosures for the purposes of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Listing Rules; and\n- Governance and review - the targets were formulated following a strategic review by engaging with internal and external stakeholders, including our Board, the Sustainability Committee, the Sustainability Executive Committee, relevant business units, and our investors.\n\nLate in 2021, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange introduced amendments to the Listing Rules which are aimed at enhancing the market's corporate governance framework and promoting good governance amongst listed companies.\n\nSome of the key changes cover the following areas: alignment of a company's culture; requirements on long-serving independent directors and mechanisms to ensure independent views are available to the board; gender diversity at board and management level; a mandatory requirement for nomination committee; and shareholders communication policy. These changes are effective 1 January 2022.\n\nCLP already fulfills most of these new requirements. An analysis of the new requirements and our practices on these are set out on page 109. We have also recently amended our Board Diversity Policy to explain how CLP will consider the independence of our Directors and to elaborate on our commitment that Directors be given the opportunity and channel to express their views.\n\nCLP is committed to undertaking external and internal Board reviews. We have conducted an internal Board review in 2021. This review takes the form of a questionnaire and covers a broad range of topics including: Board composition and dynamics, Board meeting cycle and Board materials, Board's focus and oversight of a range of issues.\n\nThis internal Board survey is a timely one as it reinforces the importance of the mechanisms in place for Directors to provide feedback to the Board as envisaged in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange new corporate governance requirements. In addition, feedback from this survey will assist in formulating the focus of attention for the 2022 Board review which will be conducted with an external consultant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n108\n\n## Material ESG Topics Our Approach to ESG reporting\n\nOne of the key Reporting Principles of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ESG Reporting Guide is materiality; essentially, those ESG issues that are determined by the Board as more important to investors and other stakeholders will need to be reported.\n\nCLP undertakes a materiality assessment process to determine the material ESG topics for reporting purposes. This process involves engagement with external and internal stakeholders with further validation and review undertaken periodically.\n\nBuilding on the materiality assessment process, we have taken a double materiality approach for our Annual Report and Sustainability Report:\n\n- Annual Report - this will discuss the material ESG issues that have an enterprise value impact on CLP; and\n- Sustainability Report - this explains the impact that CLP has on people, the environment and the economy.\n\nWith the ever-increasing demand for ESG information from different stakeholders, we believe this will assist our stakeholders in understanding the ESG topics that would have an impact on CLP's enterprise value, and those that are impactful in a broader sense.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n107",

The model letter is on our website and deals with a range of matters regarding a Director's appointment and responsibilities including an expected level of time commitment.\n- We have a set of bespoke CLP Onboarding Guidelines for Directors with the key objective of assisting new Directors in their understanding of CLP's business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. The Guidelines are available on the CLP website.\n- With the objective of minimising succession risk, the retirement age guideline in our Board Diversity Policy provides that where a Non-executive Director (other than the Chairman) has reached the age of 72 at the time of the relevant AGM, such Director will not be considered for re-election, however, this may be waived if the Board considers such Director has the skills, experience or capabilities that cannot be replaced at the relevant time.\n\n## Our disclosure\n\n- Our Fair Disclosure Policy sets out the principles for the broad and non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public.\n- Our Continuous Disclosure Obligation Procedures guide the organisation in monitoring and disclosing potential inside information.\n- The Continuous Disclosure Committee conducts regular assessment of potential inside information.\n- Our Risk Management Report sets out CLP's risk management framework and how CLP manages the Group's material risks.\n- We disclose our Senior Management's confirmation of compliance with the Model Code and CLP Code for Securities Transactions, in addition to similar disclosures by our Directors.\n- Our disclosure of financial information on the CLP Group's joint ventures and associates includes off-balance sheet contingent liabilities.\n- We issue individual Board Committee reports in our Annual Report for the Audit & Risk Committee, Sustainability Committee, Nomination Committee and Human Resources & Remuneration Committee.\n- We announce our financial results within two months after the end of the financial year. The Annual Report is available on our website within the following fortnight with hardcopies sent to shareholders about two weeks after that.\n- We disclose on our website minutes of our AGM; in addition, any questions or topics that are not specifically addressed at the AGM, full answers are provided and disclosed.",

Our Value Framework was refreshed in December 2020.\n- We have formulated our own Anti-Fraud Policy (with online training in 2020) which stipulates our commitment to preventing, detecting and reporting fraud, bribery and extortion.\n- General Representation Letters are issued by our CEO and CFO to the Audit & Risk Committee as verification of compliance.\n- We conduct a Group-wide Business Practice Review for our staff on a periodic basis to foster employees' understanding of our Code of Conduct (updated in May 2020) under CLP's Value Framework. An important aspect of this is ensuring that our employees maintain a good understanding of CLP's culture and values.\n- Under our Value Framework, we also have a Responsible Procurement Policy Statement. This sets out our expectations of the suppliers, and of their suppliers and subcontractors; we encourage them to follow the same standards of integrity and transparency in doing business with us.\n- Our Audit & Risk Committee will regularly examine the audit activity reviews conducted by the Internal Auditors. The Internal Auditors will highlight the significant events and findings which require the Committee's attention and further examination, where appropriate.\n- Members of our Audit & Risk Committee will conduct a meeting as between Members only prior to the full Committee meeting attended by management and the auditors; two of which are joined by the independent auditor.\n- For the Group's continuing connected transactions (CCTs), we engage the Company's independent auditor, PwC to undertake an agreed-upon procedures (AUP) engagement on the Group's CCTs pricing policies. The AUP findings were provided to the Independent Non-executive Directors as part of their consideration of the CCTs for the purposes of giving the required confirmation under Rule 14A.55 of the Listing Rules.\n\n## Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code and ESG Reporting Guide of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange\n\nThroughout the financial year ended 31 December 2021, the Company has complied with the Code Provisions and applied all the principles in the Corporate Governance Code in force during the year. CLP deviates from only one Recommended Best Practice in the Corporate Governance Code - that an issuer should announce and publish quarterly financial results.\n\n## Our Considered Reasons for not Issuing Quarterly Financial Results\n\nWhile CLP does issue quarterly statements which set out key financial and business information such as electricity sales, dividends and progress in major activities, we do not issue quarterly financial results for the following considered reasons:\n\n- they do not bring significant benefits to our shareholders;\n- they encourage a short-term view of the Company's business performance;\n- CLP's activities do not run and need not be disclosed and judged on a three-month cycle; and\n- preparation of quarterly reports is costly, including the opportunity cost of Board and management time spent on quarterly reporting.",

The Directors' Report includes the 'Board's Statement on ESG' which explains the governance of sustainability issues and how CLP approaches and manages our material ESG topics (page 189).\n- The governance of sustainability is integrated into our corporate governance structure throughout the Group. Set out below is CLP's Sustainability Governance Structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- As a Board Committee, the Sustainability Committee has a primary role in overseeing the management of the Group's sustainability issues and is supported by the Sustainability Executive Committee. The Audit & Risk Committee, meanwhile, ensures the assurance of the ESG data is appropriate.\n- Further information about CLP's ESG management approach and how progress on ESG-related goals and targets are reviewed can be found in the earlier section '2021 At a Glance' of this Corporate Governance Report, the Risk Management Report, the Sustainability Committee Report and the Directors' Report of this Annual Report, as well as in the Sustainability Report and the Climate-related Disclosures Report published online at the same time as this Annual Report.\n\n## Reporting Principles & Boundaries\n\n- Materiality - Since 2018, the approach of CLP's materiality assessments considers how megatrends could impact the success of its strategy in the medium- to long-term. In 2021, CLP has adopted a double materiality assessment to categorise financially material and impact material topics, which will be disclosed and discussed in the Annual Report and Sustainability Report respectively. Full details on the materiality assessment is provided in our online Sustainability Report and in 'Board's Statement on ESG' in the Directors' Report.\n- Quantitative and Consistency - Our ESG disclosures follow these guidelines and recommendations: the suite of tools from the Value Reporting Foundation (VRF), namely the Integrated Thinking Principles, the Integrated Reporting Framework, and the SASB Standards for Electric Utilities & Power Generators; the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's ESG Reporting Guide (ESG Reporting Guide); and the Global Reporting Initiative Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). ESG KPIs are provided over a period of five years in the Five-year Summaries to facilitate comparison. In 2021, a separate Climate-related Disclosures Report is also produced which follows the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the International Sustainability Standards Board's Climate-related Disclosures Prototype.",

Our materiality assessment process enabled management to determine which ESG issues have an enterprise value impact (financial materiality) and accordingly these financially material topics will be discussed and reported in the Annual Report; these are for reporting purposes under the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ESG Reporting Guide. Further information is in the Sustainability as Our Business Strategy and Capitals chapters. For those ESG issues which impact on people, the environment and the economy (impact materiality), they will be reported in full details in the online Sustainability Report, which is published at the same time and captures in detail our delivery of social and environmental value in a rapidly changing environment. Our approach to managing climate risks and capitalising on opportunities as part of CLP's decarbonisation efforts are captured in detail in the Climate-related Disclosures Report. In addition, data related to financially material and impact material topics are set out in the Five-year Summary: CLP Group Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Data on pages 302 to 305 of the Annual Report.\n- The following is a list of key sustainability topics by reference to the aspects in the ESG Reporting Guide and discussions and data on these topics can be found in the following chapters of this Annual Report:\n\n## Environmental\n\n## A1.

Our Directors Development Programme includes:\n\n- A -reading regulatory and industry-related updates, with the focus in 2021 on the Corporate Governance Guide for Boards and Directors issued by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange;\n- B -meeting with local management and stakeholders, and visiting CLP's facilities and special projects with CLP's involvement; and\n- C -attending expert briefings / seminars / conferences relevant to the business or director's duties. In addition, they have access to Chatham House (a leading independent policy institute based in London) publications and the opportunity to attend Chatham House events on topics relevant to our business.\n\n## Onboarding for new Directors\n\nThe Company has in place a set of Onboarding Guidelines with the key objective of assisting new Directors in their understanding of CLP's business, governance and Board and Committee dynamics. This sets out a structured onboarding process that would serve as a roadmap for new Directors to gain a better understanding of CLP and our business environment.\n\nOur Onboarding Programme for the newly appointed Directors is individually designed with the specific Director in mind having regard to the Director's unique background, skills, experience and perspective. No new Director was appointed in 2021.",

Other details of the Directors' biographies are set out under Board of Directors on page 98 of this Annual Report and on CLP website.\n\n## Board Evaluation\n\nWe undertook an external Board review in 2019. Since then, we have taken a progressive approach in implementing the recommendations from such review.\n\nIn 2021, an internal Board review was conducted in the form of a Board survey; it aimed at soliciting valuable feedback and comments from Directors in preparation for the next external Board evaluation. The process involved each Director completing a confidential online questionnaire covering a broad range of topics including Board composition and dynamics, Board meeting cycle and Board materials, Board's focus and strategic oversight of the Company including CLP's Strategy Review and digitalisation journey.",

The diagram below presents the approach used by CLP to appoint our Directors.\n\n## Key Principles in the Search for New Directors\n\n- In the search for potential new Director candidate(s), this should be guided by the strategic needs of the Company and the Board.\n- Independent Director candidates would, ideally, have the relevant experience and background to contribute on CLP's emerging strategic issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nomination Committee\n\n- Considers the candidates and existing Directors based on merit having regard to the experience, skills and expertise as well as the overall board diversity.\n- Makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board\n\n- Approves appointment of new Directors.\n\nNewly appointed Directors are:\n\n- subject to election by shareholders at the first general meeting following the appointment.\n\n## Existing Directors are:\n\n- subject to rotation at least once every three years; and\n- one-third of which are required to retire at the AGM and are eligible for re-election.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders\n\n- Approve the election or re-election of Directors at the Company's general meeting.\n\n## Additional Requirements\n\nFor Non-executive Directors\n\n- appointment is made through a formal letter; and\n- subject to the retirement age guideline in our Board Diversity Policy, eligible for re-election.\n\nFor Independent Non-executive Directors serving more than nine years\n\n- the Nomination Committee and the Board consider factors and discuss why the proposed Director is still independent and should be recommended for re-election; details of which will be stated in the relevant Notice of AGM.\n\n## For Proposed Director\n\n- appointment is considered as an individual resolution at the general meeting.",

        "page_content": "## Why Board Diversity is Important to CLP\n\nWe recognise that Board diversity is an essential element contributing to the sustainable development of CLP.\n\nThe CLP Board Diversity Policy was adopted by the Board in 2013. It incorporates the Code Provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, the retirement age guideline (at the age of 72) for our Non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman) and the CLP Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff. The policy was recently revised in February 2022 to highlight CLP's view on independence and the approach to receiving independent views and input from Directors.\n\nIn addition to independence and gender, our concept of diversity incorporates a number of other aspects including but not limited to age, cultural and educational background, professional experience, business perspectives, skills, knowledge, ethnicity and length of service.\n\nOur Board Diversity Policy also recognises that board diversity can be achieved without increasing the size of the Board and that a reduction in board size due to retirements without replacement can also be a way to further diversity. In 2021, our Board size slightly reduced from 14 to 13 due to the retirement of a former Executive Director.\n\nThe CLP Board Diversity Policy is available on the CLP website.\n\n## Board Composition & Diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assessment Results of Diversity\n\nThe Board is characterised by its strong independence and diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPercentage of Directors having served the Board for over 10 years slightly increased from 42% due to the resignation of a former Executive Director\n\nBoard is reasonably diverse in terms of nationality, with Directors based in Hong Kong (11), Australia (1) and India (1) where CLP has major business and operations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board Expertise\n\nTo ensure the Board continues to possess a balance of skills appropriate for the requirements of the business of the Group, an analysis of the skill set mix was considered by the Nomination Committee.\n\nThe table below highlights the breakdown of the skill set mix of our Directors and demonstrates the broad and diverse mix of experience and background relevant to CLP that the Directors bring to the Board and its Committees.\n\n| Expertise

In 2021, none of the Directors were required to withdraw from meeting in these circumstances.\n\nThe Company follows guidelines at each financial reporting period to obtain confirmations from Directors in respect of any transactions of the Company or its subsidiaries which are related to Directors or their connected entities.\n\nIn addition, identified significant related party transactions are disclosed in Note 32 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Independence\n\nAs required under the Listing Rules, the Company received written confirmations from all of the Independent Non-executive Directors regarding the independence of each of them and their immediate family members.\n\nAmong the Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company, Mr Nicholas C. Allen has held cross-directorship with Ms May Tan by serving on the boards of the Company and Link Asset Management Ltd (Link REIT). Ms May Tan stepped off the board and board committees of Link REIT on 31 January 2022.\n\nGiven that each of Mr Nicholas C. Allen and Ms May Tan plays a non-executive role and holds less than 1% of the issued shares in each of the relevant companies, the Company considers that such cross-directorship would not undermine their independence with respect to their directorships at CLP Holdings.\n\n## Our view on independence\n\nThe Company maintains the view that a Director's independence is a question of fact and this is formally recognised in the Board Diversity Policy. The Board is committed to assessing this on an ongoing basis with regard to all relevant factors concerned, including the ability to continually provide constructive challenge for management and other Directors and to express one's own views independent of management or other fellow Directors and the gravitas inside and outside the boardroom context. These attributes and desired behaviour have been demonstrated by our Independent Non-executive Directors as circumstances require.\n\n## Mechanisms for ensuring independent views and input\n\nThe Company has established channels through formal and informal means whereby Independent Non-executive Directors can express their views in an open and candid manner, and in a confidential manner, should circumstances require; these include periodic Board surveys and Board reviews, dedicated meeting sessions with the Chairman and interaction with management and other Board Members including the Chairman outside the boardroom.\n\nTaking into account all of the circumstances described in this section, the Company considers all of the Independent Non-executive Directors to be independent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of all Directors and their biographies including, if any, relationship between the members are disclosed on pages 98 to 103 and on our website.\n\n## Directors' Shareholding Interests\n\nDirectors' interests in CLP's securities as at 31 December 2021 are disclosed in the Directors' Report on page 188. All Directors have confirmed, following specific enquiry by the Company, that throughout the year ended 31 December 2021 they have complied with the required standard set out in the Model Code and our own Code for Securities Transactions. CLP's own Code for Securities Transactions is largely based on the Model Code set out in Appendix 10 of the Listing Rules and is on terms no less exacting than those in the Model Code.",

Our respect for people and diversity are embedded in CLP's Value Framework and our Board Diversity Policy has also incorporated the CLP Group Diversity and Inclusion Policy for Senior Management and Staff. The Value Framework was updated in 2020 and a number of labour-related commitments have been reinforced in the updated Value Framework.\n\nOne of the key tasks of CLP's management and staff is the successful implementation of strategy and direction as determined by the Board under the leadership of our Chairman. This includes promoting and 'living' the good corporate culture set by our Board over the years. In doing so, they must apply business principles and ethics which are consistent with those expected by the Board, CLP's shareholders and other stakeholders, and these have been documented in our Code of Conduct.\n\nA key fundamental feature of CLP's corporate governance is a culture of 'doing the Right Thing', this 'tone' is set at the top of the organisation at the Board level and is embedded throughout our Value Framework, Code of Conduct, CLP Code, and the Whistleblowing Policy.\n\n## Ongoing Monitoring and Training\n\nTo demonstrate CLP's commitment to high ethical and integrity standards and to foster the culture of making conscious decisions in doing the right thing as a company, we conducted a Group-wide Business Practice Review in 2021 (other than EnergyAustralia who will undertake this in 2022). This is a mandatory training programme for all staff, through live discussion in the training workshops, not only to refresh their understanding of the key principles in Code of Conduct and other major Group policies, but also to facilitate better application of these principles in their daily work. More than 290 sessions were held which covered approximately 6,300 employees and 1,000 contractors.\n\nIn view of the pandemic situation where organisations could potentially be more vulnerable to the heightened risk of fraud, we rolled out a mandatory Fraud Risk Awareness e-training to all CLP staff in 2020, which has now been extended to all new joiners, and has become part of the mandatory induction training programme starting in 2021. The e-training focused on the importance of identifying different forms of potential fraud, and on how CLP staff can prevent, detect, respond to, and report cases of fraud. It is also available in CLP intranet for staff to revisit anytime as they see appropriate.",

We also make selective use of independent executive assessment and coaching processes to assist with identifying individual development needs and provide input to our succession planning decisions.\n\n## Participation in Training and Continuous Professional Development of Senior Management in 2021\n\n| Senior Management      | Attending formal executive  development /   training programme   | Attending expert briefings  /   seminars / workshops /  conferences relevant to the  business or their duties   | Participating as   speakers at events   | Access to web-based  learning resources   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Mr Richard Lancaster   |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Mr Nicolas Tissot  1   |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Mr David Simmonds  2   |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Ms Quince Chong        |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Ms Eileen Burnett-Kant |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Mrs Betty Yuen         |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Mr Chiang Tung Keung   |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Mr Chan Siu Hung       |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Mr Mark Collette  3    |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n| Mr Rajiv Mishra        |                                                                  |                                                                                                                 |                                         |                                           |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1  Mr Nicolas Tissot joined the Company on 7 September 2020 and has become a member of Senior Management with effect from 1 April 2021.\n- 2  During 2021, Mr David Simmonds, the Company Secretary, served as the Vice-President, the Chairman of the Membership Committee and the Company Secretaries Panel, he also led the Competition Law Interest Group and was a member of the Investment Strategy Task Force of the Hong Kong Chartered Governance Institute.

Our Chairman, The Hon Sir Michael David Kadoorie was unable to attend the AGM due to family reasons and, Mr Philip Kadoorie, who attended the meeting at the AGM venue, read out a personal message from Chairman to the shareholders. Our CFO (then Deputy CFO) and other Directors attended the meeting online at an off-site venue.\n\nThe opportunity for shareholders to attend the AGM online and to send their questions in advance of the AGM as well as in real-time through the online platform allowed shareholders to express their views amid special circumstances.\n\n## Highlights of the 2021 Hybrid AGM\n\n- Improvement measures: both registered and non-registered shareholders could participate in the online AGM to view, submit questions and cast votes in near real-time through the online platform. To ensure the online AGM was conducted effectively, a chat response function was available on the online platform to address procedural questions from shareholders.\n- We placed a limit of 50 shareholders who could attend in person at the physical location and their attendance required confirmation through prior online registration, and a balloting process, as needed.\n- An attendance of over 200 shareholders participated in person or online.\n- A high level of votes approving the following major items:\n- The election and re-election of Directors ranging from over 94% to over 99%.\n- The adoption of the new Articles of Association (over 99%) (Amendments to the Articles of Association were made to incorporate provisions to improve the arrangements for convening and managing hybrid general meetings and to improve efficiencies for general meetings and the timeliness of the distribution of information to shareholders.)\n- The general mandate to issue new shares of up to 5% of shares in issue only, at a price not being at a discount of more than 10% to a benchmarked price (about 99%) and to repurchase shares of not more than 10% shares in issue (over 99%).\n- Through the online platform, shareholders posed various questions and all of these were addressed at the meeting.",

The most recent review was undertaken in November 2021 and the effectiveness of the Policy was confirmed. With the continuing COVID-19 situation, the manner of engagement with our shareholders will be monitored closely.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nCLP's Group Internal Audit (GIA) department plays a major role in monitoring the internal governance of the CLP Group. The head of the department, Senior Director - GIA, leads a well-resourced department of 26 highly qualified professional staff.\n\nThe Senior Director - GIA is a member of the Group Executive Committee, who reports directly to the Audit & Risk Committee and the CEO and has direct access to the Board through the Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee. The Senior Director - GIA has the right to consult the Audit & Risk Committee without reference to management.\n\n## Independent Auditor\n\nThe Group engages PwC (Certified Public Accountants and Registered Public Interest Entity (PIE) Auditor) as our external independent auditor and we regard their independence as a fundamental governance principle.\n\nHow the Group ensures the independence of the external auditor:\n\n- The lead audit partner of PwC is subject to rotation every seven years (as per The International Federation of Accountants rules on independence of external auditors).\n- The lead audit partner, after having served the Company's statutory audits in that capacity for seven years since the 2014 financial year-end audit, has retired and was replaced by a new lead audit partner, Ms Yee Shia Yuen, who did not have any prior involvement in the CLP Group audit.\n- PwC is required to give an annual confirmation on their independence.\n- The Audit & Risk Committee will assess PwC's independence in considering their re-appointment.\n\nIn addition, PwC will not be engaged to perform non-audit work unless the non-audit work meets the criteria suggested in the Listing Rules and has been pre-approved by the Audit & Risk Committee or its delegates. There must be clear efficiencies and value-added benefits to CLP from the work being undertaken by PwC, with no adverse effect on the independence of their audit work, or the perception of such independence.\n\nDuring the year, PwC provided the following audit and permissible audit related and non-audit services to the Group:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Audit                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 41          | 39          |\n| Permissible audit related and non- audit services                                                                                                                                                     |             |             |\n| Audit related services   (including Sustainability                                                                                                                                                    |             |             |\n| Report assurance, Continuing  Connected Transactions limited  assurance, limited assurance  over EnergyAustralia's  regulatory reviews and  reporting, audits of CLP's  provident funds and auditor's |             |             |\n| attestation)                                                                                                                                                                                          | 9           | 10          |\n| Non-audit services                                                                                                                                                                                    |             |             |\n| (including tax advisory and  other services)                                                                                                                                                          | 1           | 1           |\n| Total                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 51          | 50          |\n\n(For these purposes, permissible audit related and non-audit services provided by PwC include any entity under common control, ownership or management with PwC or any entity that a reasonable and informed third party having knowledge of all relevant information would reasonably conclude as part of the audit firm nationally or internationally.)\n\nThe fees of PwC and other non-principal external auditors are shown in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the fees for permissible audit related and non-audit services accounted for 18% and 2% of the total fees respectively.\n\n## Other Stakeholders\n\nGood governance requires due regard to the impact of business decisions (including impact on people, the environment and the economy), both on shareholders and on other key stakeholders.

They are therefore an essential part of an organisation's operation and governance processes. This section explains (and contains cross references) the key features of our risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## Risk Management Framework\n\nCLP's overall risk management framework is overseen by, and is the responsibility of, the Board, through its Audit & Risk Committee, and comprises four key elements.\n\n| Risk Management  Philosophy                                                                                                                                     | Risk Governance  Structure                                                                                                                                     | Risk Management  Process                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Risk  Appetite                                                                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CLP recognises that risk  management is the  responsibility of everyone  within CLP and thus it is  integrated into the  business and  decision-making process. | Clear roles and  responsibilities are  assigned to multiple layers  within the organisation.  This structure facilitates  risk identification and  escalation. | Through an integrated  top-down and bottom-up  risk review process, which  enables risks identification  and prioritisation  throughout the Group,  management maintains an  open and effective  communication channel to  enable the timely | The nature and extent of  the risks that the Group is  willing to undertake in  pursuit of its strategic and  business objectives. |\n\nThe way we manage risk is set out in the Risk Management Report on page 138.\n\n## Internal Control Framework\n\nCLP's structure of internal control is based on the internationally recognised COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) 2013 integrated framework. Our internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in achieving our strategic and business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material loss or misstatement. CLP Corporate Governance Structure is consistent with our Risk Governance Structure - see page 139.\n\nThe Board of Directors , through the Audit & Risk Committee 's review, is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness. The reviews cover management's assessment on the key business operations, changes in material risks, internal controls, audit and compliance issues.\n\nGIA provides independent assurance to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls for CLP. They adopt a risk-based approach, concentrating on areas with significant risks or where significant changes have been\n\nmade. GIA is equipped with well qualified and capable staff with access to all the data and operations of the Group.\n\nThe CEO and the Group Executive Committee have primary accountability to the Board in ensuring that robust risk management and internal control systems are established and functioning effectively. Such responsibility is discharged by exercising structured and continuous monitoring and oversight across the Group.\n\nGroup Functions establish relevant Group-wide policies and procedures, oversee the risk and control activities of Business Units relevant to their respective functions.\n\nControl Owners (Business Units, Functional Units and individuals) are primarily responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of risk management and internal control systems within his / her own area of responsibility. These systems are supported by well-defined policies and procedures, properly established and communicated, which reflect the values and corporate culture of the Group.",

Material risks and associated controls, including mitigation when needed, are continually reviewed and updated. The Board is regularly informed of significant risks that may have an impact on CLP's performance. Regular management briefings and 'deep dive' presentations are presented to the Audit & Risk Committee, as set out in the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 152.\n\nOur internal control review process continues to follow the substance of the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on internal controls over financial statements. Three times a year, management provides internal control review updates to the Audit & Risk Committee which cover the scoping of significant processes and controls, assessment on controls design and operating effectiveness. High risk key controls are required to be tested annually by management while lower risk key controls are tested on a rotational basis.

CLP aims to identify risks early so that they can be understood, managed, mitigated, transferred or avoided. This demands a proactive approach and an effective Group-wide risk management framework. The risk management framework at CLP comprises four key elements:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk Management Philosophy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLP's Risk Management Philosophy\n\nCLP recognises that risk management is the responsibility of everyone within the business, and cultivating and embedding risk awareness into the organisational culture is critical to implementing the Group's risk management framework. Risk management is therefore integrated into all business and decision-making processes, including strategy formulation, business development, business planning, capital allocation, investment decisions, internal control and day-to-day operations.\n\nCLP has clear risk management objectives:\n\n- At a strategic level , CLP focuses on the identification and management of material risks inherently associated with the pursuit of the Group's strategic and business objectives. In pursuing growth opportunities, CLP aims to optimise risk and return decisions as defined and quantified through diligent and independent review and challenge processes.\n- At an operational level , CLP aims to identify, analyse, evaluate and mitigate all operational hazards and risks. It does this to create a safe, healthy, efficient and environmentally-friendly workplace for employees and contractors while ensuring public safety and health, minimising environmental impact, as well as securing asset integrity and adequate insurance.",

In line with CLP's Value Framework and the expectations of stakeholders, the Group takes only reasonable risks that fit its strategy and capability, can be understood and managed, and do not expose the Group to:\n\n- Hazardous conditions affecting the health and safety of employees, contractors and the general public;\n- Material financial losses impacting the financial viability and strategy execution of the Group;\n- Material breaches of external regulations that could lead to fines or loss of critical operational and business licences;\n- Material damage to the Group's reputation and brand;\n- Business or supply interruptions that could lead to severe impact on the community; and\n- Severe environmental incidents.\n\nCLP has established its risk profiling criteria in line with its risk appetite to assess and prioritise each identified risk according to its consequence and its likelihood. Therefore, when assessing a risk, CLP considers non-financial consequences, as detailed in its risk appetite, in addition to financial ones.\n\n## CLP's Risk Governance Structure\n\nCLP's risk governance structure:\n\n- Facilitates risk identification and escalation while providing assurance to the Board.\n- Assigns clear roles and responsibilities and facilitates implementation with guidelines and tools.\n- Adopts the Five Lines of Assurance approach as explained below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Detailed checklists and worksheets are used to identify risks, formulate mitigation measures and assess risk levels. Material risks and associated mitigations are highlighted and discussed at the Investment Committee, chaired by the CEO.\n\n## Risk Management Integrated with Internal Control Systems\n\n- Risk management is closely linked to CLP's Integrated Framework of Internal Control. Key controls are subject to testing in order to assess their effectiveness. Details on Internal Control are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 135 to 137.\n\n## Risk Management in the Business Planning Process\n\n- As part of the annual business planning process, business units are required to identify all material risks that may impact the delivery of their business strategy and objectives. Overarching strategic risks to the Group are also reviewed. Identified risks are evaluated on the same set of risk criteria as the quarterly risk review process, and plans to mitigate the identified risks are developed. The material risks listed on pages 145 to 150 have been laid out in CLP's 2022 business planning process.",

CLP identifies, assesses and manages climate change risks alongside all other types of risk as an integral part of its Group-wide Risk Management Framework.\n\nAccording to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), climate change risks can be classified into two major categories:\n\n- Transition risks - Transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail policy, legal, technology and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change, and may pose varying levels of financial impacts, as well as reputational risk to the Group.\n- Physical Risks - Physical risks resulting from climate change can be event-driven (acute) or longer-term shifts (chronic) in climate patterns, causing direct damage to assets and indirect impact from supply chain disruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLP's reporting on climate change risk management in the 2020 Annual Report was cited as an example of good practice in the Climate Disclosure Standards Board's TCFD Good Practice Handbook (pictured), published in November 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLP recognises the wide-ranging implications of climate change, and considers climate change risks a combination of standalone risks and cross-cutting risk drivers of other material risks. As shown in the CLP's top-tier risk tables on pages 145 to 150, climate change transition risk and physical risk have respectively been identified as standalone risks and categorised under Regulatory Risk and Operational Risk. The tables also illustrate other material risks connected with either Transition or Physical risk drivers, or combinations of the two.\n\nAs with other material risks, CLP adopts the same set of risk profiling criteria in assessing climate change risks. Climate change risks are managed across the Group according to CLP's risk governance structure and risk management process, with management oversight and assurance provided to the Board. In 2021, CLP committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2050 under its updated Climate Vision 2050 strategy, which guides the Group in managing climate-related risks as well as opportunities.\n\nDetailed discussions on CLP's climate strategies are included in the Capitals chapter on page 64. Additionally, further information is available in CLP's 2021 Sustainability Report and 2021 Climate-related Disclosures Report.",

The top tier risk profile is summarised below:\n\n## Operational Risk\n\nCLP's operations are exposed to a variety of operational risks relating to Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) incidents / compliance, physical security, plant performance, data privacy, cyber security attacks on operational technology (OT) and IT systems, project delivery and extreme weather events as a result of climate change.\n\nNew COVID-19 variants including Omicron have sparked major concerns worldwide and brought further travel restrictions. The impact of the new variants on CLP's operations will continue to be closely monitored.\n\n## CLP manages operational risk by:\n\n- a)  Implementing an HSE improvement plan, involving all stakeholders, to rethink risks and build and promote a sound safety culture across the Group, as well as among contractors and sub-contractors. Group-wide initiatives on eliminating exposure to serious injuries and fatalities include the introduction of the Safety in Design framework and improvements to the incident investigation process;\n- b)  Implementing operations and systems reinforcements to maintain a high operational and emissions performance;\n- c)  Maintaining appropriate response levels and control measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- d)  Consolidating emergency response, crisis management, disaster recovery and business continuity plans with regular drills;\n- e)  Enforcing a Group-wide Project Management Governance System to facilitate the delivery of high-quality projects; and\n- f)  Introducing Group-wide cybersecurity policies and standards with appropriate controls, technologies and practices at all levels, while cultivating a cyber resilience culture across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Group Top Tier Risks - Operational     | Changes in 2021   | Additional   References     |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1.

Combined assurance includes Board oversight by the Audit & Risk Committee, management oversight by the CEO and the Group Executive Committee, independent assurance by internal audit, control and monitoring by Group functions, and risk and control ownership by business units. It should be acknowledged that CLP's risk management and internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure in achieving our strategic and business objectives, and can only provide reasonable - but not absolute - assurance against material loss or misstatement.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems during the period covered by this Annual Report. The details of the effectiveness review are described in the Corporate Governance Report on page 137, and the Audit & Risk Committee Report on page 155.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNicolas Alain Marie Tissot\n\nChief Financial Officer Hong Kong, 28 February 2022",

There is an open invitation between this Committee and the EnergyAustralia ARC for members to attend the other committee's meetings.\n\nDuring the Period, the Chairman of the Committee participated in three EnergyAustralia ARC meetings and the Chairman of EnergyAustralia ARC participated in one meeting of the Committee.\n\n## Highlights of the Committee's Work\n\nThe Committee devoted considerable time in reviewing the accounting treatment of certain key items and in monitoring some of the material risks faced by the Group.\n\nWith the challenges and changes faced by the EnergyAustralia business, the Committee paid particular attention to the carrying values of the business cash generating units at the time of finalising the half-year and annual financial statements. This was also reflected in the Key Audit Matters in the Auditor's Report. In addition, the Committee closely monitored the legal proceedings for the Iona case which resulted in a final settlement in March.\n\nThe Committee was cognisant of the material risks that the Group was facing. The topic of cybersecurity remains as a standing item for deep dive briefing and the Committee had dedicated briefings on this in the January and June Committee meetings. With the significance of EnergyAustralia's investment in a new project for the retail business, the Committee had the opportunity of understanding the background and strategy of this project while recognising that this EnergyAustralia project would be subject to the governance oversight at EnergyAustralia's level.\n\nFor the Hong Kong business, the Committee appreciated the number of major infrastructure projects that was being undertaken by the local business and the Committee received detailed briefings on the CCGT unit 2 project and the Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal project as well as the gas supply security for Hong Kong.",

The Committee considered the refreshment for the membership of the Board and Committees in both the short and medium term; having regard to a number of issues including long-serving Independent Non-executive Directors, the retirement age guideline threshold for some Directors, the skillsets required from Directors for CLP's strategic objectives, and the expectation for higher gender diversity on the Board and Board Committees. The Committee recognises that effective succession planning for the Board and Committees takes time and it involves identifying the strategic objectives for the Board and Committees, the search process and a gradual transition of the Board and Committees' membership.

The Committee paid particular attention to the proposed re-election for Sir Rod Eddington. Sir Rod, at age 72, is subject to the retirement requirement under CLP's retirement age guideline; however, as provided for under the guideline, this requirement may be waived by the Board if the Board considers such Director has the skills, experience or capabilities that cannot be replaced at the relevant time. The Committee considered this at length and endorsed for the Board's approval of the waiver of the retirement age requirement. In doing so, the Committee had due regard to the following:\n\n- Sir Rod has a unique background with in-depth experience in Hong Kong and Australia and a thorough understanding of the strategic issues concerning the CLP Group and, in particular, EnergyAustralia, which is now undergoing a period where it will need to address a number of fundamental issues and challenges for the business;\n- The Board would greatly benefit from Sir Rod's continued service on the Board at this very important juncture, with Sir Rod's insightful perspectives of the Australian business, the political and regulatory landscape and the strategic objectives of CLP and EnergyAustralia; and\n- The alternative of replacing Sir Rod with a new Independent Director to match the skillsets required for these strategic objectives would be most challenging having regard to the complexities of the Australian business and regulatory environment and the appreciation of CLP's investment thesis and approach in the Group's overseas business and EnergyAustralia.\n\nDuring 2021, Mr Geert Peeters retired as an Executive Director. On succession planning, an independent search process for potential Director candidate(s) had commenced.",

The Committee is authorised by the Board to investigate all matters that fall within its terms of reference. The objectives of the Committee are to recommend to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and on the nomination of Directors, having regard to the independence and quality of the nominees and ensuring that the nominations are fair and transparent.\n\n## Terms of Reference\n\nThe current terms of reference were adopted in January 2018 and are set out on the CLP's and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's websites.\n\n## Nomination Policy\n\nEmbedded in the Committee's Terms of Reference is the Nomination Policy for Directors. The Policy (set out below) stipulates the key nomination criteria and principles of the Company for the nomination of Directors and provides what the Committee should do in order to give effect to this Policy:\n\n- 1  review and monitor the structure, size and composition (including the skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of perspectives) of the Board on an annual basis and make recommendations on any proposed changes to the Board to complement the Company's corporate strategy;\n- 2  identify and nominate qualified individuals for appointment as additional Directors or to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise. The criteria to be adopted by the Board in considering each individual shall be their ability to contribute to the effective carrying out by the Board of its responsibilities set out in the CLP Code in particular those described in paragraphs II.B.35 and 36 of the Code;\n- 3  make recommendations to the Board on the appointment or re-appointment of Directors and succession planning for Directors, in particular, the Chairman and the CEO; and\n- 4  make recommendations to the Board with particular regard to ensuring a substantial majority of the Directors on the Board being independent of management.\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\nThe Committee will continue to play a leading role in planning for the Board's succession and refreshment. The Committee is committed to ensuring that the Board will have the appropriate level of diversity and independence and the right composition that aligns strategically with the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNicholas C.

The fees are subject to a formal independent review undertaken no less frequently than every three years. Those fees were most recently reviewed at the beginning of 2022 (the 2022 Review). The methodology adopted in the 2022 Review is the same as that used in the previous reviews and as explained to shareholders in the CLP Code.\n\nThe 2022 Review and methodology applied are summarised as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nHaving regard to the possible year-to-year fluctuations in the time spent by Non-executive Directors (based on the data CLP has collected since 2004), it has been recommended to maintain the approach of the 2019 Review by taking the average time spent by Non-executive Directors over a longer duration of three periods (i.e. nine years), rather than over the three years immediately preceding the review, in order to smooth out the effect of short-term fluctuations in workload.\n\nThe following are the key observations from the 2022 workload review over the nine-year period as against the 2019 Review:\n\n- there has been a slight increase in the working hours of the Board;\n- moderate increases were recorded in the working hours of the Audit & Risk Committee, Human Resources & Remuneration Committee, Sustainability Committee and Nomination Committee;\n- the working hours of the Finance & General Committee decreased; and\n- there was a slight decrease in the working hours of the Provident & Retirement Fund Committee.\n\nAccordingly, the indicative fees show a slight reduction in fees for the Finance & General Committee. This is driven by the reduction in the average working hours of the Committee over the nine-year period. Over the review period, this reduction can be attributed to the delivery of more succinct board papers and enhanced efficiency in the Committee's work especially from the period of 2017 onwards. Although there is a reduction in the average working hours over the nine-year period, in respect of the more recent three-year period, the working hours have increased over the preceding two-year period (for full details please refer to the 2022 Review available on the CLP website). This is in line with the expected pick up in workload for the Finance & General Committee in the 2019-2021 period and is anticipated to continue in the coming years. In these circumstances, Management considers it appropriate to hold the current fees for the Financial & General Committee unchanged.\n\nThere is also a slight decrease in the working hours of the Provident & Retirement Fund Committee, and Management propose that a nominal fee be continued to be maintained for this Committee which, in any event, is less than the indicative fees for this Committee based on its working hours.\n\nThe review methodology results in a modest increase in the proposed fees of the Audit & Risk Committee, Human Resources & Remuneration Committee, Sustainability Committee and Nomination Committee. Management considers that these increases are well justified because of the increasing demands on these Committees in recent years; for the Audit & Risk Committee, in terms of increased oversight of risk management; for the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee, in terms of succession planning (both in the ordinary course and in anticipation of the business transformation-related changes and demands such as innovation and technology); for the Sustainability Committee, in terms of the rising need to manage the longer-term emerging sustainability issues concerning the Group, in particular, on climate change; and for the Nomination Committee, in terms of the growing demand on the continuous review of the composition, refreshment and independence of the Board, the monitoring of the nomination criteria and the ongoing application of the Board Diversity Policy.\n\nThe proposed fees represent a justifiable and measurable increase on those paid between 2019 and 2021. The proposed increase in the hourly rate of HK$220 is slightly less than the increase in Hong Kong's Composite Consumer Price Index over the past three years. The increase is in line with an ongoing increase in the workload shouldered by the Board and Board Committees in recent years.\n\nWe have applied the methodology in a conservative manner - the fee review takes place every three years and the methodology takes into account past and present data, rather than any forward-looking projections. In benchmarking fees against selected companies, we have not assumed that there will be any ongoing increases in directors' fees paid by those companies.\n\nAs with the 2013, 2016 and the 2019 Reviews, it is recommended to spread the proposed increase over a period of three years from 2022 to 2024, as opposed to a full increase in the first year.",

Gale & Co (JSG), external legal advisor, and will be put for approval by our shareholders at the AGM on 6 May 2022. JSG have provided an opinion to the effect that the methodology adopted by CLP is reasonable and appropriate, has been fairly and consistently applied in all material respects and that the resulting proposed level of fees is reasonable and appropriate having regard to current corporate governance practices in Hong Kong and the UK. In this respect, CLP's approach goes beyond that required by laws or regulations in Hong Kong or the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code. Further to CLP's commitment to the adoption of a transparent methodology for determining Non-executive Directors' remuneration, the 2022 Review and the opinion of JSG on that 2022 Review are placed on

Where payments are made to the individual over more than one financial year, this is explained in the notes.\n\nTo provide a clear picture of remuneration, amounts are shown as recurring or non-recurring items. Recurring items are the normal annual remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Management while non-recurring items relate primarily to the appointment or termination of Executive Directors and Senior Management.\n\nIn the tables on page 178 and pages 185 and 186 the 'Total Remuneration' column for 2021 includes the following recurring items:\n\n- (i) base compensation, allowances & benefits paid;\n- (ii) 2021 annual incentive accrued based on previous year's Company performance and the 2020 annual incentive adjustment. The adjustment is the difference between the actual annual incentive paid in 2021 for 2020 performance and the annual incentive accrual for 2020;\n- (iii)  the 2018 long-term incentive award paid in January 2021 when the vesting conditions were satisfied (the comparative figures are the long-term incentive for 2017 paid in 2020). Approximately 1% of the increase in the value of the phantom shares portion of 2018 long-term incentive payments resulted from the change in CLP Holdings' share price between 2018 and 2020, with dividends reinvested; and\n- (iv)  provident fund contribution made.\n\nThe 'Other Payments' column includes the following non-recurring items:\n\n- (i) relocation payments for newly hired Senior Management; and\n- (ii) approved acceleration of long-term incentive payments and any contractual termination payments for departed Executive Director and Senior Management members.\n\n## Performance Outcomes for the Year\n\nIn considering performance outcomes against the balanced scorecard of measures set for the 2021 performance year, the Committee reviewed progress made against a mix of financial, operational, safety, environmental, internal control and objectives reflecting strategic priorities and long-term sustainability.\n\nIn 2020, the Committee awarded a performance outcome reflecting resilient financial and operational performance, with improved safety and major project delivery despite unprecedented external challenges.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee balanced solid financial and operational performance in continued challenging conditions, improved safety, pleasing progress on major decarbonisation projects, with the need to accelerate progress on business transformation and growth initiatives. Having considered these outcomes, the Committee decided to award a lower performance outcome than in 2020. The Committee considers that this outcome appropriately aligns management remuneration with shareholder outcomes.",

Our Policy is designed to be sustainable, aligned with shareholders and simple . Delivery of a highly-reliable supply of electricity today together with transforming our business into a Utility of the Future, is a commitment that requires long-term stewardship and a sustainable approach to remuneration. Ensuring fairness and internal equity; encouraging and rewarding appropriate behaviour while discouraging inappropriate behaviour; and balanced judgement of short- and long-term performance, aligned with shareholder outcomes, underpin this approach.\n\nFairness and internal equity are key elements of our approach. Depending on individual roles, Senior Management is responsible for a mix of businesses: a vertically-integrated regulated business in Hong Kong, a customer-focused energy business in Australia, and an independent power producer in Mainland China, India, Southeast Asia and Taiwan. We seek to fairly recognise the extent of Senior Management's assigned job responsibilities and capabilities demonstrated, and to ensure that our remuneration attracts, retains and motivates a diverse, high-performing executive team. The structure of our executive remuneration packages is assessed in terms of appropriateness to the role, and with reference to both local and international markets. We emphasise strong management development, succession planning and job mobility to fill vacancies for executive positions as we believe that a long-term career with the Group is an important asset to CLP. Consequently, external competitiveness of remuneration must be balanced with internal equity. While Senior Management pay reflects the scale and scope of their responsibilities, our policy is designed to ensure that remuneration structure and outcomes are aligned with our wider workforce, whose skills, values and commitment are essential to our success, and HR&RC decisions on executive pay outcomes are taken in the context of wider workforce considerations.\n\nSenior Management pay is structured to seek to avoid excessive risk-taking in the achievement of performance targets and is governed by and compliant with relevant regulatory frameworks. In determining incentive payments and Total Remuneration, the HR&RC considers and balances a broad range of performance indicators including financial (e.g., long-term growth in the share price and dividends), operational, safety, environmental, social, business sustainability (including responding to climate change), governance and compliance-related factors linked to CLP's strategy. Decisions on pay reflect considerations of both what was achieved and how it was achieved. The determination of performance outcomes is not formulaic, as the HR&RC believes that their overriding responsibility is to exercise judgement and responsibility, ensuring alignment between shareholders and management.",

The HR&RC strives to keep remuneration arrangements simple, clear and consistent to enable effective stakeholder scrutiny. We have maintained our Remuneration Policy in line with prior years in part on the belief that the current arrangements remain fit for purpose, are embedded into our business and are well-understood both internally and externally. Mindful of continuing external interest and debate on executive pay, we have reshaped the structure of our reporting on Remuneration Policy in order that the links between policy, strategy and performance are more clearly and simply articulated.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\n## Executive Directors and Senior Management (excluding Managing Director - EnergyAustralia)\n\nThe illustration below summarises policy design and operation for members of Senior Management.

        "page_content": "## Board's Statement on ESG\n\nThe following is a statement from the Board of Directors explaining the Board's oversight of ESG issues and how CLP approaches the management of ESG issues.\n\n## Governance structure\n\nThe CLP Board has overall responsibility for CLP's ESG reporting and sustainability, and governance of sustainability is integrated into our corporate governance structure throughout the Group. The Sustainability Committee has a primary role in overseeing the management of the Group's sustainability issues. In 2021, the Sustainability Committee's role has been strengthened with a further focus on the impact of longer-term sustainability issues on the Group's strategy. It is supported by the Sustainability Executive Committee. The Audit & Risk Committee, meanwhile, retains oversight of material risks and assurance of the ESG data. For further details on the governance structure, please see 'CLP's Approach to ESG Reporting' in the Corporate Governance Report.\n\n## How does CLP approach and manage material ESG issues?\n\nCLP regularly reviews its strategic priorities against ESG risks and opportunities to ensure they remain fit-for-purpose. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant social and economic disruption, led to myriad challenges and opportunities, and accelerated pre-existing trends.\n\nIn late 2021, CLP revised our approach to materiality by conducting our first double materiality assessment. This is based on best practice from global reporting standard setters and allows CLP to better reflect ESG risks and opportunities in its business strategy from both a financial and an impact perspective:\n\n- Financially material topics, which potentially create or erode enterprise value, are covered in this Annual Report and are for reporting purposes under the Hong Kong Stock Exchange ESG Reporting Guide. The key audience is providers of financial capital.\n- Impact material ESG topics, which reflect significant positive or negative impacts on people, the environment and the economy, are covered in the Sustainability Report. They address the concerns of a diverse range of stakeholders wanting to understand CLP's positive and negative contributions to sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA key outcome of the process was the prioritisation of four financially material topics and three impact material topics. The CLP Sustainability Executive Committee considered the financially material topics to be most likely to create or erode enterprise value. These four topics are: (i) shaping and executing the transition to net zero; (ii) pursuing growth opportunities in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area; (iii) building an agile and innovative workforce; and (iv) reinforcing resilience in a changing operating environment. Further details can be found on Sustainability as Our Business Strategy on page 22.\n\nThe assessment process was conducted by management with active executive-level participation. These topics were then presented to the Sustainability Committee for their analysis and endorsement. For further details on how other ESG issues are addressed by the Sustainability Committee, please see the Sustainability Committee Report.\n\n## Climate Vision 2050\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate change remains one of the material topics and our Climate Vision 2050 publication is a pledge from CLP on our climate action which sets out clear climate-related targets for the Group. In 2021, we strengthened our Climate Vision 2050 targets as outlined extensively in this Annual Report, the Sustainability Report and Climate-related Disclosures Report. The Board approved these long-term commitments after a thorough strategic review involving the Sustainability Committee and the Sustainability Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board recognises that climate change is one of the most material risks to CLP's business and will continue to provide oversight to ensure that the Group will continue to act in a responsible manner and will be able to pursue the opportunities that may arise from the energy transition.",

There was no purchase, sale or redemption by the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, of the Company's listed shares during the year.\n\n## Reserves\n\nDistributable reserves of the Company amounted to HK$23,671 million as at 31 December 2021 (2020: HK$24,308 million).\n\n## Bank Loans and Other Borrowings\n\nThe total borrowings (including debentures) of the Group as at 31 December 2021 amounted to HK$58,215 million (2020: HK$54,348 million). Particulars of borrowings are set out in Note 23 to the Financial Statements and on pages 67 to 73 of the Financial Capital.\n\n## Financial Assistance and Guarantees to Affiliated Companies\n\nThe financial assistance given to affiliated companies and the guarantees given for facilities granted to affiliated companies aggregated to 0.7% of the Group's total assets as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Equity-linked Agreements\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the Company did not enter into any equity-linked agreement.\n\n## Donations\n\nDonations by the Group for charitable and other purposes amounted to HK$15,085,000 (2020: HK$27,088,000).\n\n## Five-year Summary\n\nA summary of the results for the year and of the assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2021 and for the previous four financial years are on page 300. A ten-year summary is on the CLP website.\n\n## Senior Management\n\nThe biographical details of the Senior Management as at the date of this Report are set out on pages 104 and 105. Details of their remuneration are set out in the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report on page 170.\n\n## Major Customers and Suppliers\n\nSales to the Group's five largest customers together represented less than 30% of the Group's total turnover during the year. Purchases from the Group's five largest suppliers, in aggregate, accounted for 44.76% of the Group's total purchases during the year and a breakdown of the purchases (as a percentage of the Group's total purchases) from each of the five largest suppliers are set out below in descending order:\n\n- 1 11.95% from Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in which the Group has no economic interest. AEMO is the administrator and operator of the Australian energy market, from whom electricity is bought to supply EnergyAustralia group customers and to whom electricity is sold from EnergyAustralia group generators (as market participants, EnergyAustralia group entities are members of AEMO but do not hold any economic interest in AEMO).\n- 2 10.17% from Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company, Limited (GNPJVC) which is 25% owned by the Group. GNPJVC owns Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS), and CLP Power Hong Kong, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the largest electricity supplier in Hong Kong, purchases 80% of GNPS's output for supply of electricity to its customers in Hong Kong.\n- 3 8.71% from PetroChina International South China Co., Ltd. (PCISC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from PCISC for its electricity generation.\n- 4 8.36% from CNOOC China Limited (CNOOC) in which the Group has no interest. CAPCO purchases natural gas from CNOOC for its electricity generation.\n- 5 5.57% from Ausgrid Operator Partnership (Ausgrid) in which the Group has no interest. EnergyAustralia pays the distribution charges to Ausgrid which owns and operates the electricity distribution network that provides services to customers located in Sydney, the Central Coast and Hunter regions of NSW.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, none of the Directors, their close associates or substantial shareholders of the Company had any interest in those suppliers other than their indirect interests in GNPJVC, which interests arose from the Group's interest in GNPJVC and the Group's approximate 0.28% shareholding interest in CGN Power Co., Ltd. (the listed entity of which GNPJVC is a subsidiary).",

        "page_content": "## Directors\n\nAs at the date of this Report, the Directors of the Company, who held their office for the full year ended 31 December 2021, together with their biographical details are set out on pages 98 to 103 of this Annual Report. Details of Directors' remuneration are set out in the Human Resources & Remuneration Committee Report on page 170.\n\nMr Geert Peeters stepped down as an Executive Director on 31 July 2021 due to health reasons. Mr Peeters confirmed that he had no disagreement with the Board and that he was not aware of any matter in relation to his retirement that should be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the Company.\n\nUnder the Company's Articles of Association, Directors are subject to retirement by rotation and re-election at the AGM. In accordance with Article 119 of the Company's Articles of Association, Mrs Zia Mody, Ms May Tan, Mr Philip Kadoorie, Sir Rod Eddington and Mr William Mocatta will retire by rotation at the 2022 AGM.\n\nSir Rod Eddington, who has served the Board for more than 16 years, reached the age of 72 before the 2022 AGM. The Board, based on the recommendation and endorsement of the Nomination Committee (please see the Nomination Committee Report on page 166), decided to waive the retirement age guideline in CLP Board Diversity Policy in relation to the re-election of Sir Rod Eddington; and concluded that Sir Rod is still independent and should be recommended for re-election. Details of the Board's considerations are included in the Notice of the 2022 AGM.\n\nAll the retiring Directors, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. None of the Directors offering themselves for re-election at the 2022 AGM has a service contract with the Company which is not determinable by the Company within one year without payment of compensation.\n\n## Directors' Interests in Transactions, Arrangements or Contracts\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021, none of the Directors or his / her connected entity had directly or indirectly any material interest in transactions, arrangements or contracts of significance entered into by the Group.\n\n## Alternate Director\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021 and up to the date of this Report (the Period), Mr Andrew Brandler is alternate to Mr William Mocatta.\n\n## Directors of Subsidiaries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe names of all directors who have served on the boards of the subsidiaries of the Company during the Period are available on the CLP website.\n\n## Permitted Indemnity Provisions\n\nDuring the Period, the Company has in force indemnity provisions as permitted under the relevant statutes for the benefit of the Directors (including former Directors) of the Company or its associated companies. The permitted indemnity provisions are provided for in the Company's Articles of Association and in the Group-wide directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company in respect of potential liability and costs associated with legal proceedings that may be brought against the Directors of the Company.\n\n## Continuing Connected Transactions\n\nChina Southern Power Grid International (HK) Co., Limited (CSG HK) (for reference, China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd. (CSG) and its subsidiaries, collectively, the CSG Group) is a connected person of CLP Holdings (at the subsidiary level) by virtue of CSG HK being a substantial shareholder of CAPCO, a subsidiary of CLP Holdings. Accordingly, ongoing transactions entered into between members of the CSG Group and members of the CLP Group constitute continuing connected transactions (CCTs) for CLP Holdings under Chapter 14A of the Listing Rules.\n\nUnder the Listing Rules, the Group's CCTs relating to the power purchase arrangements with the CSG Group are required to be subject to an annual aggregate cap determined by the Company, and for 2021, this was HK$1,522 million. The annual aggregate cap was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2020 and subsequently disclosed in the announcement dated 4 January 2021. The project level caps of the CCTs for 2021 set out in the table on pages 192 to 203 are for reference only and were used to derive the annual aggregate cap of HK$1,522 million.\n\nOther details of the CCTs, which are required to be disclosed pursuant to Rules 14A.49 and 14A.71 of the Listing Rules, are also set out in the same table. The considerations for 2021, unless otherwise stated, represented the actual transaction values of the relevant CCTs in the full twelve months of 2021.",

To achieve this objective, it is always our aim to present the financial information of CLP as clearly and concisely as possible. This overview helps you understand how information is organised and presented in our financial statements. Hopefully, this will bring you a more insightful reading experience.\n\n## Accounting Mini-series\n\nWe believe that understanding financial statements is a right, not a privilege. To help those unfamiliar with accounting terms read our financial statements, we have developed an Accounting Mini-series to explain topical and difficult accounting concepts in a way that is easier to understand. A number of topics have been discussed since 2007, the content of which can be found in our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our accounting mini-series\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFinancial statements are prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS). You do not need to be familiar with all the requirements of HKFRS because the accounting policies which are significant and relevant to the Group are disclosed in the financial statements. The disclosures include specific principles and procedures selected and applied by management in preparing the financial statements, as well as the methods, measurement basis and procedures to account for the transactions.\n\nLook for light gold boxes\n\n## Tips & Hints\n\nTips & Hints are our initiatives to facilitate you to understand the content of a particular disclosure or complicated accounting concepts or terms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLook for light bulb\n\n## Essential Financial Statements\n\nFinancial statements start with summaries of the financial position, performance and changes in resources of the Group. These summaries are presented in three essential financial statements with different objectives as shown in the diagram. The relationships between these statements and the interactions with the Group's stakeholders are set out in our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n03\n\n04\n\n05\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nManagement makes judgements and estimates in preparing the financial statements, some of which will have a significant effect on the reported results and financial position. HKAS 1 specifies that an entity shall disclose (1) the key judgements that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised; and (2) the assumptions and other sources of estimation uncertainty at period end that have a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities within the next financial year. You should pay attention to our disclosures under 'critical accounting estimates and judgements' which help you assess CLP's financial position and performance and understand the sensitivities to changes in assumptions.\n\nLook for gold boxes\n\n01",

Therefore, we are progressively phasing out coal for power generation while investing in renewable and other non-carbon emitting energy, as well as developing other streams of business, including power transmission, distribution and retail; and energy and infrastructure services.\n\nThis global trend of transitioning towards a low carbon economy, if not properly managed, could challenge the financial stability of companies, and it has resulted in the inclusion of climate change as one of the key risks reported by most organisations. No matter this, the accounting standard does not refer explicitly to climate-related matters, however these may affect the financial statements in various areas. One of the affected areas is related to the estimation of the useful life and the residual value of an asset.\n\nIn this accounting mini-series, we will check out what factors shall be considered in the determination and estimation of the useful life and the residual value of an asset and how climaterelated risks may affect the decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What is useful life?\n\nUseful life is defined as the period over which the company expects the asset to be available for use, or the number of production or similar units expects to be obtained from the asset. It is typically referred to as the length of time the asset can reasonably be used to generate income and be of benefit to the company, and therefore may be shorter than the design life of the asset.\n\nAs the useful life of an asset is an accounting estimate and the underlying assumptions may change over time, the accounting standard requires companies to review the estimated useful life of the assets at least every financial year end.  The change in the estimated useful life of an asset affects the amount of depreciation recognised each year.\n\nIn the past, when reviewing or determining estimated useful lives, management mostly focused on existing guidelines in the accounting standard. Nowadays, with the evolving trends in climate change, climate-related factors shall also be taken into consideration.  Details of both general and climate-related factors are set out in the adjacent table.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus, residual values take account of changes in prices up to the reporting date, but not of expected future changes. Residual values are not based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition of an asset.\n\nAn asset is depreciated to its residual value, hence a change in the residual value affects its depreciation expense. Same as with the useful life, as uncertainty is associated with the estimates, the residual value of an asset is to be reviewed, as a minimum, at each financial year end. The common approaches to derive the residual value are set out in the adjacent table.\n\n## Approaches\n\n| Insignificant or no value                                                                      | Comparables Basis                                                                                           | Company's policy                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A very efficient method  that simplifies the  depreciation calculation.                        | An objective approach,  more defensible.                                                                    | Facilitates management  evaluation of the  performance of the assets  in the same class.                               |\n| Cons                                                                                           | Cons                                                                                                        | Cons                                                                                                                   |\n| Changes in the estimated  residual value could  cause volatility in the  depreciation expense. | Not all assets have  comparables in a  well-organised market,  including specific assets  like power plant. | Less supportive approach.

Previous periods are not adjusted for changes in estimates.\n\nA significant reduction in the estimated useful life of an asset may also indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is impaired as the period of income generation would be reduced significantly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What to disclose?\n\nA change in estimates affect the depreciation expense for the current period as well as for each future period until the end of the asset's useful life.  The company shall disclose the nature and amount of the change in these estimates.\n\nThe accounting standard does require disclosure of climaterelated matters, including the exposure of the value of the assets to climate-related risks that could result in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts within the next financial year and / or could influence investors' decisionmaking process.

In recent years, management has paid special attention and consideration to climate-related matters during the revision of useful lives and residual values of the generation assets.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Group Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nKey audit matters identified in our audit are summarised as follows:\n\n- Unbilled retail revenue;\n- The carrying values of EnergyAustralia's energy retail business and generation business, and Apraava Energy's Jhajjar power station;\n- Fixed asset accounting and the calculation of the Scheme of Control permitted return;\n- Recoverability of trade receivables; and\n- Asset retirement obligations (AROs).\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Unbilled retail revenue\n\nRefer to note 2 to the Group Financial Statements\n\nRetail electricity and gas revenues are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the customers. Revenues are measured on the basis of periodic cycle meter readings and include an estimated accrual for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group totalled HK$3,186 million as at 31 December 2021.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power Hong Kong) calculates unbilled revenue using estimates including: consumption quantity based on the electricity sent-out adjusted by loss factors, the pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors.\n\nEnergyAustralia Holdings Limited (EnergyAustralia) calculates unbilled retail revenue based on the electricity purchased and the applicable tariffs for the mass market customer segment, as well as the actual meter readings and the contracted rates for commercial and industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because the calculation of unbilled retail revenue involves a high degree of estimation.\n\nOur procedures in relation to unbilled revenue included:\n\n- Understanding of and testing the key controls in place to determine the estimate of unbilled revenue for both CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia;\n- Testing the volume of electricity sent-out by CLP Power Hong Kong to supporting information;\n- Assessing the reasonableness of estimates by comparing them against historical trends;\n- Testing the volume of electricity purchased by EnergyAustralia from the wholesale electricity market to the underlying Australian Energy Market Operator invoices on a sample basis and reconciling the total purchase volumes to revenue volumes; and\n- Understanding the estimates made relating to loss factors and tariffs used in determining the level of unbilled revenue for both CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia and assessing their reasonableness by comparing them against historical trends and against the weighted average tariff for prices.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the Group's unbilled revenue amount is supported by the available evidence.",

These are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe key estimates and assumptions used in EnergyAustralia's generation business value in use calculation include a pre-tax discount rate, forward electricity pool prices, generation volumes, retail volumes, gas prices, long term assumptions around market movements, growth rates and forecasted operating costs.\n\nEnergyAustralia's generation business value in use model indicates minimal headroom. Any adverse shift in a key assumption is likely to result in a potential impairment.\n\nDuring 2021 management determined it is unlikely that the power purchase agreements with the offtakers at Apraava Energy Private Limited (Apraava Energy)'s Jhajjar power station will be renewed after their expiry in 2037.\n\nAn impairment test for Jhajjar power station was performed using a value in use calculation and an impairment provision for fixed assets of HK$330 million was recognised as at 31 December 2021. The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation include a pre-tax discount rate and the time period of the power purchase agreement.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter, because inputs to the value in use models require significant management judgements and a high degree of estimation.

This includes fixed assets and leasehold land relating to CLP Power Hong Kong and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) (together the SoC Companies) (SoC fixed assets) which are the base used in the calculation of the permitted return under the Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement.\n\nThe annual permitted return is 8% of the SoC Companies' average net fixed assets. If the gross tariff revenue in a period is less than or exceeds the total of the SoC operating costs, the permitted return and the taxation charges, such deficiency shall be deducted from, or such excess shall be added to, the Tariff Stabilisation Fund (TSF). In any period, the amount of deduction from or addition to the TSF is recognised as a revenue adjustment to the extent that the return and charges under the SoC are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because of the significance of the balance and its importance to the SoC Companies. The accuracy of SoC fixed asset additions, disposals and depreciation charges is important to ensure the SoC fixed asset balance is appropriate and the permitted return is calculated correctly.\n\nOur procedures in relation to the Group's SoC fixed assets and the calculation of the SoC permitted return included:\n\n- Assessing the control environment and testing controls over SoC fixed assets additions, disposals and depreciation charges;\n- Testing the SoC fixed asset additions in the year to supporting evidence on a sample basis and assessing whether the items have been appropriately capitalised;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of SoC capital accruals made by management for large projects by agreeing assumptions to audit evidence from the Group's vendors;\n- Assessing the estimated useful lives of the SoC fixed assets for compliance with the SoC;\n- Testing depreciation charges by performing depreciation reasonableness tests;\n- Obtaining management's reconciliation of SoC fixed assets from the opening balance at the beginning of the year to the closing balance at the end of the year and reconciling this to the general ledger and supporting records;\n- Recalculating the SoC permitted return for the year; and\n- Recalculating the SoC adjustment to revenue for the year.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the Group's SoC fixed asset accounting and the SoC permitted return calculation are supported by the available evidence.",

The offtakers for the Group's other generation businesses are mainly a small number of state grid operators. The Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nExpected credit losses in CLP Power Hong Kong are close to zero as the trade receivables are mostly secured by cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers and have no recent history of default.\n\nEnergyAustralia has trade receivables of HK$5,429 million at 31 December 2021 against which provisions for expected credit losses of HK$987 million are held. Management estimated the level of expected losses, by assessing future cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a probability weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling historical credit loss experience by customer segment, geographical region, tenure and type of customer and applying that weighting to the receivables held at year end. The impact of economic factors, both current and future, is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from customers.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had total receivables of HK$2,302 million relating to unpaid Renewable National Subsidies in its Mainland China business. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.\n\nApraava Energy's renewable projects have trade receivables of HK$883 million of which HK$809 million are past due at 31 December 2021. Management has assessed the recoverability of past due amounts and concluded that the expected credit loss is close to zero as there is no recent history of default and continuous payments are received.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because of the magnitude of the trade receivables balance and the significant judgement applied in assessing the allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nOur procedures in relation to trade receivables included:\n\n- Testing controls over the billing and collection cycles in CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia;\n- Testing the system calculated trade receivables ageing analysis used to assess the recoverability of receivables in CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia;\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the credit loss provisioning methodologies used by the Group;\n- Assessing the estimates used to determine the expected credit losses by considering cash collection performance against historical trends and assessing the reasonableness of forward-looking factors included in the expected credit loss model;\n- Reviewing the allocation of deposits to customer balances as a part of CLP Power Hong Kong's expected credit loss assessment;\n- Reviewing the accuracy of management's judgements by comparing historical provisions against actual write-offs;\n- Reviewing minutes of the boards of directors' meetings relating to the recoverability of trade receivables;\n- Discussion with management to understand the nature and the judgement involved in their determination that the expected credit loss on unpaid Renewable National Subsidies is close to zero, assessing the regulatory eligibility for the Group's projects and considering subsidies collected to-date; and\n- Discussion with management to understand the nature and the judgement involved in estimating the expected credit loss provision on trade receivables from the state grid operators of Apraava Energy's renewable projects and corroborating with correspondence with the customers.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that management's assessments of the recoverability of trade receivables are supported by the available evidence.",

Estimating the amount and timing of the obligation requires significant judgement. Management has assessed the Group's obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure dates.\n\nManagement's key ARO judgements are as follows:\n\nThe Group's ARO provision of HK$2,950 million mainly relates to land remediation and decommissioning of generation assets in Australia. The provisions are based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using internally determined end of plant lives. Other significant judgements also include the timing of the asset removal and costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and groundwater, water usage and technological developments.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong expects that its transmission and distribution network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers and considers it remote that the network will be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore, AROs have not been recognised for transmission and distribution assets.\n\nCAPCO will retire the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak 'A' Station (CPA) between 2022 to 2025. Management considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered by the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC as at 31 December 2021.\n\nNo provision for AROs has been recognised for the other generation units of CAPCO as the removal of CAPCO's other fossil-fuel generation units is possible and it is expected that should such obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nThis is a Key Audit Matter because significant judgement is required in determining whether an ARO exists and estimating the amount and timing of the obligation.\n\nOur procedures in relation to AROs included:\n\n- Assessing the appropriateness of the Group's accounting policy;\n- Evaluating management's judgement that it is remote that the Hong Kong transmission and distribution network would be removed from the existing land sites; it is probable that the CPA units will be removed; and it is possible but not probable that CAPCO's other fossilfuel generation units may be removed at some point in time in the future;\n- Assessing management's judgements as to whether a contractual or constructive obligation exists based on the respective power purchase agreements, lease agreements, local laws and regulations and past practice;\n- Assessing the independence, objectivity and competence of management's external experts involved in respect of the future cost estimates for those assets where a provision has been recognised; and\n- Testing the appropriateness of management's estimates of future costs, the timing of payments and the discount rates where management has concluded that a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nBased on the work performed, we found that the ARO provisions are supported by the available evidence.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with HKSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Group Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Group Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.",

        "page_content": "## Significant Accounting Policies\n\nSignificant accounting policies are included in the corresponding notes to the financial statements or set out below.\n\n## 1. Basis of Preparation\n\nThe Company, CLP Holdings Limited, and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Group in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS) issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) and requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap.622).\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with HKFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are especially significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in relevant notes to the financial statements.\n\n## 2. Changes in Significant Accounting Policies\n\n- (A)  Amendments of standards first time adopted in 2021\n\nThe Group has initially adopted Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to HKFRS 9, HKAS 39, HKFRS 7, HKFRS 4 and HKFRS 16) from 1 January 2021. The amendments provide practical reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative risk-free benchmark rate (the 'Reform').\n\nUp to the reporting date, no derivative or non-derivative financial instruments of the Group for which the benchmark rate had been replaced with an alternative benchmark rate. The amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Reform also has no material impact on interest rate risk management strategy of the Group.\n\nNegotiations with counterparties are ongoing to evaluate the appropriate changes and resetting of rates where necessary. If the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group will update the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the Reform.\n\nThe Phase 2 amendments also provide a series of temporary exceptions from certain hedge accounting requirements when a change required by the Reform occurs to a hedged item and / or hedging instrument that permits the hedging relationship to be continued without interruption. The Group will apply the following reliefs as and when uncertainty arising from the Reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and amount of the interest rate benchmarkbased cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument:\n\n- the Group will amend the designation of a hedging relationship to reflect changes that are required by the Reform without discontinuing the hedging relationship; and\n- when a hedged item in a cash flow hedge is amended to reflect the changes that are required by the Reform, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve will be deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows are determined.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Changes in Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transition to Phase 2 of the Reform\n\nThe Group's assessment of primary exposure to the Reform is related to the debt related cash flow and fair value hedges with cross currency interest rate swaps and / or interest rate swaps based on hedged risk of US dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). At 31 December 2021, it is still not certain when hedged items and hedging instruments will be amended to alternative interest rates, or how this will change the fair values and cash flows on these instruments, which casts uncertainty on the prospective assessment of the effectiveness of hedge accounting. Therefore, in assessing the hedge effectiveness requirements on a forward-looking basis, the Group has assumed that US dollar LIBOR interest rates are not altered by the Reform and has not discontinued the hedges.\n\nThe Group has established a project team to manage the transition for any of its contracts that could be affected. Fallback clauses have been introduced to the Group's key contracts as a mitigation measure.\n\nThe Group assumes that cash flows associated with designated hedge relationships will continue to be highly probable if LIBOR is replaced with an alternative interest rate. Outstanding interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of HK$5,773 million equivalent are impacted by the Reform as at 31 December 2021. These swaps have been designated as hedging instruments to hedge against same notional amount of loans as the hedged items. 56% of that notional amount will mature after 30 June 2023 when the Group's applicable US dollar LIBOR rates will either cease or no longer be representative immediately after that date.\n\n## (B)  Amendments to standards effective after 2021\n\nThe following amendments to standards, which may be applicable to the Group, have been issued and are effective after 2021. The Group has not elected to early adopt these amendments in 2021. The adoption of these amendments is not expected to have any significant impact on the results or the financial position of the Group.\n\n- Amendments to HKFRS 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n- Amendments to HKFRS 9 Fees in the '10 per cent' Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\n- Amendments to HKFRS 10 and HKAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n- Amendments to HKAS 1 and HKFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n- Amendments to HKAS 8 Definition of Accounting Estimates\n- Amendments to HKAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n- Amendments to HKAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use\n- Amendments to HKAS 37 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\n- HK Interpretation 5 (2020) Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification by the Borrower of a Term Loan that Contains a Repayment on Demand Clause",

        "page_content": "## 3. Consolidation and Equity Accounting\n\n## (A)  Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries up to 31 December and include the Group's interests in joint ventures and associates on the basis set out in (B) below.\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Where necessary, to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\n## (B)  Joint ventures and associates\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control nor joint control over the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures / associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of postacquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income, until the date on which joint control or significant influence ceases. Distributions received from an investee reduce the carrying amounts of the investments.\n\n## (C)  Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control (as explained in (B) above), whereby the Group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. When the Group undertakes its activities under a joint operation, the Group as a joint operator recognises its direct right to, and its share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the joint operation. They are incorporated in the financial statements under appropriate headings.\n\n## (D)  Change in ownership interests\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are treated as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received, and the reattribution of other comprehensive income to non-controlling interests are recognised in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Group.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of a loss of control, joint control or significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purpose of subsequent accounting for the retained interest as a joint venture, associate or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are reclassified to profit or loss. Gains or losses on disposals are recognised in profit or loss.",

Consolidation and Equity Accounting (continued)\n\n## (D)  Change in ownership interests (continued)\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture or associate is reduced, it is possible that joint control or significant influence is retained or a joint venture becomes an associate. As the Group continues to apply the equity method under both cases, the retained interest is not remeasured. However, a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income of the investment is reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA quick guide to the classification of equity investments:\n\nControl \uf0d2 Subsidiary Joint control \uf0d2 Joint venture / joint operation Significant influence \uf0d2 Associate Less than significant influence \uf0d2 Equity investment\n\n## 4. Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nNon-financial assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation. They are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and, in any case, at least annually. Non-financial assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units (CGUs)). Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of an asset or a CGU less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nAn impairment loss recognised in prior years for an asset other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there is a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of an asset. A reversal of the impairment loss is limited to the asset's carrying amount (net of accumulated amortisation or depreciation) that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.\n\n## 5. Inventory\n\nInventory comprises stores and fuel and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis. Net realisable value is determined on the basis of anticipated sales proceeds less estimated selling expenses.\n\n## 6. Renewable Energy Products\n\nRenewable energy and energy efficiency schemes operate through the creation, trade and surrender of energy products. Renewable energy certificates are recognised upon the risks and rewards being transferred to the Group and are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated on a weighted average basis.\n\n## 7. Employee Benefits\n\n## (A)  Defined contribution plans\n\nThe Group operates and / or participates in a number of defined contribution plans. The assets of these plans are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The pension plans are funded by payments from employees and by participating companies of the Group, and provide benefits linked to contributions and investment returns on the plans. The Group has no further legal or constructive payment obligations if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefit relating to employee service in the current and prior periods, once the contributions have been paid.",

Employee Benefits (continued)\n\n## (A)  Defined contribution plans (continued)\n\nForfeited contributions (by employers on behalf of employees who leave the scheme prior to vesting fully in such contributions) are not used to offset existing contributions but are credited to a reserve account of that provident fund, and are available for distribution at the discretion of the relevant employers.\n\nContributions to the defined contribution plans are recognised as expenses in the year to which the contributions relate, except to the extent that they are capitalised as part of the cost of qualifying assets.\n\n## (B)  Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group, through its subsidiaries, operates funded defined benefit plans for qualifying employees in Australia and India. Under the plans, the employees are entitled to lump sum benefits on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. The level of benefits provided depends on employees' years of service and final average salary. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice in each country.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe defined benefit asset recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the surplus of the fair value of plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information of our defined benefit plans can be found in Note 17(c).\n\n## (C)  Incentive bonus and employee leave entitlement\n\nProvisions are made for the estimated liability for incentive bonus and employee leave entitlement as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period, where there is a contractual obligation or past practice that has created a constructive obligation.\n\n## 8. Foreign Currency Translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Hong Kong dollar, which is the Group's presentation currency.\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies by using the exchange rates at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nFor subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that have a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency for the purpose of consolidation, assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period, and income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income presented are translated at the average exchange rates for the reporting period (unless this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the date of the transactions). All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and as a separate component of equity. Reclassifications of gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss are translated by using the exchange rate at the date of reclassification. The remaining reserve balances are translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period. Any exchange differences arising from these are taken to retained profits directly.",

Foreign Currency Translation (continued)\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated using the closing rates at the end of the reporting period.\n\nUpon disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary / loss of joint control over a joint venture / loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIn the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is re-attributed to non-controlling interests and is not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals (that is, reductions in the Group's ownership interest in a joint venture or associate that do not result in the Group losing joint control or significant influence) the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities are assets to be received and liabilities to be paid in fixed amounts. For example, a trade receivable is a monetary asset (the amount to be received is fixed) but a fixed asset is not a monetary asset because it is uncertain how much you will receive if the fixed asset is sold.\n\nAn entity can have both functional currency and presentation currency, however, a consolidation group can only have presentation currency but not functional currency. This is because presentation currency is a matter of choice but functional currency is based on the different primary economic environment in which each group entity operates.\n\n## 9. Leases\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. A contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset if the customer has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nFor the Group as a lessor, leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of an underlying asset to the customer, are classified as operating lease arrangements. The respective lease assets are included in the financial statements according to their nature. Operating lease payments which vary with operation parameters are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.\n\nFor the Group as a lessee, the Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets which are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The Group recognises lease liabilities representing the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Financial Statements\n\n## 1. General Information\n\nThe Company is a limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The principal activity of the Company is investment holding, and the principal activities of the subsidiaries are generation and supply of electricity in Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia and India, and investment holding of power projects in Mainland China, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.\n\nThe financial operations of the Company's major subsidiaries, CLP Power Hong Kong Limited (CLP Power Hong Kong) and Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO) (collectively referred to as SoC Companies), are governed by a SoC Agreement entered into with the Hong Kong Government. Our electricity business in Hong Kong is therefore also referred to as the SoC business. The main features of the current SoC are summarised on pages 297 and 298, which are unaudited.\n\nThese financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2022.\n\n## 2. Revenue\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n- (A)  Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenues from sales of electricity and gas are recognised when electricity and gas are supplied to and consumed by the customers. Revenues are measured at the amounts billed to the customers based on the periodic cycle meter readings and the estimated accruals for the value of electricity and gas consumed from the meter reading date to the end of the reporting period ('unbilled revenue').\n\n## (B)  Other revenue\n\nRevenue from power purchase agreements represents operating lease income comprising capacity charge and energy charge. Capacity charge is recognised to the extent that capacity has been made available to the offtakers during the year. Energy charge is recognised when electricity is supplied.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Unbilled Retail Revenue\n\nThe Group records revenues from retail energy sales using the accrual accounting method. In Hong Kong, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated using estimates including consumption quantity based on electricity sent-out adjusted by loss factors, pattern of residential and non-residential consumption, weather and certain other factors. In Australia, the unbilled retail revenue is calculated based on the electricity purchased and applicable tariffs for the mass market customers, as well as actual meter readings and contracted rates for commercial and industrial customers. The amount is adjusted for physical energy loss and other measurable factors. Unbilled retail revenue of the Group (included in trade and other receivables) totalled HK$3,186 million at 31 December 2021 (2020: HK$3,478 million).",

Segment Information\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision-maker of the Group. In accordance with the Group's internal organisation and reporting structure, the operating segments are based on geographical regions.\n\nSegment revenue is based on the geographical region in which the electricity is generated and / or services are rendered. Segment capital additions represent the total costs incurred during the year to acquire fixed assets and other segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, corporate assets, and the Company's liquid funds and borrowings.\n\nSubstantially all the principal activities of the Group in each region are for the generation and supply of electricity which are managed and operated on an integrated basis.\n\nThe Group operates, through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, in five major geographical regions - Hong Kong, Mainland China, Australia, India and Southeast Asia and Taiwan.",

Operating Profit (continued)\n\nNotes:\n\n- (a) Retirement benefits costs for the year amounted to HK$652 million (2020: HK$606 million), of which HK$142 million (2020: HK$144 million) was capitalised.\n- (b) KPMG India has been the statutory auditor of Apraava Energy Private Limited (Apraava Energy) and its subsidiaries (Apraava Energy group) since April 2017. The Group does not regard KPMG India as a principal auditor of the Group given the relative small quantum of the audit fees, which reflect the scale of operations of Apraava Energy group. Our policy with regard to non-principal auditors for providing non-audit services is to ensure that, within country, the non-audit fees are not paid out of proportion to the audit fees so as to compromise in-country independence. The figure of audit related and non-audit services represented KPMG India's fees charged to Apraava Energy group. Other KPMG offices have also provided services to our businesses in other regions which amounted to HK$14 million during the year (2020: HK$16 million).\n- (c) Permissible audit related and non-audit services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers comprised Sustainability Report limited assurance, Continuing Connected Transactions limited assurance, limited assurance over EnergyAustralia's regulatory reviews and reporting, audits of CLP's provident funds, auditor's attestation and other advisory services.\n- (d) During the year, management's view on the long-term outlook of Jhajjar Power Station (Jhajjar) has changed. In particular, management viewed it unlikely that Jhajjar's PPAs with the offtakers would be renewed after their expiry in 2037. An impairment test for Jhajjar was performed and an impairment provision for fixed assets of HK$330 million (Rs3,145 million) (after tax: HK$247 million or Rs2,353 million) was recognised as at 31 December 2021 (2020: nil). The recoverable amount tested for impairment has been determined based on a value in use calculation. An estimated pre-tax discount rate of 11.13% was used in estimating Jhajjar's value in use. In forecasting cash flows, management has restricted the time period of the PPAs. Management does not consider that reasonably possible changes in assumptions would have a material impact on the recoverable amount.\n- (e) During June 2021, exceptionally heavy rainfall was recorded throughout the Latrobe Valley region where the Yallourn coal-fired power station and mine are located. The rain resulted in heightened water flows through the Morwell River Diversion (MRD) which runs through the Yallourn mine site. While there was no flooding in the mine, cracks were discovered in the MRD structures. Examination of the extent of the damage to the MRD along with potential rectification options is being progressed and is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Total expenditure of HK$452 million (A$78 million) (after tax: HK$316 million or A$54 million) was recognised for immediate repairs and damage assessment. At 31 December 2021, although longer-term rectification works were still dependent on the outcome following completion of dewatering assessment activities and the respective agreement with the government, no material outflow of economic benefit was expected.\n- (f) Upon the financial close of Vung Ang II, a legacy coal-fired project in Vietnam, in November 2021, the Group received the contingent and remaining consideration from the sale of its entire interest in a joint venture, OneEnergy Asia Limited, and a gain of HK$307 million (after tax: HK$249 million) was recognised.\n\n## 6. Finance Costs and Income\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nBorrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred, except to the extent that they are capitalised when they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset which necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use.\n\nInterest and other finance income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.",

Fixed Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the fixed asset. Cost may also include transfer from equity of any gains / losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of fixed assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. For any asset replacement, the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nDepreciation of fixed assets is calculated, using the straight-line method, to allocate their costs to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of the fixed assets are set out below:\n\n|                                                                           | SoC fixed assets   | Non-SoC fixed assets   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| Freehold land                                                             | not applicable     | not depreciable        |\n| Cable tunnels                                                             | 100 years          | 30 years               |\n| Buildings and civil structures at power stations                          | 35 years           | 20 - 50 years          |\n| Ash lagoon                                                                | 35 years           | 20 - 40 years          |\n| Other buildings and civil structures                                      | 60 years           | 10 - 60 years          |\n| Generating plants                                                         | 25 - 45 years *    | 10 - 41 years          |\n| Overhead lines (33kV and above)                                           | 60 years           | 20 - 40 years          |\n| Overhead lines (below 33kV)                                               | 45 years           | 18 - 20 years          |\n| Cables                                                                    | 60 years           | 10 - 30 years          |\n| Switchgear and transformers                                               | 50 years           | 15 - 35 years          |\n| Substation miscellaneous                                                  | 25 years           | 15 - 20 years          |\n| Meters                                                                    | 15 years           | 10 - 15 years          |\n| Other equipment, furniture and fittings, motor vehicles and marine crafts | 5 - 10 years       | 2 - 30 years           |\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. For plant under construction, no depreciation is provided until the construction is completed and the assets are ready for their intended use. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The gain or loss on disposal of a fixed asset is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant asset, and is recognised in profit or loss.",

Fixed Assets (continued)\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\n- (A)  Assessment of the Carrying Value of Generation Assets in Australia\n\nGiven continued changes in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in Australia and changes in the supply and demand equilibrium, risk is introduced in market modelling which heightens the criticality of this judgement area. As part of making these critical judgements, risks do exist in the assumptions made around supply and demand with regard to the Group's generation assets in Australia. In certain circumstances, where demand expectations and supply side responses vary substantially from the assumptions made, particularly in regard to the transition to renewable energy sources and uses, significant changes in the value of the assets could eventuate.\n\nWhen determining the recoverable amount of the generation assets, scenarios are produced which reflect a range of economic conditions that could exist over the life of the CGU. The scenarios consider a broad range of outcomes including increased renewable generation, emissions reduction and carbon pricing schemes, potential regulatory changes and the impact to the useful lives of the Group's generation assets. The scenarios are then considered in terms of likelihood to arrive at management's best estimate of recoverable amount.\n\nKey estimates and assumptions for assessing the carrying value of the generation assets are as follows:\n\n- Critical judgement exists in estimating forward electricity pool prices (the forward curve), generation volumes, retail volumes, gas prices and long-term assumptions around market movements and growth rates. A terminal growth rate, informed by expectations around the lives of generation assets and market expectations, has been used when estimating cash flows beyond a period of ten years. The forward curve has a significant impact on the accounting for certain items including value in use calculations for impairment purposes.\n- Operating costs are escalated by relevant cost drivers using activity-based costing principles. Noncontracted fuel costs are based on management's estimate of future fuel prices.\n\nThe impairment testing result of the Group's generation CGU in Australia suggests that minimal headroom remains. As a result, any material adverse shift in a key assumption is likely to result in a potential impairment. The Group will continually perform the generation CGU valuation as the market and the Group transition towards a cleaner energy future.\n\nManagement particularly considers the generation CGU to be highly sensitive to a weakening of expected longterm wholesale prices and a further accelerated exit for the Mount Piper power station. A further shortening of Mount Piper power station's expected life or decrease in long-term wholesale prices whilst holding all other assumptions static, could result in the carrying value of the CGU no longer being supported.\n\n- (B)  Assessment of the Carrying Values of Fixed Assets and Right-of-use Assets in Other Regions\n\nThe Group has also made substantial investments in fixed assets and right-of-use assets (mainly leasehold land and land use rights) in other regions. The Group conducts impairment reviews of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n\nDetermining whether an asset or a CGU should be impaired requires an estimation of the recoverable amount, which requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows, a growth rate (that reflects the economic environments in which the Group operates) and a pre-tax discount rate (that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset) in order to calculate the present value. Where the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the asset's carrying amount, an impairment loss may arise. During 2021, after reviewing the business environment as well as the Group's strategies and past performance of the investments, management concluded that there was an impairment for fixed assets of HK$330 million relating to Jhajjar (Note 5(d)).",

Right-of-Use Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nThe Group as a lessee recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n\nThe Group has lease contracts for land and buildings and various items of plant, machinery and equipment used in its operations.

Investment Property\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nInvestment properties include properties that are being constructed or developed for future use as investment properties. Land held under an operating lease is accounted for as an investment property when the rest of the definition of an investment property under the accounting standard is met. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including related transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, unless they are still in the course of construction or development at the end of the reporting period and their fair value cannot be reliably measured at that time. Fair value is based on active market prices, adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If the information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Any gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value or from the retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.",

The income capitalisation approach is based on the capitalisation of the existing rental / licence income and potential reversionary income over the remaining tenure of the property from the date of valuation at appropriate capitalisation rates that by reference to the yields achieved in analysed market sales transactions and as expected by investors. The significant unobservable input is the capitalisation rates adopted for the valuation which are ranging from 3.90% to 4.15% (2020: 3.90% to 4.15%). The fair value is negatively correlated to the capitalisation rate.\n\nThe fair value measurement of the Group's investment property is categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at 31 December 2021 and 2020.\n\n## 13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises from the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.\n\nGoodwill impairment reviews are undertaken at least annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\n## (B)  Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are measured initially at cost or, if acquired in a business combination, fair value at the acquisition date. An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful life and carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.",

        "page_content": "## 13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment\n\nThe recoverable amounts of CGUs with allocated goodwill are determined based on value in use calculations, which use cash flow projections as at 31 December 2021. These cash flow projections are derived from the approved business plan which has considered ongoing cost optimisation initiatives and a forecast covering a period of ten years which have incorporated necessary updates. Projections for a period of greater than five years have been used on the basis that a longer projection period represents the long-dated nature of our generation and electricity supply assets and a more appropriate reflection of future cash flows from potential legislative, regulatory and structural changes in the industry.\n\n## Energy retail business in Australia\n\n## Key assumptions for value in use calculations\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculations reflect a combination of internal and external factors impacting gross margin, number of customer accounts and discount rates.\n\nThe assumptions impacting gross margin include:\n\n- Retail tariffs are sensitive to regulatory changes including regulation and deregulation, and based on management estimates and expectations of current and expected market conditions arising from known and potential regulatory outcomes.\n- Electricity and gas volumes for purchases and sales in the short term represent the forecast projections in EnergyAustralia's Business Plan. External information is used to verify and align internal estimates.\n- Electricity and gas network (transmission and distribution) cost assumptions are based on published regulated prices. When no estimates are available, network costs are assumed to escalate by the relevant consumer price index.\n- Electricity pool prices, generation volumes, dispatch levels and gas prices were derived using modelling of the electricity and gas wholesale markets. NEM modelling is prepared internally using, where possible, observable inputs. The modelling used for the electricity and gas wholesale markets is based on experience and observable market activity.\n\nOther assumptions include:\n\n- The number of customer accounts in the short term for electricity and gas aligns with EnergyAustralia's Business Plan.\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.9% (2020: 9.9%). The discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital.\n- A long term growth rate of 2.8% (2020: 2.5%) is applied in the terminal value calculation after the first ten years of cash flows.",

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (continued)\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Goodwill Impairment (continued)\n\n## Energy retail business in Australia (continued)\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for the energy retail CGU valuation\n\nWhen undertaking the value in use calculation of our retail CGU at year end, the results indicate that marginal headroom remains. The energy retail CGU valuation is sensitive to certain key assumptions, in particular, gross margin and customer accounts growth. Both retail tariffs and customer account growth assumptions are judgemental and have a direct impact on our CGU valuation. Movements in discount rates, whilst driven by different assumptions, would also have an impact.\n\n- A 5% decrease in long term gross margin would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,896 million (A$335 million).\n- A 1% decrease in long term annual customer growth rate would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,823 million (A$322 million).\n- An increase in the discount rate of 0.5% would decrease the recoverable amount by HK$1,783 million (A$315 million).\n\nThese sensitivities are based on a change in the relevant assumption while holding other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. As a result of the marginal headroom, any material adverse shift in a key assumption without any favourable valuation movement is likely to result in a potential impairment. Up to the date of this report, there were no confirmed material changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned above that would have caused the recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value.\n\n## Hong Kong electricity business\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are as follows:\n\n- Goodwill arising from the CAPCO acquisition has been allocated to CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO as a combined CGU as the acquisition is considered beneficial to the whole SoC business.\n- The electricity tariff for the supply of electricity in meeting the demand of customers in Hong Kong over the forecast periods is determined with reference to the rate-setting mechanism under the SoC.\n- The forecast for electricity demand is based on the load forecast to support local infrastructure development and meeting customer load requirements, maintaining safety and supply reliability, and meeting environmental requirements.\n- Expenditures for the supply of electricity in meeting the forecast demand are based on committed purchase contracts where applicable, and inputs on cost trends specific to the electricity business in Hong Kong. Such forecast aligns with the projection in the Business Plan for our Hong Kong electricity business, with capital expenditures for the periods to year 2023 aligned with those forecasted in the approved Development Plan.\n- Terminal value of the CGU is adopted to estimate the cash flows to be generated for the periods beyond ten years. This is expressed as a multiple of net asset values which corresponds to our return model based on fixed assets investment. The terminal value is a multiple of 1.2 times of the net asset values forecasted as at the end of 2031.\n- The cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 9.82% (2020: 9.80%), or a post-tax return of 8.00% (2020: 8.00%) which reflects the SoC return rate applicable to the electricity business in Hong Kong.\n\nUp to the date of this report, there were no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions mentioned above that would have caused the recoverable amount of this CGU to be less than its carrying value.",

        "page_content": "## 16.  Derivative Financial Instruments\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nA derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and is subsequently remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value gain or loss arising from derivatives not designated or not qualified for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as either fair value hedges, which are hedges of the fair value of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or firm commitments (e.g. fixed interest rate loans and foreign currency trade receivables) or cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the cash flows of recognised financial assets or financial liabilities or highly probable forecast transactions (e.g. floating interest rate loans and future purchases of fuels denominated in US dollar).\n\nThe Group documents at the inception of the transaction the intended relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements.\n\n## (A)  Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss, which offset any changes in the fair values recognised in profit or loss of the corresponding hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk and achieve the overall hedging result.\n\n## (B)  Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss. Such reclassification from equity will offset the effect on profit or loss of the corresponding hedged item to achieve the overall hedging result. However, when the highly probable forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset at the time of acquisition. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in fuel costs in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of fixed assets.\n\nFor cash flow hedges affected by the IBOR reform, the Group retains the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve, even though there is uncertainty arising from the IBOR reform with respect to the timing and amount of the cash flows of the hedged items. Should the Group consider that the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur due to reasons other than the IBOR reform, the cumulative gain or loss will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Any cumulative gain or loss remains in equity at that time is accounted for according to the nature of the underlying transactions (as discussed above) once the hedged cash flow occurs. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is reclassified to profit or loss immediately.",

Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)\n\n## Accounting Policy (continued)\n\n## (C)  Costs of hedging\n\nTime value of options, forward element of forward contracts and foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments may be separated and excluded from the designated hedging instruments. In such case, the Group treats the excluded elements as costs of hedging. The fair value changes of these elements are recognised in a separate component of equity. For time-period related hedged items, these elements at the date of designation (to the extent that it relates to the hedged item) are amortised on a systematic and rational basis to profit or loss over the hedging period. For transaction related hedged items, the cumulative change of these elements is included in the initial carrying amount of any non-financial asset recognised when the hedged transaction occurs or is recognised in profit or loss if the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\n## (D)  Rebalancing of hedge relationships\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.\n\n|                                    | 2021        | 2021             | 2020        | 2020             |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|\n|                                    | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M | Assets HK$M | Liabilities HK$M |\n| Cash flow hedges                   |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 74          | 126              | 22          | 115              |\n| Foreign exchange options           | 1           | -                | 7           | -                |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps | 51          | 987              | 230         | 1,144            |\n| Interest rate swaps                | -           | 80               | -           | 166              |\n| Energy contracts                   | 2,256       | 314              | 2,108       | 1,412            |\n| Fair value hedges                  |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps | 129         | 59               | 279         | 68               |\n| Interest rate swaps                | 14          | 7                | 55          | 17               |\n| Not qualified for hedge accounting |             |                  |             |                  |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts | 82          | 61               | 107         | 60               |\n| Interest rate swaps                | 5           | -                | 14          | 2                |\n| Energy contracts                   | 870         | 1,032            | 691         | 317              |\n|                                    | 3,482       | 2,666            | 3,513       | 3,301            |\n| Current                            | 1,475       | 1,302            | 1,816       | 1,166            |\n| Non-current                        | 2,007       | 1,364            | 1,697       | 2,135            |\n|                                    | 3,482       | 2,666            | 3,513       | 3,301            |\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the contractual maturity profile of the hedging instruments from the end of the reporting period is summarised below:\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts Foreign exchange options Cross currency interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps Energy contracts\n\nUp to 5 years\n\nUp to 3 years\n\nUp to 15 years\n\nUp to 11 years\n\nUp to 9 years",

Dividends on the investments are recognised in profit or loss unless they clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment, in which case they are deducted from the carrying amounts of the investments directly.\n\nInvestments classified at fair value through profit or loss (mainly investments in funds) are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## (B)  Contract acquisition costs\n\nIncremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer are capitalised if they are expected to be recoverable. Costs capitalised are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected benefit periods of the contracts. Nonincremental costs, i.e. costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract is obtained, are expensed when incurred.\n\n## (C)  Service concession receivables\n\nThe Group recognises a financial asset arising from a service concession arrangement when it has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor for the construction. Such financial assets are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n|                                                              | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Investments at fair value through other comprehensive income | 373         | 273         |\n| Investments at fair value through profit or loss             | 542         | 291         |\n| Deposits paid for purchase of a property  (a)                | 338         | -           |\n| Contract acquisition costs                                   | 180         | 154         |\n| Service concession receivables  (b)                          | 234         | 243         |\n| Defined benefit asset  (c)                                   | 221         | 130         |\n| Others                                                       | 415         | 209         |\n|                                                              | 2,303       | 1,300       |\n\n## Notes:",

Other Non-current Assets (continued)\n\n## Notes (continued):\n\n- (c) The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit plans for the Group's Australian subsidiaries, as at 31 December 2021, was prepared by Mr Mark Samuels of Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd, a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia. In respect of the plans for the Group's Australian subsidiaries: (i) the principal actuarial assumptions used include discount rate of 2.9% (2020: 1.6%), longterm salary increase rate of 2.5% (2020: 2.5%) and pension increase rate of 2.0% (2020: 2.0%); (ii) the level of funding is 145% (2020: 122%).\n- The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit plans for the Indian subsidiaries, as at 31 March 2021, was prepared by Mr Saurabh Kochrekar of Kapadia & Kochrekar, a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries of India. No actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 December 2021 as the Indian subsidiaries have a different financial year end.\n\nThe costs for these defined benefit plans represent an immaterial portion to the Group's total retirement benefit costs. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the associated costs represented 1.5% (2020: 1.5%) of the Group's total retirement benefit costs.\n\n## 18.  Property under Development\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nProperty under development comprises leasehold land and construction-in-progress and is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Property under development is included in current assets when it is expected to be realised or is intended for sale in the normal operating cycle.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Group and Sino Land Company Limited (Sino Land) agreed to collaborate on redeveloping the Group's former headquarters at Argyle Street for residential purposes and to preserve the Clock Tower building for community use. Under the development arrangement, Sino Land is fully responsible for all development costs such as land premium, construction costs, professional fees etc. and paid a non-refundable upfront payment of HK$3 billion to the Group. When the property is completed and sold, the Group is entitled to share a percentage of the sale proceeds.\n\nThe arrangement entered into by the Group and Sino Land does not involve an establishment of a separate legal entity and is considered as a joint operation under HKFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. The non-refundable upfront payment forms part of the proceeds from the property development and is recorded as deferred revenue (Note 22(e)). When legal titles of the units in the developed property are passed to the purchasers, deferred revenue and the percentage share of the sale proceeds to which the Group is entitled will be credited to the profit or loss as revenue, while property under development will be charged to the profit or loss as cost of development.\n\n## 19.  Trade and Other Receivables\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at transaction price and are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowances for expected credit losses. The Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to its recognised amount is recognised in profit or loss, as an impairment loss or a reversal of an impairment loss. Trade and other receivables are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nExpected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e. the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of the trade receivables. Expected credit losses on trade receivables are calculated by using the provision matrix approach. Trade receivables are categorised by common risk characteristics that are representative of the customers' abilities to pay all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms. The provision matrix is determined based on historical observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nIf there is no significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, impairment on other receivables is measured at 12-month expected credit losses. If a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, then impairment is measured as lifetime expected credit losses.",

Trade and Other Receivables (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements: Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nProvision for expected credit losses is made when the Group does not expect to collect all amounts due. The provision is determined by grouping together trade debtors with similar risk characteristics and collectively or individually assessing them for likelihood of recovery. The provision reflects lifetime expected credit losses i.e. possible default events over the expected life of the trade receivables, weighted by the probability of that default occurring. Judgement has been applied in determining the level of provision for expected credit losses, taking into account the credit risk characteristics of customers and the likelihood of recovery assessed on a combination of collective and individual basis as relevant. While the provision is considered appropriate, changes in estimation basis or in economic conditions could lead to a change in the level of provision recorded and consequently on the charge or credit to profit or loss.\n\n|                                             | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade receivables  (a)                      | 11,707      | 10,868      |\n| Deposits, prepayments and other receivables | 2,526       | 1,722       |\n| Dividend receivables from                   |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                              | 190         | 139         |\n| An associate                                | 975         | -           |\n| Loan to and current accounts with  (b)      |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                              | 5           | 134         |\n| An associate                                | 1           | 1           |\n|                                             | 15,404      | 12,864      |\n\n## Notes:\n\nThe ageing analysis of the trade receivables at 31 December based on invoice date is as follows:\n\n|                    | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|--------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 30 days or below * | 9,285       | 8,559       |\n| 31 - 90 days       | 670         | 601         |\n| Over 90 days       | 1,752       | 1,708       |\n|                    | 11,707      | 10,868      |\n\n## Movements in provision for impairment\n\n|                                                          | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                                     | 1,602       | 1,583       |\n| Provision for impairment                                 | 246         | 512         |\n| Receivables written off during the year as uncollectible | (332)       | (564)       |\n| Amounts reversed                                         | (2)         | (1)         |\n| Exchange differences                                     | (58)        | 72          |\n| Balance at 31 December                                   | 1,456       | 1,602       |",

Trade and Other Receivables (continued)\n\nNotes (continued):\n\n## (a) Trade receivables (continued)\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nThe Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk with respect to the trade receivables in Hong Kong and Australia as their customer bases are widely dispersed in different sectors and industries. The Group has established credit policies for customers in each of its retail businesses.\n\nIn Hong Kong, electricity bills are due within two weeks after issuance. To limit the credit risk exposure, customers' receivable balances are generally secured by cash deposits or bank guarantees from customers for an amount determined from time to time by reference to the usage of the customers, and in the normal course of events will not exceed the highest expected charge for 60 days. For all the deposits held, customers are paid a floating market interest rate equivalent to the HSBC bank saving rate. The customers' deposits are treated on the statement of financial position as current liabilities on the basis that they are repayable on demand. At 31 December 2021, such cash deposits amounted to HK$6,251 million (2020: HK$5,895 million) and the bank guarantees stood at HK$835 million (2020: HK$854 million).\n\nIn Australia, customers are allowed to settle their electricity bills in no more than 45 days after issue. EnergyAustralia has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to retail customers (including residential and commercial customers) of an appropriate credit quality and collectability is reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nTrade receivables arising from sales of electricity to the offtakers in Mainland China and India are due for settlement within 30 to 90 days and 15 to 60 days after bills issuance respectively. The offtakers of these regions are mainly state-owned enterprises. Management has closely monitored the credit qualities and the collectability of these trade receivables and considers that the expected credit risks of them are close to zero.\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nFor trade receivables relating to accounts which are long overdue with significant amounts or known insolvencies or non-response to collection activities, they are assessed individually for impairment allowance. CLP Power Hong Kong and EnergyAustralia determine the provision for expected credit losses by grouping together trade receivables with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessing them for likelihood of recovery, taking into account prevailing economic conditions and forward looking assumptions.\n\n## CLP Power Hong Kong\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong classifies its trade receivables by nature of customer accounts. These include active accounts and terminated accounts.\n\n|                               | Lifetime   Expected   Credit Loss Rate   | Gross   Carrying   Amount HK$M   | Lifetime   Expected   Credit Loss HK$M   | Net   Carrying   Amount HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2021           |                                          |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Active accounts               |                                          |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                     | 14                               | (8)                                      | 6                              |\n| Provision on collective basis | 0% *                                     | 2,203                            | (9)                                      | 2,194                          |\n| Terminated accounts           |                                          |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                     | 3                                | (3)                                      | -                              |\n| Provision on collective basis | 28%                                      | 6                                | (2)                                      | 4                              |\n|                               |                                          | 2,226                            | (22)                                     | 2,204                          |\n| At 31 December 2020           |                                          |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Active accounts               |                                          |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                     | 7                                | (5)                                      | 2                              |\n| Provision on collective basis | 0%*                                      | 1,960                            | (8)                                      | 1,952                          |\n| Terminated accounts           |                                          |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Provision on individual basis | 100%                                     | 6                                | (6)                                      | -                              |\n| Provision on collective basis | 25%                                      | 5                                | (1)                                      | 4                              |\n|                               |                                          | 1,978                            | (20)                                     | 1,958                          |",

EnergyAustralia recognises lifetime expected credit losses for receivables by assessing future cash flows for each group of trade receivables including a probability weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes based on twelve month rolling historical credit loss experience by customer segment, geographical region, tenure and type of customer and applying that weighting to the receivables held at year end. The determining factor impacting collectability is customer attributes. The impact of economic factors, both current and future, is considered in assessing the likelihood of recovery from customers.\n\n|                     | Weighted   Average   Lifetime   Expected   Credit Loss Rate   | Gross   Carrying   Amount HK$M   | Lifetime   Expected   Credit Loss HK$M   | Net   Carrying   Amount HK$M   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2021 |                                                               |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Current             | 1%                                                            | 3,290                            | (22)                                     | 3,268                          |\n| 1 - 30 days         | 7%                                                            | 408                              | (29)                                     | 379                            |\n| 31 - 60 days        | 18%                                                           | 221                              | (39)                                     | 182                            |\n| 61 - 90 days        | 22%                                                           | 139                              | (31)                                     | 108                            |\n| Over 90 days        | 63%                                                           | 1,371                            | (866)                                    | 505                            |\n|                     |                                                               | 5,429                            | (987)                                    | 4,442                          |\n| At 31 December 2020 |                                                               |                                  |                                          |                                |\n| Current             | 1%                                                            | 3,886                            | (22)                                     | 3,864                          |\n| 1 - 30 days         | 7%                                                            | 466                              | (34)                                     | 432                            |\n| 31 - 60 days        | 17%                                                           | 218                              | (37)                                     | 181                            |\n| 61 - 90 days        | 26%                                                           | 165                              | (43)                                     | 122                            |\n| Over 90 days        | 64%                                                           | 1,582                            | (1,019)                                  | 563                            |\n|                     |                                                               | 6,317                            | (1,155)                                  | 5,162                          |\n\n## Mainland China\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had total receivables of HK$2,302 million (2020: HK$1,774 million) relating to unpaid Renewable National Subsidies. The application, approval and settlement of the Renewable National Subsidy are governed by the relevant policies issued by the Central People's Government. All of the relevant wind and solar projects are qualified for renewable energy subsidy in accordance with the prevailing government policies. There is no due date for the settlement of Renewable National Subsidies as the collection is subject to the allocation of funds by relevant government authorities to local grid companies, which takes a relatively long time for settlement. The expected credit loss is close to zero as continuous settlements have been noted with no history of default and the subsidy is funded by the Renewable Energy Development Fund set up and administered by the Ministry of Finance.\n\n## India\n\n## (i) Renewable receivables\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Apraava Energy's renewable projects had trade receivables of HK$883 million (2020: HK$771 million) of which HK$809 million (2020: HK$680 million) were past due. The expected credit loss is close to zero as there are no history of default and continuous payments received. Trade receivables in dispute are assessed individually for impairment allowance in order to determine whether specific provisions are required.\n\n- (ii) Disputed charges with offtakers\n\nJPL has disputes with its offtakers over applicable tariff of capacity charges and energy charges relating to transit losses. At 31 December 2021, total disputed amounts were Rs3,347 million (HK$351 million) (2020: Rs3,105 million (HK$329 million)). The Group considers that JPL has a strong case and hence, no provision has been made.\n\nIn September 2013, JPL filed a petition to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) against its offtakers. In 2016, CERC pronounced its judgment in favour of JPL, which supports the Group's decision that no provision should be made. The offtakers filed an appeal against the CERC's order in the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) and JPL filed an appeal challenging certain findings of the CERC. The APTEL hearing concluded on 16 June 2020 and the matter was reserved for judgment. However, the tenure of the Technical Member on the APTEL's bench expired before the judgment was passed and the APTEL's bench had to be reconstituted in 2021. The matter will be reheard by the APTEL and the next hearing is scheduled in end-March 2022.\n\nOther disputed receivables of HK$185 million (2020: HK$165 million) were provided in full as there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.",

Fuel Clause Account\n\nThe cost of fuel consumed by CLP Power Hong Kong is passed on to the customers. Any variations between the actual cost of fuel and the fuel cost billed to customers are captured in the fuel clause account. The balance on the account (inclusive of interest) represents amounts over-recovered or under-recovered and is treated as an amount due to or from customers. CLP Power Hong Kong may adjust fuel related tariff from time to time, including on a monthly basis, in accordance with the SoC, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity. As at 31 December 2021, the fuel clause account asset balance represented the right of CLP Power Hong Kong to collect the under-recovered fuel costs from the customers under the SoC.",

Trade Payables and Other Liabilities\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\n## (A)  Trade and other payables\n\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## (B)  Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments with reference to an expected lease term, which includes optional lease periods when the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or not to terminate the lease. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable; variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate; and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this cannot be readily determined, an incremental borrowing rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment, over a similar term and with a similar security. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amounts to reflect interest on the lease liabilities (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amounts to reflect the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment made to the related right-of-use asset) when there is a change in future lease payments in case of renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or in case of reassessment of options under certain conditions.\n\n|                                              | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade payables  (a)                          | 6,119       | 6,077       |\n| Other payables and accruals                  | 7,504       | 7,136       |\n| Lease liabilities  (b)                       | 217         | 219         |\n| Advances from non-controlling interests  (c) | 832         | 1,021       |\n| Current accounts with  (d)                   |             |             |\n| Joint ventures                               | 1           | 1           |\n| An associate                                 | 564         | 583         |\n| Deferred revenue  (e)                        | 3,144       | 3,104       |\n|                                              | 18,381      | 18,141      |\n\n## Notes:\n\n(a) The ageing analysis of trade payables at 31 December based on invoice date is as follows:\n\n|                  | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| 30 days or below | 5,800       | 5,852       |\n| 31 - 90 days     | 219         | 123         |\n| Over 90 days     | 100         | 102         |\n|                  | 6,119       | 6,077       |\n\nAt 31 December 2021, trade payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the corresponding Group entities amounted to HK$1,073 million (2020: HK$941 million), of which HK$897 million (2020: HK$786 million) were denominated in US dollar (2020: US dollar).",

Bank Loans and Other Borrowings\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value of proceeds received, net of transaction costs incurred. Transaction costs are incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial liability. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is amortised to profit or loss or capitalised as cost of the qualifying assets over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe Group's bank loans and other borrowings at 31 December were repayable as follows:\n\n|                           | Bank Loans   | Bank Loans   | Other Borrowings *   | Other Borrowings *   | Total     | Total     |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                           | 2021 HK$M    | 2020 HK$M    | 2021 HK$M            | 2020 HK$M            | 2021 HK$M | 2020 HK$M |\n| Within one year           | 8,893        | 5,299        | 1,619                | 3,448                | 10,512    | 8,747     |\n| Between one and two years | 3,068        | 4,321        | 3,410                | 1,536                | 6,478     | 5,857     |\n| Between two to five years | 3,657        | 4,708        | 6,253                | 7,755                | 9,910     | 12,463    |\n| Over five years           | 3,555        | 3,115        | 27,760               | 24,166               | 31,315    | 27,281    |\n|                           | 19,173       | 17,443       | 39,042               | 36,905               | 58,215    | 54,348    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother presentation of the Group's liquidity risk is set out on pages 287 to 289.",

Deferred Tax\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is also provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted off when the taxes relate to the same tax authority and where offsetting is legally enforceable. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown separately on the consolidated statement of financial position:\n\n|                          | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | 376         | 571         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | (15,886)    | (15,429)    |\n|                          | (15,510)    | (14,858)    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeferred tax asset = income tax recoverable in the future Deferred tax liability = income tax payable in the future",

The Rent and Rates Special Rebate paid to customers was offset against the refunds received.\n\n## 26.  Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nWhen the Group has a legal and / or constructive obligation for remediation and the likelihood of economic outflow is probable, provisions for asset retirement obligations are recorded for estimated remediation costs of reclamation, plant closure, dismantling and waste disposal. A provision for asset retirement costs is determined by estimating the expected costs associated to remediate the site based on the current legal requirements and technologies and is discounted to its present value with an unwind adjustment recognised in finance costs. An asset is recognised on initial recognition of the provision and is depreciated over the useful life of the facility. The asset retirement costs are reviewed annually and adjustments are made to the carrying amount of the assets to reflect changes made to these estimated discount rates or future costs.",

Asset Decommissioning Liabilities and Retirement Obligations (continued)\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nEstimating the amount and timing of the obligation to be recorded requires significant judgement. Management has assessed the Group's obligations for each asset based on the local regulatory environment and expected closure dates.\n\nCLP Power Hong Kong has been investing in the transmission and distribution network to supply electricity to the customers in its supply area in Hong Kong. As CLP Power Hong Kong expects that the land sites being used for the transmission and distribution network will continue to be used for the distribution of electricity supply to its customers, it is currently considered remote that the network would be removed from the existing land sites. Therefore in accordance with applicable accounting standards, asset retirement obligations for these assets have not been recognised by CLP Power Hong Kong.\n\nAs part of the current development plan agreed with the Hong Kong Government in 2018, CAPCO will retire the coal-fired generation units at Castle Peak 'A' Station (CPA) between 2022 to 2025. Following this retirement, the removal of CPA's coal-fired generation units has become probable. In support of the Government's net-zero carbon emissions targets in the 'Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050' announced in October 2021, CAPCO will be in discussion with the Government to phase out the use of coal for daily electricity generation in Castle Peak 'B' Station and work on ways to convert its gas-fired generation facilities to operate on green fuels. While it is envisaged that these remaining generation units will have their roles in supporting the Government's Climate Action Plan 2050, with the continuous development in decarbonisation technologies, the removal of these units and replacement by alternative facilities is possible. Under the SoC, CAPCO makes a periodic charge to accrue in the statement of financial position a liability balance to be utilised in discharging asset decommissioning costs if and when incurred. CAPCO considers that the dismantling obligation for the CPA units is covered under the asset decommissioning liability accrued under the SoC as at 31 December 2021. While no provision for asset retirement obligations for the other generation units of CAPCO has been recognised, it is expected that if such an obligation be incurred, it will be met by the liability accrued and the cost recovery mechanism under the SoC.\n\nAsset retirement obligations of EnergyAustralia as at 31 December 2021 amounted to HK$2,950 million (2020: HK$2,704 million) which mainly related to the provision for land remediation and decommissioning of generation assets. The provisions are largely based on estimates by external and internal experts that are discounted using internally determined end of plant lives. The calculation of the provision requires management judgement with respect to estimating the timing of asset removal, costs to remove infrastructure, remediate soil and groundwater, water usage and technological developments. The terms associated with the decommissioning of certain assets including site restoration plans are yet to be agreed with the relevant regulators. Any future agreements with regulators or changes to regulatory requirements could impact the cost estimates used in the decommissioning provision. On an ongoing basis, we continually review and update underlying assumptions relating to forward rehabilitation estimates and timelines.",

The redeemable shareholder capital is subordinated, unsecured, interest free and has no fixed terms of repayment. CAPCO can, at its sole discretion, redeem all or part of the redeemable shareholder capital at any time after 31 December 2032.\n\nAs both the perpetual capital securities and redeemable shareholder capital do not contain any contractual obligation to pay cash or other financial assets, in accordance with HKAS 32, they are classified as equity and regarded as part of noncontrolling interests for accounting purpose.\n\n## 30.

Related Party Transactions\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nRelated parties are individuals and companies, including subsidiaries, fellow subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and key management personnel, where the individual or company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control or jointly control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. A close family member of any such individual is considered to be a related party.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRelated Parties \u2260 Connected Parties\n\nThey sometimes overlap but should not be confused. Accounting standards define related parties, while the Listing Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange define connected parties.\n\nBelow are the more significant transactions with related parties for the year:\n\n- (A)  CLP Power Hong Kong is obliged to purchase 70% of the output from Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station (GNPS). The price paid by CLP Power Hong Kong for electricity generated by GNPS throughout the terms of the PPA is determined by a formula based on GNPS's operating costs and a calculation of profits with reference to the capacity factors. The purchase of nuclear electricity under the arrangement was HK$5,678 million (2020: HK$5,582 million).\n- Under a separate purchase arrangement with GNPJVC and its shareholder, Guangdong Nuclear Investment Company Limited, CLP Power Hong Kong would purchase approximately 10% of additional nuclear electricity from GNPS on a best endeavour basis from October 2014 to end of 2023, at the same unit price as that under the above purchase arrangement. The purchase of nuclear electricity under the arrangements was HK$813 million (2020: HK$798 million).",

Contingent Liabilities\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of litigation, regulatory judgments and contractual disputes in the course of its normal operations. The Group considers each instance separately in accordance with legal advice and will make provision and / or disclose information as appropriate. Changes in the assumptions around the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources or the estimation of any obligation would change the values recognised in the financial statements.\n\n## Indian Wind Power Projects - WWIL's Contracts\n\nApraava Energy group has invested in approximately 533MW of wind power projects developed with Wind World India Limited (WWIL). WWIL's major shareholder, Enercon GmbH, commenced litigation against WWIL claiming infringement of intellectual property rights. Dr Wobben, the controlling shareholder of Enercon GmbH, also brought actions against Apraava Energy group, as a customer of WWIL. Dr Wobben is seeking, among other things, an injunction restraining Apraava Energy group's use of certain rotor blades acquired from WWIL. Although Dr Wobben has passed away, his counsel have sought time to file appropriate applications to bring on record the legal representatives of the plaintiff.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group considers that Apraava Energy group has good prospects of defending these claims and the legal proceedings are unlikely to result in any material outflow of economic benefits from the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe litigation arising from the disposal of Iona Gas Plant was settled.

        "page_content": "## Financial Risk Management\n\n## 1. Financial Risk Factors\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk, fair value and cash flow interest rate risks, and energy portfolio risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise the impact of exchange rate, interest rate and energy price fluctuations on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses different derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure in these areas. All derivative financial instruments are employed solely for hedging purposes.\n\nRisk management for Hong Kong operations is carried out by the Group's central treasury department (Group Treasury) under policies approved by the Board of Directors or the Finance & General Committee of relevant Group entities. Overseas subsidiaries conduct their risk management activities in accordance with policies approved by their respective Boards. Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and monitors financial risks in close co-operation with the Group's operating units. The Group has written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and cash management.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group operates in the Asia-Pacific region and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. This is primarily with respect to Australian dollar, Renminbi and Indian rupee. Additionally, the Group has significant foreign currency obligations relating to its foreign currency denominated debts and major capital project payments, US dollar denominated nuclear power purchase offtake commitments and other fuel related payments. The Group uses forward contracts and currency swaps to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, and from recognised assets and liabilities which are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the respective Group entity. Hedging is only considered for firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\n## SoC Companies\n\nUnder the SoC, the SoC Companies are allowed to pass-through foreign exchange gains and losses arising from future non-capital projects related commercial transactions and recognised liabilities which are denominated in a currency other than Hong Kong dollar, thus retaining no significant foreign exchange risk of such payments over the long term. The SoC Companies use forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge all their debt repayment obligations denominated in foreign currencies for the full tenor, and a significant portion of their US dollar obligations on fuel and nuclear power purchases, provided that for US dollar the hedging can be accomplished at rates below the Hong Kong Government's historical target peg rate of HK$7.8: US$1. The objective is to reduce the potential impact of foreign exchange movement on electricity tariffs. The SoC Companies also use forward contracts to manage the foreign exchange risks arising from non-Hong Kong dollar payment obligations for major capital projects, for which the exchange gains and losses are capitalised.\n\nThe fair value movement of the derivative financial instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship is recorded in equity. The extent of the impact to the cash flow hedge reserve under equity due to exchange rate movements, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                                       | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Increase / (decrease) in the cash flow hedge reserve  |             |             |\n| Hong Kong dollar against US dollar                    |             |             |\n| If Hong Kong dollar weakened by 0.6% (2020: 0.6%)     | 111         | 92          |\n| If Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 0.6% (2020: 0.6%) | (111)       | (92)        |\n| Hong Kong dollar against Euro                         |             |             |\n| If Hong Kong dollar weakened by 2% (2020: 3%)         | 22          | 5           |\n| If Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 2% (2020: 3%)     | (22)        | (5)         |",

Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Foreign exchange risk (continued)\n\n## The Group's Asia-Pacific Investments\n\nWith respect to the power project investments in the Asia-Pacific region, the Group is exposed to both foreign currency translation and transaction risks.\n\nThe Group closely monitors translation risk using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach but does not hedge foreign currency translation risk because translation gains or losses do not affect the project company's cash flow or the Group's annual profit until an investment is sold. At 31 December 2021, the Group's net investment subject to translation exposure was HK$64,082 million (2020: HK$65,577 million), arising mainly from our investments in Mainland China, Australia, India and Southeast Asia and Taiwan. This means that, for each 1% (2020: 1%) average foreign currency movement, our translation exposure will vary by about HK$641 million (2020: HK$656 million). All the translation exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income and therefore have no impact on the profit or loss.\n\nWe consider that the non-functional currency transaction exposures at the individual project company level, if not managed properly, can lead to significant financial distress. Our primary risk mitigation is therefore to ensure that project-level debt financings are implemented on a local currency basis to the maximum extent possible. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme into local currency taking into consideration any indexing provision in project agreements, tariff reset mechanisms, lender requirements, and tax and accounting implications.\n\nMost foreign currency exposures of the Group entities are hedged and / or their transactions are predominantly conducted through the functional currency of the respective entity. The following analysis presents the Group's (apart from the SoC Companies) sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the functional currencies of the Group entities against the US dollar and Renminbi, with all other variables held constant. The sensitivity rates in US dollar and Renminbi used are considered reasonable given the current level of exchange rates and the volatility observed in the different functional currencies of the Group entities. These are both on a historical basis and market expectations for future movement at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates. The extent of the impact to post-tax profit or equity due to exchange rate movements of US dollar and Renminbi against different functional currencies of Group entities, with all other variables held constant, is as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| US dollar                                  |             |             |\n| If US dollar strengthened by 3% (2020: 3%) |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | 26          | 17          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | 21          | 23          |\n| If US dollar weakened by 3% (2020: 3%)     |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | (26)        | (17)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | (21)        | (23)        |\n| Renminbi                                   |             |             |\n| If Renminbi strengthened by 2% (2020: 3%)  |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | 5           | 12          |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |\n| If Renminbi weakened by 2% (2020: 3%)      |             |             |\n| Post-tax profit for the year               | (5)         | (12)        |\n| Equity - cash flow hedge reserve           | -           | -           |",

        "page_content": "## 1. Financial Risk Factors (continued)\n\n## Energy portfolio risk\n\nEnergyAustralia's activity in energy markets exposes it to financial risk.\n\nThe electricity market is a competitive power pool. In this market generation supply and retail demand are exposed to spot prices. EnergyAustralia purchases and sells majority of its electricity through the pool, at the same time EnergyAustralia enters into electricity spot-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage the spot electricity price risk against forecast retail and generation exposures.\n\nThe gas market is a balancing market. To meet retail demand, EnergyAustralia procures gas supply agreements from various gas producers. The contract prices of certain agreements comprise a fixed component, and a variable component that is linked to oil spot prices on the global markets. EnergyAustralia enters into oil-price-linked derivative financial instruments to manage this oil price risk component.\n\nEnergy portfolio exposure is managed through an established risk management framework. The framework consists of policies which place appropriate limits on overall energy market exposures, hedging strategies and targets, delegations of authority on trading, approved product lists, regular exposure reporting, and segregation of duties. Risk monitoring includes physical position reporting, stress testing of the portfolios and 'at-risk' analyses of potential earnings. The corporate governance process also includes oversight by an Audit & Risk Committee (ARC-EA) which acts on behalf of EnergyAustralia's Board.\n\nAt-risk measures are derived by modelling potential variability in spot and forward market prices and supply and demand volumes, across the wholesale energy portfolio, through Monte Carlo simulations, historic simulations, and scenarios. Overall Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) exposure for the coming financial year is reported as the 1 in 4 probability downside (2020: 1 in 4 probability downside) of the expected earnings distribution, as simulated with the above methods. The energy portfolio risk exposure for EnergyAustralia as at 31 December 2021 was HK$441 million (2020: HK$430 million).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises from borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, and borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The risks are managed by monitoring an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe appropriate level of the fixed / floating mix is determined for each operating company subject to a regular review. For instance, SoC Companies conducts an annual review to determine a preferred fixed / floating interest rate mix appropriate for its business profile. Each overseas subsidiary and project company has developed its own hedging programme taking into consideration project debt service sensitivities to interest rate movements, lender requirements, tax and accounting implications.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis below presents the effects on the Group's post-tax profit for the year (as a result of change in interest expense on floating rate borrowings) and equity (as a result of change in the fair value of derivative instruments which qualify as cash flow hedges). Such amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged items affect profit or loss, and offset one another in the profit or loss.\n\nThe analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. The sensitivity to interest rates used is considered reasonable given the market forecasts available at the end of the reporting period and under the economic environments in which the Group operates, with all other variables held constant.",

Good credit ratings from reputable credit rating agencies and scrutiny of the financial position of non-rated counterparties are two important criteria in the selection of counterparties. The credit quality of counterparties will be closely monitored over the life of the transaction. The Group further assigns mark-to-market limits to its financial counterparties to reduce credit risk concentrations relative to the underlying size and credit strength of each counterparty. In an attempt to forestall adverse market movement, the Group also monitors potential exposures to each financial institution counterparty, using VaR methodology. All derivatives transactions are entered into at the sole credit of the respective subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates without recourse to the Company.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nPrudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and making available an adequate amount of committed credit facilities with staggered maturities to reduce refinancing risk in any year and to fund working capital, debt servicing, dividend payments, new investments and close out market positions if required. The Group maintains significant flexibility to respond to opportunities and events by ensuring that committed credit lines are available to meet future funding requirements. In addition, CLP Power Hong Kong will fund its committed contractual maturities through cash flows earned under the terms of the SoC and financing available under its credit lines and MTN programme. Management also monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's undrawn borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents on the expected cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group seeks to apply, wherever possible, hedge accounting to present its financial statements in accordance with the economic purpose of the hedging activity. The Group determines the economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments by reviewing their critical terms. As a result, the Group concludes that the risk being hedged for the hedged items and the risk inherent in the hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned. There is no inherent mismatch in the hedging relationships. Certain ineffectiveness can arise during the hedging process. The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are considered to be the effects of re-designation of the hedging relationships and the counterparty credit risks on the hedging instruments.\n\n## Hedges on debt related transactions\n\nThe Group applies various types of derivative financial instruments (forward foreign currency contracts, foreign currency options, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps) to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in foreign currencies and / or interest rates of debt. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items. In view of the nature of the hedging activities, no significant ineffectiveness is expected at inception.\n\n## Hedges on non-debt related transactions\n\nThe SoC Companies use forward contracts to manage its foreign exchange risk arising from fuel and nuclear purchases obligations, and payments for major capital projects. The SoC Companies hedge a high portion of committed and highly probable forecast transactions.\n\nEnergyAustralia uses electricity spot-price-linked forward contracts and oil-price-linked forward contracts to mitigate exposures arising from the fluctuations in electricity spot price and oil spot price embedded in gas contracts. In most of the cases, the hedging instruments have a one-to-one hedge ratio with the hedged items.\n\n## Effects of hedge accounting\n\nThe tables below summarise the effect of the hedge accounting on financial position and performance of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021 and 2020:\n\n|                                          |                    |

Fair Value Estimation and Hierarchy of Financial Instruments\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as publicly traded derivatives) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using appropriate valuation techniques and making assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the Group's financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, their carrying values approximate their fair values.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value are analysed into the following fair value measurement hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 -  inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)\n\nLevel 3 - inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)",

The finance department of EnergyAustralia includes a team that performs the valuations of non-property assets required for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values. This team reports directly to EnergyAustralia's Chief Financial Officer (CFO-EA) and ARC-EA. The valuation of Level 3 forward energy contracts involves the use of a short term forward curve which is observable in the liquid market and an internally generated long term forward electricity price and cap price curve which is derived using unobservable inputs. This short term forward curve is reviewed at least once every six months, in line with the Group's half-yearly reporting dates. Review of the long term forward curve is performed by the CFO-EA and ARC-EA annually due to the lack of market liquidity. Analysis of fair value changes is performed on a monthly basis for reasonableness.\n\n- (C)  Movements and sensitivity analysis of Level 3 financial instruments\n\n|                                                                           | Investments HK$M   | 2021 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   | Investments HK$M   | 2020 Energy  Contracts HK$M   | Total HK$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Opening balance                                                           | 326                | 392                           | 718          | 282                | 1,077                         | 1,359        |\n| Total gains / (losses) recognised in                                      |                    |                               |              |                    |                               |              |\n| Profit or loss and presented in fuel and  other operating expenses (note) | 164                | 119                           | 283          | (16)               | 7                             | (9)          |\n| Other comprehensive income                                                | -                  | 444                           | 444          | 2                  | (650)                         | (648)        |\n| Purchases                                                                 | 128                | -                             | 128          | 58                 | -                             | 58           |\n| Sales / settlements                                                       | (53)               | (108)                         | (161)        | -                  | (42)                          | (42)         |\n| Closing balance                                                           | 565                | 847                           | 1,412        | 326                | 392                           | 718          |\n\nNote: Out of which, unrealised gains recognised in profit or loss relating to the assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period was HK$282 million (2020: losses of HK$3 million).\n\nThe valuation of long tenure energy contracts is sensitive to electricity pool price assumptions. At 31 December 2021, a favourable and unfavourable change of 15% (2020: 15%) would cause the balance of the energy contracts to rise by HK$681 million (2020: HK$802 million) and decline by HK$724 million (2020: HK$806 million) respectively, with all other variables held constant.",

Capital Management\n\nThe primary objective of the Group's capital management is to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, maintain a strong credit rating and a healthy capital ratio to support the business and to enhance shareholder value.\n\nThe Group manages its capital structure and fine-tunes it in light of changes in economic conditions and business strategies. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, issue new shares or change the level of debts. The Group's capital management objectives, policies or processes were unchanged during 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe Group monitors capital using 'total debt to total capital' and 'net debt to total capital' ratios. These ratios are as follows:\n\n|                                                             | 2021 HK$M   | 2020 HK$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Total debt  (a)                                             | 58,215      | 54,348      |\n| Net debt  (b)                                               | 49,955      | 42,640      |\n| Total equity  (c)                                           | 127,541     | 126,993     |\n| Total capital (based on total debt)  (d)                    | 185,756     | 181,341     |\n| Total capital (based on net debt)  (e)                      | 177,496     | 169,633     |\n| Total debt to total capital (based on total debt) ratio (%) | 31.3        | 30.0        |\n| Net debt to total capital (based on net debt) ratio (%)     | 28.1        | 25.1        |\n\nIncrease in the Group's net debt to total capital is mainly attributable to higher net debt to finance capital expenditure for business growth and decarbonisation.\n\nCertain entities of the Group are subject to loan covenants. For both 2021 and 2020, there is no material non-compliance with those loan covenants.\n\n## Notes:",

The generating plants in Hong Kong are owned by Castle Peak Power Company Limited (CAPCO), in which CLP Power Hong Kong owned 70%. CLP Power Hong Kong builds and operates CAPCO's power stations under contract and is the sole customer for CAPCO's electricity which CLP Power Hong Kong transmits and distributes to its customers in Kowloon, New Territories and most of the outlying islands. CLP Power Hong Kong owns the transmission and distribution network.\n\nSince financial year 1964, the electricity-related operations of CLP Power Hong Kong and CAPCO (the SoC Companies) have been governed by a Scheme of Control (SoC) Agreement with the Hong Kong Government. The SoC specifies the SoC Companies' obligations to supply adequate and reliable electricity supplies to customers at the lowest reasonable cost and the mechanism for the Hong Kong Government to monitor their financial affairs and operating performance. In return, CLP Power Hong Kong is allowed to charge tariffs designed to recover the operating costs (including tax) and allowed net return of the SoC Companies.\n\nThe current SoC took effect from 1 October 2018 and covers a term of over 15 years ending on 31 December 2033. The SoC contains a provision to give the SoC Companies protection for stranded costs, which may arise as a result of future changes to the market structure which adversely impact on the SoC Companies' ability to recover and to earn returns on existing investments made in good faith in accordance with the SoC. These costs will include the costs of investments, fuel and power purchase agreements previously approved by the Hong Kong Government. If stranded costs arise after the SoC Companies have implemented mitigation measures reasonably required by the Hong Kong Government, the SoC Companies are entitled to recover them from the market, consistent with international practice. Three years before market changes are introduced, the SoC Companies and the Hong Kong Government will agree on the amount of stranded costs and the mechanism for their recovery by the SoC Companies.\n\n## Tariff Setting Mechanism\n\nFor each year, CLP Power Hong Kong designs the total tariff it charges to cover the SoC Companies' operating costs and allowed net return. The total tariff consists of the following components:\n\n- (i) basic tariff rate which is derived by taking into account the annual forecast of (a), (b) and (c) below, using the formula '(a-b) / c':\n- (a) the allowed net return and operating costs including the standard cost of fuels; generation, transmission, distribution and administration expenses; depreciation; interest expenses; and taxes;\n- (b) 80% of the profit on electricity sales to Mainland China; and\n- (c) local unit sales as determined by the load forecast.\n- (ii) fuel clause charge or rebate (Fuel Cost Adjustment) which represents the difference between the cost of fuels (including natural gas, coal and oil) and the standard cost recovered through the basic tariff rate. The Fuel Cost Adjustment may be adjusted from time to time, including on a monthly basis, to reflect changes in the cost of fuels consumed by the SoC Companies for the generation of electricity.\n\nAny difference between the actual profit for SoC operations and the permitted return for the year is transferred to or from a Tariff Stabilisation Fund. The Tariff Stabilisation Fund does not form part of distributable shareholders' funds and represents a liability in the accounts of CLP Power Hong Kong. A charge on the average balance of the Tariff Stabilisation Fund is credited to a Rate Reduction Reserve in the accounts of CLP Power Hong Kong, which balance as at the end of each year is to be transferred to the Tariff Stabilisation Fund in the following year.",

These provisions state that each company will receive that proportion of the total net return represented by the net return that company would receive if it were the only company under the SoC and the net return were calculated solely on the basis of its own financial statements.\n\nUnder the SoC, 65% of the energy efficiency incentives earned by the SoC Companies are to be contributed to a CLP Community Energy Saving Fund (CESF) to support programmes in promotion of energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, the disadvantaged groups and other programmes as agreed with the Hong Kong Government.\n\nThe calculations shown on next page are in accordance with the SoC and the agreements between the SoC Companies.",

Its non-CO\u2082 GHG emissions (i.e. CH\ufffd and N\u2082O) are included in CLP's Scope 1 CO\u2082e emissions.\n- 5 Starting from 2020, the portfolio includes energy storage assets and generation assets. Energy storage assets include pumped storage and battery storage. In previous years, the portfolio included generation assets only.\n- 6 Numbers include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.\n- 7 Numbers include assets with majority and minority shareholdings, and those under 'long-term capacity and energy purchase' arrangements with CLP. Starting from 2018, 'long-term capacity and energy purchase' has been defined as a purchase agreement with a duration of at least five years, and capacity or energy purchased being no less than 10MW.\n- 8 Numbers include Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 emissions (direct emissions from generation of purchased electricity that is sold to CLP's customers).\n- 9 CO\u2082e emissions of Yallourn and Hallett Power Stations were used to calculate CO\u2082 emissions metrics in 2017 due to limited data availability.",

Days Away From Work Injuries refers to the number of personnel who sustains workrelated injury and is unfit to perform any work on any day after the occurrence of the injury. 'Any day' is any calendar day which includes rest days, weekend days, leave days, public holidays or days after ceasing employment. It does not include the day the injury incident occurred. 'Days Away From Work Injuries' excludes fatalities which were included in 'Lost Time Injury'. Numbers prior to 2021 are the previously reported numbers for 'Lost Time Injury'.\n- 12  Refers to the number of Days Away From Work Injuries and Fatalities per 200,000 work hours in the year.\n- 13  Refers to the number of personnel who sustains life threatening or life-altering work-related injury. It is a subset of Days Away From Work Injuries.\n- 14  Refers to the number of Total Recordable Injuries per 200,000 work hours in the year. Total Recordable Injuries include Fatalities, Days Away From Work Injuries, Restricted Work Injuries, and Medical Treatment Injuries.\n- 15  Starting from 2021, 'Work-related Ill Health' replaces 'Occupational Disease'. Work-related Ill Health includes the diseases listed in the ILO List of Occupational Diseases, work-related mental illnesses and work-related disorders. Numbers prior to 2021 are the previously reported numbers for 'Occupational Disease'.\n- 16  Starting from 2021, 'Lost Days' replaces 'Days Lost'. 'Lost Days' is the sum total of calendar days (consecutive or otherwise) after the days on which the work-related injuries and work-related ill health occurred. 'Days Lost' accounts the working days instead of calendar days. Numbers prior to 2021 are the previously reported numbers for 'Days Lost'.\n- 17  19 out of 304 days were carried forward from one incident in 2020.\n- 18  188 out of 443 days were carried forward from one incident in the past.\n- 19  158 out of 464 days were carried forward from three incidents in the past.\n\nAll 2021 data in the above table have been independently verified by PricewaterhouseCoopers except those numbers which are shaded in grey.",

Commencing 1 October 2018, the Fuel Cost Adjustment is automatically adjusted on a monthly basis to reflect changes in actual price of fuel used.\n- 2 CLP Power Hong Kong provided customers with a Rent and Rates Special Rebate of 1.1 cents per unit from January 2018 to mid-February 2019 and 1.2 cents per unit in 2020, returning to customers the refunds received from the Government in relation to CLP Power's claims against the Government's overcharged rent and rates.\n- 3 Effective net tariffs including one-off special fuel rebates in 2017 was 110.5 cents per unit.\n- 4 Without taking into account the effect of the customer programme of demand response pursued to reduce electricity usage, the maximum demand would have been higher at 7,269 MW in 2019, 7,369 MW in 2020 and 7,551 MW in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
