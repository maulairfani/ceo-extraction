It monitored the activities of the company's Board of Management, dealt with the succession planning for the Board of Management and advised it on business management issues. It also continued to regularly address the situation and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the financial year 2021.\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the Supervisory Board held six regular meetings as well as three extraordinary meetings. The regular meetings took place in February, March, May, June, September, and December, and the extraordinary meetings took place in August, September and December. The Supervisory Board also adopted a written resolution in October.\n\nIn all of the regular meetings in the financial year, the Board of Management reported on Group revenues and results as well as business developments in the individual business segments. The Board of Management informed the Supervisory Board on the course of business as well as on the development of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group, including deviations in actual business developments from the planning. In this context, the adequacy of capitalization, the solvency ratio, and the respective risk and stress scenarios were discussed. The annual Allianz SE and the Group's consolidated financial statements - including the respective auditor's reports, the halfyearly as well as the quarterly reports - were reviewed in detail by the Supervisory Board after preparation by the Audit Committee.\n\nOther focal points of reporting, in addition to the situation and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall economic conditions as well as on the insurance industry and Allianz employees, were strategic topics including risk strategy and the Board of Management's planning for both the fiscal year 2022 and the three-year period from 2022 to 2024.

Another focus was the handling of the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha matter, in respect of which the Board of Management gave a detailed progress report on the civil and administrative proceedings and the Supervisory Board had the Board of Management report in detail on the measures it was taking, and the appropriateness of such measures.

Based on the discussion at the extraordinary meeting on 29 September 2021, the Supervisory Board appointed Dr. Andreas Wimmer to the Board of Management of Allianz SE with effect from 1 October 2021 as the successor for Ms. Jacqueline Hunt, who resigned from office as of 30 September 2021. The Supervisory Board further appointed Ms. Sirma Boshnakova as an additional member of the Board of Management of Allianz SE with effect from 1 January 2022.

The committees prepare the consultations in plenary sessions as well as the adoption of resolutions. They can also adopt their own resolutions. The composition of the committees can be found in the Statement on Corporate Management.\n\nThe Standing Committee held six meetings in 2021 and adopted two written resolutions. This committee dealt with corporate governance issues as well as preparations for the establishment of a Sustainability Committee of the Supervisory Board, remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board, the preparations for the AGM, the Supervisory Board self-evaluation as required by supervisory law and the associated development plan, and the efficiency review of the Supervisory Board, which was conducted in 2021 with the assistance of the external consultant Spencer Stuart.

In addition, the Standing Committee has passed resolutions approving the granting of loans to senior executives. At an extraordinary meeting in March, the committee addressed in detail the planned acquisition of business activities from Aviva in Poland and Lithuania, which required the approval of the Standing Committee due to the transaction value.

These reviews revealed no reasons for objection. The Board of Management reported on the quarterly results and discussed them in detail with the Audit Committee together with the results of the auditor's review. One focus of the Audit Committee's activities was the regular review of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of natural disasters and weather events, which occurred on a large scale in the last financial year.

        "page_content": "In addition, the committee dealt extensively with the compliance system and the internal auditing system, as well as the accounting process and internal financial reporting control mechanisms. At several meetings, the Audit Committee discussed with the Board of Management the effects of the changeover to the new accounting standards IFRS 9 & 17 with its respective effects on Allianz's accounting from financial year 2023 onwards and the status of the implementation measures for a proper transition to the new standards. At all regular meetings, reports on legal and compliance issues in the Group, operational risks and the work of the Internal Audit department were presented and discussed in detail. Furthermore, the head of the actuarial function (Group Actuarial, Planning & Controlling) presented his annual report. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed the adjustments resulting from the Financial Market Integrity Strengthening Act (FISG), and the internal audit plan for 2022. The Audit Committee held in-depth discussions with the Board of Management on the progress of the civil as well as the administrative proceedings of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice in the matter of the Structured Alpha Funds of AllianzGI U.S. A separate working group of the Audit Committee was additionally set up for this purpose/uni003B this group held four meetings in the reporting year, which were also attended by the lawyers engaged by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Risk Committee held two meetings in 2021. At both meetings, the committee discussed the current risk situation of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE with the Board of Management. In the March meeting, the risk report and other risk-related statements in the annual Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements as well as management and group management reports were reviewed with the auditor and approved. The appropriateness of the early risk recognition system at Allianz SE and Allianz Group and the result of further risk assessments by the auditor were also discussed. The Audit Committee was recommended to include the Risk Report, as presented and discussed, in the Annual Report. At both meetings, the Risk Committee examined the risk strategy in detail, including risk appetite, capital management and the external rating as well as the effectiveness of the risk management system for the Allianz Group and Allianz SE. The committee further looked in detail at the report on Allianz's own risk and solvency assessment and the changes to the internal Solvency II model, and held discussions with the Board of Management, in particular about transactions with portfolios in the life insurance sector to improve the return on equity and the solvency position. The Risk Committee also focused on the topic of inflation risk and, in this context, Allianz's exposure in the event of rising inflation rates and the consideration of inflation trends in pricing, as well as on the developments relating to 'silent cyber', i.e., the unintended, implied coverage of cyber risks, especially in the area of commercial insurance. In addition, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic were again addressed with regard to the business development and risk situation, the management of reputational risks and accumulation risks as well as the management of non-financial risks. The Risk Committee also dealt extensively with the impact of the AllianzGI Structured Alpha matter on the risk situation at Allianz. In addition, special regulatory topics, such as the EIOPA review of Solvency II, as well as business policy topics were also on the agenda.\n\nThe Technology Committee held two meetings in the financial year 2021, at which it discussed in detail the reorganization of information technology in the Allianz Group, the IT strategy and, in particular, the strategic IT partners in cloud and IT applications, and in the comprehensive IT transformation. The focus was again on the implementation of the Business Master Platform (BMP) in the context of the Allianz Customer Model (ACM).

        "page_content": "The Nomination Committee held one meeting in 2021, at which it reviewed the objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board and proposed changes to the Supervisory Board in order to adapt to new legal requirements and to expand the skills profile. In particular, it was proposed to amend adequate expertise with respect to technology to explicitly include adequate expertise in cybersecurity as well as to add adequate knowledge in the area of sustainability. The Supervisory Board implemented these proposals in its meeting on 24 June 2021. The committee also reviewed the actual composition of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, detailed preparations were made for the Supervisory Board elections at the AGM 2022, taking into account the objectives for the composition. The Nomination Committee discussed the general succession planning for the Supervisory Board and proposed the formation of a so-called 'Staggered Board', which has been strongly requested by investors. Beginning with the Annual General Meeting in 2022, the candidates standing for election as shareholder representatives will no longer be elected on the principle of block election with identical terms of office. In the case of new elections for retiring Supervisory Board members, new members shall then each be elected for the term of office stipulated in the Articles of Association, in order to also establish the Staggered Board for the following years. Furthermore, the Nomination Committee has intensively discussed potential candidates to succeed the members of the Supervisory Board who will retire in the coming years. For each retiring member of the Supervisory Board, outstandingly suitable candidates could be identified, each of whom has already declared their willingness to stand for election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meetings in 2024 and 2025. Together with the Board of Management, the Nomination Committee has also agreed concrete measures to prepare the candidates at an early stage for the duties of a member of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE as well as for the complex business of a globally operating and regulated financial services company. These measures include, for example, the preparation of candidates in the context of a mandate as a member of the supervisory board of a European subsidiary of Allianz SE or other appropriate measures, as well as the early identification of training measures based on the skill profile of the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Nomination Committee addressed the appointment of a further substitute candidate in the event that a Supervisory Board member had to be replaced at short notice.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee , which was newly established by the Supervisory Board in February 2021, held two meetings in the 2021 financial year. At its constitutive meeting, the committee first dealt with structuring its area of responsibility, which covers the topics of environment, social responsibility and corporate governance, as well as data ethics, the committee's mode of operation and its interfaces to other committees of the Supervisory Board, in particular the Personnel Committee and the Risk Committee. Key topics in the two meetings included sustainability reporting and the assessment of the Allianz Group by external providers of sustainability indices as well as the discussion of measures to improve the assessment, sustainability ambitions for the future and the implications arising from sustainability regulation. In addition, the committee dealt in detail with the strategy in the area of social responsibility and prepared the setting of sustainability targets for the Board of Management remuneration as well as the corresponding target achievement assessment for the financial year 2021 by the Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was informed regularly and comprehensively of the committees' work.",

The Supervisory Board appointed PwC as statutory auditor for the annual Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements as well as for the review of the half-yearly financial report for the financial year 2021. PwC audited the financial statements of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group as well as the respective management reports. They issued an auditor's report without any reservations. The management reports also each contain the respective non-financial statement. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE were prepared in accordance with German law and accounting standards. PwC performed a review of the half-yearly financial report. In addition, PwC was also mandated to perform an audit of the market value balance sheet according to Solvency II as of 31 December 2021 for Allianz SE and the Allianz Group. Furthermore, PwC was commissioned to conduct a review with respect to the content of the non-financial statement.",

        "page_content": "All Supervisory Board members received the documentation relating to the annual financial statements and the auditor's reports from PwC on schedule. The preliminary financial statements and PwC's preliminary audit results were discussed in the Audit Committee on 16 February 2022, as well as in the Supervisory Board's plenary session on 17 February 2022. The finalized financial statements and PwC's audit reports (dated 21 February 2022) were reviewed  by  the  Audit  Committee  on  2 March 2022,  and  in  the  Supervisory  Board  plenary  session  on 3 March 2022. The auditors participated in the discussions and presented key results from their audit. Particular emphasis was placed on the key audit matters described in the auditor's report and on the audit procedures performed as well as the treatment of the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha matter. No material weaknesses in the internal financial reporting control process were discovered. There were no circumstances that might give cause for concern about the auditor's independence. In addition, the market value balance sheets dated 31 December 2021 for both Allianz SE and the Allianz Group as well as the respective PwC reports were reviewed by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nOn the basis of its own reviews of the annual Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements, the management and group management reports, and the recommendation for the appropriation of earnings, the Supervisory Board has raised no objections and agreed with the results of the PwC audit. It has also approved the Allianz SE and consolidated financial statements prepared by the Board of Management. The financial statements have thus been formally adopted. The Supervisory Board agrees with the Board of Management's proposal on the appropriation of earnings.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to express its special thanks to all Allianz Group employees for their great personal commitment over the past fiscal year under the continuing difficult conditions caused by the pandemic.\n\nThere were no changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board in the fiscal year 2021.\n\nDr. Barbara Karuth-Zelle and Mr. Christopher Townsend were appointed as new members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE with effect from 1 January 2021. They succeeded Dr. Christof Mascher and Mr. Niran Peiris, who left the Board of Management on 31 December 2020. Furthermore, Dr. Andreas Wimmer was appointed to the Board of Management of Allianz with effect from 1 October 2021. He succeeded Ms. Jacqueline Hunt, who resigned from office with effect from 30 September 2021. Ms. Sirma Boshnakova was also appointed as a new member of the Board of Management with effect from 1 January 2022.\n\nMunich, 3 March 2022\n\nFor the Supervisory Board:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichael Diekmann Chairman",

The decrease was mainly driven by a reduction in volume from the intra-group Property-Casualty reinsurance business amounting  to  \u20ac 226 mn.  This  was  partially  compensated  by  an increase  in  external  motor  business.  In  total,  \u20ac 11,480 mn  (2020: \u20ac 11,685 mn)  of  gross  premiums  were  attributable  to  PropertyCasualty reinsurance and \u20ac 671 mn (2020: \u20ac 543 mn) to Life/Health reinsurance.\n\nDriven by reinstatement premiums relating to the retrocession of claims from European natural catastrophes, the net retention ratio decreased to 90.7 % (2020: 91.8 %). Premiums earned (net) increased to \u20ac 10,915 mn (2020: \u20ac 10,888 mn).\n\nThe accident year claims 1 ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance decreased to 71.1 % (2020: 72.7 %). This was mainly due to the adverse impact of COVID-19 losses in 2020. The natural catastrophe losses before retrocession of \u20ac 1,406 mn were above the prior year's amount (2020: \u20ac 220 mn) 2 with the floods and severe storms in Europe being  the  major  events.  Despite  the  recovery  from  retrocession  of claims  from  natural  catastrophes  amounting  to  \u20ac 1,058 mn  (2020: \u20ac 0 mn), the net losses were also above those from the previous year.\n\nThe  run-off result (net) in Property-Casualty  reinsurance amounted to \u20ac 439 mn (2020: \u20ac 400 mn) and was mainly influenced by  liability  reinsurance  (\u20ac 283 mn),  credit  and  bond  reinsurance (\u20ac 89 mn) as well as fire and property reinsurance (\u20ac 63 mn). Overall, the calendar year claims ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance decreased to 67.0 % (2020: 69.0 %).\n\nThe expense ratio (net) in Property-Casualty reinsurance decreased to 29.0 % (2020: 29.5 %), driven by both a lower commission ratio of 28.2 % (2020: 28.6 %) and a lower administrative expense ratio of 0.8 % (2020: 1.0 %).\n\nIn Life/Health reinsurance, the net underwriting result decreased to \u20ac 44 mn (2020: \u20ac 60 mn), mainly due to higher commissions for business with external cedents.\n\nThe total net underwriting result amounted to \u20ac 458 mn (2020: \u20ac 140 mn), mainly driven by the positive development of the calendar year loss ratio in Property-Casualty reinsurance in 2021.\n\nIn  2021,  the change  in  claims  equalization  and  similar  reserves amounted to \u20ac (435) mn (2020: \u20ac (363) mn). This was mainly driven by the claims development in the liability and motor reinsurance business.\n\nAfter the increase of equalization and similar reserves, the net technical result amounted to \u20ac 24 mn (2020: \u20ac (223) mn).\n\n## Investment result\n\n\u20ac mn\n\n|                                                                                               | 2021    | 2020    | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Investment income                                                                             |         |         |          |\n| Income from profit transfer agreements                                                        | 2,295   | 2,373   | (78)     |\n| Income from affiliated enterprises and  participations                                        | 6,156   | 4,487   | 1,669    |\n| Income from other investments                                                                 | 486     | 525     | (39)     |\n| Realized gains                                                                                | 274     | 302     | (28)     |\n| Income from reversal of impairments                                                           | 18      | 25      | (7)      |\n| Subtotal                                                                                      | 9,230   | 7,712   | 1,518    |\n| Investment expenses                                                                           |         |         |          |\n| Expenses for the management of  investments, interest, and other investment- related expenses | (933)   | (1,022) | 88       |\n| Depreciation and impairments of  investments                                                  | (500)   | (552)   | 51       |\n| Realized losses                                                                               | (148)   | (167)   | 19       |\n| Expenses for losses taken over                                                                | (58)    | (714)   | 655      |\n| Subtotal                                                                                      | (1,641) | (2,454) | 813      |\n| Investment result                                                                             | 7,589   | 5,258   | 2,331    |\n\nThe investment  result significantly  increased  by  \u20ac 2,331 mn  to \u20ac 7,589 mn.\n\nIncome from profit transfer agreements declined by \u20ac 78 mn to \u20ac 2,295 mn.

This reduction was driven by lower interest expenses (\u20ac 103 mn) as a result of lower refinancing rates for the rollover of matured debt instruments. The overall decrease of this position was partly offset by higher investment-related expenses (\u20ac 15 mn).\n\nDepreciation  and  impairments  of  investments went  down  by \u20ac 51 mn to \u20ac 500 mn. The impairments in 2021 were particularly attributable  to  write-downs  on  bonds  (\u20ac 166 mn),  participations (\u20ac 141 mn) and shares in affiliated enterprises (\u20ac 139 mn).\n\nRealized losses declined by \u20ac 19 mn to \u20ac 148 mn and were predominantly attributable to the sale of bonds (\u20ac 145 mn).\n\nExpenses  for  losses  taken  over considerably  decreased  by \u20ac 655 mn to \u20ac 58 mn. This was primarily driven by a lower loss taken over from Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE, which declined by \u20ac 496 mn to \u20ac 22 mn, and the fact that no loss was taken over from our service provider Allianz Technology SE in 2021 (2020: \u20ac 163 mn).\n\n## Other non-technical result\n\nThe other non-technical result deteriorated significantly by \u20ac 1,532 mn to \u20ac (2,423) mn. On the one hand, this development was driven by the foreign currency translation result, which deteriorated by \u20ac 714 mn and was mainly driven by foreign currency translation losses of liabilities denominated in USD. On the other hand, the increase in pension expenses by \u20ac 628 mn also negatively influenced the result: This was primarily caused by the increase of the pension trend parameter. For further information regarding other income and expenses, please refer to note 24.\n\nAs far as legally permissible, Allianz SE acts as the controlling company ('Organtr\u00e4ger') of the German tax group that most German subsidiaries belong to. As the controlling company, Allianz SE is liable for the income taxes of this German tax group.\n\nAfter being offset against tax losses, the current tax charge of Allianz SE amounted to \u20ac (352) mn (2020: \u20ac (250) mn). Moreover, Allianz SE received a tax allocation of \u20ac 543 mn (2020: \u20ac 732 mn) by  Allianz SE  tax group companies that recorded taxable income. Taking into account other taxes, the income from taxes amounted to \u20ac 195 mn (2020: \u20ac 486 mn).\n\nNet income increased by \u20ac 743 mn to \u20ac 5,351 mn (2020: \u20ac 4,608 mn).",

        "page_content": "## Economic outlook 1\n\nThe global economic recovery following the COVID-19 crisis is continuing in 2022. However, it is going to lose momentum overall and will also be distributed quite unevenly, not least due to differences in the pace of vaccination which cause the gap between industrialized and emerging countries  to widen further. Overall, we expect the global economy to grow by 4.1 % in 2022. While the United States and the eurozone are expected to achieve 3.9 % and 4.1 % respectively, growth in China will cool to 5.2 %, the lowest rate in over 30 years (apart from the slump in the COVID-19 year 2020).\n\nSupply bottlenecks and parts shortages are likely to continue to weigh on production and prices, with no improvement expected before the second half of 2022. In view of persistent inflation, central banks will probably withdraw more of their expansionary monetary policy measures/uni003B first interest rate hikes are expected in the United States, albeit not in the eurozone. Even if financing conditions remain generous overall, volatility in the stock markets is expected to increase in 2022. The same goes for the bond markets, where a slight rise in interest rates and a slight widening of spreads is to be expected. In addition, the different approaches of central banks are expected to influence international capital flows and exchange rates.\n\nIn this outlook, the downside risks predominate. First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic itself is by no means \"defeated\" yet: The lack of herd immunity, especially in poorer countries, may allow new variants to emerge at any time, leading to more waves of contagion. At the same time, economic policy faces the difficult challenge of managing the transition to a \"post-pandemic\" world - that is, the normalization of monetary policy and the scaling back of fiscal crisis support - smoothly, without causing any major market distortions. Add to this the fact that, after two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, its burdens are unevenly distributed among population groups, social peace appears increasingly fragile in many countries and, last but not least, geopolitical tensions have further increased across the board.\n\n## Insurance industry outlook\n\nThe global insurance market is expected to develop positively overall in 2022. Essentially, the same drivers are still at work as in 2021: the continued economic  recovery (especially in the industrialized countries), increased risk awareness among households and companies, and rising prices, especially in commercial lines. At the same time, the investment  environment  remains  very  challenging  due  to  stronger market movements/uni003B although the expected slight rise in interest rates could be a first step out of the low-interest-rate trough and lead to an improvement in investment returns.\n\n2022 will also be marked by accelerated digitization, with the aim of simplifying and scaling up processes, and offering customers simple, fast, easy-to-grasp solutions. In the context of sustainability, social aspects will play an increasingly important role, not least against the backdrop of growing inequality due to the COVID-19 crisis. This offers the insurance industry opportunities to position itself as a partner for strengthening social resilience. At the same time, it is important to pay more attention to the potential reputational risks arising from growing\n\nsocial, political, and cultural demands on companies in general and on insurance companies in particular.\n\nIn the non-life sector ,  premium growth will  probably continue slightly below the previous year's level. Commercial lines should continue to benefit from rising prices, albeit to a lesser extent/uni003B investment income could increase slightly, although financial market risks should not be underestimated. Also, the gradual return to normality will allow claims volumes to return to pre-crisis levels, especially in the motor business.\n\nIn the life sector , the recovery in premium income is also expected to continue in 2022, although it is unlikely that the previous year's growth levels will be reached again. As before, a key driver of this outlook is a greater awareness of the need for risk protection and increased savings in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. The expected slight rise in interest rates could also stimulate the demand for savings products. Profitability should improve as well, considering the expected slight improvement in investment income as well as the decline in excess mortality that will follow the successful vaccination campaign.\n\n## Business outlook\n\nOur outlook assumes no significant deviations from our underlying assumptions - specifically:\n\n- -continuation of global economic recovery,\n- -interest rates to remain at the current level,\n- -no major disruptions in the capital markets,\n- -no disruptive fiscal or regulatory interference or major litigation,\n- -level of claims from natural catastrophes at expected average levels,\n- -an average U.S. dollar-to-euro exchange rate of 1.19.\n\nAllianz SE provides a wide range of reinsurance coverage, primarily to Allianz Group's insurance entities (group-internal business), but also to third-party  customers  (external  business).  This  includes  PropertyCasualty as well as Life/Health business on both a proportional and a non-proportional  basis.  Due  to  the  broad  spread  of  exposures underwritten by line of business and geography, Allianz SE's portfolio is diversified.\n\nAllianz Group uses Allianz SE, in particular, as a vehicle for actively managing its overall exposure to catastrophes. Under a group-wide risk management framework, each operating entity is responsible for controlling its exposure to individual catastrophes and defining its local reinsurance requirements, based on its local risk appetite and capital position. The respective cover is then provided by Allianz SE or one of its subsidiaries. At the Group level, the Allianz SE's  Board  of Management reviews and approves the risk appetite. The reinsurance division is then responsible for designing and implementing Group catastrophe protection within given exposure limits. These covers take various forms and aim to protect the Group against excessive losses from  major  natural  or  man-made  catastrophes.  However,  despite measures to limit or mitigate our risks, there is still the potential for an unexpected frequency and/or severity of catastrophic events that may materially impact the results of Allianz SE.

Higher  than planned catastrophe losses, especially in Germany, were offset by improved profitability in liability and other Property-Casualty business. The combined ratio was lower than planned. Consequently, the net underwriting result before change in claims equalization and similar reserves was higher than expected.\n\nAfter many years of low profitability in the industry, rates started moderately hardening in 2020 and 2021. Following pandemic related underwriting losses during the course of 2020, and global natural catastrophe events above the 10-year average level in both 2020 and 2021, the trend of price increases has continued with 2022 renewals.\n\nAllianz SE's  technical  result  largely  depends  on  group-internal cessions in the form of quota share agreements with European Allianz entities. Based on our estimates, we expect slightly higher premiums and  a  visible  improvement  of  the  net  underwriting  result  before changes in claims equalization and similar reserves for the PropertyCasualty reinsurance in 2022. It should be noted that the actual result may vary significantly as the reinsurance business is, by nature, volatile in terms of frequency and severity of losses.\n\nCompared to our outlook, the net underwriting result and the investment result deviated positively for 2021, while our other nontechnical result was below the planned result. This resulted in both net income as well as net earnings exceeding our expectations. For 2022, we predict a moderately increasing net income with almost stable net  earnings.  Based  on  our  current  expectations,  increases  in  the underwriting  result  and  the  other  non-technical  result  will  only  be partially offset by a lower investment result. We are not planning a specific foreign currency result, nor are we able to anticipate any net gains/losses from derivatives. These could, however, considerably impact the net income of Allianz SE. Given the susceptibility of our nontechnical result to adverse capital market developments, we do not provide a precise  outlook for the development of our net income. Nevertheless, we are ultimately planning and managing the Allianz SE net earnings in line with the Allianz Group's dividend policy. To this end,  we  take  advantage  of  the  opportunity  to  make  use  of  the dividends of our subsidiaries, in particular those of Allianz Europe B.V., in  order  to  generate  net  earnings  for  Allianz SE  that  match  the dividend policy of Allianz Group. For more detailed information on our dividend policy, see the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2021 and\n\n- www.allianz.com/dividend .\n\n## Management's overall assessment of the current economic situation of Allianz SE\n\nAt the date of issuance of this Annual Report, and based on current information  regarding  natural  catastrophes  and  capital  market trends - in particular foreign currency, interest rates, and equities - the Board of Management has no indication that Allianz SE is facing any major adverse developments.\n\n## Cautionary note regarding forwardlooking statements\n\nThis document includes forward-looking statements, such as prospects or expectations, that are based on management's current views and assumptions and subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties.

The  combined  ratio  increased  to  101.0 %  (2020:  94.4 %), mainly due to a worsening of the accident year claims ratio to 75.8 % (2020: 68.2 %). The increase is the result of a higher claims frequency. A  strengthening  of  the  equalization  reserve  by  \u20ac 120 mn  (2020: \u20ac 416 mn) led to a net technical result of \u20ac (167) mn (2020: \u20ac (231) mn).\n\nThe household and homeowner reinsurance portfolio increased by 6.2 % to gross premiums written of \u20ac 1,186 mn (2020: \u20ac 1,118 mn), mainly coming from business with Allianz IARD S.A. and Allianz Versicherungs-AG. The combined ratio grew to 101.4 % (2020: 83.0 %), driven by an increase in the accident year claims ratio to 74.0 % (2020: 54.6 %).  The  net  technical  result  decreased  to  \u20ac (19) mn  (2020: \u20ac 190 mn).\n\nThe decline of the fire reinsurance portfolio was mainly caused by lower internal business volume.  The combined ratio rose to 91.8 % (2020: 77.1 %), driven by an increase of the calendar year claims ratio to 66.5 % (2020: 54.5 %) due to a lower run-off result of \u20ac 8 mn (2020: \u20ac 253 mn) as well as a higher expense ratio of 25.2 % (2020: 22.7 %). After a further strengthening of the equalization reserve by \u20ac 32 mn (2020: \u20ac 74 mn), the net technical result amounted to \u20ac 22 mn (2020: \u20ac 78 mn).\n\nEngineering reinsurance gross premiums written were stable. The combined ratio was 101.3 % (2020: 91.6 %), and thus, was above the\n\nprevious year driven by a decrease of the run-off result by \u20ac 40 mn. The net technical result decreased to \u20ac (21) mn (2020: \u20ac 34 mn).\n\nThe written premiums in the business interruption reinsurance decreased by 9.7 % to \u20ac 230 mn (2020: \u20ac 255 mn), mainly due to internal business volume. The combined ratio improved significantly to 73.6 % (2020: 234.2 %), mainly due to the decrease of the accident year claims ratio to 76.7 % (2020: 199.6 %), after the previous year's accident year claims ratio had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The net technical result thus increased to \u20ac 58 mn (2020: \u20ac (315) mn).\n\nOther property reinsurance includes extended coverage for fire and business interruption as well as hail, storm, water damage, livestock, burglary, and glass reinsurance. The premiums written increased by 5.1 % due to a higher internal as well as a higher external business volume. In addition, the run-off result improved by \u20ac 47 mn (2020: negative run-off result of \u20ac 55 mn), resulting in an improved combined ratio of 103.6 % (2020: 123.3 %). The net technical result amounted to \u20ac (19) mn (2020: \u20ac (135) mn).\n\nPremiums written for liability reinsurance declined by 4.7 % to  \u20ac 1,114 mn  (2020:  \u20ac 1,169 mn),  mainly  driven  by  cessions  from Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE. The combined ratio improved to 72.6 % (2020: 100.8 %), mainly due to a positive run-off result of \u20ac 283 mn (2020: \u20ac 71 mn) and a decrease of the accident year claims ratio to 69.5 % (2020: 76.1 %).

The net technical result declined to \u20ac 39 mn (2020: \u20ac 58 mn), largely owed to an increase of the acquisition costs.\n\nThe premium revenue of personal accident reinsurance remained stable. The combined ratio worsened to 87.9 % (2020: 84.3 %), mainly driven by a higher accident year claims ratio. The net technical result thus decreased to \u20ac 50 mn (2020: \u20ac 68 mn).\n\nThe gross premium written in marine and aviation reinsurance decreased by 11.1 % to \u20ac 339 mn (2020: \u20ac 382 mn). The combined ratio increased mainly due to a decline of the run-off result to \u20ac 9 mn (2020: \u20ac 55 mn).  Despite  a  strengthening  of  the  equalization  reserve  by \u20ac 20 mn  (2020:  \u20ac 65 mn),  the  net  technical  result  was  positive  at \u20ac 15 mn (2020: \u20ac 10 mn).\n\nThe premium revenue of legal expenses reinsurance increased by 7.2 % to \u20ac 281 mn (2020: \u20ac 262 mn), driven by Allianz Elementar Versicherungs-AG (\u20ac 11 mn). In addition, the premium income with Allianz Versicherungs-AG increased by \u20ac 9 mn. The combined ratio improved to 116.6 % (2020: 118.9 %) due to a decrease in the calendar year claims ratio to 80.8 % (2020: 82.8 %), stemming from a lower accident year claims ratio. The equalization reserve remained stable during the financial year (2020: release of \u20ac 31 mn), while the net technical result decreased to \u20ac (46) mn (2020: \u20ac (18) mn).\n\nGross premiums written in credit and bond reinsurance increased by  22.2 %  to  \u20ac 242 mn  (2020:  \u20ac 198 mn).  The  increase  was  mainly caused by the increase of the premium income amounting to \u20ac 52 mn with Euler Hermes Reinsurance AG. Driven by a lower calendar year claims ratio of 24.6 % (2020: 36.2 %), the combined ratio improved to 69.1 % (2020: 87.8 %). The net technical result amounted to \u20ac 25 mn (2020: \u20ac 164 mn) after a strengthening by the equalization reserve by \u20ac 36 mn (2020: release of \u20ac 135 mn).\n\nIn health reinsurance the premium revenue increased by 14.8 % to \u20ac 192 mn (2020: \u20ac 167 mn), mainly driven by external business. The net technical result rose to \u20ac 6 mn (2020: \u20ac 2 mn).\n\nOther reinsurance lines include:\n\n- -emergency assistance,\n- -fidelity & political risk,\n- -motor extended warranty,\n- -other property and casualty business.",

More details regarding this position are explained in note 5 to our financial statements.\n\nOther investments declined from \u20ac 34.2 bn to \u20ac 32.3 bn, mainly reflecting decreases in debt securities (\u20ac 1.5 bn) and loans (\u20ac 0.5 bn).\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, \u20ac 27.0 bn of other investments were invested in debt securities, of which \u20ac 9.4 bn were government bonds. We reduced our overall government bond exposure by \u20ac 1.9 bn compared to 31 December 2020, thereby decreasing our investments in Spanish and Italian government bonds from \u20ac 0.9 bn to \u20ac 0.8 bn and from \u20ac 0.8 bn to \u20ac 0.7 bn respectively.\n\nFunds held by others under reinsurance business assumed increased to \u20ac 13.9 bn (2020: \u20ac 13.1 bn). This increase was mainly due to a new reinsurance contract with Allianz Benelux S.A.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the fair value of investments amounted to \u20ac 144.4 bn (2020: \u20ac 148.6 bn), compared to a carrying amount of \u20ac 123.0 bn (2020: \u20ac 121.1 bn). The decrease of valuation reserves to \u20ac 21.4 bn (2020: \u20ac 27.5 bn) is primarily driven by lower net asset values of our shares in affiliated enterprises.\n\n## Receivables\n\nReceivables increased from \u20ac 4.8 bn to \u20ac 5.3 bn, driven by a growth of \u20ac 0.2 bn in other receivables and a growth of \u20ac 0.3 bn in receivables on reinsurance business. The increase in other receivables mainly resulted from higher cash pool receivables of \u20ac 0.3 bn.\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nAs  of  31 December 2021,  our shareholders'  equity amounted  to \u20ac 41.0 bn (2020:  \u20ac 40.4 bn).  A buy-back of own shares at acquisition costs of \u20ac 0.7 bn led to a decrease. The shares were cancelled without reducing the issued capital. This decrease was more than offset by a rise of \u20ac 1.4 bn, due to net income being higher than the dividend paid.  The net income rose by  \u20ac 0.8 bn  to  \u20ac 5.4 bn  (2020:  \u20ac 4.6 bn). \u20ac 0.8 bn (2020: \u20ac 0.8 bn) were transferred from the net income to the revenue reserves.\n\nThe Board of Management proposes to use the net earnings of \u20ac 5,021 mn for dividend payments in the amount of \u20ac 4,409 mn. 1 The unappropriated earnings of \u20ac 613 mn will be carried forward.\n\nOur disclosures concerning treasury shares as required in our financial statements in accordance with \u00a7 160 (1) No. 2 AktG can be found in note 11.",

The main sources of liquidity available to Allianz SE are dividends received from subsidiaries as well as reinsurance premiums received, and external funding raised in the capital markets. Liquidity resources are defined as readily available assets - specifically cash, money market securities, and highly liquid fixed income securities. Funds are primarily used for paying interest expenses on our debt funding, claims arising from the reinsurance business, operating costs, internal and external growth investments, and dividends or share buybacks to our shareholders.\n\n## Funding sources\n\nAllianz SE's access to external funds depends on various factors such as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings, and credit capacity. The financial resources available to Allianz SE are both equity and debt funding. Equity can be raised by issuing ordinary no-par value shares. The issuance of debt in various maturities as well as group-wide liquidity management are the main sources of our debt funding.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the share capital registered at the Commercial Register was \u20ac 1,169,920,000. This was divided into 408,457,873 no-par value shares. As of 31 December 2021, Allianz SE held 238,720 (2020: 247,489) own shares.\n\nAllianz SE has the option to increase its share capital base according to authorizations provided by the AGM. The following table outlines Allianz SE's capital authorizations as of 31 December 2021:\n\n## Capital authorizations of Allianz SE\n\n| Capital authorization            | Nominal amount   | Expiry date of   the authorization   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Authorized Capital  2018/I 1     | \u20ac 334,960,000    | 8 May 2023                           |\n| Authorized Capital  2018/II 2    | \u20ac 15,000,000     | 8 May 2023                           |\n| Conditional Capital  2010/2018 3 | \u20ac 250,000,000    | 8 May 2023                           |\n\n- 1\\_For issuance of shares against contribution in cash and/or in kind, with the authorization to exclude shareholders' subscription rights.\n- 2\\_For issuance of shares to employees, with the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights.\n- 3\\_To  cover  convertible  bonds,  bonds  with  warrants,  convertible  participation  rights,  participation  rights,  and subordinated financial instruments, each with the authorization to exclude shareholders' subscription rights.\n\nFor further details on Allianz SE's authorized and conditional capital, please refer to note 11 to our financial statements.\n\nThe cost and availability of debt funding may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or to Allianz SE. Our main sources of debt funding are senior and subordinated bonds. Among others, money market securities, letter-of-credit facilities, and bank credit lines allow Allianz SE to fine-tune its capital structure.\n\nIn the first half-year of 2021, we called two subordinated bonds of \u20ac 0.8 bn and USD 1.0 bn each, and repurchased a \u20ac 0.5 bn convertible bond. Furthermore, in the second half-year of 2021, we called another \u20ac 1.1 bn subordinated bond and issued a dual tranche restricted tier 1 (RT1) bond (\u20ac 1.25 bn and USD 1.25 bn). Overall, subordinated liabilities decreased to \u20ac 15.8 bn (2020: \u20ac 16.6 bn) at year-end.\n\nOther financial liabilities remained almost unchanged compared to the previous year, at \u20ac 38.7 bn (2020: \u20ac 38.8 bn). Lower intra-group loans were offset by higher cash-pool liabilities. For further details on Allianz SE's financial liabilities, please refer to note 12 and note 15 to our financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT\n\n## Target and strategy of risk management\n\nAllianz SE aims to ensure that it is adequately capitalized at all times for the benefit of both shareholders and policyholders. This includes meeting the Solvency II regulatory capital requirements resulting from the internal model.\n\nWe closely monitor the capital position and risk concentrations of Allianz SE, and apply regular stress tests (including standardized, historical and reverse stress test scenarios). These analyses allow us to take appropriate measures to preserve our continued capital and solvency strength. For example, risk capital is allocated to reinsurance business segments and reflected as cost of capital in our pricing tools. Furthermore, we ensure a close alignment of the risk and business strategy by the fact that business decisions to achieve our set targets are taken within the determined risk appetite. Sound processes to steer the business and assess and manage associated risks ensure a continous alignment between the risk and business strategy, and enable us to detect and address any potential deviations.\n\nIn addition, the liquidity risk management framework of Allianz SE ensures that our liquidity risks are managed and a sufficient liquidity position is maintained under both market and business conditions (expected as well as stressed).\n\n## Risk governance system\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, we consider risk management to be a core competency and an integral part of our business. Our risk management framework covers all operations and business units of Allianz SE in proportion to the inherent risks of the activities, ensuring that risks across Allianz SE are consistently identified, analyzed, assessed, and adequately managed. The key elements of our risk management framework are:\n\n- -Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a robust risk governance structure.\n- -Consistent application of an integrated risk capital framework to protect our capital base and support effective capital management.\n- -Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into management and decision-making processes by attributing risk and allocating capital to the business units.\n\nOur risk management system is based on the following four pillars:\n\nRisk identification, evaluation and underwriting: A robust system of risk identification, evaluation, and underwriting forms the foundation for adequate risk and management decisions. Supporting activities include standards for underwriting, valuation methods, individual transaction approvals, emerging-/operational-/top-risk assessments, liquidity risk and scenario analyses, among others.\n\nRisk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk appetite consistently with our business strategy. It ensures that rewards\n\n1\\_Midpoint of our EPS target range.\n\nare appropriate based on the risks taken and the required capital. It also ensures that delegated decision-making authorities are in line with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy.\n\nRisk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework provides management with the transparency needed to assess whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits, and to identify emerging issues and risks quickly. For example, risk dashboard and limit utilization reports as well as scenario analyses and stress tests are regularly prepared and communicated.\n\nCommunication  and  transparency: Transparent  risk  disclosure provides the basis for communicating our strategy and performance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing. It also strengthens risk awareness and our risk culture throughout Allianz SE.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nAllianz SE's business strategy is aligned with and mainly driven by the strategy of the Allianz Group. Allianz SE's main tasks are the ownership of legal entities, in particular subsidiaries, the provision of central financing functions, and offering reinsurance services to mostly internal but also external counterparties.\n\nThe Board of Management of Allianz SE has defined the following objectives for the Allianz Group's medium-term strategy, building on the success of the efforts to simplify the company, in line with the motto 'simplicity at scale':\n\n- -Outperform: We seek to move ahead of our competitors, both traditional businesses and disruptors, to drive profitable growth.\n- -Transform: We seek to become simpler and deeply digital, and to put - in addition to the customer - scalability at the heart of our actions.\n- -Rebalance: We seek to build leading positions in large, profitable and fast-growing geographies as well as in new areas of business. An increased focus will be placed on an organic rebalancing of the business mix.\n\nThese objectives have been translated into clear ambitions for the period 2022 to 2024. With regard to financial performance, we strive for a return on equity (excluding unrealized gains/losses on bonds) of more than 13 %, while growing our earnings per share from \u20ac 21 (expected  baseline full year 2021, as communicated in the Allianz Capital Markets Day 2021) to approximately \u20ac 25 1 by 2024 (reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 5 % to 7 %).\n\nTo ensure the sustainability of our performance, we have set ourselves non-financial targets that reflect strong underlying organizational health: For customer loyalty, our ambition is for more than 50 % of the business segments of Allianz Group's entities to be or become rated by their customers as a 'loyalty leader' in terms of the",

At the same time, we have also set the target to become a clear leader in sustainability and diversity.\n\nAllianz Group including Allianz SE faces an altered environment on insurance markets. Generally, reinsurance rates are rising as the market is characterized by an overall hardening due to large losses, mainly from natural catastrophes. Business areas such as cyber coverage are experiencing greater demand.  Cover for pandemic risks is generally not in the risk appetite of the reinsurance division and is only granted after a strict review and with clear limits.\n\nTo implement these strategic objectives, we continue to drive initiatives addressing the five dimensions of our Renewal Agenda: Customer Centricity, Digital by Default, Technical Excellence, Growth Engines and Inclusive Meritocracy. To realize our growth ambition and accelerate our value creation, we have defined five additional strategic areas of focus:\n\n## -Transforming the Life/Health and Asset Management franchise:\n\n- Fully address protection & savings needs and accelerate transformation  to  a  capital  efficient  model,  both  leveraging  our\n\nstrengths in Asset Management.\n\n- -Expanding our Property & Casualty leadership position: Beat the best players in each market building on productivity gains and scale/uni003B in retail motor and beyond.\n- -Boosting growth through scalable platforms: Scale our customerfacing platforms and build new operating platforms to grow our business volume and margin.\n- -Deepening the global vertical integration and execution of agility: Verticalize operating models across lines of business to unleash value from our skills and scale.\n- -Reinforcing capital productivity and resilience: Retain industryleading financial strength and unlock further value creation potential through an improved risk/return profile and an active management and reduction of tail risk exposure. Our focus on capital resilience is matched with a focus on talent development and diversity that also strengthens our organizational resilience.\n\nAllianz SE's Board of Management has also defined a strategy for the management of risks. This risk strategy places particular emphasis on insuring the integrity of the Allianz brand and reputation, remaining solvent even in the event of extremely adverse scenarios, maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet financial obligations, and providing resilient profitability.\n\nThe Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's financial strength renders us resilient  against market stress,  and our ongoing transformation creates capabilities allowing us to profit from new opportunities in a fast-changing business environment.\n\nAllianz SE's role - as laid out in our business strategy - includes providing central financing functions to Allianz  Group  companies, and acting as a reinsurer with predominantly Group-internal business. Opportunities  management  is  principally  a  responsibility  for  the Allianz Group's primary insurance and asset management entities.\n\nAllianz SE's  activities  in  support  of  the  Allianz  Group's  opportunity management mainly fall in the following areas:\n\n- -Supporting the companies' efforts to continuously harmonize and simplify products and processes across all business segments via development of centralized expertise in data analytics, product design, and distribution platforms.\n- -Supporting the Allianz Group's growth strategy via provision of financing for acquisition of M&A targets.\n- -Reinsurance pooling from Group companies and optimization via retrocessions as well as reinsurance solutions to optimize their capital needs.\n\nFor a detailed description of the Allianz Group's opportunities see the annual reports of our subsidiaries.\n\nThe  pooling  of  internal  reinsurance  on  the  balance  sheet  of Allianz SE is an important strategic initiative which has been pursued for many years. As a Group reinsurer, the reinsurance division not only provides guidance and tools to Group companies to manage exposures as effectively as possible, but also provides most of the reinsurance covers to Group companies. The large and diversified portfolio at Allianz SE allows for acceptances of a wide range of reinsurance solutions,  including  proportional  and  non-proportional  contracts. Furthermore, net quota shares as well as adverse development covers (ADC) contribute to a balanced portfolio at Allianz SE. Larger risk concentrations are actively managed via retrocessions on a per risk and per event basis in order to protect our capital and increase the return on equity.\n\nDue to the deep expertise available at Allianz SE, important services to Group companies are provided, for example, via the Global Commercial unit for the MidCorp business segment with tools for pricing,  accumulation  management  and  loss  control  engineering services, or via the Global P&C and Global Life units for their respective business segments.\n\nIn 2021, Allianz SE also supported Group efforts for simplification and digitalization, among others, by building centralized expertise in  product  development,  digital  distribution  platforms,  and  claims management.\n\nFor  further  details  on  opportunities  envisaged  by  Allianz SE, please refer to the section 'Business Outlook'.\n\n## Risk governance structure\n\nAllianz SE's approach to risk governance allows for an integrated risk steering and ensures that our risk profile remains consistent with both our risk strategy and our capacity to bear risks.\n\nWithin our risk governance system, Allianz SE's Supervisory Board and the Board of Management have both Allianz SE and Group-wide responsibilities. The Board of Management formulates business objectives and a corresponding risk strategy/uni003B the core elements of the risk framework are set out in the Allianz Group Risk Policy approved by the Board of Management, which together with the Allianz SE-specific appendix also serves as the master risk policy for Allianz SE. The Supervisory Board advises, challenges, and supervises the Board of Management in the execution of its management activities. The",

        "page_content": "following committees support the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board on risk issues.\n\n## Supervisory Board Risk Committee\n\nThe  Supervisory  Board  Risk  Committee  reports  to  the  Supervisory Board, where the information and the findings are discussed with the Board of Management. It monitors the effectiveness of Allianz SE's risk management framework. Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related developments as well as the general risks and specific risk exposures, and ensures that the business strategy is aligned with the risk strategy.\n\nFor  more  information  please  refer  to  the  paragraph  'Risk Committee' in the Supervisory Board Report.\n\n## Group Finance and Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Finance and Risk Committee (GFRC) provides oversight of the Group's and Allianz SE's risk management framework, acting as a primary early-warning function by monitoring the Allianz  Group's and Allianz SE's risk profiles as well as the availability of capital. The GFRC also ensures that an adequate relationship between return and risk is maintained. Additionally, the GFRC defines risk standards, is the limit-setting authority within the framework set by the Board of Management, and approves major financing, reinsurance and capital management transactions. Finally, the GFRC supports the Board of Management with recommendations regarding Allianz SE's capital structure, capital allocation, liquidity position, and investment strategy, including the sub-portfolio strategic asset allocations.\n\nThe Allianz Re Risk Committee supports the GFRC on issues relating to Allianz SE's reinsurance business.\n\nA comprehensive system of risk governance is achieved by setting standards related to organizational structure, risk strategy and appetite,  limit systems, documentation, and reporting. These standards ensure the accurate and timely flow of risk-related information and a disciplined approach towards decision-making and execution.\n\nAs a general principle, the responsibility for the 'First Line of Defense' rests with business managers in the business units of Allianz SE. They are responsible for both the risks taken and the returns from their decisions. Our 'Second Line of Defense' is made up of independent oversight functions including Risk, Actuarial, Compliance, and Legal, which support the Board of Management in defining the risk framework within which the business can operate. Audit forms the 'Third Line of Defense'/uni003B  independently and regularly reviewing Allianz SE's risk  governance  implementation,  compliance  with  risk  principles, performing quality reviews of risk processes, and testing adherence to business standards, including the internal control framework. Allianz SE  has  established  dedicated  responsibilities  for  the  three lines of defense with its departments (including reinsurance).\n\n## Risk management function\n\nThe function of the Chief Risk Officer for both the Allianz Group and Allianz SE is performed by the same person. Independent risk oversight for Allianz SE is performed by risk control units within Group Risk and within the reinsurance department of Allianz SE. The risk management function supports Allianz SE's Board of Management, including its committees, by performing various analyses, communicating risk-\n\nmanagement-related  information,  and  in  preparing  and  implementing committee decisions.\n\nThe  risk  management  function  also  supports  the  Board  of Management in developing the risk management framework - which covers risk governance, risk strategy, and appetite - and risk monitoring and reporting. The risk management function's operational responsibilities encompass assessing risks, and monitoring limits and accumulations of specific risks across business units and business lines, including natural and human-caused (regulatory terminology: man-made) disasters, and exposures to financial markets and counterparties.\n\n## Other functions and bodies\n\nIn addition to the risk management function for Allianz SE, Allianz SE's legal, compliance, and actuarial functions constitute additional components of the 'Second Line of Defense'.\n\nAllianz SE's legal and compliance functions seek to mitigate legal risks for Allianz SE with support from other departments. The objectives of both functions are to ensure that laws and regulations are observed, to react appropriately to all impending legislative changes or new court rulings, to attend to legal disputes and litigation affecting Allianz SE, and to provide legally appropriate solutions for transactions and business processes. In addition, Compliance - in conjunction with Legal and other experts involved - is responsible for integrity management, which aims to protect Allianz SE and employees from regulatory risks.\n\nAllianz SE's actuarial function contributes towards assessing and managing risks in line with regulatory requirements, in particular for those risks whose management requires actuarial expertise. The range of tasks includes, among others, the calculation and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial assistance in business planning, reporting and monitoring of the results, and supporting the effective implementation of the risk management system.\n\n## Risk-based steering and risk management\n\nAllianz SE is exposed to a variety of risks through its holding function and  reinsurance  activities,  including  market,  credit,  underwriting, business, operational, strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\nAllianz SE  considers  diversification  across  different  lines  of business and regions to be an important element in managing our risks efficiently, as it limits the economic impact of any single event and contributes  to  relatively  stable  results.  Our  aim  is  to  maintain  a balanced  risk  profile  without  any  disproportionately  large  risk concentrations and accumulations.\n\nWith  Solvency II  being  the  regulatory  regime  relevant  for Allianz SE  since  1 January 2016,  our  risk  profile  is  measured  and steered based on our approved Solvency II internal model. We have introduced  a  target  solvency  ratio  in  accordance  with  Solvency II, supplemented by ad hoc  scenarios, historical and reverse stress tests, and sensitivity analyses. This allows for a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line with the Solvency II framework.\n\nAllianz SE steers its portfolio taking a comprehensive view at risk and return, which is based on the internal model and is supported by scenario analyses. Risk and concentrations are actively restricted by  limits  based  on  our  internal  model  or  other  considerations.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of the Return on Risk Capital (RoRC) is regularly conducted and translated for the underwriting of  the property and casualty reinsurance business. The RoRC is an indicator for new business and allows us to identify profitable lines of business on a sustainable basis, and thus is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions.\n\nAs  a  consequence,  the  internal  model  is  fully  integrated  in business steering, and its application satisfies the so-called 'use test' requirement under Solvency II.\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a global reinsurer, Allianz SE  holds  and  uses  a  broad  range  of  financial  instruments, which are reflected on our balance sheet as both assets and liabilities.\n\nFor our holding activities (i.e., to hold participations, provide financing for Group companies, cover internal pension liabilities, invest cash pooled from subsidiaries, and as the lender of last resort within Allianz Group), Allianz SE predominantly invests in participations and fixed-income assets. In support of our China strategy, we also hold a sizeable minority stake in unlisted life insurer Taikang Insurance Group, Inc.\n\nAs an inherent part of our reinsurance operations, we collect premiums from our customers and invest them in a wide variety of assets. The resulting reinsurance investment portfolio backs the future claims and benefits to our cedents. In addition, we also invest shareholders' capital, which is required to support the underwritten risks and the holding activities. Our market risk from liabilities primarily relates to fixed-income instruments held for financing as well as to internal pensions and reinsurance liabilities. Finally, we use derivatives for various  purposes.  A  principal  example  would  be  the  hedging  of planned dividend income from non-euro subsidiaries against adverse currency market movements. In the case of high capital market volatility, or especially adverse market conditions, Allianz SE may also undertake  hedge  overlays  to  support  the  solvency  of  the  Allianz Group. Generally, the use of derivatives at Allianz SE is for the purpose of risk reduction. Guidelines are in place regarding the use of derivatives, for which adherence is monitored by the risk management function of Allianz SE.  Asset/liability  management  (ALM)  decisions  are  taken based on the internal model, considering both risks and returns on the financial markets.\n\nAs the fair values of our assets and liabilities depend on changes in the financial markets, we are exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments. Allianz SE's most important market risk results from changes in the value of its participations in Group companies. The long-dated internal pension liabilities of German Group companies on Allianz SE's balance sheet contribute to interest rate risk in particular, as they cannot be fully matched by available investments due to long maturities. In addition, we are also exposed to adverse changes in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, inflation, implied volatilities, and currency values, which might impact the value of our assets and liabilities.\n\nTo measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models 1 for the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to generate possible future market developments. After the scenarios for all risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are revalued under each scenario. The worst-case outcome of the portfolio\n\n1\\_Internal pensions are evaluated and modeled based on deterministic models, following IAS 19 principles.\n\nprofit and loss distribution at a confidence level of 99.5 % defines the market Value at Risk (VaR).\n\nMarket  risk  from  Allianz SE's  material  M&A  transactions  is evaluated by assessing risk capital implications.\n\nStrategic asset allocation benchmarks are defined for several sub-portfolios  of  Allianz SE's  investment  portfolio.  Furthermore,  we have risk limits in place, including financial VaR, stand-alone equity and interest rate sensitivity  limits, and foreign-exchange exposure limits. Limits are closely monitored and, if a breach occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include the escalation to certain decision-making bodies and/or the closing of positions.\n\nFinally, guidelines are in place regarding certain investments, new investment products, and the use of derivatives.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nAllianz SE's equity risk predominantly results from the performance of our strategic insurance participations. Other material risk exposures reflect listed and unlisted equities, equity derivatives, own shares, and management incentive plans.\n\nRisks from changes in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share prices and increasing equity price volatilities. As the performance of our participations might exceed expectations and stock values might also increase, opportunities may arise from participations and other equity investments.\n\nIn 2021, Allianz SE had profit and loss transfer agreements with fifteen German subsidiaries. These are listed in the appendix in the 'Legal Obligations' section. Risks from these contracts are reflected in the risk capital calculation for participations.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nIf the duration of our assets is shorter than our liabilities, we may suffer an economic loss in the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing assets at lower rates prior to the maturity of liability contracts.\n\nBy contrast, opportunities may arise when interest rates increase. Interest rate risk is managed within our ALM process and controlled via an interest rate sensitivity limit.\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nFixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads widen. However, our risk appetite for credit spread risk considers the underlying economics of our reinsurance business model. As a liabilitydriven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets covering reinsurance liabilities until maturity. This implies that we are economically less affected by short-term changes in market prices.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nAs the holding company of the Allianz Group and as a reinsurance company, we are exposed to changing inflation rates. Since inflation increases reinsurance claims and costs as well as internal pension obligations, higher inflation rates will lead to greater liabilities.\n\nInflation assumptions are considered in our reinsurance underwriting. However, unexpected rising rates of inflation will increase both future claims and expenses, leading to higher liabilities. Conversely, if future inflation rates were to be lower than assumed, liabilities would be lower than anticipated. The risk that inflation rates deviate from inflation assumptions is incorporated in our internal model. Potential",

This includes the identification of early warning signs and triggers for potential actions in order to address mitigating actions.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe major part of Allianz SE's foreign currency risk results from our ownership  of  non-euro  Group  companies.  In  addition  to  this  risk, Allianz SE's currency risk is driven by its non-euro reinsurance exposure, as well as by the use of foreign currency bonds as external financing instruments.\n\nIf the euro strengthens, the euro-equivalent net asset value of our foreign subsidiaries and the value of our non-euro financing instruments  will decline from Allianz SE's perspective/uni003B at the same time, however, capital requirements in euro will decrease, partially mitigating the total impact on the capitalization of Allianz SE.\n\nAn additional important source of currency risk is the planned dividend income from non-euro subsidiaries.\n\nAllianz SE's currency risk is monitored and managed based on our foreign exchange management limit framework.\n\nCredit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality of our counterparties ('migration risk') or the inability or unwillingness of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations ('default risk').\n\nAllianz SE's credit risk profile comes from three sources: our investment portfolio, guarantees, and retrocession.\n\nInvestment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and receivables, whose value may decrease depending on the credit quality of the obligor.\n\nGuarantees: Credit risk is caused by the potential default of Group companies  on  commitments  from  contracts  with  external  stakeholders, which are backed by guarantees from Allianz SE.\n\nRetrocession: Credit risk to external reinsurers arises when parts of Allianz SE's reinsurance business are retroceded to external reinsurance  companies  to  mitigate  risks.  Credit  risk  arises  from  potential losses from non-recoverability of reinsurance receivables, or due to default on benefits under in-force reinsurance treaties. Our retrocession partners are carefully selected by a team of specialists. Besides focusing on companies with a strong credit rating, we may further require letters of credit, cash deposits, or other financial measures to further mitigate our exposure to credit risk.\n\nThe internal credit risk capital model considers the major drivers of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity. Additional parameters assigned to obligors are migration probabilities and obligor asset correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio. Ratings are assigned to single obligors using a clearly defined assignment process. Central components of this assignment process are long-term ratings from external rating agencies and internal rating models in case of specific internal investment strategies. If available, a dynamic adjustment using market-implied ratings and the most recent qualitative information available is applied. The loss profile of the portfolio is obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation, considering interdependencies and exposure concentrations per obligor segment.\n\nTo ensure effective credit risk management, a credit VaR limit is derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the lower investment grade and non-investment grade area.\n\nOur group-wide country and obligor group limit management framework (CRisP 1 ) allows us to manage counterparty concentration risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the levels of the Group and of Allianz SE. This limit framework forms the basis for discussions on credit actions. Clearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed.\n\nAllianz SE's underwriting risk consists mainly of premium risk and reserve risk in the Property-Casualty reinsurance business, biometric risk from the Life/Health reinsurance business,  and from internal pensions obligations.\n\n## Property-Casualty\n\nOur Property-Casualty reinsurance business is exposed to premium risk related to adverse developments in the current year's new and renewed business as well as to reserve risk related to the business in force.\n\nAs  part  of  our  Property-Casualty  reinsurance  operations,  we receive  premiums  from  our  customers  and  provide  insurance protection in return. Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the current year develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios.\n\nPremium  risk  is  subdivided  into  three  categories:  natural catastrophe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including manmade catastrophes.\n\nAllianz SE  actively  manages  premium  risk  from  reinsurance business. The assessment of risks as part of the underwriting process is a key element of our risk management framework. There are clear underwriting guidelines, limits  and restrictions in place, which are regularly  monitored.  Excessive  risks  are  mitigated  by  external retrocession agreements. All these measures contribute to a limitation of risk accumulation. We also monitor concentrations and accumulation of non-market risks on a stand-alone basis (i.e., before diversification effects) within an Allianz  Group global limit framework in order to avoid substantial losses from single events, such as natural catastrophes, and from man-made catastrophes, such as terror or large industrial risk accumulations.\n\nPremium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are used to derive claims distributions and consider the features of our reinsurance contracts (e.g., shares, limits, reinstatements and commissions). Non-catastrophe risks are modeled using attritional loss models for frequency losses as well as frequency and severity models for large losses. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, storms and floods, represent a significant challenge for risk management due to their accumulation potential for higher return periods. For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location, characteristics of insured objects and their values) with simulated natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of potential losses. For significant exposures where such stochastic models do not exist, we use deterministic, scenario-based  approaches  to  estimate  potential  losses.  Similar",

        "page_content": "approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror and man-made catastrophes, including losses from cyber incidents and industrial concentrations.\n\nThese loss distributions are then used within the internal model to calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\nReserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in bestestimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from fluctuations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement. Allianz SE estimates and holds reserves for claims resulting from past events that have not yet been settled. In case of unexpected negative developments, we would experience a financial loss.\n\nReserve risk can also be mitigated by retrocession. We constantly monitor the development of reserves for reinsurance claims on a lineof-business level, and changes are discussed quarterly in the reserve committee. In addition, Allianz SE subjects its provisions to annual reserve uncertainty analyses based on similar methods used for reserve risk calculations. The results of these analyses are provided to respective reinsurance experts on a regular basis. Where appropriate, the expertise and analysis of other Group entities is leveraged. The Allianz Group performs regular independent reviews of these analyses. Similar to premium risk, retrocession agreements from previous years have a risk mitigating effect.\n\nSimilar to premium risk, reserve risk is calculated based on actuarial  models.  The  reserve  distributions  derived  are  then  used within the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %.\n\n## Life/Health\n\nRisks in Allianz SE's Life/Health segment include risks assumed from reinsurance transactions and from our internal pension obligations. The main exposures include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks. Mortality, disability and morbidity risks are associated with an unexpected increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims. Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and internal pension contracts might not be sufficient due to longer life expectancies of the insured persons.\n\nLife/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower than expected. As profitability calculations are based on several parameters - such as historical loss information and assumptions on inflation, mortality or morbidity - parameters realized may differ from the ones used for the calculation of pension liabilities and for underwriting.  For  example,  higher-than-expected  inflation  may  lead  to higher medical claims in the future. However, beneficial deviations are also possible: For example, a lower morbidity rate than expected will most likely result in lower claims.\n\nWe measure risks within our internal risk capital model, distinguishing,  where  appropriate,  between  risks  affecting  the  absolute level and trend development of actuarial parameter assumptions on the one hand, and pandemic risk scenarios on the other.\n\nOperational risks represent losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, human errors, system failures and external events, and can stem from a wide variety of sources, for example:\n\n- -The  category  'execution,  delivery  and  process  management' describes  potential  losses  arising  from  transaction  or  process management  failures. Examples include interest and penalties\n\n- from non-payment or underpayment of taxes. These losses tend to occur with little financial impact (although single large loss events can occur).\n- -The category 'clients, products and business practices' includes potential losses due to a failure to meet the professional obligations, or from the design of transactions. Examples include antitrust behavior, violations of data protection regulations, sanctions, and embargoes. These losses can have a high financial impact/uni003B however, they tend to occur rarely.\n- -'Other operational risks' include, for example, internal and external fraud, financial misstatement risk, and information security incidents causing business disruption or fines. Potential failures at  our outsourcing partners can also cause a disruption to our working environment.\n\nIn view of Allianz SE's tasks as holding company for the Allianz Group and reinsurer, the operational risk capital of Allianz SE is dominated by the risk of potential losses within the areas of 'execution, delivery and process management' and 'clients, products and business practices'.\n\nOperational risk capital is calculated using a scenario approach based on expert judgment as well as internal and external operational loss data. The estimates for frequency and severity of potential loss events for each material operational risk category are assessed and used as the basis for our internal model calibration.\n\nAllianz SE has implemented a group-wide operational risk management framework that focuses on the early recognition and proactive management of material operational risks. The framework defines roles  and  responsibilities  as  well  as  management  processes  and methods. An important component of this framework is the Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS), which ensures that effective controls or other risk mitigation activities are in place for all significant operational risks. Risk managers in the Allianz SE risk management function, in their capacity as the 'Second Line of Defense', identify and evaluate relevant operational risks and control deficiencies via a dialogue with the 'First Line of Defense', and in close interaction with both the other 'Second Line of Defense' functions at Allianz SE and with the audit function.\n\nIn the IRCS approach, risk identification, assessment and controls vary  between  the  different  operational  risk  sources  reporting, compliance  and  operations.  For  example,  compliance  risks  are addressed  via written policies. The risk of financial misstatement is mitigated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting. Outsourcing risks are covered by an Outsourcing Policy, by Service Level Agreements and by Business Continuity and Crisis Management programs  to  protect  critical  business  functions  from  these  events. Cyber risks are mitigated through investments in cyber security, cyber insurance, which Allianz SE buys from third party insurers, and a variety of ongoing control activities.\n\nOperational risk events are reported in a central database.\n\nBusiness risk includes cost risk and policyholder behavior risk. These risks are mostly driven by the Life/Health business, and to a lesser extent by the Property-Casualty business.\n\nCost risks are associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering  policies  are  higher  than  expected,  or  that  the  new business volume decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz to cover its fixed costs.",

        "page_content": "For the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks related to unpredictable, adverse behavior of policyholders in exercising their contractual options, such as, for instance, early termination of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, and annuity take-up options.\n\nAssumptions  on  policyholder  behavior  are  set  in  line  with accepted actuarial methods and are based on our own historical data, if and as available. If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on industry data or expert judgment. These are used as a basis to determine  the  economic  impact  of  policyholder  behavior  under different scenarios within our internal model.\n\nConsidering  the  business  model  of  Allianz SE  as  primarily  a group-internal reinsurer, business risk is moderate and is only significant for large contracts with long durations.\n\nThere are certain risks which, due to their nature, cannot be adequately addressed or mitigated by additional capital, and are therefore not considered in the internal risk capital model. For the identification, analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks, we also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally based on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses. Strategic,  liquidity and reputational risk are the most important of these other risks.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company's value arising from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their implementation.\n\nStrategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Allianz Group's and Allianz SE's Top Risk Assessment processes, and discussed in various Board of Management-level committees (e.g., the Group Finance and Risk Committee). We also monitor market and competitive  conditions,  capital  market  requirements,  regulatory  conditions, etc., to decide if strategic adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe most important strategic risks are directly addressed through Allianz's Renewal Agenda, which focuses on True Customer Centricity, Digital by Default, Technical Excellence, Growth Engines, and Inclusive Meritocracy. Progress on mitigating strategic risks and meeting the Renewal Agenda objectives is monitored and evaluated in the course of the Strategic and Planning Dialogue between Allianz SE's Board of Management and the operative functions of Allianz SE. To the extent that the topic of new growth areas leads to takeover and acquisition transactions and large single investments, it is of particular importance to Allianz SE. In addition, in reinsurance, the subject of technical excellence in particular was addressed through specific measures ('Allianz Reinsurance Transformation').\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that current or future payment obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of adversely altered conditions. Liquidity risk can arise primarily if there are mismatches in the timing of cash in- and outflows.\n\nThe investment strategy of Allianz SE particularly focuses on the quality of investments, and ensures a significant portion of liquid assets in the portfolio (for example, high-rated government or covered bonds). We employ actuarial methods to estimate our liabilities arising  from  reinsurance  and internal pension contracts. In our liquidity\n\nplanning process, we reconcile liquidity sources (such as dividends received from subsidiaries, cash from investments and premiums) and liquidity needs (including payments due to dividends to shareholders, reinsurance claims and expenses) under a best-estimate plan as well as under idiosyncratic and systemic adverse liquidity scenarios.\n\nThe main goal of planning and managing Allianz SE's liquidity position is to ensure that we are always in a position to meet payment obligations.  To  comply  with  this  objective,  the  liquidity  position  of Allianz SE is monitored and forecasted on a daily basis.\n\nAllianz SE's  short-term  liquidity  is  managed  within  Allianz SE's cash pool, which serves as a central tool also for investing the excess liquidity of other Group companies. The accumulated short-term liquidity forecast is updated daily. The cash position in this portfolio is subject to an absolute minimum liquidity threshold and an absolute target liquidity threshold. Both thresholds are defined for the Allianz SE cash pool in order to be protected against short-term liquidity crises.\n\nAs part of our liquidity stress testing framework, contingent liquidity requirements and sources of liquidity are considered to ensure that Allianz SE is able to meet any future payment obligations even under adverse conditions. Major contingent liquidity requirements include non-availability of external capital markets, combined market and catastrophe risk scenarios for subsidiaries as well as lower than expected profit transfers and dividends from subsidiaries.\n\nIn order to protect Allianz Group against the liquidity impact of adverse risk events beyond those covered by the capital and liquidity buffers at our subsidiaries, Allianz SE holds a strategic liquidity reserve for which the target level is reevaluated annually.\n\nThe strategic liquidity planning for Allianz SE, which covers the periods  of one calendar year (more granular) and three calendar years, is regularly reported to the Board of Management.\n\n## Reputational risk\n\nAllianz SE's reputation as a well-regarded and socially aware holding and reinsurance company is influenced by our behavior in a range of  areas,  such  as  financial  performance,  quality  of  reinsurance underwriting and customer service, corporate governance, employee relations, intellectual capital, and corporate responsibility.\n\nReputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of the Allianz share price, the value of the inforce business, or the value of the future business caused by a decline in our reputation in internal or external stakeholders' judgement.\n\nThe Allianz Group has defined sensitive business areas and corresponding risk guidelines that are binding for Allianz SE and the other affiliated companies of the Allianz Group. All affected Allianz SE functions cooperate in identifying reputational risk. Group Communications and Reputation (GCORE) assesses reputational risk for Allianz SE based on a group-wide methodology, covering all areas of reputational  risk,  including  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG) risks.\n\nThe identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of the annual Top Risk Assessment (TRA) process. As part of this process, senior management approves the risk management strategy for the most significant risks facing the company, including those with a potentially  severe reputational impact. In addition, significant ESG and other reputational risks identified in the course of business (direct reputational risk) are managed on a case-by-case basis.",

        "page_content": "For further details on our key ESG integration processes, please refer to the 'ESG Approach' and 'Climate Change Strategy' sections of the Non-Financial Statement.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate  change  has  the  potential  to  materially  affect  the  global economy and the business of Allianz Group and Allianz SE, especially in the long run. Risks arising from climate change can already be seen today, and their relevance will increase over the mid- and long-term.\n\nThe most significant risks that have a material impact on our business, or we expect will have in the future, are:\n\n- -Physical risks: These can for instance be acute and chronic, such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves and droughts, or a change in vector-borne diseases, with impacts on property, life or health.\n- -Transitional risks: These risks result from the cross-sectoral structural change stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Transitional risks include changes in climate policy, technology, or market sentiment, and the impact of this on the market value of financial assets as well as the impact from climate change litigation.\n\nThese risks impact the reinsurance business of Allianz SE in two key ways:\n\n- -firstly,  through  the  exposure  within  reinsurance  contracts,  e.g., physical damages, prolonged business interruptions, and other losses and\n- -secondly, through changes in market sectors and business models.\n\nFurthermore, the Allianz Group and Allianz SE are affected as largescale institutional investors with significant stakes in various economies, companies, infrastructure, and real estate that might be affected by the physical impact of climate change and by the transition to a low-carbon economy. This can directly influence the ability of assets to generate long-term value.\n\nWe address immediate risks from climate change factors following the management approach for the primary underlying risks, (i.e., financial risks, premium or reserve risks, reputational risks, etc.), e.g., building on Allianz's long-term expertise in the modeling of extreme weather events or analyzing emission profiles of our proprietary investments. For example, the carbon footprint of our investee companies reported in our climate disclosure serves as a starting point for an analysis of the exposure to emissions pricing. Our commitment to align our proprietary investment portfolio to 1.5\u00b0C climate scenarios is an effective means to address our transition risk exposure over the years. As another example, as part of our reputational risk management, we review and evaluate social and environmental effects, including climate change issues, arising from our business activities and business relations through the ESG business integration approach described above.\n\nOn  a  forward-looking  basis,  we  consider  risks  from  climate change factors under emerging risks, where we closely monitor the development of the risk landscape supported by selective analyses of our portfolios. In this regard, we are developing different approaches\n\ntowards scenario analysis to further educate our understanding of how climate change risks may unfold in the future.\n\nClimate change also creates opportunities, be it in connection with financing a low-carbon and climate-resilient future (e.g., by investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency in real estate, and electric vehicle infrastructure), or by providing insurance solutions to protect against physical climate impacts and to support low-carbon business models.\n\n## Internal risk capital framework\n\nWe define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the basis for determining our Solvency II regulatory capitalization. We calculate  Allianz SE's internal risk capital on a quarterly basis, both overall and for all contributing business units. We also project risk capital requirements regularly between reporting periods in times of financial market turbulence.\n\nWe utilize an approach that reflects the Solvency II rules for the management of our risk profile and solvency position.\n\n## Internal model\n\nOur internal risk capital model is based on a Value at Risk (VaR) approach using a Monte Carlo simulation. Following this approach, we  determine the maximum loss in portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe ('holding period', set at one year) and probability of occurrence ('confidence level', set at 99.5 %). We simulate risk events from all risk categories modeled ('sources of risk'), and calculate the portfolio value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including risk-mitigating measures like retrocession or derivatives, under each scenario.\n\nThe required risk capital is defined as the difference between the current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse conditions at the 99.5 % confidence level. As we simultaneously consider the impact of a negative or positive event on all covered businesses, diversification effects across products and regions are considered. The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk, both separately and in aggregate. We also analyze  several  predefined  stress  scenarios,  representing  historical events, reverse stress tests, and adverse scenarios relevant for our portfolio.  Furthermore, we conduct ad hoc stress tests to reflect current political and financial developments, and to analyze specific nonfinancial risks more closely.\n\n## Coverage of the risk capital calculations\n\nAllianz SE's  internal  risk  capital  model  covers  the  activities  of Allianz SE as the holding company for Allianz Group as well as its activities as a reinsurer.\n\nWhereas the model treats most subsidiaries as participations, it applies a look-through rule for 32 subsidiaries and investment funds, which are ancillary to Allianz SE's operations (mainly by holding assets), and reflects their risks - either in full or in part - on a granular level.\n\nThe  risk  capital  model  covers  all  relevant  assets  (including fixed-income instruments, equities, real estate, and derivatives) and",

        "page_content": "liabilities (including the run-off of all technical provisions as well as deposits, issued debt and other liabilities such as guarantees).\n\nTherefore, Allianz SE's risk capital framework covers all material and quantifiable risks. Risks specifically not covered by our internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks.\n\n## Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment\n\nWhen calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities (excluding pensions obligations), the assumptions regarding the underlying riskfree yield curve are crucial in determining and discounting future cash flows. For extrapolation of the risk-free interest rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor, we apply the methodology provided by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in its technical documentation (EIOPA BoS-20/109). 1\n\nIn addition, we partially adjust the risk-free yield curves of the reinsurance portfolio using a volatility adjustment (VA) for most markets where a volatility adjustment is defined by EIOPA and approved by BaFin. This is done to better reflect the underlying economics of our business. The advantage of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return, and earning this additional yield component over the duration of the bonds. Being a long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of the forced selling of debt instruments at a loss prior to maturity.\n\nWe take account of this by applying the volatility adjustment to mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less meaningful for long-term investors than the default risk. The Allianz Group also models the volatility adjustment dynamically within its approved internal model, which differs from the static EIOPA VA concept applied in the standard formula. For risk capital calculations, a dynamic movement of the volatility adjustment is assumed that is broadly consistent with the way the VA would react in practice/uni003B however, the movement is based on our own portfolio rather than the EIOPA portfolio. To account for this deviation, the Allianz Group applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the dynamic volatility adjustment.\n\n## Diversification and correlation assumptions\n\nOur internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and correlation effects when aggregating results for Allianz SE. The resulting diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses are not likely to materialize at the same time.\n\nDiversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks that are not, or only partly, interdependent. Important diversification factors include regions (for example, windstorm risks), risk categories (for example, market risk versus underwriting risk), and subcategories within the same risk category (for example, equity risk versus interest rate risk). Ultimately, diversification is driven by the specific features of the investments or reinsurance transactions in question and their respective risk exposures. For example, an operational risk event at the Allianz SE branch in Singapore can be considered to be highly independent of a change in the credit spread for a French government bond held in Allianz SE's reinsurance investment portfolio in Munich.\n\nWhere possible, the Allianz Group derives correlation parameters for each pair of market risks through statistical analysis of historical market data, considering observations over more than a decade. In\n\ncases where historical data or other portfolio-specific observations are  insufficient  or  unavailable,  correlations  are  set  by  the  Allianz Group Correlation Setting Committee, which combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined and controlled process. In  general, when using expert judgment, we set the correlation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks under adverse conditions. Based on these correlations, the Allianz Group uses an industry-standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied Monte Carlo simulation.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nOur internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability inflation, mortality, morbidity, longevity, policyholder behavior, expenses, etc. We use our own internal historical data for actuarial assumptions  wherever possible, leverage expertise of other Allianz Group companies in the scope of the internal model, and also consider recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, and actuarial associations. The derivation of our actuarial assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods. Within our internal risk capital and financial reporting framework, comprehensive processes and controls exist for ensuring the reliability of these assumptions.\n\n## Model limitations\n\nAs the internal model is based on a 99.5 % confidence level, there is a low statistical probability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this threshold at the Allianz SE level in the course of one year.\n\nWe use model and scenario parameters derived from historical data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events. If future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past - for example, in an unprecedented crisis, or as a possible result of severe structural breaks resulting from climate change - our VaR approach might be too conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to predict. In order to mitigate reliance on historical data, we complement our VaR analysis with stress testing.\n\nFurthermore, we validate the model and parameters through sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews, and - where appropriate - independent external reviews, focusing on methods for selecting parameters and control processes. Overall, we believe that our validation efforts are effective, and that the model adequately assesses the risks to which we are exposed.\n\nSince the internal model considers the change in the economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate the market value of each item accurately. For some assets and liabilities, it may be difficult, if not impossible - notably in distressed financial markets - to either obtain a current market price or to apply a meaningful markto-market approach. For such assets, we apply a mark-to-model approach. For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of their values additionally depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow estimates. Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair values are appropriately assessed.\n\nWhile the aggregate risk capital is exactly modeled, the whole account stop loss construction 2 leads to the use of approximations when reporting contributory risk capital figures for the sub-categories",

This was mostly driven by the participation correlation model change decreasing equity risk and slightly compensated by pension  model  changes  (e.g.,  inflation  model  change)  increasing market risk. Model changes affecting credit and underwriting risk only had an immaterial impact, hence credit and underwriting risk remained mostly stable.\n\n## Diversification\n\nThe participation correlation model change was the main driver for the reduction of diversification between risk categories by \u20ac 109 mn.\n\nBusiness  and  operational  risk  were  not  affected  by  model changes and remained stable.\n\n## Risk profile and management assessment\n\nThe quantitative risk profile of Allianz SE is primarily dominated by market risk that results from its non-traded insurance participations when measured in a manner consistent with the treatment of participations under Solvency II (e.g., without looking through to the underlying risks behind the participations). In order to provide greater transparency, the Group risk figures as reflected in the Allianz Group\n\nAnnual Report can be interpreted as a 'look-through' view at the consolidated risk profile represented by all of the Group's participations as well as those risks unique to Allianz SE. The second largest risk for Allianz SE from an internal model perspective is the underwriting risk arising from its reinsurance business and from internal pension obligations.  From  a  broad  perspective,  the  overall  risk  profile  of Allianz SE has remained and is expected to remain stable. 'Stable' in this context means a relatively high exposure to market risk, in particular from participations equity generated by our holding of Allianz Group subsidiaries, a high exposure to underwriting risk, and moderate exposures to operational risk and credit risk (i.e., measured as a share of the Allianz SE's Solvency II risk capital). Please refer to the section 'Solvency II regulatory capitalization' for further details.\n\nTo support the development of a risk appetite and a risk management framework for these core risks, Allianz SE has elaborated the following risk management philosophy:\n\n- -Financial  risks: Allianz SE's  objective  is  to  support  the  Group strategy while ensuring that financial risk-taking is in line with its risk-bearing capacity. To manage financial risk effectively, it is essential to clearly identify, measure, monitor and control the risks inherent, especially in the investment portfolios, financing transactions, the reinsurance portfolio and the internal pension obligations.\n- -Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are accepted when acting as a reinsurer for predominantly group-internal business. Quality control mechanisms are applied to ensure adherence to the Allianz Group's underwriting standards, and to monitor the quality of the portfolio, the underwriting and retrocession processes. These processes must support sustainable and profitable business decisions, and need to be aligned with the risk appetite of Allianz SE and the Allianz Group as well as to avoid undesired and/or excessive risks and accumulations. The full economic consequences of a pandemic event such as COVID-19 are uninsurable. The required capital for effective protection against such an accumulation of risks would require premium rates that are unattractive for the customers, if not unaffordable. In addition, a pandemic affects multiple lines of business, such as business interruption, travel, event cancellations, but also liability lines as well as increases in medical costs and mortality. On topof this, the impact on capital markets needs consideration.\n- -Other non-financial risks: These risks are inherent to Allianz SE as holding company and reinsurer for the Allianz Group, and need to be carefully managed via continuous improvements in risk identification,  risk  assessment  and  control  environments.  This  occurs through elements of the risk management framework, such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA), Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS), Reputational Risk Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management.\n\nFinancial markets are characterized by historically low interest rates and low risk premiums, causing some investors to look for higheryielding - and potentially higher-risk - investments. In addition to sustained low interest rates, there are several other factors that may lead to increasing market volatility. These include the challenges of",

Another  potential source of higher market volatility is the uncertainty around whether the currently observed higher rates of inflation are transitory, and the associated timing and extent of corresponding central bank policy measures.\n\nThe increasing reliance on digital technologies, which has been greatly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic - to ensure business continuity, and enhance efficiency and competitiveness - increases the risk of technology obsolescence, cyberattacks, data breaches,  and system failures. There is also the risk of noncompliance with increasing regulation covering IT-related business processes.\n\nThe lasting uncertainty around the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant risk. Full economic recovery is not expected to occur until the health concerns are forcefully and credibly removed, i.e., highly effective medication is available or herd immunity is achieved. The timing and progress remain uncertain, and residual risks will remain, such as further virus mutations, length of immunity from vaccination, and a lasting refusal to take vaccines by too great a part of the population, as most authorities do not intend to make vaccination  compulsory.  Renewed  or  modified  containment  (lockdown)  measures  risk  delaying  economic  recovery,  with  significant credit implications in some industries. The pace and timing of recovery, the overall economic cost, and credit implications will depend on an effective transition to post-COVID-19 policies, as less supportive fiscal packages could hurt employment and the solvency of small or more exposed businesses.\n\nTherefore, we continue to closely monitor political and financial developments as well as the global trade situation in order to manage our overall risk profile to specific event risks.\n\nOur approved internal model has been applied since the beginning of the year 2016, when Solvency II became effective.\n\nIn addition, future Solvency II capital requirements are expected to change as a result of the review of the Solvency II framework. Concrete effects of the Solvency II review for Allianz SE can, however, only be assessed after final results are available and adopted in national legislation, which is expected to take place in 2025.\n\n## Management assessment\n\nAllianz SE's management feels comfortable with Allianz SE's overall risk profile, and is confident that the effectiveness of its risk management framework meets both the challenges of a rapidly changing environment and the day-to-day business needs. This confidence is based on several factors:\n\n- -Due to its effective capital management, Allianz SE is well capitalized. We have met our internal and regulatory solvency targets as of 31 December 2021.\n- -Allianz SE has a conservative investment profile and disciplined business practices in the reinsurance business, leading to sustainable operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile.\n- -Allianz SE is well positioned to deal with potentially adverse future events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic -  due to our strong internal limit framework, stress testing, internal model, and risk management practices.\n\nBased on the information available to us at the moment of report completion, we expect Allianz SE to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and the Minimum Capital Requirement. We also expect to maintain a robust liquidity buffer in case of short term market volatility. However, we  are  carefully  monitoring  the  development  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  and  managing  our  investment  portfolio  to  ensure  that Allianz SE has sufficient resources to meet its solvency capital and liquidity needs.\n\nAllianz SE's own funds and capital requirements are based on the market value balance sheet approach consistent with the economic principles of Solvency II. 1 Our regulatory capitalization is shown in the following table:\n\n## Allianz SE: Solvency II regulatory capitalization\n\n| as of 31 December    |      |   2021/uni00B9 |   2020/uni00B2 |\n|----------------------|------|----------------|----------------|\n| Own funds            | \u20ac bn |           94.8 |             95 |\n| Capital requirement  | \u20ac bn |           36.4 |             37 |\n| Capitalization ratio | %    |          260   |            257 |\n\n- 1\\_Excluding the application of transitional measures for the valuation of technical provisions at other Allianz Group companies.\n- 2\\_2020 risk profile figures as reported previously.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Solvency II capitalization of Allianz SE stands at 260 %. The increase of 3 percentage points in 2021 was mainly caused by a \u20ac 0.6 bn decrease in solvency risk capital.\n\nThe  Allianz  Group  companies  Allianz  Lebensversicherungs-AG and  Allianz  Private Krankenversicherungs-AG have been granted approval for the application of transitionals on technical provisions. The resulting change in participation values impacts Allianz SE's own funds and capital requirements. Including the application of transitional measures for technical provisions at these Allianz Group companies,  Allianz SE's  own  funds  and  capital  requirement  amounted  to \u20ac 107.2 bn and \u20ac 40.5 bn, leading to a Solvency II ratio of 265 %. However,  the  general  capital  steering  for  both  the  Allianz  Group  and Allianz SE continues to focus on the previous approach, i.e., excluding the application of transitional measures for technical provisions at Allianz Group companies. Consequently, the figures in all subsequent sections exclude transitional measures applied at Allianz Group companies unless otherwise stated.",

All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis, and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly.\n\nThe following table presents the market risk of Allianz SE related to the source of risk:\n\n## Allianz SE: Risk profile - Market risk by source of risk pre-diversified, \u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December   | 2021   | 2020/uni00B9   |\n|---------------------|--------|----------------|\n| Interest rate       | (3)    | 28             |\n| Inflation           | (425)  | (242)          |\n| Credit spread       | 146    | 251            |\n| Equity              | 35,283 | 34,688         |\n| Real estate         | 128    | 123            |\n| Currency            | 39     | 141            |\n| Total Allianz SE    | 35,169 | 34,989         |\n\n- 1\\_2020 risk profile figures adjusted based on the 2021 model changes.\n\nFor  Allianz SE,  the  pre-diversified  market  risk  as  of  year-end  2021 shows an increase of \u20ac 180 mn driven by higher equity risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nIn 2021, the interest rate risk reduced the market risk of Allianz SE by \u20ac 3 mn. The change in comparison to the previous year (\u20ac (31) mn) is mainly caused by diversification effects.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, Allianz SE's interest-rate-sensitive assets amounting to a market value of \u20ac 46.1 bn would have gained \u20ac 2.7 bn or lost \u20ac 2.4 bn in value, in the event of interest rates changing by -100 and +100 basis points respectively.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nThe \u20ac 183 mn increase in the market risk relief that results from inflation risk in 2021 mainly results from diversification effects.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nIn 2021, Allianz SE's equity risk increased by \u20ac 595 mn, reflecting an overall higher market value of participations in Allianz Group companies. This change includes a \u20ac 2.8 bn after-tax provision for the Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC Structured Alpha matter.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, those of our investment assets that are sensitive to changing equity markets would have lost \u20ac 527 mn in value, assuming equity markets declined by 30 %.",

        "page_content": "## Credit spread risk\n\nAllianz SE's credit spread risk is \u20ac 105 mn lower than in 2020, mainly due to lower bond investments.\n\n## Real estate risk\n\nThe \u20ac 5 mn increase in 2021 is driven by the higher market value of the real estate portfolio.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nAllianz SE's \u20ac 39 mn currency risk at year-end 2021 results from net open positions in several currencies, dominated by the U.S. dollar. The \u20ac 101 mn decrease in the contribution to market risk is mainly caused by diversification effects.\n\nAllianz SE's credit risk decreased by \u20ac 54 mn, mainly due to lower bond investments. Within the bond portfolio, there was a reallocation from government bonds to corporate bonds without a significant impact on the portfolio's credit quality.\n\nThe following table presents the pre-diversified risk calculated for underwriting risks stemming from our reinsurance business and internal pensions: 1\n\nAllianz SE: Risk Profile - Underwriting risk by source of risk pre-diversified, \u20ac mn\n\n| as of 31 December                  | 2021   | 2020/uni00B9   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|\n| Premium natural catastrophe        | 472    | 336            |\n| Premium non-catastrophe and terror | 1,928  | 1,544          |\n| Reserve                            | 1,443  | 1,655          |\n| Biometric                          | 89     | 174            |\n| Total Allianz SE                   | 3,931  | 3,710          |\n\n- 1\\_2020 risk profile figures adjusted based on the 2021 model changes.\n\nFor Allianz SE, the pre-diversified underwriting risk showed an increase of \u20ac 221 mn, driven by an increase in premium non-catastrophic risks.\n\n## Property-Casualty\n\n## Premium risk\n\nIn 2021, Allianz SE's natural catastrophe risk increased by \u20ac 136 mn due to the reinsurance of a newly acquired portfolio in Australia.\n\nThe top five scenarios contributing to Allianz SE's natural catastrophe  risk as of 31 December 2021 were a windstorm in Europe, a flood in Germany, a tropical cyclone in Australia, an earthquake in Turkey, and an earthquake in Australia.\n\nAllianz SE's non-catastrophe and terror premium risk increased by \u20ac 384 mn in 2021 due to a higher exposure from the stop loss contract with Allianz Re Dublin dac.\n\n## Reserve risk\n\nThe reduction by \u20ac 212 mn in Allianz SE's reserve risk in 2021 considers aspects including the retrocession of losses from natural catastrophes into non-proportional protections.\n\n## Life/Health\n\nIn 2021, Allianz SE's biometric risk was \u20ac 85 mn lower than in 2020. The main driver is a large life reinsurance contract from Canada which mainly covers mortality risks. Due to offsetting effects with the longevity risks of the Allianz SE pension portfolio, the overall impact of biometric risks has decreased.\n\nIn 2021, a large reinsurance contract with Canadian exposure was accepted. The transaction increased business risk by \u20ac 102 mn.\n\nThe \u20ac 13 mn decrease in operational risk resulted primarily from multiple offsetting effects, including an \u20ac 8 mn reduction in the 'Defective Products' risk category, due to a more stringent control environment.\n\nDetailed  information  regarding  Allianz SE's  liquidity  risk  exposure, liquidity, and funding - including changes in cash and cash equivalents - are provided in the chapter Liquidity and Funding Resources. As inferred from the section on the management of liquidity risks, they are quantified and monitored through regular stress test reporting, and properly managed, but are not quantified for risk capital purposes.",

        "page_content": "## INTEGRATED RISK AND CONTROL SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to \u00a7 289 (4) of the HGB.\n\nIn line with risk management and in accordance with legal requirements, we have developed a framework to identify and mitigate the risk of material errors in our financial statements (including controls  for  the  market  value  balance  sheet  and  risk  capital). Allianz SE's Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) is regularly reviewed and updated. It differentiates between three areas: Financial Reporting, Compliance, and other operational risks (including IT risks). The IT controls are based on COBIT 5 and include, for example, controls for access rights management, and for IT project and change management. The IRCS also covers external service providers. Additionally, our Entity Level Control Assessment (ELCA) framework contains controls to monitor the effectiveness of the system of governance.\n\n## Accounting processes\n\nThe accounting processes we use to produce financial statements are based on a group-wide IT solution and local general ledger. Access rights to accounting systems are managed according to strict authorization procedures.\n\nInternal controls are embedded in the accounting processes to safeguard the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the information provided in our financial statements.\n\n## Integrated internal risk and control system approach\n\nOur approach can be summarized as follows:\n\n- -We use a centrally developed risk catalogue that is linked to individual accounts. This risk catalogue is reviewed on a yearly basis and is the starting point for the definition of the Group's as well as Allianz SE's scope of financial reporting risks. The methodology is described in the IRCS guideline. During the scoping process, both materiality and susceptibility to a misstatement are considered simultaneously. In addition to the quantitative calculation, we also consider qualitative criteria.\n- -Based on the centrally provided risk catalogue, we identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements.\n- -Preventive and detective key controls to address financial reporting risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and impact of financial misstatements. If a potential risk materializes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of the financial misstatement. Given the strong dependence of financial reporting processes on IT systems, we have also implemented IT controls.\n- -Last but not least, we ensure that controls are appropriately designed and effectively executed to mitigate risk. We conduct an annual assessment of our control system to maintain and continuously enhance its effectiveness. Internal audit ensures that the overall quality of our control system is subject to regular control testing, to assure reasonable design and operating effectiveness.",

These regulatory requirements are applicable throughout the Group in accordance with the principle of proportionality. The implementation of the regulatory requirements is supported by written guidelines issued by the Board of Management of Allianz SE.

These requirements are stipulated by law, by the Statutes, or in individual cases by decisions of the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Supervisory Board approval is required, for example, for certain capital transactions, intercompany agreements, and the launch of new business segments or the closure of existing ones. Approval is also required for acquisitions of companies and holdings in companies as well as for divestments of Group companies that exceed certain threshold levels. The Agreement concerning the Participation of Employees in Allianz SE, in the version dated June 2021 (hereinafter 'SE Agreement'), requires the approval of the Supervisory Board for the appointment of the member of the Board of Management responsible for employment and social welfare.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management is described in Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management or on our  website  at www.allianz.com/management-board .

        "page_content": "## Diversity concept for the Board of Management and succession planning\n\nIn accordance with the legislation on the implementation of the European guidelines as regards the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information (CSR Directive), the diversity concept for the Board of Management, its objectives, implementation, and results achieved are to be reported.\n\nThe Supervisory Board adopted the following diversity concept for the Board of Management of Allianz SE:\n\n'For  the  composition  of  the  Management  Board,  the  Supervisory Board aims for an adequate 'Diversity of Minds'. This comprises broad diversity with regard to gender, internationality, and educational as well as professional background.\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses the achievement of such target, inter alia, on the basis of the following specific indicators:\n\n- -adequate proportion of women on the Management Board: at least 30 % by 31 December 2021/uni003B\n- -adequate share of members with an international background (e.g., based  on  origin  or  extensive  professional  experience abroad), ideally with a connection to the regions in which the Allianz Group is operating/uni003B\n- -adequate diversity with regard to educational and professional background, taking into account the limitations for the Supervisory Board by regulatory requirements (fitness).'\n\nThis diversity concept is implemented in the appointment procedure for members of the Board of Management by the Supervisory Board. For the purpose of long-term succession planning, a list of candidates is prepared and updated on an ongoing basis by the Chairperson of the Board of Management in consultation with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board. It is ensured that lists of successors will comprise appropriate percentages of female candidates as well as of candidates with international experience. The Personnel Committee takes this into consideration especially in succession planning. The list of candidates includes internal and external candidates who generally meet the requirements for a mandate in the Board of Management. In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Management, the Personnel Committee,  after a thorough examination, recommends a suitable candidate to the Supervisory Board plenary session and reports on the selection process and, if necessary, alternative candidates. Prior to an appointment to the Board of Management, all members of the Supervisory Board are given the opportunity to meet the candidate in person.\n\nAs a result of the increase in the size of the Board of Management to 11 members as of 1 January 2022, the three female members of the Board of Management account for 27.27 % of the total, which is slightly below the target value of 30 %. Since this shortfall is expected to be of a temporary nature only, the Supervisory Board considers it acceptable.  Five  members  of  the  Management  Board  have  international backgrounds. There is an adequate degree of variety as regards educational and professional backgrounds. The Board of Management of Allianz SE is thus, with the exception of the temporary shortfall of the\n\nadequate proportion of women on the Management Board, composed in accordance with the diversity concept.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nThe Allianz Group has an effective internal risk and control system for verifying  and  monitoring  its  operating  activities  and  business  processes, in particular financial reporting, as well as compliance with regulatory requirements. The requirements placed on the internal control system are essential, not only for the resilience and franchise value of the company, but also to maintain the confidence of the capital market, our customers, and the public. An assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the System of Governance is conducted regularly in the course of the review of the business organization. For further information on our risk organization and risk principles, please refer to the section 'Risk governance system' in the Risk and Opportunity Report. For further information on our Integrated Risk and Control System for Financial Reporting, please refer to the respective chapter.\n\nIn addition, the quality of our internal control system is assessed by the Allianz Group's Internal Audit function. This function conducts independent, objective assurance activities, analyzing the structure and efficiency of the internal control system as a whole. In addition, it also examines the potential for additional value and improvement of our  organization's operations. Fully compliant with all international auditing  principles  and  standards,  Internal  Audit  contributes  to  the evaluation and improvement of the effectiveness of the risk management, control, and governance processes. Therefore, internal audit activities are geared towards helping the company to mitigate risks, and further assist in strengthening its governance processes and structures.\n\nIntegrity is at the core of our compliance programs and the basis for the trust of our customers, shareholders, business partners, and employees. The Compliance function fosters a corporate culture of individual and collective responsibility for ethical conduct and adherence to the rules by:\n\n- -advising the Board of Management, managers, and employees on business conduct that is lawful and ethical/uni003B\n- -identifying and assessing material compliance risks and overseeing the implementation of adequate and effective internal controls to mitigate them/uni003B\n- -providing a speak-up facility that employees and third parties can use to confidentially report possible illegal or inappropriate behavior/uni003B\n- -communicating transparently and trustfully with supervisory authorities.\n\nThe global compliance programs coordinated by Allianz SE's central Group Compliance function support our employees, managers, and executive board members to act responsibly and with integrity in all situations.",

        "page_content": "Moreover,  Allianz SE's central Group Compliance function is responsible - in close cooperation with local compliance functions for ensuring the effective implementation and monitoring of the compliance programs within the Allianz Group as well as for investigating potential compliance infringements. Furthermore, as a key function, the Compliance function carries out the advisory, risk identification and assessment, monitoring, and early warning tasks required under the Solvency II regime.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nOur  Code  of  Conduct  and  the  internal  compliance  policies  and guidelines derived from it provide all employees, managers, and executive board members with clear and practical guidance, enabling them to act in line with the values of the Allianz Group. The rules of conduct established by the Code of Conduct are binding for all employees worldwide and build the basis for our compliance programs.  The  Code  of  Conduct  is  available  on  our  website  at www.allianz.com/compliance .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Speak up\n\nA major component of the Allianz Group's compliance management system is a speak-up facility that allows employees and third parties to  notify the relevant compliance department confidentially about potential illegal or inappropriate conduct. No employee voicing concerns about irregularities in good faith needs to fear retribution, even if the concerns later turn out to be unfounded. Third parties can contact the compliance department via an electronic mailbox on our website www.allianz.com/complaint-system.\n\n## Compliance programs\n\nAllianz SE's central Group Compliance function has set up internal guidelines for the following identified compliance risk areas: financial crime, market integrity, customer protection, and compliance with legal requirements. For further information on the compliance risk areas, please refer to the Sustainability Report on our website at www.allianz.com/sustainability .\n\n## Compliance training\n\nIn order to convey the principles of the Code of Conduct and the compliance programs based on these principles, Allianz has implemented interactive training programs around the world. These provide practical guidance that enables employees to make their own decisions based on internal and external requirements as well as ethical principles. Training programs comprise in-person and e-learning training and are delivered in several languages.\n\nTraining courses to prevent corruption and money laundering are mandatory for all Allianz employees worldwide. The same is true for the antitrust training to exposed employees. Further training exist for the other compliance programs.\n\n## Function of the Supervisory Board and the composition and functions of committees\n\nThe  German  Co-Determination  Act  ('Mitbestimmungsgesetz')  does not apply to Allianz SE because it has the legal form of a European Company (SE). Instead, the size and composition of the Supervisory Board is determined by general European SE regulations. These regulations are implemented in the Statutes and via the SE Agreement.\n\nThe Supervisory Board comprises twelve members, including six shareholder representatives appointed by the AGM. The six employee representatives are appointed by the SE works council. The specific procedure for their appointment is laid down in the SE Agreement. This agreement stipulates that the six employee representatives must be allocated in proportion to the number of Allianz employees in the different countries. The Supervisory Board currently in office includes four employee representatives from Germany and one each from France and the United Kingdom. According to \u00a7 17 (2) of the German SE  Implementation  Act  ('SE-Ausf\u00fchrungsgesetz'),  the  Supervisory Board of Allianz SE shall be composed of at least 30 % women and at least 30 % men. For the future, the AGM on 5 May 2021 resolved to shorten the regular term of appointment for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE to four years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Board of Management on managing the business. It is also responsible for appointing  the members of the Board of Management, determining their overall remuneration, succession planning for the Board of Management, and reviewing Allianz SE's and the Allianz Group's annual financial statements. The Supervisory Board's activities in the financial year 2021, including an individualized disclosure of the meeting participation, are described in the Supervisory Board Report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board takes all decisions based on a simple majority. The special requirements for appointing members to the Board of Management, as stipulated in the German Co-Determination Act, and the requirement to have a Conciliation Committee, do not apply to an SE. In the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who at Allianz SE must be a shareholder representative. If the Chairperson is not present in the event of a tie, the casting vote lies with the vice chairperson from the shareholder side. A second vice chairperson is elected at the employee representatives' proposal.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities.  The review is carried out either on the basis of a selfevaluation using a questionnaire or by consulting an external consultant. The entire Supervisory Board discusses recommendations for improvements and adopts appropriate measures on the basis of recommendations from the Standing Committee. In addition, the fitness and propriety of the individual members of the Supervisory Board are reviewed as part of an annual self-evaluation required by supervisory law, and a development plan for the Supervisory Board is drawn up on this basis.",

In addition to the skills profile for the overall Supervisory Board, the diversity concept\n\n## Objectives of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board regarding its composition\n\n'The aim of Allianz SE's Supervisory Board is to have members who are equipped with the necessary skills and competence to properly supervise and advise Allianz SE's management. Supervisory Board candidates should possess the professional expertise and experience, integrity, motivation and commitment, independence, and personality required to successfully carry out the responsibilities of a Supervisory Board member in a financial services institution with international operations.\n\nThese objectives take into account the regulatory requirements for the composition of the Supervisory Board as well as the relevant recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code ('GCGC'). In addition to the requirements for each individual member, a profile of skills and expertise ('Kompetenzprofil') as well as a diversity concept are provided for the entire Supervisory Board.\n\n## I. Requirements relating to the individual members of the Supervisory Board\n\n## 1. Propriety\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board must be proper as defined by the regulatory provisions. A person is assumed to be proper as long as no facts are to be known which may cause impropriety.

In case shareholder representatives and employee representatives are viewed separately, at least four of each should be independent.\n\nIt has to be considered that the possible emergence of conflicts of interests in individual cases cannot generally be excluded. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board and will be resolved by appropriate measures.\n\n## 4.

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board pursues these objectives, and thus also the diversity concept, when nominating candidates for shareholder representatives. As employee representatives are appointed according to different national provisions, there is only limited potential influence to the selection of employee representatives. The Supervisory Board of Allianz SE is currently composed in accordance with these objectives, including the diversity concept. According to the assessment by the Supervisory Board, all shareholder representatives, i.e., Ms. Boissard, Ms. Bosse  as  well  as  Mr. Diekmann,  Dr. Eichiner,  Mr. Hainer  and\n\nMr. Snabe, are independent within the meaning of the objectives (see No. I.3).

Each year, an ordinary AGM takes place at which the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board give an account of the preceding financial year. For special decisions, the German Stock Corporation Act provides for the convening of an extraordinary AGM.\n\n## Accounting and auditing\n\nThe Allianz Group prepares its accounts according to \u00a7 315e of the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB') on the basis of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE  are prepared in accordance with German law and accounting rules.\n\nIn compliance with the special legal provisions that applied to insurance companies until fiscal year 2021, the auditor of the annual financial statements and of the half-yearly financial report have been appointed by the Supervisory Board, not the AGM. In the future, such appointment will be the responsibility of the AGM. The audit of the financial  statements  covers  the  individual financial statements of Allianz SE  and the consolidated financial statements of the Allianz Group.\n\nWe inform our shareholders, financial analysts, the media, and the general public about the company's situation on a regular basis and in a timely manner. The annual financial statements of Allianz SE, the Allianz Group's consolidated financial statements, and the respective management reports are publicly available within 90 days of the end of each financial year. Additional information is provided in the Allianz Group's half-yearly financial reports and quarterly statements. Information is also made available at the AGM, at telephone conferences for analysts and journalists, and on the Allianz Group's website. Our website also provides a financial calendar listing the dates of major publications and events, such as annual reports, half-yearly financial reports, and quarterly statements, AGMs, and analyst conference calls as well as financial press conferences.\n\nYou  can  find  the  2022  financial  calendar  on  our  website  at www.allianz.com/financialcalendar .\n\n## Information in accordance with the German Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Executive Positions in the Private and the Public Sector\n\nThis section outlines the targets set for Allianz SE and the other companies of the Allianz Group in Germany that are subject to co-determination (the 'subsidiaries concerned') for the Supervisory Board, the Board of Management, and the two management levels below the Board of Management.\n\nArticle 17 (2) of the German SE Implementation Act stipulates that as of 1 January 2016, the share of women and men among the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE must each total up to at least 30 %. The Supervisory Board currently in office fulfills this requirement as it includes four women (33 %) and eight men (67 %).\n\nIn August 2017, the Supervisory Board set a target for the percentage of women on Allianz SE's Board of Management at 30 % to be achieved by 31 December 2021. As of 31 December 2021, the percentage of women on Allianz SE's Board of Management decreased to 20 % due to the resignation of Ms. Hunt from the Management Board. In light of the appointment of Ms. Boshnakova as member of the Board of Management as of 1 January 2022, and the resulting increase in the size of the Board of Management to 11 members, the percentage of women on the Board of Management increased to 27.27 %.\n\nAs regards the proportion of women on the first and second management levels below the Board of Management, the Board of Management of Allianz SE has set a target of 20 % and 30 %, respectively, to be met by 31 December 2021. As of 31 December 2021, this target was met for the first management level, with a percentage of women of 29 %, but could not be met on the second level with a percentage of 26 %. The first two management levels below the Board of Management comprise a very small comparative group of executives. No suitable female candidates could be identified for the very few positions that became vacant in the period considered.\n\nIn the longer term, Allianz aims to place women in at least 30 % of the positions at these two management levels throughout the Group.\n\nWith regard to the Supervisory Boards of the subsidiaries concerned, the target quotas for eight out of nine subsidiaries concerned were set at 30 % and the target quota for the remaining subsidiary concerned was set at 33 % for 31 December 2021. Seven of the nine subsidiaries reached this target as of 31 December 2021. The target quotas for the respective Board of Management of the subsidiaries concerned  were  between  20 %  and  30 %  (24 %  on  average)  for 31 December 2021 and were met by seven of the nine companies as of  31 December 2021.  For  the  two  management  levels  below  the Board of Management, the respective Boards of Management of the subsidiaries concerned had set target quotas between 17 % and 33 % (23 % on average) for 31 December 2021 for the first management level and target quotas between 20 % and 33 % (26 % on average) for 31 December 2021 for the second management level below the Board of Management. As of 31 December 2021, the targets were met by seven of the nine subsidiaries concerned at the first management level, while six of the nine companies met the targets set for the second  management  level.  Despite  increased  efforts  to  promote women in the Allianz Group and also at the individual subsidiaries, it was not possible to achieve the targets in these cases, as it was not always possible to identify suitable female candidates for all vacant positions. Allianz continues to work to achieve these targets.",

Directive 2014/95/EU). It focuses on the concepts and key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect our most material sustainability issues. The KPIs included are: Net Promoter Score (NPS)/uni003B Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX)/uni003B environmental indicators -  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per employee and percentage of renewable electricity/uni003B the carbon footprint of our proprietary investment portfolio for listed equities and corporate bonds/uni003B and the E.U. taxonomy eligibility indicators for our underwriting, proprietary investments and third-party assets. Emerging consumers is no longer considered to be one of the material topics and is not covered in this report.\n\nThe concepts contained in this report are in line with the content of our Group Sustainability Report 2021, which is compiled in accordance with the standards set out by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and will be published on 29 April 2022.\n\nThis non-financial section of our 2021 Annual Report covers the entire Allianz Group and also includes the relevant non-financial information for Allianz SE. All measures, activities and key figures refer to the 2021 financial year (1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021). Where appropriate, we compare our targets set in the previous year with the achievements from this year and define our targets for next year. Unless otherwise stated, we use the control principle defined by the International Financial Reporting Standards when determining the scope of our reporting for the Allianz Group.\n\nThis non-financial statement is an integral part of the management report and, as such, is subject to the statutory audit of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft.\n\nAny references to information published outside the Group Management Report and Allianz SE's Management Report are supplementary, do not form an integral part of this non-financial information, and are not subject to any assurance engagement (unless specified in the respective document).\n\n## Company description\n\nWe provide property-casualty and life/health insurance as well as asset management products and services to our customers around the world. In our activities as a financial services provider, we take sustainability-related risks such as climate change into consideration and pursue opportunities from sustainability trends. We describe our management approach to these matters in this section.\n\nFor further information on our business model, see our Business Operations chapter in the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2021, and  our  Group  Sustainability Report 2021, section 01.2\n\n- https://www.allianz.com/en/sustainability.html .\n\n## Corporate sustainability governance and strategy\n\nWe create sustainable economic value by pursuing a long-term approach to environmental stewardship, social responsibility and corporate governance. This is critical to our business success as we deliver on our promises to our stakeholders - in particular our customers, employees, investors and communities. We continually adapt our business strategy and sustainability approach to address evolving and emerging issues to deliver on our purpose 'We secure your future' .\n\nAs the Group's parent company, the ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE. To support the Board of Management in its respective decision-making process, Allianz SE has established a dedicated Group Sustainability Board (known until January 2022 as the Group ESG Board) as an advisor on all matters around sustainability. It is composed of members of the Board of Management of Allianz SE and Group Center heads, and meets at least quarterly. The core responsibilities of the Group Sustainability Board are: Preparing the overall framework for sustainability for the Allianz Group, aligning sustainability (ESG) integration into the Allianz Group's business processes with Allianz as an organization (operations and organization) and Allianz as a financial institution (investment, insurance, asset management) as well as related internal and external communication. Furthermore, it assumes responsibility for the oversight and steering of overarching sustainability matters, such as topics concerning the climate, society and governance.\n\nThe work of the Group Sustainability Board is also supported by corporate functions and operating entities, which implement sustainability matters in their activities.\n\nAs a further measure to strengthen sustainability matters within the Allianz Group, in 2021, the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE established its Sustainability Committee to oversee ESG issues, to advise the Board of Management on ethical standards concerning the usage of data (Data Ethics), and to monitor the Board of Management's sustainability strategy. It supports with sustainability-related target setting and performance reviews for Board of Management remuneration.\n\nOther Board of Management committees play an important role in decision-making processes:\n\n- -The Group Finance and Risk Committee oversees risk management and monitoring, including sustainability risk.\n- -The  Group  Underwriting  Committee  monitors  the  underwriting business and related risk management, including sustainabilityrelated matters.\n- -The Group Investment Committee focuses on fundamental investment-related topics, including sustainability-related matters",

These KPIs are also used for steering local entities. For further details about the remuneration system, please refer to the 'Variable Remuneration System' in the Remuneration Report of the Annual Report 2021.\n\nIn January 2021, responsibility for the sustainability agenda was assigned by the Board of Management of Allianz SE to the new Global Sustainability function. Global Sustainability leads, coordinates, supports, and/or orchestrates the Allianz's Group Centers and operating entities to effectively integrate the Group's strategic sustainability approach and policies into their business processes.\n\nAs of the reporting cycle 2021, responsibility for sustainability reporting shifted from Global Sustainability to Group Accounting and Reporting, which collaborates closely with Global Sustainability to produce this report. In June 2021, a Sustainable Operations function was established within Group Operations and IT. The new department will strengthen the sustainability approach of operating entities with a primary focus on IT infrastructure and applications, facility management, procurement, and business travel.\n\nTo make a positive impact on society, we must understand and respond to the changing context in which we operate. Our materiality assessment enables us to stay on top of trends, and to align our approach, reporting and strategy with the sustainability issues that are most important to our stakeholders and our businesses. We have recognized  six  relevant  stakeholder  groups:  customers,  employees, NGOs, media, rating agencies, and some of our peers performing the best in terms of their materiality assessments, according to one leading sustainability rating.\n\nWe consider the outcomes of the materiality assessment in our sustainability approach, strategy and reporting. This drives us to focus on the risks, opportunities, issues and impacts that matter most to our key stakeholders and which we have the ability to influence.\n\nOur most recent assessment was carried out in 2021 in line with the GRI standard. Our improved approach used an increasing number of data sources as well as data points within these sources.\n\nWe identified 19 material issues which were prioritized as having either high or medium importance. Topics are ranked and presented in  a  materiality  matrix  according  to  German  Commercial  Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch  -  HGB')  requirements  and  based  on  stakeholder views on their importance to society and to our business. The highest rated topics for all stakeholders were:\n\n- -climate change,\n- -ethics and responsible business,\n- -cybersecurity.\n\nFor additional details on how the materiality analysis process was performed as well as how the most relevant topics are covered throughout our business activities, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2021, section 05.3 Group Sustainability Report 3 .\n\nOur 2025 ambition is to move Allianz from a leading company to a sustainability shaper of the financial services sector and beyond. Our sustainability strategy drives how we run our business with our employees, how we manage our portfolios, and how we target our activities to have a positive influence on our industry to create real world economic, social and environmental impact.\n\nWe deliver our ambition by fully integrating three main themes in our sustainability approach:\n\n- -Environmental (E) -  low-carbon economy, climate change and decarbonization\n- -Social (S) - social impact\n- -Governance (G) - sustainability business integration\n\nSustainalytics and/or its third-party suppliers (third-party data) and are provided for informational purposes only.

Our new sustainability structure and governance also emphasizes our sustainability strategy and goals in our compensation structures and incentive systems for managers. sections 01.3 and 05.5 Group Sustainability Report .\n\nWe ground our strategy in proactive risk management to detect and address risks across the businesses. Group risk is responsible for this process. We have not identified any remaining principal risks resulting from our operations, business activities, and business relations that could have severe adverse effects on material non-financial matters. Any potential risks and impacts identified throughout our risk assessment have been addressed by the respective concepts we have in place, which we describe in this report.\n\nAs a global insurer, investor and asset manager, understanding sustainability issues allows us to reduce risks and capture opportunities in underwriting, claims, proprietary investment management, and asset management. For information on climate-related risks and opportunities, please refer to the Risk and Opportunity Report. Our concepts for all other matters for which reporting is required will be addressed in subsequent chapters. The ESG approach provides part of the foundation for these concepts and is managed by Global Sustainability.\n\nThe types of ESG risks Allianz considers to be material in its insurance and investment activities are summarized in the Allianz ESG Integration Framework. We published the fourth version of the Framework in 2021.\n\nESG risks can turn into legal risks, reputational risks, supply chain and business disruption risks, quality, operational, human-rights, financial, and/or investment risks for Allianz, its customers, and/or its invested companies. ESG topics are integrated in our insurance, investment,  and  asset  management  businesses  through  multiple  instru-\n\nments. They include internal standards, guidelines, and processes, such as the Allianz Standard for Reputational Risk and Issue Management (AS RRIM), the Allianz Standards for P&C Underwriting (ASU), and the Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI).\n\nAn overview of the Group's key ESG integration processes is described below:\n\n- -ESG risks are managed through the ESG-sensitive business guidelines outlined in the AS RRIM, in underwriting, proprietary investments in non-listed asset classes and operations.\n- -For investments in listed asset classes, the Allianz ESG scoring approach (defined in EFRI) is applied to manage related risks.\n- -For proprietary investments, Allianz has excluded investments in companies involved in controversial weapons  since 2011. Additionally, we do not provide insurance cover for activities related to such weapons.\n\n- -We have restricted proprietary investments in coal-based business models and related property-casualty insurance business. Our criteria for the exclusion of coal-based business models were further expanded in May 2021. Furthermore, we have also excluded oil sands-based business models since May 2021. 1\n- -ESG  integration  in  property-casualty  insurance  is  carried  out through the application of ESG guidelines and processes.\n- -Further  ESG-related  measures  include  our  systematic  engagement with investee companies as well as ESG considerations in our selection and management of asset managers.\n\nIn 2021, we continued our project to further strengthen ESG risk management by improving the way we identify ESG-related risks in transactions  (Property-Casualty  insurance,  proprietary  investments,  procurement).\n\nThe data related to our ESG integration approach is included in our Group Sustainability Report 2021. An in-depth overview of our approach and processes to integrating ESG is published in the Allianz ESG Integration Framework at www.allianz.com/esg-framework .\n\nIn  our  Asset  Management  business  segment,  AllianzGI  and PIMCO have developed and implemented entity-specific processes to manage risks and capture opportunities from ESG issues. For proprietary assets that AllianzGI and PIMCO manage on behalf of other Allianz Group entities, group-level requirements are observed in combination  with  the  asset  management  entities'  specific  approaches. sections 02.3 Group Sustainability Report .\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nThis section describes the impact of environmental matters on our business activities and relationships as well as the impact of the Allianz's activities and relationships on the environment. Furthermore, we describe our concepts for managing these impacts and related achievements.\n\nWithin our global sustainability approach, the pillar 'Low carbon economy, climate change and decarbonization' addresses climate change and environmental issues. Both were identified as top risks in our materiality analysis. As a company dealing with risk, managing impact on environmental matters - and their impact on us - is a key element of our business approach.\n\nNot only is climate change a major risk for societies and economies, it also directly affects our business, from our insurance products to our proprietary and third-party investments, and to our company's operations. We are tackling climate change challenges by promoting the transition to a low carbon economy through our investments and insurance solutions. In addition, we actively manage emissions from our operations in line with the Target-Setting Protocol of the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA).",

        "page_content": "## Climate Change Strategy\n\nThe Allianz Group Climate Change Strategy encourages solutions for tomorrow's climate. Besides caring for our customers through our insurance products, we leverage our position as one of the world's largest insurers and institutional investors to help drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. We do this with our own activities, and we contribute to various public/private partnerships.\n\nClimate protection is an integral part of our core business. By committing to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, we have set long-term climate targets in line with the 1.5\u00b0C ambition of the Paris Climate Agreement for our proprietary investments, our insurance, and operations. The Allianz SE Board of Management's remuneration is tied to the attainment of climate-related targets, among other things, which include the successful execution of our Climate Change Strategy.\n\n## Climate targets for proprietary investments\n\nAs a member of the AOA, we are committed to reducing the GHG emissions of our proprietary investments to net-zero by 2050. As an intermediary target, we aim to reduce our emissions in our listed equities and tradeable corporate bonds by 25 percent by year-end 2024 compared to 2019. For this purpose, we systematically measure the carbon footprint of our listed equity (2021: 2.26 1 mn t CO/uni2082e/uni003B 2020: unaudited 2.19 2 mn t CO/uni2082e) and tradeable corporate bonds (2021: 16.43 1 mn t CO/uni2082e/uni003B 2020: unaudited 19.95/uni00B2 mn t CO/uni2082e) portfolio, and disclose the absolute and relative  (2021:  unaudited  -24.9 1 %/uni003B 2020: unaudited -15.4 %) 3 portfolio carbon footprint values. Furthermore, our real estate portfolio's  emissions  will  be  aligned  with  science-based 1.5\u00b0C pathways by 2025. We have also set emissions reduction and engagement targets in line with 1.5-degree pathways for our infrastructure portfolio.\n\nFor further details on our targets and our carbon footprint, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2021, section 05.7.\n\nTo complement our portfolio climate targets for investments, we have set targets for  two of the highest-emitting  industries as well, namely utilities, and oil and gas.\n\n## Utilities\n\nComplementing our coal phase-out commitment by gradually increasing our investments in renewables and following at least the necessary annual growth rate of 5.85 % as proposed by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) as a minimum.\n\n## Oil and gas\n\nSupporting the commitment set out by the industry-led Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) to limit the emission intensity for Scope 1 and 2 emissions of oil and gas companies in their exploration and production business ('upstream') to less than 20 kg CO/uni2082e per barrel of oil, and aligning our oil and gas exposure on average-listed equity and corporate bonds portfolio to this intensity level.\n\nWe are engaging with oil and gas companies to encourage them to set net-zero emissions by 2050 targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\nBy 2025, we aim for at least 50 percent of our assets under management in the oil and gas sector to have set these targets.\n\n## Anticipating climate risks\n\nOur Climate Change Strategy aims to anticipate the risks of a changing climate. We systematically consider climate and sustainability criteria in our insurance and investment business. In 2021, we reviewed our approach to identifying and managing climate change risks and opportunities. Using internal models and external tools, we perform sensitivity and scenario analyses with time horizons extending to 2050, and with global warming scenarios ranging from 1.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C.\n\nFor more details on climate scenario analyses, see section 04.4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## www.allianz.com/sustainability .\n\nIn pursuing our investment business, we consider climate-related criteria such as carbon emissions, energy efficiency, vulnerability to climate change, and opportunities in clean tech as part of our ESG integration approach for listed and non-listed assets. We also systematically engage with investee companies exposed to high ESG risks, offering advice and encouraging them to define and pursue their own climate strategies in line with the latest scientific findings.\n\nFor further insights into the Allianz Group's ESG engagement approach, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2021, section 02.2.1 www.allianz.com/sustainability .\n\nAs part of our decarbonization strategy, we commit to fully withdrawing from coal-based business models across our proprietary investment and Property-Casualty portfolios by 2040 at the latest.\n\nFor further information on our coal policy, please refer to our 'Statement  on  Coal-Based  Business  Models' https://www.allianz.com/content/dam/onemarketing/azcom/Allianz\\_com/responsibility/documents/Allianz-Statement-coal-based-business-models.pdf.\n\nFor more information on our current state of progress, please see  section  02.2.1  of  our  Group  Sustainability  Report  2021 www.allianz.com/sustainability .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Caring for the climate-vulnerable\n\nWe support our customers to reduce climate-related risks and minimize damage, compensating those who have suffered losses and insuring low-carbon developments. We prioritize collaboration with our peers, governments and civil society to manage climate risks and to 'close the protection gap' in the most vulnerable parts of society.\n\nWe are piloting new approaches that combine insurance offerings with resilience-strengthening measures. For instance, approaches to incentivizing risk reduction include dedicated training and advice as well as risk-differentiated premium structures. Key initiatives include the InsuResilience Global Partnership, Insurance Development Forum (IDF), the Munich Climate Insurance Initiative (MCII) and the Geneva Association Global Partnership. Since 2018, we have implemented disaster risk management and transfer projects through our strategic alliance with the German Development Agency (GIZ).",

With our global footprint, Allianz has an opportunity to create positive impact using its expertise as an investor and insurer around the world. Our long-term approach as an investor and insurer is an opportunity to offer measures that can mitigate future risks and shape societies for generations, for example through pension systems, environmental and climate protection. As a global insurer, we uphold the principle of solidarity. Pooling risks is at the heart of our business model, and we have a keen interest in supporting stable communities. This also includes taxes, which are a meaningful contribution to the economic and social development of the countries in which we operate. We have a role to play in ensuring next generations can overcome the economic and social impacts of the pandemic and other systematic social risks.\n\nInformation on our Tax Strategy and our approach to taxes is provided to stakeholders through section 03.5 of the Group Sustainability Report 2021, and the Tax Transparency Report 2021.\n\nFor  further  insights  into  our  concepts,  see  section  01.4  of  our Group Sustainability Report 2021 www.allianz.com/sustainability.\n\n- -Minimize the environmental impact of waste by avoiding, reducing, re-using, and recycling it as appropriate.\n\nFurther, we include environmental factors in our sourcing and procurement processes, seeking to raise suppliers' and contractors' awareness and action on climate change and the environment. In 2021, we made Energy Sourcing a strategic priority and established central governance and expertise within the Sustainable Operations office.\n\nOur group-wide environmental management system (EMS) provides standards and controls, supports environmental data collection, and promotes transparent reporting on environmental impacts across our operations.

This trust hinges on the quality of our products, the information and advice we provide to our customers,  and the personal conduct and capabilities of our sales employees and representatives.\n\nThe Allianz Group Code of Conduct (CoC) is at the core of our corporate culture. The Code emphasizes that fairness towards customers and transparent communication about our products and services, including their limitations, maximizes our chances to earn customers' long-standing trust. This is expressed through our Global Sales Compliance Framework program which specifies standardized processes and controls for communication, monitoring and review, and is regularly updated to reflect regulatory developments.\n\nThe Allianz Standard for Sales Compliance is our consolidated customer protection framework. In addition to providing ground rules for compliant and ethical sales practices across the Allianz Group, it lays down a set of key principles to ensure fairness, transparent information and value to customers - including distributors' remuneration, product oversight and governance activities - and outlines the specific sales compliance risks our business segments face.\n\nSince 2006, we have used the Net Promoter Score (NPS) as our key metric for measuring customer loyalty through customer willingness to recommend Allianz. As of 2022, we will switch to digital NPS tracking to measure customer loyalty continuously, eliminating seasonality and deepening our understanding of customers' sentiment. Additionally, this new measurement will set higher standards (e.g., broader set of competitors), therefore we have adjusted our digital\n\nNPS targets accordingly. Our Group ambition is to reach 50 percent of loyalty leaders by 2024.\n\nOur Voice of the Customer program applies a holistic and standardized methodology to monitor and improve the customer journey by collecting real-time qualitative and quantitative feedback. After each point of contact a customer has with Allianz, they are invited to state their satisfaction on a five-star scale at predefined touchpoints along five customer journeys. We use insights from Voice of the Customer, NPS, and other customer feedback to improve our products, services and processes, both globally and locally. We analyze data to prioritize and implement structural improvements. As most complaints across customer journeys and markets are related to the speed of our processes, we are continuously working to improve this globally through the Allianz Customer Model (ACM).\n\nThe ACM is our end-to-end global business model, putting the customer at the center of our business and enabling Allianz to be simple, digital and scalable. Simplifying and harmonizing our business globally means transforming the whole value chain: products, sales, claims and operations. ACM was initially designed for Retail Property and Casualty lines,  and then extended to Health, Life, B2B2C, Mid Corp, Large Corporate and Reinsurance. We are scaling ACM via the Business  Master  Platform  (BMP)  to  digitalize  the  business  requirements. ACM aims to give our customers, agents and partners the same experience when interacting with Allianz, wherever they are in the world.\n\nFor more information on our approach to customer responsibility and compliance, please see section 02.5 of our Group Sustainability Report 2021 www.allianz.com/sustainability .\n\nwith disabilities, in alignment with the Allianz Group's global diversity and inclusion strategy.\n\nIn the first half of 2022, we aim to publish our renewed Social Impact Strategy and will set targets for 2022 and beyond. We are also in the process of developing detailed guidance and financial support for local entities to embed our global to local approach.\n\nFor more information on our Social Impact, please see section  03.1  of  our  Group  Sustainability  Report  2021\n\n- www.allianz.com/sustainability.",

In addition, we describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts with a focus on information security, data privacy and data ethics.\n\n## Information security\n\nInformation security is assessed and tracked as one of the top risks faced by Allianz, and is closely managed along eight key risk indicators across the Allianz Group. Performance against these indicators is reported quarterly to the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Allianz Information Security governance framework is robust and comprises multiple layers of corporate rules and processes. An overall policy establishes core principles, roles and responsibilities as well as the organizational framework for information security within the Allianz Group. Measures to prevent cyber incidents are prioritized along the threat landscape. They are implemented at a global level and supplemented locally where required, together with the local Information Security Officers (ISOs) that exist in all Allianz operating entities. Specific measures to improve security controls are continuously evaluated and developed with priorities assigned on a global, regulatory and risk-based basis.\n\nMeasures focus on five key risk areas: reducing the likelihood of incidents/uni003B increasing detection likelihood/uni003B reducing damage from incidents/uni003B streamlining compliance/uni003B and training/educating the organization to further improve security awareness. All employees are required to participate in at least quarterly cyber-awareness training. Allianz also participates in governmental, industry and global/regional initiatives to support the security of the overall digital ecosystem.\n\n## Data privacy\n\nProtecting our customers' data and maintaining trust in our processes are top priorities. Our customers, employees and other stakeholders expect us to treat their data with the utmost care and we take this responsibility extremely seriously. We are committed to protecting customer privacy and we cooperate closely with other stakeholders involved in the update and modernization of European privacy legislation, including industry associations, members of parliament and authorities. Our group-wide privacy program ensures compliance with all relevant data privacy laws and regulations. All data privacy matters are overseen by Group Data Privacy.\n\nThe Allianz Privacy Framework (APS) is our global standard for data privacy. It defines rules and principles for collecting and processing personal data, and includes a global standard for data privacy, a privacy impact assessment and risk management process, integration with information security standards and practices, and dedicated training programs for employees. Digital privacy guidelines provide guidance on privacy-related topics that affect digital projects, both for privacy by design as part of new-product and service design processes, and for privacy by default - this means that wherever individuals are given choices on the use and sharing of their personal data, default settings restrict the disclosure.\n\nAs part of our Privacy Risk Management , we consider the identification and management of privacy risks as an integral part of our operational processes. Privacy risks are also included in our Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS). For so-called high-exposure processes that use personal data, we carry out Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) to allow early identification of high-risk areas and ensure they are appropriately managed over the project lifecycle. Privacy champions have been appointed across Allianz Group companies and are now dedicating a portion of their time to deal with privacy related topics. In 2021, we developed a global privacy risk and controls 'blueprint' to support local compliance efforts with the APS across the entire Allianz Group. The blueprint provides a tool for identifying data privacy risks in local business processes and addressing those risks by mapping them to standard controls.\n\nWe monitor privacy governance activities and processes across our operating entities through a robust process, which includes site visits, reviews of program documents, interviews and expert challenge calls. During the pandemic, site visits were replaced with virtual meetings without any loss in efficacy.\n\nFor  more  information  on  our  commitment  to  data  privacy,\n\nplease  see section 03.2.1 of our Group Sustainability Report 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- www.allianz.com/sustainability.\n\n## Data ethics\n\nAllianz values data as a key asset and strives to position itself as a leading player in leveraging data in the most compliant and ethical way, both as an insurer and an investor. We set up the Allianz Data Ethics Project in response to the increasing regulatory initiatives and public debate on data ethics and AI worldwide, to strengthen the internal governance framework for AI, and to position Allianz in the regulatory field.\n\nIn 2021, we established a Data Advisory Board (DAB) which covers  data  ethics  and  selected  data-related  topics  on  a  more",

This is an expectation that  is  reflected  by  expanding  legislation  and  applied  across  our global operations. This section describes the impact of human rights issues on our business activities and relationships, and the impact of the Allianz Group's activities and relationships on human rights issues. We also describe the concepts and achievements related to the management of those impacts. As we are a financial services provider, these concepts mainly relate to insurance transactions, proprietary investments, and our supply chain, and are managed by Global Sustainability.\n\nWe aim to identify, prevent and  mitigate adverse human rights impacts linked to our business activities and operations including our supply chain. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) provide a framework for responsible business operations and activities. We are committed to respecting these standards and have been participating in the U.N. Global Compact (UNGC) since 2002,  which, through its ten principles, covers human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption. We annually communicate our progress against these principles. Internally, Global Sustainability is the responsible function for overseeing human rights matters. However, implementation of certain processes and actions is taken up by various group functions, including procurement, risk management, HR and compliance, among others. See our latest U.N. Global Compact annual communication.\n\nTo manage our human rights impacts, we must look across each of our roles as an insurer and investor, as an employer, as a company, including our supply chain, and as a corporate citizen. For each of these roles,\n\nwe have embedded different processes to manage human rights risks and act on opportunities to drive positive change.\n\nIn 2021, we strengthened our approach by publishing a Human Rights Policy embedded in the Allianz Group ESG Integration Framework. We continue to apply ESG and Human Rights Guidelines across all business lines and core processes dealing with insurance, investment and procurement decisions. As a corporate insurer and investor, our human rights due diligence process forms part of our overall ESG approach, which is integrated into our broader risk management system. Please refer to our ESG approach for further details on the concepts.\n\nWe require all our vendors to meet fair labor requirements and practices  to  prevent  modern  slavery  and  ensure  compliance  with UDHR and the Allianz Group Vendor Code of Conduct . Vendors with a spend volume greater than \u20ac 250,000 undergo a vendor integrity screening that is based on the requirements laid down in the Allianz Global Standard for Procurement . In 2021, we revised the screening questionnaire with additional human rights questions. Screening data and information in compliance with the Code of Conduct forms part of our procurement KPI reporting.\n\nFurther details can be found in the Allianz Group Vendor Code of Conduct.\n\nWe take an active stance against modern slavery and human trafficking, and pursue a risk-based approach across our business and supply chain. The Allianz Group Modern Slavery Statement , last published in June 2021, confirms that no incident of modern slavery, human trafficking, or child labor has been found involving any of the Allianz Group entities over the past year.\n\n- For further details on the Allianz Group's referral process and our Human Rights Guideline, see the Allianz ESG Integration Framework https://www.allianz.com/esg-framework .\n\n## Targets and achievements: human rights matters\n\n| Topic              | Targets 2021                                                                      | Achievements 2021                                                                                             | Targets 2022                                                                          |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Modern Slavery Act | Continue to report on human  rights issues as defined in the  Modern Slavery Act. | - No issues were raised in regard to human  rights issues in accordance with the  Modern Slavery Act in 2021. | Continue to report on human rights issues as  defined in the (UK) Modern Slavery Act. |\n|                    |                                                                                   | - Allianz Group Modern Slavery Statement  was updated in mid-2021.                                            |                                                                                       |",

        "page_content": "## Employee matters\n\nThis section describes our employees' impact on our business activities and relationships, and vice versa. We describe the concepts, actions and achievements in managing these impacts. All employee matters are managed by the Group HR function.\n\nDelivering our purpose 'We secure your future' starts with 155,411 1 employees who are part of our diverse and global workforce. Our purpose anchors our Group strategy, employee value proposition, brand promise and customer experience principles, and it drives our decisions and actions. We held our second global Purpose & Strategy Day in autumn 2021 to engage our employees on our purpose.\n\nA diverse workforce enables us to understand and fulfill the needs of our equally diverse customer base. Allianz fosters a culture and working  environment  where  people  and  performance  matter,  and where everyone has a voice. We take a strong stance regarding employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and gender equality. We focus on managing talent, rewarding personal achievements and promoting employee rights. The health, safety, and well-being as well as the training and development of our employees is of utmost importance.\n\n## Our response to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our global workforce. The pandemic cast a spotlight on the importance of health and mental well-being, and we introduced various measures to support employees and meet our business needs during the crisis. These have included help/advisory lines for physical and mental health issues, preventative health measures, and special support for working parents, such as additional leave to enable parents to take care of unexpected childcare needs.\n\nConvinced that vaccination will help the return to more normality soon, Allianz has conducted vaccination campaigns in 2021. In addition, Allianz booster shot campaigns have started.\n\n## New ways of working\n\nIn 2021, we have introduced  more flexible, collaborative and agile ways of working that empower our employees, customers and organization. These new Ways of Working (WOW) aim to enhance employee engagement, productivity and innovation, resulting in simpler and prompter service offerings for our customers, resilience to protect us from future crises, and a faster and flatter organization and culture. COVID-19 required us to respond rapidly to unexpected situations and new priorities. The challenges increased the pace of change with respect to how we work together and engage with each other and our stakeholders.\n\nThe focus areas for our WOW standards are centered across five categories:  1.  Flexible  work  &  Reduced  travel,  2.  Digital  tools,  3. Health & Well-being, 4. Learning, 5. Organization & Culture. For instance, employees across the globe have the opportunity to spend a minimum of 40 percent of their working hours working from home (depending on the position, e.g., mobile worker, office worker, etc.) and the opportunity to work up to 25 days a year abroad in accordance\n\nwith local regulations. We  have also significantly reduced business travel compared to 2019.\n\n## Business as usual\n\n## Allianz Engagement Survey\n\nThe annual Allianz Engagement Survey (AES) is our formal employee platform for gathering employee feedback and promoting a high-performance culture. The results of the AES are directly linked to the performance targets for the Group's Board of Management. This year we achieved our second-best result in the Allianz Group's history.\n\nOne part of the AES is the Inclusive Meritocracy Index (IMIX). It measures our progress in building a culture where both people and performance matter, as we seek to enable employees to unlock their full potential. The IMIX score comprises 10 AES questions covering the areas of leadership, performance and corporate culture.\n\n## Targets and achievements: employee matters\n\n| Topic   | Targets 2021   | Achievements 2021   | Targets 2022-2024   |\n|---------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| IMIX    | 73 % plus      | 78 % (2020: 78 %)   | 75 % plus           |\n\n## Diversity & Inclusion\n\nIn 2021, we rolled out two new policies that underpin the Allianz Code of Conduct: the Allianz Diversity and Inclusion Policy describes our rationale for diversity and inclusion (D&I) and how we foster diversity in all its forms,  and the Allianz Anti-Harassment Policy outlines our global zero tolerance standard against sexual and other harassment and discrimination.\n\nMore than 20 CEOs and board  members from Allianz entities around the globe are part of the Global Inclusion Council, which has been in place since 2007. It oversees the implementation of our D&I strategy built around three pillars: Employees, Customers, and Brand and Reputation.\n\nWe take a strong stance to increase the diversity of our leadership and management, and set new targets and ambitions for December 2024  that  extend  beyond  gender  representation  and cover  the  dimensions  of  generations,  nationality  and  ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and disability. For more information, please see section 02.4.1 of  our  Group  Sustainability  Report  2021  and  our  D&I  website\n\n- https://www.allianz.com/en/about-us/strategy-values/diversity.html.\n\nWe promote employee networks to raise awareness, support employees,  advocate for change and help shape the D&I agenda. At the global  level,  three  new  global  networks  were  established  in  2021 bringing the total to five, each focused on a key priority for D&I:\n\n- -Allianz NEO - gender inclusion,\n- -Allianz Pride - LGBTQ+ inclusion,\n- -Allianz Engage - generations inclusion,\n- -Allianz GRACE - ethnicity and cultural inclusion,\n- -Allianz Beyond - disability inclusion.\n\n## Strategic workforce planning\n\nThe purpose behind the strategic workforce planning initiative is to understand what the transition to a digital future means for Allianz and its people, and how we can equip our workforce with the skills they",

Our strategic workforce planning approach compares workforce supply by job profile against projected workforce demand over the next five years to prepare our people for the future. As of 2021, strategic workforce planning is now a structured annual process integrated within the annual planning process. As a result, major upskilling and reskilling initiatives are rolled-out to prepare our workforce for the future.\n\n## Learning & development\n\nLearning and development is a key differentiator in the financial services industry. We focus on promoting lifelong learning through our global #learn initiative, and offer our employees one hour each week dedicated to learning. We employ a wide range of learning and development  approaches,  including  on-the-job  learning,  mentoring  and coaching, classroom training, peer circles, and digital/mobile learning. We have targeted programs in place in key areas, including property and casualty, life and health, IT, strategy, finance, communications, market management and operations. In 2021, we continued #lead: a leadership  development  initiative  for  all  Allianz  people  leaders around the globe. The program aims to set a minimum standard for all people leaders with an equal focus on hard and soft skills, in order to ensure  the balance between the  IQ (intelligence quotient) and EQ (emotional quotient) of our leaders.\n\n## Employee health and well-being\n\nOur goal is to maintain and improve employee health and well-being by providing a global framework with minimum requirements for all Allianz entities to support our new Ways of Working. Based on a pulse survey, we merged the Work Well Program into four Minimum Health Requirements to drive action. The Minimum Health Requirements for all operating entities are:\n\n- 1. Access to professional psychological support for all employees worldwide,\n- 2. Training people leaders to maintain health and well-being in their teams,\n- 3. Touch points to collect employee feedback on their health and well-being,\n- 4. Meeting Free Calendar Days @Allianz.\n\nHealth and well-being managers at each operating entity are responsible for driving activities to implement the Minimum Health Requirements. We also rolled out the Allianz health app - Well Together. The aim of this app is to combine the topics of health and sustainability under one holistic platform to motivate our employees to exercise more, live more healthily and - at the same time - protect the environment.\n\n## Compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\n\nThis section describes the impact of ethics, responsible business and compliance matters on the Allianz Group's activities, and relationships and the impact of the Allianz Group's activities and relationships on compliance. The concepts and achievements related to the management of these impacts are described with a focus on the compliance management system, anti-corruption and bribery matters. All compliance matters are overseen by the Group Compliance team.\n\nOur Compliance Management System (CMS) helps ensure compliance with internationally recognized laws, rules and regulations, and to promote a culture of integrity in order to safeguard the company's reputation. We take a proactive stance, working with organizations such as the German Institute for Compliance and the Global Insurance Chief Compliance Officers Forum (CCO Forum) to enhance our understanding of compliance issues and to share best practices.\n\nCompliance risk is part of the operational risk category, as laid down in the Allianz Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS). OEs in scope of IRCS are defined by Group Risk. They are required to conduct an annual compliance risk assessment based on Group-defined risk scenarios. Together with the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness (CARE), they form the annual cycle of our integrated compliance risk scoping and assessment activities .\n\nIn 2021, the Compliance Function underwent a transformation in the way it assesses Group and local compliance departments. Review procedures have been expanded to confirm adequate compliance scope and skills, to confirm compliance with global programs and local specificities, and to reinforce a compliance-by-default and bydesign mindset. This holistic approach was rolled out in the second half of 2021 through the CARE program, a self-assessment exercise reinforced with compliance reviews/uni003B completed and coordinated by Group Compliance.\n\nCompliance  Reviews  are  supplemented  by  Targeted  Reviews which assess the implementation status and effectiveness of programs such as Antitrust, Customer Protection, etc. The benefit of this multifaceted review and confirmation strategy is that operating entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more holistic assurance activities.\n\nAn online tool for compliance issues management provides an overview of issues detected in the course of the above activities. It requires reporting on mitigating activities as well as on follow-up procedures, including a review of actions undertaken and documented in the tool.\n\nThe information gathered through the issue management tool provides the primary basis of reports to the Group Board and the Allianz SE Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. An Integrity Committee, chaired by Group Compliance, reviews all activities and issues related to misconduct and/or violations of internal/external rules and regulations, and Code of Conduct infractions, including reports of actions to follow up on whistleblowing cases.",

We thoroughly investigate allegations of violations of laws as well as of breaches of Allianz-specific rules. The obligations laid down in our various compliance programs have been derived from the Allianz Group Code of Conduct and detailed in various Allianz standards - specifically, the Economics Sanctions, Anti-Money Laundering, Antitrust, Data Privacy, Capital Markets Compliance and Anti-Corruption Standards.\n\nAllianz takes a zero-tolerance approach to fraud and corruption. We are committed to complying fully with local and international anticorruption and anti-bribery laws. Our aim is to go beyond complying with the minimum standards of the law, such as the Allianz AntiCorruption Program which sets high standards for a comprehensive and consistent group-wide approach in every jurisdiction. The program requires that employees and certain third parties with whom Allianz does business are prohibited from offering, accepting, paying or authorizing any bribe or any other form of corruption, be it with the private sector or with government officials.\n\nAnti-corruption  training  is  compulsory  for  all  employees,  with online and classroom training delivered in multiple languages.\n\nAs a matter of course, the development in the ongoing proceedings in connection with the Allianz GI U.S. LLC Structured Alpha funds would also be monitored by the compliance function and considered as part of the regular reassessment of compliance risks. Any findings will also be reflected in the continuous improvement of our Compliance Management System and compliance processes.\n\n## Targets and achievements: compliance/anti-corruption and bribery matters\n\n| Topic      | Target 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Achievements 2021                                                                                                                               | Targets 2022                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Compliance | Complete the cycle of the  integrated compliance risk scoping  and assessment activities as part of  the company's IRCS process.                                                                                           | - Roll-out of CARE program.  - Completed the 2021 integrated  compliance risk scoping and assessment  activities as part of the company's IRCS. | - Complete the cycle of the integrated  compliance risk scoping and assessment  activities as part of the company's IRCS  process in 2022.                                                                                 |\n|            | Continue to enhance the  effectiveness of local compliance  organizations by enriching our  compliance reviews, to bolster  further the governance and  processes of underlying  compliance organizations across  our OEs. | - Roll-out of CARE program.  - Completed the 2021 integrated  compliance risk scoping and assessment  activities as part of the company's IRCS. | - Continue to enhance the effectiveness of  local compliance organizations by  enriching our compliance reviews, to  bolster further the governance and  processes of underlying compliance  organizations across our OEs. |\n\n## E.U. Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe E.U. Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852) is a 'green' classification system that translates the E.U.'s climate and environmental objectives into criteria for specific economic activities for investment purposes. The  regulation  came  into  effect  this  year  and  Allianz  is  reporting against it for the first time.\n\nE.U. Taxonomy recognizes as 'green', or 'environmentally sustainable', economic activities that make a substantial contribution to at least one of the E.U.'s climate and environmental objectives, while at the same time not significantly harming any of these objectives and meeting minimum social safeguards. It is a transparency tool that will introduce mandatory disclosure obligations on some undertakings (namely, the ones in scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive  (CSRD)  prospectively) and financial market participants. The disclosure of the proportion of taxonomy-aligned activities will allow for the comparison of companies and investment portfolios. In addition, it can guide market participants in their investment decisions. Nevertheless, the E.U. Taxonomy is not a mandatory list of economic activities for investors to invest in. Nor does it set mandatory requirements on environmental performance\n\nfor companies or for financial products. Investors are free to choose what to invest in.\n\nEconomic activities that are not recognized by the E.U. Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the E.U.'s climate and  environmental  objectives  are  not  necessarily  environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that could generally make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are already part of the E.U. Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Rather, the first Delegated Act (namely, the Climate Delegated Act) under the E.U. taxonomy sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant  for  achieving  climate  neutrality  and  delivering  on  climate change objectives. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings.\n\nAt  this  stage,  the  regulation  has  only  established  'Technical Screening Criteria' for (a) climate change mitigation and (b) climate change adaptation, which are laid out in the Climate Delegated Act. Criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives will follow in a future Delegated Act, in line with the mandates outlined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn addition, extensions of the Taxonomy Regulation with view to (a) economic activities that do not have a significant impact on environmental sustainability and economic activities that significantly harm environmental sustainability, as well as (b) regarding other sustainability objectives, such as social objectives, may follow at a later stage.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, the Disclosures Delegated Act requires the E.U. Commission to review the application of this regulation by 30 June 2024, and to assess in particular the need for any further amendments with regard to the inclusion of (a) exposures to central governments and central banks in the numerator and denominator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings, and (b) exposures to undertakings that do not publish a non-financial statement pursuant to Articles 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU in the numerator of key performance indicators of financial undertakings.\n\nOverall, this means that the Taxonomy Regulation will evolve further over the next years, translating into an extension of the expected screening and reporting scope alongside various dimensions.\n\nFor a transitional period of two years, a simplified approach applies for the financial sector. In this context, only eligibility has to be reported. This means that we only report on (investments into) economic activities which are in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation, i.e., described in the Climate Delegated Act/uni003B irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down therein.\n\nThus, taxonomy eligibility of an economic activity implies that respective Technical Screening Criteria are available and the activity could generally make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives of the taxonomy. Whether an activity is taxonomyeligible, or not, provides no indication about how green or environmentally sustainable that activity is. This will only be possible with the future alignment KPI.\n\nTaxonomy alignment of an activity goes beyond taxonomy eligibility. It implies that an activity complies with the requirements defined specifically for this particular activity in the Technical Screening Criteria of the taxonomy. For example, to be 'taxonomy-aligned' under the current taxonomy, an activity has to fulfill the specific criteria that determine when an economic activity makes a substantial contribution to the climate objectives as outlined in the Climate Delegated Act. Going forward, an activity has to fulfill the Technical Screening Criteria, the  'do no significant harm'  criteria,  and the minimum social safeguards linked to this activity to be taxonomy-aligned. Taxonomy alignment has to be reported by financial undertakings from the financial year 2023 onwards.\n\nThe Disclosures Delegated Act specifies the disclosure obligations under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn order to ensure comparability of the Taxonomy information with the Group's financial disclosure, we report for each of our material financial activities. Consequently, Allianz Group will report on the following activities:\n\n- -non-life insurance,\n- -proprietary investments, and\n- -third-party investments.\n\nNon-life insurance (and thereof eight Solvency II Lines of Business (LoBs)) is one economic activity in scope of the Taxonomy Regulation ('taxonomy-eligible'), as it is generally deemed as able to have a positive enabling function with a view to climate change adaptation.\n\nIn the non-life insurance business, the Allianz Group is active in all the eight LoBs that can generally be considered as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation/uni003B the same applies for the Allianz Group's reinsurance business accepted from external counterparties. Namely reinsurance business of eligible insurance activities can be considered as Taxonomy-eligible. The extent to which individual contracts include protection against climate-related perils (e.g., flood events or hail storms) depends on the individual demand and the requirements of the customer's typical situation or unique risk exposure. Risk analysis and product advice is an integral part of our sales process and we are pursuing the objective to close insurance coverage gaps as far as possible.\n\nWe integrate climate protection into our core business. We embed the management of risks and opportunities resulting from climate change in our overall business strategy. Measures include developing and adjusting financial products and services, updating policies and processes, setting targets and limits, managing our operational climate footprint, and engaging with internal and external stakeholders. As a treaty reinsurer of external clients,  we consider the climate-related strategies of these insurance companies as part of our underwriting process in order to determine our reinsurance business strategy.\n\nThe information about taxonomy eligibility in our underwriting portfolio is an indication of the scope of our activities that can generally be assessed against the specific technical screening criteria for taxonomy-alignment applying to (re-)insurers, and therefore have the potential to provide a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation. An LoB must contain at least one policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils to be considered as taxonomy-eligible. On the one hand, the Allianz Group offers policies in the LoBs of 'other motor insurance', 'marine, aviation and transport insurance' and 'fire and damage to property insurance', where protection against climate perils is explicitly included. On the other hand, the Allianz Group offers policies that are based on a general protection approach, thus covering all risks, including (yet, not explicitly referring to) climate perils in the five remaining LoBs 'medical expense insurance', 'income protection insurance', 'workers' compensation insurance', 'motor vehicle liability insurance' and 'assistance'. Allianz generally considers both types of LoBs as eligible under the Taxonomy Regulation, as they all comprise policies that cover against climate perils. The most material eligible LoBs are 'fire and other damage  to  property  insurance',  'motor  vehicle  liability  insurance'  and 'other motor insurance'.\n\nBased on this assessment, in our non-life insurance and reinsurance business, 79 % of the P&C gross written premiums are taxonomyeligible and 21 % of the P&C gross written premiums are taxonomy non-eligible for the financial year 2021. 1 Taxonomy eligibility does not give an indication of the degree to which the Allianz Group's non-life insurance activities can be considered as taxonomy-aligned, but reflects the structure of the Allianz Group's underlying business and",

This means that for taxonomy reporting as an investor, the Allianz Group can only consider economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, obliged to disclose under Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. This includes activities of controlled subsidiaries, for which we can perform our own assessment of the underlying economic activities, given that the Allianz Group itself is in scope of the NFRD. On the other hand, several asset classes, which are material for Allianz Group, cannot be considered taxonomy-eligible as of now, such as sovereign bonds or non-E.U. investments. This applies for both proprietary and third-party assets.\n\nFor investments, a look-through approach applies. However investors' reporting for the financial year 2021 could only be based on estimates due to the fact that investees have not yet disclosed taxonomy eligibility. According to the latest implementation guidance by the European Commission, such estimated values may only be reported on a voluntary basis and must not form part of the mandatory disclosures. Considering the limited reliability of estimated taxonomy eligibility information at this stage, the Allianz Group will not report voluntary data for the financial year 2021.\n\nTaxonomy eligibility can at this stage only relate to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation (or both).\n\nAs a result, the taxonomy eligibility share for the Allianz Group's proprietary investments is only based on controlled listed or unlisted assets and debt instruments in scope, that are held by our (internal) asset\n\nmanagers, or other subsidiaries (e.g., real estate investments or mortgages. Due to the limited information value of the Taxonomy information at this stage, we disclose additional information on the sustainability of our proprietary investments portfolio at Group-level based on the definition of 'Sustainable Investments' as per the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). For more information, please refer to our Group Sustainability Report 2021, section 02.2.\n\nAs to third-party assets, as the Allianz Group would in all cases need data from investees, no screening for and reporting on taxonomy eligibility is possible at this stage except with regard to our exposure to mortgages. However, the table below provides insights into the respective  asset  classes,  where  the  exposure  to  undertakings,  which  are obliged to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU, represents the part for which a screening for taxonomy eligibility based on data reported by investees can take place going forward.\n\nTaxonomy eligibility does not assess alignment of the Allianz Group's underwriting or investment activities, i.e., it does not serve as a proxy of how sustainable our activities are. Numbers reported in the table below and in the section 'Underwriting' above describe the structure of the Allianz Group's non-life insurance and investment portfolio and define the scope of future Taxonomy alignment assessment applying Taxonomy Regulation as of the balance sheet date. Due to the limited number of economic activities in scope of the Taxonomy so far, and the focus on a subset of investees and asset classes, the eligibility figures for investment activities are rather small compared to the whole investment portfolio. The foreseen enrichment of the Technical Screening Criteria for further environmental objectives, potential extensions of the Taxonomy Regulation, and implementation of guidance might have a significant impact on Taxonomy eligibility classification in the future.",

Business-related divisions reflect our business segments  Property-Casualty,  Life/Health,  Asset  Management,  and Corporate and Other. In 2021, they were overseen by five board members. The following divisions focus on Group functions and come with business-related responsibilities: Chairperson  of the Board of Management/uni003B  Finance,  Controlling  and  Risk/uni003B  Investment  Management/uni003B Operations and Allianz Services/uni003B  Human Resources, Legal, Compliance and M&A/uni003B and Business Transformation 1 .\n\nFor further information on Board of Management members and their responsibilities, please refer to Mandates of the Members of the Board of Management.\n\nFor Allianz SE the same key performance indicators and target values as for the Allianz Group apply. In particular the key financial performance indicators are based on IFRS.\n\nThe Allianz Group steers its operating entities and business segments via an integrated management and control process. It begins with the definition of a business-specific strategy and goals, which are discussed and agreed upon between the Holding and operating entities. Based on this strategy, our operating entities prepare three-year plans, which are then aggregated to form the financial plans for the business divisions and for the Allianz Group as a whole. This plan also forms the basis for our capital management. The Supervisory Board approves the plan and sets corresponding targets for the Board of Management. The performance-based remuneration of the Board of Management is linked to short-term and long-term targets to ensure effectiveness and emphasize sustainability. For further details about our remuneration structure, including target setting and performance assessment, please refer to the Remuneration Report (which no longer forms part of the Management Report).\n\nWe continuously monitor our business performance against these targets through monthly reviews - which cover key operational and financial metrics - to ensure we can move quickly and take appropriate measures in the event of negative developments. The Allianz Group uses operating profit and net income as key financial performance indicators across all its business segments. Other indicators include segment-specific figures, such as the combined ratio for Property-Casualty, return on equity 2 and new business margins for Life/Health, and the cost-income ratio for Asset Management.\n\nBesides performance steering, we also have a risk-steering process in place, which is described in the Risk and Opportunity Report.\n\nNon-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) are used to assess the organizational health of Allianz and are reflected in the annual bonus of the Board of Management. In line with our strategy 'simplicity at scale', customer centricity and employee engagement are reflected in the Net Promoter Score (NPS 3 ) and the Inclusive\n\nMeritocracy Index. For further information on non-financial KPIs, as well as an overview of the development and expected development of these non-financial KPIs, please refer to the Non-Financial Statement.\n\nFor an overview of the development and expected development of the most important financial KPIs, please refer to the Outlook 2022 of the Allianz Group's Annual Report 2021.\n\n## Branches\n\nIn 2021, Allianz SE operated its business from Munich and from branch offices  in  Rome  (Italy),  Casablanca  (Morocco),  Singapore,  Labuan (Malaysia), Wallisellen (Switzerland), Vienna (Austria),  and  Dublin (Ireland).\n\n## Takeover-related Statements and Explanations\n\nThe following information is provided pursuant to \u00a7 289a of the German Commercial Code ('Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB') and \u00a7 176 (1) of the German Stock Company Act ('Aktiengesetz - AktG').\n\nAs  of  31 December 2021,  the  share  capital  of  Allianz SE  was \u20ac 1,169,920,000. It was divided into 408,457,873 registered and fully paid-up shares with no par value. All shares carry the same rights and obligations. Each no-par value share carries one vote.\n\nShares may only be transferred with the consent of the company. An approval duly applied for may only be withheld if it is deemed necessary in the company's interest on exceptional grounds. The applicant will be informed of the reasons.\n\nShares acquired by employees of the Allianz Group as part of the employee stock purchase plan are generally subject to a three-year lock-up period. During the lock-up period, employees can exercise their voting rights.\n\nAllianz SE is not aware of any direct or indirect interests in the share capital that exceed 10 % of the voting rights.\n\nThere are no shares with special rights conferring powers of control.",

        "page_content": "The appointment and removal of members of Allianz SE's Board of Management is governed by Articles 9 (1), 39 (2) and 46 of the SE Regulation, \u00a7\u00a7 84, 85 AktG, \u00a7 24 (3) and \u00a7 47 No. 1 German Insurance Supervision  Act  ('Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz  -  VAG'),  and  the  Statutes. According to the Statutes, the Board of Management shall consist of at least two persons/uni003B the Supervisory Board determines the number of any additional members (\u00a7 5 (1) of the Statutes). The members of the Board of Management are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a term of up to five years/uni003B reappointment is permitted for a maximum of five years in each case (\u00a7 5 (3) of the Statutes). A simple majority of the votes cast in the Supervisory Board is required to appoint members of the Board of Management. In the case of a tie vote, the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board, who pursuant to Article 42 of the SE Regulation must be a shareholder representative, shall have the casting vote (\u00a7 8 (3) of the Statutes). If the Chairperson does not participate in the vote, the Vice Chairperson shall have the casting vote, provided he or she is a shareholder representative. A Vice Chairperson who is an employee representative has no casting vote (\u00a7 8 (3) of the Statutes).\n\nAmendments to the Statutes are governed by Article 59 SE Regulation, \u00a7 179 AktG, and the Statutes. \u00a7 13 (4) of the Statutes of Allianz SE stipulates that, unless mandatory law requires otherwise, changes to the Statutes require a two-thirds majority of the votes cast at a General Meeting or, if at least one half of the share capital is represented, a simple majority of the votes cast. Where the law requires a majority in capital for a shareholder resolution, a simple majority of the capital represented at the General Meeting is sufficient, provided this is in line with legal requirements. The Supervisory Board may alter the wording of the Statutes (\u00a7 179 (1) AktG and \u00a7 10 of the Statutes).\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized to issue shares as well as to acquire and use treasury shares as follows:\n\nIt may increase the company's share capital on or before 8 May 2023, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, by issuing new registered no-par value shares against contributions in cash and/or in kind, on one or more occasions:\n\n- -Up to a total of \u20ac 334,960,000 (Authorized Capital 2018/I): In case of a capital increase against cash contribution, the Board of Management may exclude the shareholders' subscription rights for these shares with the consent of the Supervisory Board (i) for fractional amounts, (ii) in order to safeguard the rights pertaining to holders of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants, including mandatory convertible bonds, and (iii) in the event of a capital increase of up to 10 %, if the issue price of the new shares is not significantly below the stock market price. The Board of Management  may  furthermore  exclude  the  shareholders'  subscription rights with the consent of the Supervisory Board in the event of a capital increase against contributions in kind.\n- -Up to a total of \u20ac 15,000,000 (Authorized Capital 2018/II): The shareholders' subscription rights are excluded. New shares may\n\nonly be issued to employees of Allianz SE and its Group companies.\n\nThe  company's  share  capital  is  conditionally  increased  by  up  to \u20ac 250,000,000 (Conditional Capital 2010/2018). This conditional capital increase will only be carried out to the extent that the holders of convertible  bonds,  bonds  with  warrants,  convertible  participation rights, participation rights, and subordinated financial instruments issued against cash by Allianz SE or its subsidiaries, based on the authorizations granted by the General Meeting on 5 May 2010  or 9 May 2018, exercise their conversion or option rights, or to the extent that conversion obligations from such bonds are fulfilled, and to such extent that treasury shares or shares from authorized capital are not used for such purpose.\n\nUnder an authorization by the General Meeting on 9 May 2018, the Board of Management may, until 8 May 2023, buy back Allianz shares corresponding to up to 10 % of the lower of (i) the share capital at the moment of the shareholder resolution and (ii) the share capital at the moment of the buy-back, and to use those shares for other purposes (\u00a7 71 (1) No. 8 AktG). Together with other treasury shares that are held by Allianz SE, or which are attributable to it under \u00a7\u00a7 71a et seq. AktG, such shares may not exceed 10 % of the share capital at any time. The shares acquired pursuant to this authorization may be used, under exclusion of the shareholders' subscription rights, for any legally admissible purposes, in particular those specified in the authorization. Furthermore, the acquisition of treasury shares under this authorization may also be carried out using derivatives, provided such derivatives do not relate to more than 5 % of the share capital.\n\nDomestic or foreign banks that are majority-owned by Allianz SE may buy and sell Allianz shares for trading purposes (\u00a7 71 (1) No. 7 and (2)  AktG) under an authorization of the General Meeting valid until 8 May 2023. The total number of shares acquired thereunder, together with  treasury  shares  held  by  Allianz SE  or  attributable  to  it  under \u00a7\u00a7 71a et seq. AktG, shall at no time exceed 10 % of the share capital of Allianz SE.\n\nThe following essential agreements of the company are subject to a change-of-control condition following a takeover bid:\n\n- -Our  reinsurance  contracts,  in  principle,  include  a  clause  under which both parties to the contract have an extraordinary termination right, if and when the counterparty merges with another entity or its ownership or control situation changes materially. Agreements with brokers regarding services connected with the purchase of reinsurance cover also provide for termination rights in case of a change of control. Such clauses are standard market practice.\n- -Allianz SE  is  also  party  to  various  bancassurance  distribution agreements for insurance products in various regions. These distribution agreements normally include a clause under which the parties  have  an  extraordinary  termination  right  in  the  event  of  a change of control of the other party's ultimate holding company.\n- -Shareholder agreements and joint ventures to which Allianz SE is a party often contain change-of-control clauses that provide, as the case may be, for the termination of the agreement, or for put",

Where such termination rights are exercised, the respective credit lines have to be replaced by new credit lines under conditions then applicable.\n\n- -Under the Allianz Equity Incentive Program, Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) - i.e., virtual Allianz shares - are granted to senior management of the Allianz Group worldwide as a stock-based remuneration component. The conditions for these RSUs contain change-ofcontrol clauses, which apply when a majority of the voting share capital in Allianz SE is directly or indirectly acquired by one or more third parties who do not belong to the Allianz Group, and which provide for an exception from the usual vesting and exercise periods. In line with the relevant general conditions, the company will release the RSUs to plan participants on the day of the change of control, without observing any vesting period that would otherwise apply. The cash amount payable per RSU must equal or exceed the average market value of the Allianz share and the price offered per Allianz share in a preceding tender offer. By providing for the non-application of the vesting period in the event of a change of control, the terms take into account the fact that the conditions influencing the share price are substantially different when there is a change of control.",

They are amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of generally three to five years. In case of a permanent impairment, an unscheduled write-down is recognized. Based on the capitalization option in accordance with \u00a7 248 (2) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code, the internally generated intangible assets are capitalized.\n\nThese items are recorded at acquisition or construction cost less depreciation in accordance with \u00a7 253 (1) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 341b (1) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code. Depreciation is measured mainly using a straightline method according to ordinary useful life. The useful life of newly acquired properties is based on the remaining useful life in the purchase report. For all other assets, we use tax depreciation tables. In case of a permanent impairment, the values of these items are adjusted through unscheduled write-downs.\n\n## Shares in affiliated enterprises and participations\n\nThese  are  recorded  at  cost  less  impairments,  in  accordance  with \u00a7 341b (1)  of  the  German  Commercial  Code  in  conjunction  with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code.\n\nImpairments are measured either as the difference between the acquisition cost and the respective value, in accordance with IDW RS HFA 10 in conjunction with IDW S1, or as the difference between the acquisition cost and the lower share price as of 31 December 2021, or in some cases as the difference between the acquisition cost and the net asset value.\n\nWherever the market value on the balance sheet date is higher than the previous year's valuation, the value is written up to no more than the historical acquisition cost.\n\n## Loans in affiliated enterprises and participations\n\nThese items are normally recorded at cost less impairments, in accordance with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code. However, when converting foreign currency loans into euro at the reporting date, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\n## Stocks, interests in funds, debt securities and other fixed and variable income securities, miscellaneous investments\n\nThese items are generally valued in accordance with \u00a7 341b (2) of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 253 (1), (4), and (5) of the German Commercial Code, using either the acquisition cost or the stock exchange or market value on the balance sheet date, whichever is lower. We calculate the acquisition cost by averaging the different acquisition costs for securities of the same type.\n\n## Registered bonds, debentures, and loans\n\nThese items are recorded at cost less impairments in accordance with \u00a7 253 (3) sentence 5 of the German Commercial Code. In accordance with \u00a7 341c  of the German Commercial Code, amortized cost accounting is applied and the difference between acquisition cost and the redemption amount is amortized over the remaining period, based on the effective interest method.\n\n## Assets to meet liabilities resulting from retirement provision commitments\n\nThese assets are recorded at fair value in accordance with \u00a7 253 (1) of the German Commercial Code, and offset against the liabilities in accordance with \u00a7 246 (2) of the German Commercial Code. Group life insurance contracts are recorded at asset value.",

        "page_content": "If the liabilities exceed the fair value, the exceeding amount will be shown under other provisions. If the fair value of the assets exceeds the liabilities, the exceeding amount is shown as an excess of plan assets over pensions and similar obligations.\n\nThese items are recorded at acquisition cost less depreciation on a straight-line basis. The expected useful life is based on the tax depreciation tables. Low-value assets worth up to \u20ac 250 are written off immediately. A compound item for tax purposes formed in accordance with \u00a7 6 (2a) of the German Income Tax Act (EStG) for assets from \u20ac 250 to \u20ac 1,000 is depreciated by one fifth each year.\n\nWhen calculating deferred taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset.\n\nBased on the capitalization option in accordance with \u00a7 274 (1) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code, the surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities is not recognized.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed,\n- -bank deposits,\n- -accounts receivable on reinsurance business,\n- -other receivables,\n- -cash with banks and cash on hand.\n\nThese items are recorded at face value less repayments and impairments.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -unearned premiums,\n- -aggregate policy reserves,\n- -reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses,\n- -reserves for premium refunds,\n- -claims equalization and similar reserves,\n- -other insurance reserves.\n\nInsurance reserves are set up according to the German Commercial Code and the Government Order on the External Accounting Requirements of Insurance Enterprises (RechVersV) requirements. The primary goal is to ensure our ongoing ability to satisfy reinsurance contract liabilities in all cases. Generally, reinsurance reserves are booked according to the cedent's statements. For claims incurred but not yet reported, or not sufficiently reported, additional reserves are calculated using actuarial techniques.\n\nInsurance reserves in the ceded reinsurance business are calculated according to the terms of the retrocession contracts.\n\nUnearned premiums are accrued premiums already written for future risk periods. They are calculated in accordance with German accounting principles, partly on the basis of information received from the cedents and partly using nominal percentages. Where unearned\n\npremiums are calculated using such percentages, these are based on many years of experience and the latest information available.\n\nAggregate policy reserves for Life/Health reinsurance are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are established for the payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims that have occurred but are not yet settled. Reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses fall into two categories: case reserves for reported claims, and reserves for losses incurred but not reported yet, or not sufficiently reported.\n\nReserves for premium refunds are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nFor Property-Casualty reinsurance, the equalization reserve, the reserve for nuclear plants, the product liability reserve for major pharmaceutical risks, and reserves for risks relating to terrorist attacks are calculated according to \u00a7 341h of the German Commercial Code in conjunction with \u00a7 29 and \u00a7 30 of the Government Order on the External Accounting Requirements of Insurance Enterprises. The reserves are set up to moderate substantial fluctuations in the claims of individual lines of business. In cases where above-average or belowaverage claims occur, changes in the reserves mitigate the technical result for the individual lines of business.\n\nOther insurance reserves are generally recorded according to the amounts in the cedent's statements.\n\nPension provisions are calculated applying actuarial principles. Other obligations,  such as provisions for jubilee payments, birthday payments, early retirement payments, phased-in early retirement benefits and a long-term credit account, are also calculated in accordance with actuarial principles.\n\nAccording to \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code, the discount rate used for calculating the pension obligations has to be derived from a 10-year-average/uni003B for calculating other obligations, it has to be derived from a 7-year-average.\n\n\u00a7 253 (6) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code states that a positive difference resulting from the calculation of pension obligations with the discount rate of 7-year-average versus 10-year-average is subject to the restriction on dividend payout.\n\nApart from that, with respect to the discount rate, the simplification option set out in \u00a7 253 (2) sentence 2 of the German Commercial Code has still been applied (duration of fifteen years). The impact of the change in the discount rate is reported under other non-technical result.\n\nFor further information regarding the accounting for pensions and similar obligations, please refer to note 14 to our financial statements.\n\nRemaining  other  provisions  are  recognized  at  the  settlement amount. Long-term provisions are discounted applying the net approach in accordance with IDW RS HFA 34.\n\nThese consist of the following:\n\n- -subordinated liabilities,\n- -funds held with reinsurance business ceded,\n- -other liabilities.",

        "page_content": "These items are valued at the settlement amount. Annuities are recorded at present value.\n\nAccrued interest and rent are valued at nominal amounts. Premiums and discounts carried forward as prepaid income and expenses are amortized over the remaining life of the related financial instruments.\n\nTransactions are generally recorded in the original currency and converted into euro at the relevant daily rate (middle forex spot rate).\n\nLoans to affiliated enterprises denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euro using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date, and applying the strict lower of cost or market value principle.\n\nThe valuation of foreign currency shares in affiliated enterprises and participations, stocks, interests in funds, and other variable and fixed-income securities is performed by converting their value from the original currency into euro, using the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date.\n\nComparing the acquisition cost in euro with the value in euro as described above, the moderate lower-value principle is applied for affiliated  enterprises and participations. For other investments, the strict lower of cost or market value principle is applied.\n\nAs a result of this valuation method, currency gains and losses are  not  separately  determined  and  shown  as  foreign-exchange gains/losses in the other non-technical result. Instead, the net effect of both changes (exchange rate and value in original currency) is reflected in the impairments/reversals of impairments and in the\n\nrealized  gains/losses calculated for these asset classes and is disclosed in the investment result.\n\nIssued debt securities and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euro at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Unrealized losses are recognized immediately in the income statement, while unrealized gains are not.\n\nAll other monetary assets and liabilities with a remaining term of one year or less recorded in foreign currency are valued at the middle forex spot rate as of the reporting date. Both unrealized losses and gains resulting from the valuation of these foreign currency positions are reflected immediately in the other non-technical result,  as neither \u00a7 253 (1) sentence 1 nor \u00a7 252 (1)  number 4  clause 2 of the German Commercial Code are applicable.\n\nAllianz SE made use of the option of forming valuation units as defined in \u00a7 254 of the German Commercial Code. This option is used for derivative contracts in which Allianz SE acts as an intra-group clearing agency. In this function, Allianz SE enters into derivative transactions with other Group companies and hedges the exposure resulting from these transactions by entering into mirror positions with the same term and structure but with different partners. Opposing positions whose performances completely offset each other have been combined into valuation units and form a perfect micro hedge.\n\nWhen  accounting  for  valuation  units,  we  apply  the  'freezing' method, which means that mutually offsetting changes in value of opposing positions (i.e., within valuation units) are not recorded in the income statement. More details regarding derivative transactions combined into valuation units are explained in note 16 to our financial statements.",

The fair value is determined during the financial year.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nInvestments in companies quoted on the stock exchange are generally measured by the stock exchange price quoted on the last trading day of 2021. Non-quoted companies are generally valued at their net asset value, calculated using the German Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management's (DVFA) method. The transaction prices are used  for recent transactions. In individual cases, marketbased valuation models based on market multiplies of relevant peers or internal valuation models considering the individual conditions defined in shareholder agreements are applied.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThese items are measured at the stock exchange value quoted on the last trading day of 2021 or, if there is no active market, at the prices obtained from brokers or pricing services.\n\nLoans are valued using the Discounted Cash Flow method. Relevant discount  rates  are  derived  from  observable  market  parameters and reflect the remaining life and credit risk of the instruments. In exceptional cases, the carrying amount is used as fair value.\n\n## Bank deposits and funds held by others under reinsurance business assumed\n\nThere are no differences between the book value and the fair value of these items.\n\nWe disregarded market value declines of \u20ac 0.6 mn for loans with a book value of \u20ac 62 mn. Based on the expected development of market conditions, the decline in market value is not expected to be of an enduring nature. We intend to hold loans until maturity in order to ensure a repayment at par value.",

The previous year's figures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe total of other provisions rose by \u20ac 1,592 mn. This growth resulted mainly from a net increase of pension liabilities by \u20ac 1,099 mn. The miscellaneous provisions also went up by \u20ac 270 mn. This increase was almost entirely driven by the higher provisions for anticipated losses (\u20ac 240 mn), which resulted exclusively from derivative transactions. The tax provisions grew by \u20ac 223 mn.\n\nAllianz SE has made pension promises for which pension provisions are recognized. Part of these pension obligations are secured by 'Contractual Trust Arrangements' (Methusalem Trust e.V.). Nearly\n\nall of these trust assets constitute offsettable plan assets, with the asset value/market value being used as the fair value.\n\nIn 1985, the pension provisions of the German subsidiaries were centralized by transferring the corresponding assets to Allianz SE. As a result, Allianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of these old pension promises. The German subsidiaries reimburse the costs, with Allianz SE assuming responsibility for settlement. Consequently, these pension provisions are reported by Allianz SE.\n\nIn  2021,  claims  equalization  and  similar  reserves  increased  by \u20ac 435 mn to \u20ac 3,006 mn. This was mainly driven by a lower claims frequency in the liability reinsurance, which resulted in an increase of the claims equalization and similar reserves by \u20ac 243 mn. Due to an increase in the accident year claims ratio from 68.2 % to 75.8 %, the allocation to the claims equalization and similar reserves decreased by \u20ac 296 mn to \u20ac 120 mn in motor reinsurance.",

Allianz SE  hedged these positions by entering into countertrades at the market. Both intra-group and group-external positions were combined to valuation units  ('Bewertungseinheiten').  The average remaining term of the call options is six years. The average remaining term of the put options is nine months.\n\nEuropean-type  options  are  valued  using  the  Black-Scholes model, and American-type options using the binomial model, both based on the closing price on the valuation date. Yield curves are derived from the swap rates prevailing on the valuation date. The future dividend yield is estimated on the basis of market information on the valuation date. Volatility is estimated based on currently traded implicit volatility, taking into account the residual term, and the ratio between the strike price and the prevailing share price.\n\nForward contracts in shares, share indices, and hedge RSU as of 31 December 2021\n\n|               | Nominal   | Fair value   | Book value   | Underlying             | Balance sheet position   |\n|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Class         | \u20ac thou    | \u20ac thou       | \u20ac thou       |                        |                          |\n| Long forward  | 468,102   | 5,859        | 5,287        | Allianz SE share       | Liabilities F.IV.        |\n| Long forward  | 242,556   | 85,047       | -            | UniCredit S.p.A. share | -                        |\n| Short forward | 242,556   | (85,047)     | -            | UniCredit S.p.A. share | -                        |\n| Hedge RSU     | 282,180   | (343,945)    | 343,971      | Allianz SE share       | Liabilities F.IV.        |\n\nPositions in long forwards on Allianz SE shares and in hedge RSU are held in the context of hedging the Allianz Equity Incentive Plans.\n\nFor the purpose of hedging the share price risk, our subsidiary Allianz Finance II Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l.  entered  into  short  forwards  on UniCredit S.p.A. shares with Allianz SE. Allianz SE hedged these positions  by  entering into countertrades at the market. Both intra-group and group-external positions were combined to valuation units. The remaining term of these forwards is less than one year.\n\nThe fair value of a forward contract is determined as the difference between the underlying closing price on the valuation date\n\nand the discounted forward price. The net present value of dividend payments due before maturity of the forward contract is also taken into account, unless the dividends are subject to a pass-through agreement. Liabilities from hedge RSU, which the Group companies acquire from Allianz SE in order to hedge their liabilities from the Group Equity Incentive programs, are valued on the basis of the Allianz closing price on the valuation date, minus the net present value of estimated future dividends due before maturity of the respective hedge RSU. Applicable discount rates are derived from interpolated swap rates.\n\nForward contracts in bonds as of 31 December 2021\n\n|               | Nominal   | Fair value   | Book value   | Underlying   | Balance sheet position   |\n|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| Class         | \u20ac thou    | \u20ac thou       | \u20ac thou       |              |                          |\n| Long forward  | 609,672   | (96)         | -            | Bonds        | -                        |\n| Short forward | 609,672   | 96           | -            | Bonds        | -                        |\n\nFor the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk of investments, Allianz Benelux N.V. entered into forward transactions on bonds with Allianz SE.

Due to the lack of quoted prices on active markets for these financial participations, and the uncertainty regarding the occurrence of the option conditions, the fair value of such options cannot be determined reliably. Wherever feasible, contractual arrangements including the option agreements\n\nwere taken into account when determining the fair value of the financial participation. However, no stand-alone valuation of the options as derivative financial instruments was performed.\n\nEmbedded in a retrocession agreement covering the retrocession of life business to an external reinsurance partner, Allianz SE has provided the retrocessionaire with credit protection related to the issuer risk associated with ceded future cash flows arising from a corporate bond. The agreement obliges Allianz SE to pay an amount of \u20ac 87 mn to the retrocessionaire as compensation for safeguarding the reinsurance partner against default risk arising from a bond. At the end of 2021, the fair value of this credit derivative amounted to \u20ac 6.6 mn.",

This significant deterioration is primarily  attributable to the result from foreign currency translation worsening by \u20ac 714 mn as well as to the increase of pension expenses by \u20ac 628 mn.\n\nThe result from foreign currency translation turned negative to \u20ac (371) mn after a \u20ac 343 mn gain in the previous year. This was largely owed to foreign currency translation losses of liabilities denominated in USD (\u20ac (294) mn) and GBP (\u20ac (93) mn) caused by a weaker euro in 2021,  compared  to  gains  in  2020  of  \u20ac 305 mn  and  \u20ac 48 mn, respectively.\n\nAllianz SE has a joint liability for a large part of the pension provisions of its German subsidiaries (see note 14 for more details). Expenses incurred in this context are recognized as service expenses from pension plans charged to Group companies, as they are reimbursed by the German subsidiaries according to the cost allocation contract and result in corresponding service revenues.\n\nThe increase of the pension trend parameter from 1.3 % p.a. to 2.0 % p.a. resulted in a rise of pension expenses by \u20ac 545 mn in 2021.",

As of 31 December 2021, USD 0.2 bn in commercial papers were issued as part of the program,\n- -letters  of  credit  issued  to  various  Allianz Group  companies amounting to \u20ac 1.2 bn.\n\nGuarantee declarations totaling \u20ac 0.8 bn have also been made for life policies signed by Allianz Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Seguros y Reaseguros S.A.\n\nContingent liabilities exist because of indirect pension promises organized via pension funds (Allianz Versorgungskasse VVaG) and support funds (Allianz Pensionsverein e.V.). The adjustment obligation according to \u00a7 16 of the German Occupational Pensions Act (BetrAVG) is not funded in the APV old tariff. As a result of this, the plan assets of the support funds are less than the pension obligations. The resulting deficit as of 31 December 2021 amounts to \u20ac 45 mn (2020: \u20ac 20 mn). In addition, Allianz SE has a joint liability of \u20ac 562 mn for a part of the pension promises belonging to its German subsidiaries.\n\nIn the context of the sale of investments, guarantees were given in individual cases to cover counterparty exposure or the various bases used to determine purchase prices.\n\nIn addition, Allianz SE has issued guarantees to various Allianz Group companies totaling \u20ac 0.7 bn.\n\nAllianz SE enters into contingent liabilities only after careful consideration of the risks involved. On the basis of a continuous evaluation of the risk situation of the contingent liabilities entered into, and taking into account the knowledge gained up to the preparation date, it can be assumed that the obligations underlying the contingent liabilities can be met by the respective principal debtors. As of today, and to the best of our knowledge, Allianz SE assesses the probability of a loss resulting from contingent liabilities to be extremely remote.\n\n## Legal obligations\n\nLegal obligations to assume any losses arise on account of management control agreements and/or profit transfer agreements with the following companies:\n\n- -Allianz Africa Holding GmbH,\n- -Allianz Asset Management GmbH,\n- -Allianz Climate Solutions GmbH,\n- -Allianz Deutschland AG,\n- -Allianz Digital Health GmbH,\n- -Allianz Direct Versicherungs-AG,\n- -Allianz Finanzbeteiligungs GmbH,\n\n- -Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty SE,\n- -Allianz Global Health GmbH,\n- -Allianz Investment Management SE,\n- -Allianz Kunde und Markt GmbH,\n- -Allianz Technology SE,\n- -Allvest GmbH,\n- -AZ-Arges Verm\u00f6gensverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH (until 31 December 2021),\n- -IDS GmbH-Analysis and Reporting Services.\n\nThere are financial obligations of \u20ac 475 mn, which result from advertising agreements (\u20ac 455 mn), and payment obligations arising from investments (\u20ac 20 mn).\n\nAllianz SE is involved in legal, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings in Germany and foreign jurisdictions, including the United States. Such proceedings  arise  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  including, amongst others, Allianz SE's activities as a reinsurance company, employer, investor and taxpayer. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of such proceedings, they may result in substantial damages or other payments or penalties, or result in adverse publicity and damage to Allianz SE's reputation. As a result, such  proceedings  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  Allianz SE's business, financial condition, and results of operations. Apart from the  proceedings  discussed  below,  Allianz SE  is  not  aware  of  any threatened or pending legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on its financial position or profitability. Material proceedings in which Allianz SE is involved are in particular the following:\n\nSince July 2020, multiple complaints have been filed in U.S. Federal Courts and also in certain U.S. State Courts against Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC (AllianzGI U.S.) and in certain complaints, against certain of AllianzGI U.S.'s affiliates, including Allianz SE and Allianz Asset Management GmbH ('Affiliate Allianz Defendants'), in connection with losses suffered by investors in AllianzGI U.S.'s Structured Alpha funds (Funds) during the COVID-19 related market downturn. The actions brought to date have included institutional investor plaintiffs and individual plaintiffs, with certain plaintiffs asserting claims on behalf of putative classes. An investment consultant has also asserted third-party claims against AllianzGI U.S.. Plaintiffs in the currently  pending  26  actions  have  alleged  losses  of  approximately USD 6.3 bn. In addition to the complaints filed to date, other investors in the Funds, or other third parties, may bring similar actions. Plaintiffs in these actions have dismissed without prejudice all claims against Affiliate  Allianz  Defendants,  including  Allianz SE  and  Allianz  Asset Management GmbH, with only one exception where Allianz Global Investors Distributors LLC is kept as a defendant next to AllianzGI U.S. AllianzGI U.S. continues to defend against the allegations contained in the complaints.\n\nUpon request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), AllianzGI U.S. has provided substantial information to the SEC in",

The provision reflects the elements of the expected obligation in the Structured Alpha matter, for which, as of today, a reliable estimate could be determined. Final settlements with major investors were reached shortly thereafter and Allianz believes that these settlements represent a substantial majority of the Structured Alpha civil litigation exposure.\n\nDiscussions with remaining plaintiffs, the DOJ as well as the SEC are ongoing, and the timing and nature of any global or coordinated resolution of these matters is not certain. Therefore, as of today, the total financial impact of the Structured Alpha matter cannot be reliably estimated and it is expected that additional expenses will be incurred before these matters are finally resolved. Such additional expenses also cannot reliably be estimated and consequently are not included in the provision recognized in the Allianz Group financial statements. For Allianz SE the Structured Alpha matter has not led to any requirement for building a provision.\n\n## Board members\n\nThe disclosures required in accordance with \u00a7 285 No. 10 HGB for the Supervisory Board and Board of Management can be found in the chapters Mandates of the Members of the Supervisory Board and Mandates of the Members of Board of Management.\n\n## Board of Management remuneration 1\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Board of Management was comprised of ten members.

In addition, we have audited the management report of Allianz SE - which comprise the content included to comply with the German legal requirements  as  well  as  the  non-financial  statement  pursuant  to \u00a7 289b (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] included in section 'Non-Financial Statement' of the management report - for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the statement on corporate governance pursuant to \u00a7 289f HGB.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- -the accompanying annual financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021 in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, and\n- -the accompanying management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position. In all material respects, this management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the management report does not cover the content of the statement on corporate governance referred to above.\n\nPursuant to \u00a7 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\nWe conducted our audit of the annual financial statements and of the management report in accordance with \u00a7 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (number 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany - IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the\n\nAnnual Financial Statements and of the Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon/uni003B we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matter of most significance in our audit was as follows:\n\n- -Measurement of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\n- -Matter and issue\n- -Audit approach and findings\n- -Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter, we present the key audit matter:\n\n## Measurement of reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses\n\n## Matter and issue\n\nIn the annual financial statements of the Company, technical provisions (so called 'claims provisions') amounting to \u20ac 14,753 mn (11.4 % of total assets) are reported under the 'Reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses' balance sheet item.\n\nInsurance companies are required to recognize technical provisions to the extent necessary in accordance with reasonable business judgment to ensure that they can meet their obligations from insurance contracts on a continuous basis. Defining assumptions for the purpose of measuring the technical provisions requires the Company's executive directors, in addition to complying with the requirements of commercial and regulatory law, to make estimations of future events and to apply appropriate measurement methods. The gross provision is generally determined on the basis of the cedents' information or, in the case of outstanding settlements, on the basis of an estimate. The Company  reviews  the  appropriateness  of  the  cedents'  information and, if necessary, makes appropriate increases to the amounts.\n\nThe methods used to determine the amount of the claims provisions  and the calculation parameters are based on judgments and",

        "page_content": "assumptions made by the executive directors. In particular, the lines of products with long claims settlement periods, low loss frequency or high individual losses are usually subject to increased estimation uncertainties and usually require a high degree of judgment by the Company's executive directors.\n\nMinor changes to those assumptions and to the methods used may have a material impact on the measurement of the claims provisions. Due to the material significance of the amounts of these provisions in relation to the assets, liabilities and financial performance of the Company as well as the considerable scope for judgment on the part of the executive directors and the associated uncertainties in the estimations made, the measurement of the claims provisions was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n## Audit approach and findings\n\nAs part of our audit, we evaluated the appropriateness of selected controls established by the Company for the purpose of selecting actuarial methods, determining assumptions and making estimates for the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims in propertycasualty insurance.\n\nWith the support of our property-casualty insurance valuation specialists, we have compared the respective actuarial methods applied and the material assumptions with generally recognized actuarial practices and industry standards and examined to what extent these are appropriate for the valuation. Our audit also included an evaluation of the plausibility and integrity of the data and assumptions used in the valuation and an analysis of the claims settlement processes and the reconciliation of the information provided by the cedents. Furthermore, we recalculated the amount of the provisions for selected lines of products, in particular lines of products with large reserves or increased estimation uncertainties. For these lines of products we compared the recalculated provisions with the provisions calculated by the Company and evaluated any differences.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are  appropriate  overall  for  measuring  the  technical  provisions  in property-casualty insurance.\n\n## Reference to further information\n\nThe Company's disclosures on the measurement of provisions for unsettled claims are contained in section Accounting, Valuation, and Calculation Methods in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the statement on corporate governance pursuant to \u00a7 289f HGB as an unaudited part of the management report.\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\n- -the  remuneration  report  pursuant  to  \u00a7 162 AktG  [Aktiengesetz: German Stock Corporation Act], for which the supervisory board is also responsible\n- -all remaining parts of the annual report - excluding crossreferences to external information - with the exception of the audited annual financial statements, the audited management report and our auditor's report.\n\nOur audit opinions on the annual financial statements and on the management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- -is materially inconsistent with the annual financial statements, with the management report disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- -otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the annual financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial  position  and  financial  performance  of  the  Company  in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of annual financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual financial statements, the executive directors  are responsible for assessing  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.\n\nFurthermore,  the  executive  directors  are  responsible  for  the preparation of the management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the annual financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process for the preparation of the annual financial statements and of the management report.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  annual financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Company's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual financial statements and this management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual  financial  statements  and  of  the  management  report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of  the  annual  financial  statements  and  of  arrangements  and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems of the Company.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- -Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the annual financial statements and in the management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- -Evaluate the overall presentation, structure,  and content of the  annual financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the annual financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Company in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles.\n\n- -Evaluate the consistency of the management report with the annual financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Company's position it provides.\n- -Perform  audit  procedures  on  the  prospective  information  presented by management in the management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the  prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of  most significance in the audit of the annual financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

It explains the application of the remuneration system in the financial year 2021, using detailed and individualized specifications on the remuneration of current and former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe report was created jointly by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and takes into consideration the requirements of \u00a7 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its currently valid version.\n\nIt was also decided to allow the auditor to carry out a comprehensive, content audit of the Remuneration Report above and beyond the legal requirements of \u00a7 162(3) AktG.\n\n## Review of the financial year\n\nThe Supervisory Board had resolved minor adjustments to the remuneration system for members of the Board of Management with effect from 1 January 2021. These comprise primarily the introduction of requirements or recommendations of the German Stock Corporation Act and the German Corporate Governance Code. The details of these adjustments are described in the section 'Other  Remuneration  Principles', 'Deviation From The Remuneration System' and 'Remuneration Adjustments'.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also resolved to adjust the target remuneration and the maximum remuneration of the Chairperson of the Board of Management, to ensure the appropriateness of the remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration system adjusted on this basis was presented to the Annual General Meeting under agenda item 5 for approval on 5 May 2021. The Annual General Meeting approved the system for the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management with a majority of 87.14 %. The remuneration system applies to all members of the Board of Management who were active in the financial year 2021.\n\nBarbara Karuth-Zelle and Christopher Townsend have been members of the Board of Management since 1 January 2021. They assumed departmental responsibility from Dr. Christof Mascher and Niran Peiris, both of whom retired from the Board of Management as of 31 December 2020.\n\nEffective 1 October 2021, Dr. Andreas Wimmer was appointed to the Board of Management. He assumed responsibility for the Asset Management division and Allianz Life in the U.S. from Jacqueline Hunt, who is acting as strategic advisor to the Chairperson of the Board of Management as of this date. Remuneration for the new members of the Board of Management was set at the same level as the other ordinary members of the Board of Management.\n\nIn addition to the situation and impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on overall economic conditions, as well as on the insurance industry and Allianz employees, other key issues included the risk strategy and the Board of Management's planning for both the financial year 2022 and the three-year period from 2022 to 2024. Cyber risk security and the impact of rising inflation rates on the insurance business were  also  regularly  discussed.  Furthermore,  the  Supervisory  Board dealt in depth with personnel matters relating to the Board of Management as well as succession planning for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, especially in the context of the upcoming elections to the Supervisory Board in 2022. The Supervisory Board and various committees also discussed appropriate consideration of nonfinancial targets in the target-setting process for the Board of Management remuneration.\n\nThe Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board has closely followed the business development from the viewpoint of potential target achievement at Group level and individual remuneration targets for the first half of the year and at year-end. Another focal point was the ongoing discussion of the lawsuit and official proceedings in connection with the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha Funds, particularly in the second half of 2021 and with regards to the target achievement for the financial year. Besides the quantitative targets for the financial year 2022, the non-financial targets and appropriateness of the remuneration of the Board of Management were discussed. Changes in the Board of Management were also prepared and implemented.\n\n## Remuneration of the Allianz SE Board of Management\n\nRemuneration is designed to be appropriate compared to peers, given the Allianz Group's range of business activities, operating environment, and business results achieved. The aim is to ensure and promote sustainable and value-oriented management of the company that is in line with our corporate strategy. The key principles are as follows:\n\n- -Support of the Group's strategy: The design of variable compensation, and in particular of performance targets, reflects the business  strategy  and  sustainable  long-term  development  of  the Allianz Group.\n- -Alignment of pay and performance: The performance-based variable component of the board members' remuneration forms a significant portion of the overall remuneration, corresponding to 70 % of the target compensation.\n- -Sustainability of performance and alignment with shareholder interests: A major part of the variable remuneration reflects longerterm performance, with deferred payout (64 %), and is linked to the absolute and relative performance of the Allianz share.",

        "page_content": "The Board of Management's remuneration is decided upon by the entire Supervisory Board, based on proposals prepared by the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee. If required, the Supervisory Board may seek outside advice from independent external consultants. The Personnel  Committee  and  the  Supervisory  Board  consult  with  the Chairperson  of the Board of Management in assessing the performance and remuneration of Board of Management members. The Chairperson of the Board of Management is generally not involved in the discussion about their own remuneration. The Supervisory Board designs the remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management in accordance with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in its currently valid version as well as with regulatory requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, while ensuring clarity and comprehensibility. Feedback from investors is also considered.\n\nBased on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines the target total compensation, and regularly reviews the appropriateness of the remuneration. This is based on both a horizontal comparison (i.e., with peer companies) and a vertical comparison (in relation to Allianz employees). Again, the Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee develops respective recommendations, if necessary with the assistance of external consultants.\n\nThe structure, weighting, and level of each remuneration component should be adequate and appropriate.\n\n## Horizontal appropriateness\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly benchmarks the remuneration of the Board of Management of Allianz SE against other DAX companies and selected international companies (including, for example, the top positions in the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance), taking into account the company's position, as well as the Allianz Group's long-term performance, relative size, complexity, and internationality.\n\nThe benchmarking against the DAX companies in December already took into account the extension of the peer group from 30 to 40 companies. The outcome of the horizontal comparison is that Allianz SE is well above 75 th percentile relative to size (revenue, number of employees, and market capitalization) compared to the DAX companies. Accordingly, the total remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is orientated on the upper quartile of the remuneration of the peer companies.\n\n## Vertical appropriateness\n\nThis comparison is based on the total direct compensation of a member of the Board of Management and the average direct compensation of an employee of the German Allianz companies. The Supervisory Board's decision in December is based on the factor resulting from this comparison for the previous financial year. For the financial year 2020, the factor for the Chairperson of Board of Management to employee was '66', and the factor for a regular board member to employee was '36'. For the financial year 2021, the respective factor for the Chairperson of Board of Management to employee is '70' and the factor regular board member to employee is '41'.",

The current pension contribution generally represents 15 % of the target compensation of the board members.\n\nApart from cases of occupational or general disability for medical reasons, the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 62. Should board membership cease before the retirement age is reached, accrued pension rights are maintained if vesting requirements are met.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management may have additional pension entitlements under former pension plans based on previous positions in the Allianz Group or due to membership of the Board of Management prior to 2015.

        "page_content": "## Performance-based remuneration\n\nThe  performance-based  variable  remuneration  includes  the  shortterm annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration. The composition  aims  to  balance  short-term  performance,  longer-term success and sustained value creation. The Supervisory Board ensures that the targets for the variable remuneration are challenging, sustainable and ambitious.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe annual bonus provides incentives for profitable growth and further developing the operating business by successfully implementing the business objectives for the respective financial year. In doing so, the overall responsibility for reaching the Group targets as well as the individual performance with regard to the operational responsibilities of the individual members of the Board of Management are taken into consideration.\n\nThe annual bonus is derived by multiplying the target achievement factor by the target amount for the annual bonus, and is paid out in cash after the end of the relevant financial year, with payment limited to a maximum of 150 % of the target amount.\n\n## Long-term incentive - LTI\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation is oriented mainly towards the sustainable increase in the enterprise value. Taking the share price performance in absolute and relative terms as a basis, it encourages combining the interests of the shareholders with those of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nOther stakeholder aspects are taken into consideration by setting strategic sustainability targets, whose achievement forms the basis for the final assessment at the end of the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nAlmost two thirds (64 %) of the variable remuneration is  sharebased, so as to adequately reflect the long-term performance of the company in the Board of Management remuneration.\n\n## Additional remuneration principles\n\n## Shareholding obligation and shareholding exposure\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are obliged to build up the following degree of share ownership within three years:\n\n- -Chairperson of the Board of Management: two times base salary, i.e., \u20ac 3,822 thou,\n- -Regular Board of Management member: one time base salary, i.e., \u20ac 975 thou.\n\nHolding is required for the entire term of service on the Board of Management. Shares will be acquired through mandatory pay component conversion. In case of a base salary increase, the shareholding obligation increases accordingly. The holding obligation ceases with the end of the mandate.\n\nIn  combination with the virtual shares (RSU) accumulated over four years through the LTI plan, the Allianz SE Board of Management has significant economic exposure to the Allianz stock: It amounts to approx. 800 % of base salary for the Chairperson and approx. 700 % of base salary for a regular board member.\n\n## Malus/clawback\n\nVariable remuneration components may not be paid, or payment may be restricted, in the case of a significant breach of the Allianz Code of Conduct or regulatory Solvency II policies or standards, including risk limits.\n\nIn  the  same  way,  variable  remuneration  components  already paid may be subject to a clawback for three years after payout. Additionally, a reduction or cancellation of variable remuneration may occur if the supervisory authority (BaFin) requires this in accordance with its statutory powers.\n\n## Payout cap\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7 87a (1) sentence 2 (1) AktG and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board has determined a remuneration cap.\n\nThus, the actual payout for the underlying financial year, comprising the base salary, variable remuneration and pension service cost, will be capped at maximum \u20ac 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management, and at \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member of the Board of Management. If the remuneration for the financial year exceeds this amount, compliance with the maximum limit will be ensured by reducing the payout of the long-term variable remuneration accordingly.\n\nThis payout cap principle was introduced for the first time for the financial year 2019. Given that the actual amount of the paid out longterm variable remuneration cannot be determined until after vesting and the final sustainability assessment, compliance with the payout cap will be reported on for the first time in the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2024.\n\n## Deviation from the remuneration system\n\nThe Supervisory Board can deviate temporarily from the remuneration system in exceptional circumstances in accordance with the statutory requirements (\u00a7 87a (2) AktG), if this is necessary in the interests of the long-term welfare of the company. The assessment may take into account  both  macroeconomic  and  company-related  exceptional circumstances, such as impairment of the long-term viability and profitability of the company. The deviation requires a prior proposal by the Personnel Committee.\n\nThe components of the remuneration system from which deviations may be made in exceptional cases include in particular the base salary, the annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI), including their  relationship  to  each  other,  their  respective  assessment  bases where applicable, the target setting and target achievement assessment principles, and the determination of any payout and payment dates. The duration of the deviation shall be determined by the Supervisory Board at its due discretion, but should not exceed a period of four years. In a crisis situation, for example, this principle is intended to allow the appointment of a new board member, e.g., with crisis management expertise, with a remuneration structure that temporarily deviates from the remuneration structure.\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to deviate from the remuneration system.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration adjustment\n\nThe Supervisory Board is also entitled to take appropriate account of extraordinary  unforeseeable  developments  when  determining  the amount of the variable remuneration components. This rule takes up a recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code and allows for the adjustment of the remuneration in rare unforeseeable exceptional cases.\n\nConceivable cases of application include, for example, significant changes in accounting rules, or in the tax or regulatory framework, as well as catastrophic events not yet known at the time of target setting. The application of this rule may also lead to a reduction in the variable remuneration.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may also adjust the target remuneration of the members of the Board of Management, insofar as this is appropriate to ensure that the remuneration of the Chairperson of the Board of Management or a regular member of the Board of Management is appropriate with regard to their duties and performance. In doing so, it shall take into account the comparison of the Board of Management remuneration horizontally and vertically. The aim of this rule is to moderately  adjust Board of Management remuneration on the basis of horizontal and vertical salary trends, and thus to avoid major salary increases.\n\nIt does not constitute an automatic adjustment, but requires a justified decision by the Supervisory Board in each case. Such a moderate adjustment of the target remuneration does not in itself represent a significant change to the remuneration system. These adjustments or deviations must be justified in detail in the respective remuneration report for the financial year. The remuneration report is prepared in accordance with ARUG II and submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval.\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to adjust the remuneration.\n\n## Termination of service\n\nBoard of Management contracts are limited to a period of five years. For new appointments, a shorter period of up to three years is provided based on the recommendation by the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Severance payment cap\n\nPayments for early termination to board members with a remaining term of contract of more than two years are capped at twice the annual compensation, consisting of the last financial year's base salary and 100 % of the variable target compensation. If the remaining term of contract is less than two years, the payment is pro-rated for the remaining term of the contract. Contracts do not contain provisions for any other cases of early termination of Board of Management service.\n\nIn the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, a severance payment is offset against compensation resulting from the non-compete clause in case of premature termination of service.\n\n## Transition payment\n\nBoard members appointed before 1 January 2010 are eligible for a transition payment after leaving the Board of Management. The transition payment comprises an amount corresponding to the most recent base salary (paid for a period of six months), plus a one-time payment of 25 % of the target variable remuneration at notice date. Where an Allianz pension is due at the same time, such pension is deducted from the monthly transition payments. In the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, the remittance of the transitional payment will be offset against the payment resulting from the non-compete clause.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n## Internal and external board appointments\n\nWhen a member of the Board of Management simultaneously holds an appointment at another company within the Allianz Group or their joint ventures with outside partners, the full amount of the respective remuneration is transferred to Allianz SE.\n\nIn recognition of related benefits to the organization, and subject to prior approval by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, board members are also allowed to accept a limited number of non-executive supervisory roles at appropriate external organizations. In these cases, 50 % of the remuneration received is paid to Allianz SE.\n\nThe respective board member will retain the full remuneration for that position only if the Allianz SE Supervisory Board classifies the appointment as a personal one (ad personam) . Any remuneration paid by external organizations will be itemized in those organizations' annual reports/uni003B its level will be determined by the governing body of the relevant organization.",

        "page_content": "## Target achievement factor to determine the variable remuneration\n\nIn line with the overarching strategic objective 'simplicity wins', the calculation of variable remuneration follows a simple system. The annual bonus and LTI allocation are based on only two Group financial targets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group financial targets\n\nThe Group financial targets are based on equally weighted targets for Group operating profit and Group net income attributable to shareholders. Adjustments are only applied to acquisitions and disposals that account for more than 10 % of the Group's operating profit or net income attributable to shareholders, or that have a value-adding effect from a risk management perspective (e.g., portfolio transfers) and were not yet known at the time the plan was prepared. This regulation is intended to prevent meaningful transactions from having a negative impact on the remuneration of the Management Board.\n\nOperating profit highlights the underlying performance of ongoing core operations.\n\nNet income attributable to shareholders is the profit after tax and non-controlling  interests  (minorities).  Furthermore,  the  net  income forms the basis for the dividend payout and for the return on equity calculation.  Both  key  performance  indicators  (KPIs)  are  important steering parameters for the Allianz  Group and therefore reflect the level of implementation of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Group's financial target achievement is limited to a maximum of 150 % and can drop to zero.\n\nThe minimum, target, and maximum values for the Group financial targets are set annually by the Supervisory Board. These are documented for the respective next financial year and published ex-post in the remuneration report.\n\nfor the relevant financial  year: operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 50 %. The resulting target achievement is adjusted by an individual contribution factor (ICF) in the range of 0.8 to 1.2, which reflects both the results of the business division and the performance of the individual board member. If targets are not met, the variable compensation can be reduced to zero. If targets are significantly exceeded, the target achievement is limited to 150 %.\n\n## Individual performance indicators\n\nThe Group financial target achievement is multiplied by the ICF for each board member. The ICF is based on an assessment by the Allianz SE Supervisory Board, resting upon KPIs reflecting the respective board member's area of responsibility and their personal contribution.\n\n- -Business division targets: For board members with business-related division responsibilities, the contribution to the financial performance considers various indicators of profitability (e.g., operating profit and net income) and productivity (e.g., expense ratio) for the respective business division. For board members with a functional focus, division-specific performance targets are determined based on their key responsibilities, and qualitatively assessed.\n- -Non-financial targets (incl. sustainability targets): Customer satisfaction (for example, Net Promoter Score (NPS)) and employee satisfaction (for example, Allianz Engagement Survey) are taken into account in the non-financial targets. The management qualities, including strategic properties, are also assessed. The review of the individual management qualities assesses behavioral aspects, such as customer orientation, personnel management, corporate behavior, and credibility (for example, social responsibility, integrity, diversity). The following elements were taken into account in 2021 with regard to sustainability/climate protection:",

Most of the performance indicators are provided with quantitative criteria, and therefore offer a sufficiently concrete basis for the combined assessment.\n\nThe individual indicators are not weighted on a percentage basis, so that the ICF is not determined on the basis of a formulaic calculation. This allows the Supervisory Board to take appropriate consideration of the individual criteria and to react appropriately to changes in priorities during the year. Since the performance is determined without a specified weighting, the ICF covers a narrow range of 0.8 to 1.2.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI) design\n\nThe long-term, share-based compensation component makes up the largest portion of variable compensation. It promotes alignment with shareholders and reflects the sustainable implementation of the company's long-term strategy. The LTI is based on the performance in absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz share. Furthermore, the long-term development of KPIs is reflected in the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Grant and contractual vesting period: The LTI is granted annually in the form of virtual Allianz shares, so-called restricted stock units (RSUs). The number of RSUs to be granted corresponds to the LTI allocation amount, divided by the allocation value of an RSU at grant:\n- -The LTI allocation amount is derived by multiplying the LTI target amount by the annual bonus achievement factor, and capped at maximum 150 % of the target level.\n- -The RSU allocation value is based on the ten-day-average Xetra closing price of the Allianz stock following the annual financial media conference 1 . As RSUs are virtual stock without dividend payments, the relevant share price is reduced by the net present value of the expected future dividend payments during the four-year contractual vesting period.\n\nThe LTI grant is followed by a contractual vesting period of four years. After that period, the LTI amount to be paid is determined based on\n\n- 1\\_For accounting purposes, the determination of the fair value of RSUs is based on an option pricing model taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index. For the latter, simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, the\n\nthe relative performance of the Allianz share, the relevant share price, and the results of the sustainability assessment.\n\n- -Relative performance versus peers: Besides the absolute shareprice development, the LTI payout takes the relative performance of the Allianz  share into account. The total shareholder return (TSR) of the Allianz share is benchmarked against the TSR of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index by reflecting the relation of the total performance of the Allianz share ('Allianz TSR') and the total performance of the STOXX Europe 600 insurance index ('Index TSR') between the start and end of the four-year contractual vesting period. The payout is based on the TSR performance factor, which is calculated as follows:\n- -At the end of the contractual vesting period, the difference between the Allianz TSR and the Index TSR is determined in percentage points/uni003B the result is multiplied by '2': As the comparison with competitors and the market is of outstanding\n\nvolatility of the peer index, their correlation, and the expected dividends. The value of the RSUs used for the board members' compensation may deviate from this IFRS value, as a simplified calculation method was applied to increase transparency and traceability.",

        "page_content": "## Application of the remuneration system in the financial year\n\n## Financial Group targets and target achievement\n\nThe degree of target achievement for the Group's financial targets is calculated as the simple average of the target achievement of the operating profit for the year and the net income for the year attributable  to  shareholders.  At  \u20ac 13.4 bn,  the  operating  profit  target  of \u20ac 12.0 bn was exceeded as all business units achieved strong growth, resulting in a target achievement of 123.33 % for operating profit.\n\nThe provision recorded in Q4 2021 for proceedings relating to the Structured Alpha Funds significantly reduced net income attributable to shareholders and thus also the target achievement of the net income attributable to shareholders. With net income attributable to shareholders of \u20ac 6.61 bn, the target of \u20ac 7.20 bn was not reached, resulting in a target achievement of 83.60 %. Without the very strong operating performance and the positive effect from the Allianz Life reinsurance agreement in the USA, the target achievement for net income attributable to shareholders would have been even lower.\n\nOverall, this results in an achievement rate for the Group's financial targets of 103.47 %. The Supervisory Board did not exercise any discretion in determining the Group's financial target achievement.\n\nGroup financial target achievement level 2021Group financial target achievement 2019-2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Group financial target achievement   | Operating profit   | Operating profit   | Operating profit   | Net income   | Net income   | Net income   | Achievement level combined in %   | Achievement level combined in %   | Achievement level combined in %   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Financial year                       | 2019               | 2020               | 2021               | 2019         | 2020         | 2021         | 2019                              | 2020                              | 2021                              |\n| Bonus curve                          |                    |                    |                    |              |              |              |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| 0 % - Floor in \u20ac bn                  | 5.80               | 6.00               | 6.00               | 3.80         | 4.00         | 3.60         |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| 100 % - Target in \u20ac bn               | 11.50              | 12.00              | 12.00              | 7.50         | 7.90         | 7.20         |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| 150 % - Max in \u20ac bn                  | 14.35              | 15.00              | 15.00              | 9.35         | 9.85         | 9.00         |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Target achievement                   |                    |                    |                    |              |              |              | 108.72                            | 75.58                             | 103.47                            |\n| Achievement level in \u20ac bn            | 11.86              | 10.75              | 13.40              | 7.91         | 6.81         | 6.61         |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Achievement level in %               | 106.24             | 79.19              | 123.33             | 111.19       | 71.97        | 83.60        |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Weight in %                          | 50.00              | 50.00              | 50.00              | 50.00        | 50.00        | 50.00        |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n\n## Individual performance indicators and application of the individual contribution factor\n\nIn order to calculate the annual bonus, the target achievement level of the Group's financial targets is multiplied by the individual contribution factor (ICF), which is determined for each board member by the Supervisory  Board  in  line  with  the  target  achievement  of  the  individual agreement on the financial and non-financial targets.\n\nThe financial performance of the Board of Management, based on the operating business, has to be rated as very strong for the financial year 2021. The solvency stabilized at a good level. Almost all business divisions made a positive contribution and some have significantly exceeded the target level.\n\nThe Iberia & Latin America region and the non-operating business of  the  Asset  Management  are  the  exception.  Consequently,  the\n\nGroup's target achievement level is negatively impacted almost exclusively by these divisions.\n\nThe strong performance overall was achieved on a sustainable basis.  As in the financial year 2020, both customers and employees once again awarded the Board of Management a very good rating in the financial year 2021, as revealed by the indicators such as Net Promoter Score, Inclusive Meritocracy Index, and Work Well Index Plus. The  environmental  target set for reducing CO2  emissions was also clearly exceeded. As a result, the overall determination of the individual contribution factor (ICF) for the Board of Management was 1. Compared to the previous year, this includes a flat-rate discount of around 10 percentage points, which was agreed with each individual member of the Board of Management as a result of the Structured Alpha proceedings.",

        "page_content": "As CFO, Giulio Terzariol was responsible for a considerable share of the strong operating profit of over \u20ac 13 bn. He worked consistently on the Allianz Group's S&P rating, the solvency ratio,  and liquidity, which he reinforced through very good capital management, such as successful transactions with closed life insurance policies. Mr. Terzariol was also convincing in his communication of the new financial targets on the Capital Markets Day and of the preparations for the introduction of IFRS 9/17.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expects further progress to be made in 2022 on accumulation control, the management of potential reputational risks, and in monitoring and managing the transformation and IT activities.\n\nDr. G\u00fcnther Thallinger achieved a performance that exceeded expectations in investment management, for which he was responsible. Capital efficiency was significantly increased in the Life/Health business segment through a series of capital measures. In 2021 the return on equity in this segment was 13.0 %. Dr. Thallinger also played a significant  role  in  further  structuring  and  implementing  the  Allianz Group's sustainability ambitions with regard to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, whereby it achieved the leading position among the insurance companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Ranking 2021. The Group Center for sustainability was set up successfully and pro-actively supported the work of the newly-established Sustainability Committee of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expects to make further efforts in consistently realizing potential in the area of health insurance, especially through new cross-border digital initiatives as well as strengthening the competitive position as an investor in global capital markets, especially in non-listed assets.\n\nDr. Barbara Karuth-Zelle has very quickly lived up to her new role as member of the Board of Management, already making a positive and important contribution in her first year. Under her leadership, the Allianz Group has made considerable progress in further harmonizing and centralizing its IT operations. Productivity, for example, once again increased.  Despite  the  numerous  group-wide  transformation  initiatives, IT costs remained in line with expectations. The IT stability was maintained at a high level and the IT security of the Allianz Group was improved further. The very positive development of employee satisfaction in her area of responsibility is also worth mentioning.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expects further progress, especially in synchronizing the global and local measures taken to implement the Business Master Platform, and the consistent alignment of personnel development to the new requirements. The topic of cybersecurity must always be at the forefront in a dynamic environment.\n\nWith a strong contribution to earnings by the operating entities in Western Europe, Sergio Balbinot once again made a material contribution to the Group's very good operating result. Thanks to the acquisition of the Italian property-casualty insurance entity from the Aviva Group, he further reinforced Allianz's strong position in Italy. In addition to Allianz's leadership among the Asian insurance units, the authorization it was granted to establish an insurance asset management company is another very positive issue. Allianz is therefore the first company in China to be able to establish a fully foreign-owned insurance asset management enterprise on the Chinese market. From a Group perspective, the approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) to acquire the shareholdings in Allianz China Life Insurance from joint venture Partner Citic Trust is of great importance. Allianz is now the sole owner of this company.\n\nFor the financial year 2022, the Supervisory Board expects internal and external growth potential, where appropriate, to be realized in the Asia region, as well as further optimization of the business operations.\n\nRenate Wagner made a positive contribution to earnings with the functional units she leads - Human Resources, Legal, Compliance, Privacy & Data Protection, and M&A. It is particularly worth mentioning the second-highest result in the history of the group-wide employee survey 'Allianz Engagement Survey', which reflects the high level of employee satisfaction with the management of the still persistent pandemic in 2021. Contrary to the market trend, employee satisfaction remained at a high level in 2021. Another positive factor is the implementation of acquisitions despite adverse conditions, for example in Italy and Poland, and groundbreaking transactions with various closed life insurance portfolios as well as the good collaboration with the U.S. authorities in resolving the events surrounding the AllianzGI U.S. Structured Alpha Funds.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expects  that,  aside from economies of scale, M&A transactions will also contribute to the new technological challenges. The HR division has to focus strongly on developing and supporting talent within the Group, with regard to the changing requirements.\n\nDr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler successfully steered the Allianz Deutschland AG companies through a challenging year with a steady hand. The implementation of the reorganization of Allianz in Germany, together with the very good results of the employee survey at the same time, is positive. Despite the severe natural disasters of summer 2021, Allianz Deutschland AG achieved very solid results. In addition to the strong contributions to earnings from Switzerland and the region Central and Eastern Europe, the acquisition of Aviva's life and property-casualty business, as well as Aviva Poland's pension and asset management businesses, further expanded the strong position of the Allianz companies in the region. Dr. R\u00f6hler had a material impact on the group-wide improvement in the Group's property insurance performance indicators in the retail business.\n\nThe Supervisory Board continues to expect strong growth above the market trend in the region Central and Eastern Europe. It also expects consistent development of the digitalization process in the German companies in particular as well as timely  improvements in customer satisfaction in property insurance, in order to become the market leader here too.\n\nDr. Andreas Wimmer quickly familiarized himself with the business division he assumed on 1 October 2021, while also continuing to successfully manage Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG. In addition to his commitment to processing the Structured Alpha proceedings and his contribution to the life insurance portfolio transaction in the United States, his convincing presentation of Allianz's future life insurance strategy at the Capital Markets Day in December was a positive factor.\n\nBesides processing the potential measures arising from the Structured Alpha proceedings, the Supervisory Board expects Dr. Wimmer to take further steps in implementing the life insurance strategy and continuing the strategy in asset management.\n\nChristopher Townsend has integrated into the management team and the broader Allianz community fast and with positive impact. Under his leadership and via Global Commercial, the Group's Commercial  business,  incl.  AGCS,  benefited  from  reduced  volatility.  Global Commercial installed a segment-focus steering approach across the Group to address the significant market potential in Mid-Corp. The",

Australia delivered on the re-platforming of the new Business Master Platform with positive results. The strong indices of the annual employee engagement survey within the units under Christopher  Townsend's responsibility were encouraging.\n\nThe Supervisory Board expects further improvement in the MidCorp business, and tangible progress in the transformation of the companies in the UK and Australia.\n\nThe quantitative performance of the companies in the Iberia & Latin America region led by Iv\u00e1n de la Sota fell short of expectations. The Supervisory Board expects a visible improvement here, in terms of profitability and technical excellence. It is worth mentioning the promising start of the joint venture with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) in Spain, the integration of the SulAm\u00e9rica business in Brazil, and  the  successful  transactions  of  the  Allianz X  unit  in  promising FinTech companies. The Supervisory Board assesses as very positive the further successful steps taken towards developing and implementing a uniform, cross-border product and IT platform strategy as well as in the claims processing of Allianz Group.\n\nAllianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) as well as AllianzGI and PIMCO showed a strong operating performance during the time Jacqueline  Hunt was responsible until 30 September 2021. Also positive was the successful completion of the reinsurance agreement for a USD 35 bn fixed index annuity portfolio by Allianz Life, which significantly improved the Allianz Group's return on equity and strengthened the Allianz Group's regulatory capital position. In the case of AllianzGI and PIMCO, in particular, the record inflows of assets under management had a positive impact.\n\nThe non-financial targets also showed a good performance of Ms. Hunt and her contribution went beyond her divisional responsibilities.\n\nMs. Hunt has been an excellent member of the Board of Management and there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by her in connection with Structured Alpha. However, the net income impact of the provision for Structured Alpha has been reflected in her ICF of 0.8.\n\nOverall, Oliver B\u00e4te acted prudently and with confidence, providing his Board of Management team with the right impetus in what was once again a difficult environment, so that the Allianz Group could consistently meet its operating targets beyond expectations. Mr. B\u00e4te presented the Allianz Group's new strategy and ambition for 2022 2024 with great conviction at the Capital Markets Day and the Supervisory Board now expects consistent implementation of this strategy. Mr. B\u00e4te convinced analysts and investors alike with the new dividend strategy and the announcement of AZ Life's groundbreaking transactions in the United States. He was once again a great role model to the entire Allianz management in 2021.\n\n## Potential impact of the legal disputes in the USA on Board of Management remuneration\n\nThe legal disputes in the USA will, in addition to the negative impact on net income attributable to shareholders of the Asset Management division and the Group as a whole, because of failure of this element to meet the financial targets for the 2021 financial year, and through the agreement to a 10 percentage point discount on the individual contribution factor of all board members, also have negative implications for the bonus of the entire Board of Management. The distribution of the LTI in 2022 will be reduced, as well as the bonus payment.\n\nFurthermore, the legal disputes in the USA could also potentially have a clearly negative effect on the Board of Management's longterm incentive. The long-term incentive is based on Allianz SE's share price performance in absolute and relative terms. Following publication of the ad hoc announcement on 1 August 2021, the Allianz share fell by 8 % and at year-end 2021 traded only +3.5 % higher than at the start of the year. In the relative development (including dividends), the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance rose by +21 % compared to the +8 % performance of the Allianz share in 2021. The 12 % points underperformance is reflected with a factor of 2 in the Board of Management's long-term incentive and could potentially reduce the payout by up to -25 %.\n\nEach long-term incentive plan has a four-year term. The relative performance achieved before 1 January 2021 or the future relative performance until the payment date are not taken into account in this exemplary analysis as at the reporting date of 31 December 2021. The relative performance in the reporting year impacts the long-term incentive from the 2020 and 2021 plans. 1\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Board of Management have initiated reviews in conjunction with the Structured Alpha subject as well as commissioning independent advisors to conduct external investigations. The various examinations were not yet concluded at the time of preparing this Remuneration Report. There are no findings so far of possible breaches of duty by the Board of Management.\n\nAccording to the remuneration system for members of the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board may wholly or partially reduce the annual bonus and/or LTI allocation amount or payout (malus) in the case of a significant breach of the Allianz Code of Conduct or other compliance provisions.\n\nIf a breach of compliance is committed and/or infringed prior to payment of the annual bonus or the long-term incentive but is not identified until after payout, the Supervisory Board may wholly or partially reclaim the annual bonus or long-term incentive paid out (clawback).\n\nThe Supervisory Board makes its decision on the basis of its professional  judgment.  In  particular,  the  severity  and  impact  of  the breach, degree of culpability and any financial loss or reputational damage to the company that has occurred or is impending must be taken into account.",

        "page_content": "The following tables show the individual remuneration of the members of the Board of Management who were active in the reporting year, for the 2021 and 2020 financial years.\n\nThe table 'Remuneration In The Financial Year' features the remuneration  awarded  and  due  in  accordance  with  \u00a7 162 (1)  sentence 1 AktG. It includes the payments made in the financial year for base salary, perquisites, and other remuneration. For the variable remuneration, the components for performance fully rendered in the financial year are reported. This requirement is met in case the applicable performance criteria are fulfilled and conditions subsequent and suspensive have been met or have ceased to exist. For the financial year 2021, this is the annual bonus that refers to the 2021 performance period and is paid out in March 2022. For the share-based renumeration, the payout of the RSU allocation of the Allianz Equity Incentive (AEI) for the financial year 2016, which vested in the financial year 2021, is reported.\n\nThis interpretation of the awarding concept corresponds to the definition of the payout in the remuneration reports of previous years. The information in the table 'Remuneration In The Financial Year' is therefore consistent with the details in the column 'Payout' in previous remuneration reports.\n\nThe additional table 'Renumeration For The Financial Year' goes above and beyond the requirements of \u00a7 162 AktG. It includes the contributions  to  base  salary  and  perquisites  made  in  the  respective\n\nfinancial year as well as the annual bonus for the respective financial year and the allocation amount of the share-based remuneration for the financial year.\n\nThe amounts for the annual bonus and LTI allocation reported here result from the achievement of the targets for the financial year. The information therefore directly depicts the correlation between remuneration and business development.\n\nThese compensation components  correspond with the components in the column 'Actual Grant' in previous remuneration reports.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration for the financial year is decisive for reviewing the retention of the general payout cap of \u20ac 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the Board of Management and \u20ac 6,000 thou for a regular member. It is reviewed prior to the payout in 2026 and 2025 of the LTI tranches allocated for the financial year 2021 and 2020, and reported in the remuneration report for the respective financial year.\n\nFurthermore, the pension expenses in the financial year are listed in  both  tables,  even  if  these  are  not  regarded  as  remuneration awarded and due in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG. Finally, in addition to the absolute amounts, the share of the individual remuneration components relative to the total remuneration is stated.\n\nThe information provided for by the Stock Corporation Act on remuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management is shown in a separate table for the sake of clarity.\n\nThe following diagram presents the allocation of the remuneration components in the two tables, using the financial year 2021 as an example:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Her pro-rated base salary for the period from 1 January to 30 September 2021 is \u20ac 731 thou. The pro-rated annual bonus amount for this time period is \u20ac 503 thou.\n\n## Compliance with the maximum remuneration principles on payouts for share-based remuneration in the financial year 2021\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the RSU tranches for the financial year 2016, allocated in March 2017, were paid out to Oliver B\u00e4te, Sergio Balbinot and Jacqueline Hunt. According to the remuneration system applicable at the time of the allocation, the RSU payout is capped at 200 % above the grant price. During the term of the AEI/RSU 2017 tranche, the decisive price of the Allianz share rose from \u20ac 165.55 to \u20ac 203.13. The increase, and therefore the payout, remained significantly below this cap.\n\nFurthermore, the pension expenses in the financial year are listed, even if these are not regarded as remuneration awarded and due in accordance with \u00a7 162 AktG.",

The earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for the Group's financial target achievement -  operating profit and net income, as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nIt must be noted with regard to the Board of Management remuneration from 2017 to 2018 that the payout for the mid-term bonus (MTB) for 2016 - 2018 is reported in the financial year 2018.\n\nThe year-on-year change in Sergio Balbinot's remuneration in 2020 is largely attributable to the fact that he received a payout from the share-based compensation for the first time in this year.\n\nJacqueline Hunt received the share-based compensation for the first time in the financial year 2021. The significant change from 2020 to 2021 in Dr. Klaus-Peter R\u00f6hler's remuneration is explained by the fact that he joined the Board of Management during the year, so the remuneration reported for 2020 is pro rata only.\n\nRemuneration awarded and due to former members of the Board of Management for the financial years following their departure comprises mainly pension payments, share-based compensation payouts and other remuneration.\n\n## Comparative presentation\n\n|                                                    | Development of Board of Management compensation, profit and

        "page_content": "## New board members\n\nEffective 1 January 2022, Sirma Boshnakova was appointed to the Board of Management. Her remuneration has been set at the same level as the other regular members of the Board of Management.\n\n## Individual contribution factor (ICF) structure\n\nIn determining the targets for 2022, even greater account was taken of the increased importance of sustainability issues. In addition to group-wide sustainability targets, individual environmental, social and governance targets were set for each member of the Board of Management for their respective areas of responsibility.\n\nIn order to take better account of this when assessing the target achievement, the individual contribution factor was also restructured with effect from 1 January 2022.\n\nIn the future, the ICF will comprise three categories, namely the Group's financial targets, the strategic priorities, and the sustainability targets, which are described in detail. The new structure of the individual contribution factor will be explained in detail in the remuneration report for the financial year 2022.\n\n## Remuneration of the Allianz SE Supervisory Board\n\nThe remuneration of the Supervisory Board is governed by the Statutes of Allianz SE and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The structure of the Supervisory Board's remuneration is regularly reviewed with regard to its compliance with German, European, and international corporate governance recommendations and regulations.\n\n- -The set total remuneration reflects the scale and scope of the duties of the members of the Board of Management, and is appropriate to the company's activities, and business and financial situation. The contribution to the long-term development of the company by the monitoring activity of the Supervisory Board is also reflected.\n- -The remuneration structure takes into account the individual functions and responsibilities of Supervisory Board members, such as chair, vice chair, or committee mandates.\n- -The remuneration structure allows proper oversight of business as well as independent decisions on executive personnel and remuneration.\n- -In view of the size, complexity and the Allianz Group's long-term performance, the level  of the remuneration for the Supervisory Board is based on the upper quartile of the Supervisory Board remuneration of the companies reported in the DAX.\n\nThe remuneration for the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE provides for a  fixed  remuneration.  Supervisory  Board  members  who  had  only served on the Supervisory Board during part of the financial year receive one twelfth of the remuneration for each month of service commenced. This shall apply accordingly for membership of Supervisory Board committees.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's Remuneration System was presented to the Annual General Meeting of Allianz SE on 5 May 2021 for approval. The inclusion of remuneration for members of the Nomination Committee was also proposed. The remuneration is set at \u20ac 25 thou for the Chairperson and \u20ac 12.5 thou for a regular member, which is half of the usual committee remuneration. This remuneration takes into account the increased tasks in the selection of suitable candidates for the election of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board as well as the increased selection frequency due to the proposed shortening of the term of office of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board from five to four years.\n\nIn the financial year 2021, the Supervisory Board also set up a Sustainability Committee, to closely monitor the sustainability strategy of the Board of Management, in particular. The remuneration was proposed at the usual committee remuneration level of \u20ac 50 thou for the Chairperson and \u20ac 25 thou for a regular member.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting approved these proposals with a majority of 97.56 %.\n\n## Fixed annual remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of a Supervisory Board member consists of a fixed cash amount paid pro rata temporis after the end of the respective quarter of the business year for services rendered over that period. In 2021, each regular Supervisory Board member received a fixed compensation  amounting  to  \u20ac 125 thou  per  year.  The  Chairperson  received \u20ac 250 thou, each Vice Chairperson received \u20ac 187.5 thou.\n\n## Committee-related remuneration\n\nThe Chairperson and members of the Supervisory Board committees receive additional committee-related remuneration. The committeerelated remuneration is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Attendance fees and expenses\n\nIn addition to the fixed and committee-related remuneration, members of the Supervisory Board receive an attendance fee of \u20ac 1,000 for each Supervisory Board or committee meeting they attend. Should several meetings be held on the same or consecutive days, the attendance fee will only be paid once. In addition, the Supervisory Board members are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses and the VAT payable on their Supervisory Board service. The company provides insurance coverage and technical support to the Supervisory Board members to an extent reasonable for carrying out their Supervisory Board duties.",

The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board presented in the table corresponds to the total remuneration awarded and due in the respective financial year.\n\nThe earnings development is shown using the two key performance indicators for the Group's financial target achievement -  operating profit and net income as well as net income as reported in the individual financial statements of Allianz SE. The workforce of the German companies of the Allianz Group is used to present the average employee remuneration on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\n## Comparative presentation\n\n|

The executive directors and the supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related dis-closures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany - IDW). Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report including the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive  directors and the supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of remuneration report including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remuneration report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2021, including  the related disclosures, complies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of \u00a7 162 AktG.\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration report required by \u00a7 162 Abs. [paragraph] 3 AktG, including the issuance of a report on this audit. As we express an unqualified audit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit opinion includes that the information required by \u00a7 162 (1) and (2) AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\nWe issue this auditor's report on the basis of the engagement agreed with Allianz SE. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform the company as to the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended for any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties/uni003B no third parties are included in the scope of protection of the underlying engagement.  \u00a7 334 BGB  [B\u00fcrgerliches  Gesetzbuch:  German  Civil Code], according to which objections arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, is not waived.\n\nMunich, 21 February 2022\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\n\nRichard Burger\n\nFrank Trauschke\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor)\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor)",
