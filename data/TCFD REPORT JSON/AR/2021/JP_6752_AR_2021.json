And based on this thought, he aimed to achieve 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind.' The 'Basic Management Objective' is a concise expression of this mission, and as the heart of the Panasonic Group's management philosophy, it has been the foundation for all of our management activities to date. 'Live Your Best' is a new brand slogan that reflects our Group-wide purpose. Today, global environmental problems, including climate change, are the world's top-priority issues that require urgent solutions. We at Panasonic are determined to unite our Group-wide efforts to squarely address these issues. Furthermore, we will devote ourselves to supporting the well-being of individual people who live and work in society by helping them to pursue their own happiness and health in both mind and body, and thus live their lives with peace of mind and comfort. Therefore, we have decided to adopt this new brand slogan that encapsulates these aims. Going forward, the Panasonic Group will continue to contribute to solving social issues and the development of society based on our management philosophy, thereby paving a new way toward the future. We will also achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value.\n\nBrand slogan reflecting Group-wide purpose\n\nIn an ever-changing world, we continue our efforts to make life simpler, safer, healthier, more enjoyable, and more sustainable.

We mainly operate the home appliance and residential equipment businesses, not only in Japan but globally, especially in China and Northeast Asia.\n\nIn the HVAC, refrigerator, and refrigerator and freezer display case businesses, we are continuing efforts to reduce CO2 emissions through technologies such as energy saving and natural refrigerants. We will also contribute to improving the quality of living from the perspectives of people, society, and the planet, in order to achieve a sustainable society.\n\nIn this segment we will continue to provide new value to vehicles and mobility experience under the slogan 'Heartmotive,' a coined word that combines 'human emotion (heart)' and 'automotive.' This slogan expresses our wish to continue creating inspiring encounters. By combining the technologies honed through development and manufacturing in our automotive business with the Group's knowledge of people and lifestyles, and with comfort, safety and security, and the environment as keywords, we provide a wide variety of unique automotive products, deployed on systems and devices. We also make proposals of solutions using our automotive products. In addition, with regard to initiatives toward the environment, we are promoting the expansion of our products that contribute to automobile electrification and weight reduction and products that use recycled materials, as well as energy reduction in our business activities and recycling-oriented manufacturing.\n\nIn this segment we are contributing to the management reforms of B2B customers by staying close to and bringing innovation to their diverse gemba (operational frontlines). For example, customer supply chains (the gemba for manufacturing, logistics, and retail) are plagued by labor shortages, but operational processes are becoming more complex in order to respond quickly to the diversifying needs of consumers. To address such issues of our customers, we work to optimize operational frontlines and improve productivity by connecting software and technology to powerful hardware, and by incorporating our knowledge and know-how cultivated through manufacturing into our services. We also aim to realize a sustainable society by contributing to the reduction of disposal loss and energy consumption.\n\nIn this segment we provide electronic and industrial devices for a wide range of applications, including industry, information and communication, automotive, and more. By developing products with outstanding features backed by our unique material and process technologies, we contribute to solving difficult social issues such as labor shortages in manufacturing, the data explosion caused by the progress of the information society, and environmental and safety requirements in the mobility society. We also actively work to achieve carbon neutrality in our production activities and reduce our environmental impact through the evolution of product performance, thereby contributing to the realization of a sustainable and prosperous society.\n\nIn this segment we globally provide automotive batteries that support mobility electrification and industrial batteries that support safe and secure social infrastructure such as data centers and home energy storage, medical equipment, and meters, as well as dry batteries that support convenient and comfortable day-to-day living. On the environmental front, we aim to contribute to the environment by reducing CO2 emissions not only through our own business activities, but also through the electrification of society (transition to electric power), particularly in the automotive sector. By maximizing the value we provide to society in the form of security, safety, and low environmental impact, we will contribute to a society that realizes enriched lifestyles and environmental sustainability.",

With this new strategy, we aim to contribute to solving global environmental issues and to support the health and well-being of people around the world, both in mind and body, toward achieving 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind.' This will be done by enhancing competitiveness in all of our businesses, from the viewpoints of both 'strategy' and 'operational capability,' which are indispensable to each other.\n\nThe cash generated, as a return on these contributions, will be allocated to investments in ways that enhance competitiveness. This will allow us to make further contributions and improve our ability to generate cash. In this way, I am determined to enhance corporate value in the medium- to long-term perspective. Since dialogues with our shareholders and investors are extremely important, I will make use of your valuable opinions and suggestions on how our management can pursue enhanced corporate value.\n\nAs we unite our best efforts as a Group, I ask for your continued understanding and support.\n\n## Start of the new structure\n\nOn April 1, 2022, the Panasonic Group formally launched the 'operating company system,' in which each operating company is an independent legal entity. We call this system an 'operating company system' because operating companies play the main role.\n\nEach operating company will enhance competitiveness through\n\n- - implementing thorough 'autonomous responsible management,'\n- - adopting new systems that enable us to compete with specialized companies in each industry, instead of simply implementing Group-wide systems and processes, and\n- - continuously taking up challenges proactively.\n\nFurthermore, each operating company aims to make contribu-\n\ntions to society and customers in the industry it addresses, with\n\nunrivaled speed and scale.\n\nPanasonic Holdings Corporation aims to strengthen its Group-wide management foundation from a long-term perspec-",

To help all employees return to the basics and fully understand their essence, in 2021, we conducted a major revision for the first time in approximately 60 years. I personally took part in this endeavor as a member of the editing team. For each operating company to thoroughly implement 'autonomous responsible management,' it is fundamental that each employee implement the Basic Business Philosophy, so this role, among all five roles, is tackled as the highest priority.\n\nThe second role is to ensure and support enhanced competitiveness through\n\n- - Green Transformation (GX), aiming toward our long-term environmental vision, 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT,'\n- - Digital Transformation (DX), aiming for greater efficiency in operational processes, and\n- - ' Gemba (operational frontlines) innovation' initiatives that eliminate wastefulness in the manufacturing gemba and supply chain by the full use of AI and IT, leading to strengthened operational capabilities.\n\nThe third role is to attain management that maximizes the potential of each employee, an essential part of enhancing competitiveness, and to build the needed platforms. The Panasonic Group has approximately 240,000 employees globally, with diverse personalities and talents. The work environment and corporate culture will be transformed so that each\n\n## Looking back on fiscal 2022 and challenges to take up\n\nSince I assumed the position of CEO in April 2021, I have been engaged in management while setting two years, fiscal year ended March 2022 (fiscal 2022) and fiscal 2023, as the period to focus on enhancing competitiveness to make larger contributions toward society and customers, and to further improve profitability. Looking back on the first year, fiscal 2022, we took a step forward with progress in gemba innovation such as improving productivity, and with gradually internalizing the practice of making constant improvements. However, in terms of the speed of enhancing competitiveness, there is still room for improvement. During fiscal 2023, the second year, we will further accelerate our efforts.\n\nAs for the challenges we should take up, first, we need to take a long-term and customer perspective in formulating our strate-\n\n## New medium- to long-term strategy\n\n## Future direction for the Panasonic Group\n\nOur founder proclaimed the mission of achieving 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind.' Toward this\n\nemployee can take up challenges. To further generate opportunities in major roles and in taking up challenges, we will leverage the Group's wide-ranging capabilities and continue the active exchange of human resources beyond operating companies.\n\nThe fourth role is to make 'selection & concentration' decisions in cases where the operating companies are unable to make such decisions, or to promote investment for growth in opportunities where such investment exceeds the operating companies' own funds. In principle, each operating company will play the major role in developing its own business. However, as a holding company, we will take measures toward our Group's comprehensive development when necessary.\n\nThe fifth role is to respond effectively to critical risks from a Group-wide perspective. This includes thorough implementation of financial discipline, safety and compliance, and a Business Continuity Plan (BCP).\n\n## Roles of Panasonic Holdings Corporation\n\n- 1.  Thoroughly implement Group's Basic Business Philosophy\n- 2.  Help enhance competitiveness to make greater contributions to society & customers: (GX, DX, Gemba Innovation, Design Management, Brand Management, various accelerated innovations)\n- 3.  Help maximize the potential of each employee and build needed platforms\n- 4.  Decide 'selection & concentration' beyond operating company's capability, invest in growth beyond operating company's own funds\n- 5.  Respond effectively to critical risks from Group's perspective\n\ngies. In a rapidly changing world, we should envisage major social changes instead of simply looking at a period of two to three years. What is best for our customers? And how can we translate our great mission into actually achieving our goal by back-casting from those changes?\n\nSecond, we should improve our adaptability to changes and make our management speedier, to an outstanding level. In order to do this, we must eliminate wastefulness, stagnation, and rework at our business frontlines, so that all of our employees can focus on truly value-added activities. Furthermore, it will be necessary to create a system and corporate culture that maximizes the potential of each employee. The new medium- to long-term strategy started in fiscal 2023 has been formulated based on such challenges we need to take up.\n\nGroup's mission, today we must contribute to solving global environmental issues and support the health and well-being of people around the world, both in mind and body, in their 'life-\n\ns\n\n10 10\n\n2",

By becoming unrivaled in accomplishing valued work, we can make great contributions. Accordingly, we will be able to return the generated profit to society, starting with shareholders, and adequately reward our employees. Moreover, we can make investments toward further contributions. We aim to implement such a cycle that leads to thoroughly enhancing our competitiveness.\n\nThis is precisely about conducting sustainable management, while we also make our utmost efforts toward achieving a sustainable society: 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind.' The path will not be smooth, but I am confident that we can achieve this through the unrivaled competitiveness of our contributions to our customers and society.\n\n## Panasonic GREEN IMPACT\n\nToward achieving 'an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind,' contributing to solving global environment issues, climate change in particular, is one of the tasks we must take on with the highest priority.\n\nIn January 2022, we announced the Group's long-term environmental vision: 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT.' We have committed ourselves to 'ACT' to\n\n- - reduce CO2 emissions throughout our overall value chain, including emissions from the use of sold products at the customer side, and\n- - make a positive impact to increase size of contribution in CO2 reductions for society through our wide range of business activities.\n\nAs a numerical target, we announced our aim to create an impact that reduces CO2 emissions by more than 300 million tons by 2050 through the entire Group's business activities (300 million tons is equivalent to approximately 1% of the current global emissions). Setting this target at the center of our medium- to long-term strategy, we will make the strategic investments and take actions for our contributions going forward.\n\nThere are three parts to this major effort. The first part, 'OWN IMPACT,' is emissions reduction in our own value chain, which is 110 million tons. We will achieve net-zero emissions through our energy-saving initiatives, in addition to the effect of decarbonization occurring in society, which will progress toward 2050. This includes 'virtually net-zero CO2 emissions at all operating companies by 2030,' to which we committed ourselves in May 2021. The second part, 'CONTRIBUTION IMPACT,' is 'avoided emissions' (contribution to reducing CO2 emissions for society) of 100 million tons through reduced consumption at the customer side with our current businesses. We will make contributions through such areas as the expansion of EVs with our automotive batteries, supply chain software, and air quality & air-conditioning businesses. The third part, 'FUTURE IMPACT,' is 'avoided emissions' of 100 million tons to impact energy transformation in society through the creation of new technologies and businesses such as hydrogen energy. Taking all three parts together, we aim to achieve an overall reduction impact of more than 300 million tons by 2050.\n\nAs a milestone toward 2050, by 2030, we will aim for approxi-\n\nmately 100 million tons of avoided emissions. However, currently there is no standard to calculate 'avoided emissions.' As the formulation of a standard proceeds, we may need to make revisions accordingly. Nevertheless, we will make efforts to reach each of these targets one by one, so that we can contribute to an early achievement of a carbon neutral society.\n\n## Medium-term management indicators (KGIs) and strategic investments\n\nIn the past, we had set single year-based sales and operating profit margins as management indicators. However, setting short-term profit targets led to the business frontlines holding back necessary investments for the future. As a result, I believe that in some cases, our competitiveness fell behind our peers.\n\nTherefore, we have set cumulative operating cash flow for the three-year period as one of our medium-term management indicators. Cumulative operating cash flow is an indicator of our cash-generation capability as a Group, which is essential for tax payments, dividends, employees' salaries, and sufficient investments in our future contributions to society. More specifically, we aim for 2.0 trillion yen of cumulative operating cash flow over the three years of fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025, with a precondition of achieving 1.5 trillion yen of cumulative operating profit over the same period. In addition, we have set ROE, a measure of capital efficiency, as another medium-term management indicator. Our target is to achieve a level of 10 percent or more by fiscal 2025.\n\nTo achieve these targets, we must thoroughly enhance competitiveness at each business. In this regard, for instance, during the past two years, China and Northeast Asia Company managed to decrease manufacturing costs by over 20 percent in home appliance products as a part of their competitiveness-enhancement initiatives. This gave us the confidence to compete against our peers in pricing, while also securing profit, even in a very competitive market like China. This is just one example showing us there is still a lot of room for improvement in cost competitiveness and profitability as a Group.\n\nRegarding investments going forward, in principle, each operating company will make investments with the cash generated through its own business. Furthermore, while maintaining financial discipline, we will also make strategic investments as a Group. Under the condition of cumulative operating cash flow of 2 trillion yen, a total of 600 billion yen in three years will be invested: 400 billion yen in 'growth areas,' which are automotive battery, supply chain software, and air quality & air-conditioning, as well as 200 billion yen in 'technology pillars.'",

To reach this target, we will make Group-wide investments to thoroughly and rapidly strengthen battery capacity, safety, and cost competitiveness of our automotive batteries.\n\nMore specifically, we will commercialize new high-capacity cells with a 46-mm diameter, at the fastest speed within the industry, by refining our high-quality and safer automotive battery technologies, as well as achieving industry-leading cost competitiveness. First, we will verify the productivity of the highly efficient production line at our Wakayama factory in Japan, with mass production set to start in fiscal 2024. In addition, we applied to the incentive program that the State of Kansas established to attract investments, and received the state's approval in July 2022. The construction of a manufacturing facility in Kansas, USA., is to be decided upon assessing the progress and outlook of enhanced competitiveness in operational capabilities, including manufacturing.\n\nAnd from a sustainability perspective, it is essential to consider the use of precious and limited materials. With our lithium-ion batteries, we have already achieved a significant reduction of cobalt, a rare and indispensable metal. Our battery contained less than 5 percent cobalt as of 2021. Moreover, we have already completed development of technologies to produce cobalt-free cells, and we are nearly at the stage of being able to start their mass production according to customers' needs.\n\n## Supply chain software area\n\nDue to the declining working population, we are facing labor shortage issues at the gemba of manufacturing and logistics industries. Consequently, there are strong demands for higher efficiency and standardization. Therefore, solutions that autonomously improve the overall supply chain are necessary. Even if solutions run autonomously, there is a limit to how swiftly we can optimize the gemba , since they require a higher level of skills. Therefore, such solutions are needed to enable people at the gemba to eliminate wastefulness and stagnation in the overall supply chain without requiring special knowledge.\n\nTo achieve these aims, we will offer a wide range of software solution packages and optimize operational processes through the collection, accumulation, analysis and utilization of various data at the gemba . With these solutions, we will contribute to optimizing the overall supply chain and improving the efficiency of management for our customers. In addition, the accuracy of autonomous supply chain management by Blue Yonder's AI will be enhanced, and their software solutions will also continue to evolve. At the same time, we will contribute to the reduction of negative environmental impact through energy savings, which can be achieved by eliminating wastefulness and stagnation in the overall supply chain.\n\nWith greater business opportunities in the area of supply chain software, the business conditions face drastic changes in the competitive environment, with tougher competition in investments and increased global mobility of highly skilled software engineers. Therefore, to accelerate its growth globally by utilizing the capital markets, we have begun preparations for a potential stock exchange listing of our supply chain management business, as announced on May 11, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Air quality & air-conditioning area\n\nDue to COVID-19, there has been growing demand for ways to alleviate people's anxiety about bacteria and viruses. Moreover, since air-conditioning equipment consumes a large portion of the global electric power, we can make huge contributions to the global environment, even as people enjoy clean and safe air as well as a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTo achieve this goal, Panasonic will continue to develop such unique technologies as 'nanoe X,' 'Ziaino,' and humidity control technologies. In addition, Panasonic will develop an advanced coordinated system that integrates air quality and air-conditioning to manage both comfort and energy savings. Furthermore, we will make investments, mainly in Europe, China and Japan, with the following purposes:\n\n- - establish foundations for sales, engineering and services to continuously offer customers clean, safe and environment-friendly air, and\n- - expand our lineup of advanced coordinated products. By integrating our customer contacts with our knowledge and technologies, accumulated in over 100 years of R&D, we will 'Vitalize the future with air.'\n\ns\n\n12 12\n\n2",

We will apply this to the next-generation residential fuel cell system 'ENE-FARM' and the pure hydrogen fuel cell generator 'H2 KIBOU.' Through these efforts, we will contribute to the acceleration of decarbonization in the power-generation field. Moreover, we aim to establish energy-management technologies that link\n\n- - distributed energy located in various facilities such as houses and factories,\n- - power storage systems, and\n- - EVs.\n\nAccordingly, we will improve the effective use of electric power and contribute to clean energy transformation for society. Another pillar, the Cyber Physical System (CPS), includes\n\ntechnologies that rapidly enable users to find and offer optimum solutions for issues in 'lifestyle' and 'workstyle' by linking the real 'physical' world and 'cyber space.' An example is sensing the activities at various 'physical' workstyle gemba sites, such as manufacturing, logistics and distribution, and then inputting the acquired data in 'cyber space' for analysis and simulation. In this way, we can come up with the optimum solution to eliminate wastefulness and stagnation at the gemba and make improvements. In addition, we are trying to better understand what our customers really need in their actual lifestyles through the usage of our products in various situations. Using AI and software technologies will help us to understand this, and we aim to bring better value in lifestyle experience with our products and services.\n\nTo strengthen Group-wide technology pillars, we will also be proactive in our search for new technologies such as investing in ventures.\n\n| Group-wide technology pillars                                          | Group-wide technology pillars                | PC   | PAS   | PEAC PHS   | PCO   | PID   | PEC   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------|-------|------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Technologies contributing to  'environment'                            | Functional materials/Materials informatics   |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n| Technologies contributing to  'environment'                            | Power electronics                            |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n| Technologies contributing to  'environment'                            | Hydrogen energy devices/DERMS*               |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n| Technologies contributing to  'environment'                            | CPS/AI                                       |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n| Technologies contributing to  well-being in  'lifestyle' & 'workstyle' | Image sensing/Robotics                       |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n| Technologies contributing to  well-being in  'lifestyle' & 'workstyle' | Simulation/Model-based development           |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n| Technologies contributing to  well-being in  'lifestyle' & 'workstyle' | Biosensing/Emotion recognition/Biotechnology |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n| Common software platform                                               | Software/communication/security              |      |       |            |       |       |       |\n\n*Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems\n\nNote: Labels on horizontal axis indicates abbreviations of seven operating companies.

Back in 1932, he recognized the mission of a company as 'the true mission of industrialists: only after there is spiritual peace of mind and a limitless supply of material goods will humanity achieve true happiness.' He set his aim to achieve this with the so-called '250-year plan.'\n\nTo always remind all of us of this mission, we have decided to adopt a new brand slogan, 'Live Your Best.' This slogan also embodies my hope that each employee will turn their thoughts to each customer's happiness.\n\nToward what we aim to be in 2030, everyone at all operating companies of the Panasonic Group is determined to continue efforts to help our customers live their best, offer contributions to become a valued company needed by society, and thus enhance corporate value from the perspective of stakeholders as well as enterprise value in terms of financial measures.\n\nFinally, I would like to ask for your continued support of Panasonic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHighly relevant\n\nRelevant",

Using cumulative operating CF and ROIC as medium-term management indicators (KGIs: key goal indicators), the individual operating companies are working to thoroughly enhance their business competitiveness with the goal of making contributions to society, including in the area of the environment.\n\nFor details on medium- to long-term strategy for each operating company, please refer to the 'Panasonic Group IR Day 2022' documents. https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/investors/presentations/ir-day-2022.html\n\nThe formula for calculating the ROIC of each operating company is as follows.\n\nNet Operating Profit after Taxes\n\nOperating Profit \u00d7 ( 1 - ( Income Taxes / Profit before Income Taxes ) )\n\nInvested Capital\n\nROIC\n\n=\n\n=\n\nEquity + Interest-bearing Debt* *Average at the beginning and the end of fiscal year\n\n## Lifestyle (Panasonic Corporation)\n\n## Becoming an Enterprise with an Overwhelming Presence in Lifestyle\n\nPanasonic Corporation, aiming to manage from a long-term perspective, has defined a mission and vision as its corporate Purpose. The mission is 'Life tech & ideas: For the wellbeing of people, society and the planet,' and the vision is 'We are the best partner of your life with human centric technology and innovation.' Under these banners, the company will move forward with its transformation into an enterprise with an overwhelming presence in the Lifestyle area.\n\nThe long-term strategy for the year ending March 31, 2031 (fiscal 2031) has identified seven priority businesses from the perspectives of business position (market growth potential) and competitive advantage (industry position and growth drivers): HVAC system, overseas electrical construction materials, energy solutions, CO2 refrigeration system, electrical construction materials in Japan, display cases, and home appliances in Japan. In each of these seven priority businesses, the company aims to achieve the No. 1 or No. 2 market share in the industry by 2030 as the customer's preferred choice, thereby transforming its business portfolio. And through this business portfolio reforms, the company will halve CO2 emissions in its own value chain and accelerate the impact of its emission reduction contribution to society.\n\nThe medium-term strategy for fiscal 2025, which is a stepping stone towards 2030, is focused on strategic resource allocation, such as allocating cash generated mainly through operating cash flows to investment in growth businesses and investment to strengthen operational capabilities.

On the other hand, what is equally important is to enhance operational capability. We cannot realize our vision without operational capabilities, which include the unrivaled ability to create products that are valuable to customers and cost-effective, to deliver those products quickly, and to continue production and sales without product shortages or excess inventory. I believe it is necessary to eliminate all kinds of wastefulness and stagnation at the operational frontlines, thoroughly refine our operational capabilities, and tirelessly make kaizen efforts with the mindset that improvements made yesterday will be further improved today.\n\n## Establishment of Operational Strategy Department\n\nIn April 2022, the Company established the Operational Strategy Department as an organization reporting directly to the Group CEO. The aim of the Operational Strategy Department is to accelerate the strengthening of each business's operational capabilities, develop human resources who are willing to take on the challenge of tirelessly making kaizen efforts, and utilize their skills to support recovery in the event of a fire or other incident. Our efforts are directly related to strengthening our 'Five capabilities toward change (1 through 5)' for enhancing competitiveness (see 'Message from the Group CEO' p. 14), particularly 'Response to demand changes' and 'Response to production fluctuations;' in other words, to strengthening our responsiveness to supply chain management in general.\n\nBy continuously making kaizen (improvement) efforts, we will thoroughly eliminate all kinds of wastefulness and stagnation, thereby enhancing competitiveness\n\n## Masanori Minamio\n\nGeneral Manager, Operational Strategy Department Panasonic Holdings Corporation\n\n## Establishing kaizen know-how as a mindset\n\nWe have all kinds of wastefulness at the operational frontlines, including wastefulness in operations and wastefulness between operations. These are things that our customers don't need and make our business less competitive. Kaizen is an activity to standardize and improve business processes. By using the power of digital technology, wastefulness can be analyzed and visualized, allowing people to focus on improvement activities. That will lead to higher quality of management.\n\nThe Company has been manufacturing many products globally for more than 100 years since its founding. Through all our experiences, we have accumulated knowledge in industrial engineering. Industrial engineering is a method for maximizing business and operational efficiency by standardizing business processes and quantitatively and scientifically analyzing operations at the operational frontlines. The Operational Strategy Department is developing initiatives to establish the kaizen know-how that has been accumulated as tacit knowledge at most of the operational frontlines as a mindset. In addition, we are promoting the training of 'designated specialists' to disseminate these activities widely. We will continue to lead such activities in the ' gemba kaizen way' at all the operational frontlines, where people can feel the joy and satisfaction of kaizen , help each other, and create even more kaizen .\n\nWe also want to use our skills in kaizen , which eliminates wastefulness and stagnation, to support early recovery in the event of a disaster, for example. Furthermore, we will even offer these skills and know-how to Panasonic Group customers' frontlines. Improving the overall supply chain will not only contribute to the management of our corporate customers, but also contribute to the reduction of their environmental impact and the well-being of their employees.",

In the component assembly process, work time of each worker is directly related to productivity. The factory therefore adopted the power of digital technology, using AI to analyze videos captured by omnidirectional cameras to identify rooms for productivity improvements. This has significantly reduced the manhours required to analyze the current production status, which previously depended on human skills, further accelerating the pace of kaizen .\n\n2\n\n## Saga Factory, Panasonic Connect Co., Ltd.\n\n## Optimize the mounting process with digital data and AI analysis of people, goods, and equipment\n\nThe Saga Factory is implementing innovation on the manufacturing floor in the mounting process used to manufacture printed circuit boards of various types and quantities. The factory is using a combination of omnidirectional cameras, equipment data, and production planning to identify rooms for productivity improvements and improve the speed and efficiency of product swapping. The planning is then optimized by identifying differences between the plan and the actual results.\n\nSpecifically, using cyber-physical systems and AI to group and optimize parts according to the production plan has significantly improved production efficiency by minimizing the swapping of parts trolleys. In addition, by combining digital data on people, goods, and equipment and analyzing it with AI, higher productivity is achieved by extracting wasted time from highly individualized plans and allocating it to productive time. Compared to the year ended March 31, 2021 (fiscal 2021), the factory was able to reclaim 6,000 minutes of wasted time per month (as of April 2022).\n\nVideo captured with omnidirectional cameras is analyzed by AI to identify rooms for productivity improvements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdentify rooms for productivity improvements by combining omnidirectional cameras, equipment data, and production planning\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOmnidirectional camera\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, the production plans had to directly reflect each customer's demand for each product with different specifications, and if the lead time was long, in some cases the customer's requested delivery date could not be met. Meanwhile, from a management point of view, there was too much inventory, among other problems. The introduction of Blue Yonder's solutions, which provide a high level of situational awareness of the entire supply chain, has resulted in reductions in production and disposal losses and cumulatively saved approximately 2 billion yen since it was introduced in 2019 (as of April 2022).

The Media Entertainment BD handles broadcasting equipment and the Mobile Solutions BD develops Let's note brand of notebook PCs, among other products. It maintains an inventory of more than 10 million parts needed for product repair and maintenance. The supply of service parts requires both the maintenance of service levels through prompt delivery and the reduction of warehouse housing costs and cash through appropriate inventory management. Reducing operational costs is an important effort that is directly linked to profits. At the Service Parts Center in Saito, the picking operation used to be the bottleneck of the entire operation, but is now streamlined as a result of process innovations through kaizen activities integrating industrial engineering knowhow and digital technologies.\n\nFirst, a dashboard system was built that combines WMS (Warehouse Management System) data and work footage from fixed cameras in an integrated way, allowing for time-saving identification of problems. This greatly speeds up the cycle from analysis to improvement and enables operations that can greatly reduce bottlenecks and waiting times. Next, a new technology was developed and introduced that can simultaneously estimate a parts picking cart's self-position (localization) and acquire video images of the cart's operation to track its movements even in indoor warehouses where GPS does not work. Flow line and bottlenecks, which could not be captured with fixed cameras alone, can now be fully grasped, greatly expanding the scope and targets for improvement. In addition, AI-based image analysis technology is used to break down the video footage taken with a camera of a person's series of tasks into detailed elemental tasks and analyze them. Then, by identifying bottlenecks and applying kaizen techniques to these bottlenecks, it enables us to create the operational frontlines where business process transformation continuously takes place. In addition, spatial sensing technology has been used to monitor loading capacity by automatically tracking the fill rate in containers, shelves, and parcel cages, even while in motion. By maximizing the efficiency of warehouse space and deploying truck management synchronized with warehouse operations, we hope to be able to solve the problem of trucks waiting for long periods of time and delivering small payloads.\n\nIntroducing these kinds of digital technologies made it possible to comprehensively analyze the operating status of people and equipment, their movements, work data, demand data, and so on, use the data to identify warehouse conditions and problems, and make sure operations can keep up with fluctuations in load volume. This has eliminated the need to constantly allocate more resources in case of delays or shortages.\n\nA work analysis showed that what used to take 600 minutes has been reduced to 15 minutes, a reduction of a factor of 40.* 1 As a result, kaizen initiatives have been greatly accelerated. The productivity of picking operations has improved by 25% per year,* 2 productivity has almost doubled over the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, and in terms of cost performance, overall costs were reduced by 10%.* 3\n\nImage analysis technology to track the movement of carts even in indoor warehouses where GPS does not work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlgorithm that breaks down and analyzes each task by AI in real time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpatial sensing technology to automatically track the fill rate in containers, shelves, and parcel cages, even while in motion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n22\n\n2",

        "page_content": "structure. We achieved the following results in each of the initiatives.\n\n(1) In enhancing our management structure, we aimed at profit contributions of 100 billion yen over the three-year period of the Mid-term strategy: 60 billion yen from fixed cost reductions and 40 billion yen from rolling out measures for businesses having loss-making structures. We reduced fixed costs by thoroughly reducing personnel costs and indirect operations, as well as by consolidating facilities. These efforts contributed to profit by some 101 billion yen, well above our initial target. In addition, our measures for businesses having loss-making structures generated profit contributions of 34 billion yen. The measures included transferring the semiconductor business, terminating in-house production in the LCD panel and solar businesses, and turning the TV business profitable mainly by focusing on specific regions. Together with the aforementioned fixed cost reductions, we achieved profit contributions of 135 billion yen in total. With the spread of the COVID-19, we reviewed fixed costs and reduced expenses related to activities which used to be considered normal, such as business trips, meetings, and exhibitions; which had led to cost reductions. We will continue to control costs thoroughly going forward so that the benefits of these measures take root.\n\n(2) In reforming our business portfolio, alongside measures for businesses having loss-making structures, we worked on enhancing our competitiveness through partnerships; for example, we established joint ventures with Toyota Motor Corporation in the automotive prismatic battery business and the town development business. Also, we made Blue Yonder a wholly-owned subsidiary, expanded automotive battery production capacity at our North America factory in Nevada, and made investments to capture growth opportunities with a view to medium- to long-term growth.\n\n(3) As for improving profitability in the automotive business (automotive solutions and automotive batteries), in automotive solutions we concentrated on our areas of strength, while for automotive batteries we worked on the rationalization of materials and productivity improvements. As a result, in the fiscal year ended March 2021 (fiscal 2021), we managed to turn profitable on a full-year basis after heavy losses in fiscal 2020. The automotive batteries business in particular has now grown into a business which generates steady profits from brisk EV demand.\n\nThe results of these measures contributed to steady improvement in adjusted operating profit even in the midst of the pandemic and other changes in the external environment.\n\nFrom a financial point of view, we continued to shift our management resources towards sustainable growth and enhance the competitiveness of the entire Group by reforming our business portfolio in line with our basic approach to financial management. In the Gemba (operational frontlines) Process business, which we consider as an area of focus, with the aim of achieving a business model transformation with a view to the future, we deepened our strategic partnership mainly by establishing a joint venture with Blue Yonder in 2019 and acquiring a 20% equity stake in the company in 2020. In order to further accelerate this business transformation, we made Blue Yonder\n\na wholly-owned subsidiary in September 2021. The total acquisition price was approximately 860 billion yen*. Considering the temporary financial impact of this acquisition, including the recording of sizeable intangible assets and goodwill, we issued hybrid bonds worth 400 billion yen in which a certain level of equity value is recognized for credit rating purposes in order to stably maintain our credit rating after the acquisition and ensure that we still have the capacity to make investments in the future.\n\nIn looking back on our allocation of cash over the three-year period of the previous Mid-term strategy, the amount of cash generated from not only operating cash flow, but also from divestitures and asset sales, was greater than the amount we allocated to dividend payments, structural reforms, and investments for growth, including the Blue Yonder acquisition. As a result, net cash at the end of fiscal 2022 was -649 billion yen, an improvement of approximately 160 billion yen from -813.1 billion yen at the beginning of fiscal 2020.\n\n*Includes the repayment of Blue Yonder's bank borrowings\n\n## Capital allocation (FY2020-FY2022)\n\nCash flow generation\n\nApprox. 2,540\n\nCash flow allocation\n\nApprox. 2,380\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNew medium- to long-term strategy\n\n## -  The Company's new medium- to long-term strategy was launched under the operating company system.

As a measure of our ability to generate cash, cumulative operating cash flow of 2.0 trillion yen and cumulative operating profit of 1.5 trillion yen have been set for the three-year period from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025. We have also set ROE as a KGI to measure capital efficiency. ROE has been around the 8% level recently, but we are targeting 10% or more by fiscal 2025. By setting cumulative management indicators as KGIs, our objective is to boost our cash-generation capability and profitability over the medium to long term. In the previous Mid-term strategy we laid down a solid foundation by steadily taking steps to reduce fixed costs and take measures for businesses with loss-making structures. The new medium-term strategy represents a new phase of boldly embracing challenges to achieve our future vision. Our KGI targets are challenging, but in light of the areas we need to strengthen, we are seeing a lot of ingenuity and efficiency emerging from an operational standpoint and the speed at which we are implementing various initiatives is gathering pace.

Moreover, they are areas in which we can make significant contributions towards solving global environmental issues in line with the 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT.' Some of the past strategic investments were unable to achieve growth that brings profits because we were focused on pursuing scale expansion. Under the new medium-term strategy, however, we intend to execute investments after assessing competitiveness of each business and drive Group-wide growth by improving profitability in the three growth areas. To that end, it is important that we steadily secure enough cash for not only shareholder dividends, but also strategic investments. We will therefore secure cash as a holdings company and allocate cash to the operating companies. In return for the capital allocated, we will establish an appropriate cost of capital that suitably reflects their business characteristics in order to collect a share of cash equivalent to the cost of capital from each operating company. We will then use the cash received to make strategic investments with the aim of enhancing Group-wide enterprise value. In addition to receiving dividends from operating companies, PHD takes a flexible approach to optimal Group-wide financing schemes, such as the sale of assets, etc. or funding the operating companies when they are making an investment which exceeds their own funds.\n\nIn May 2022, we announced that we would start making preparations for a stock exchange listing of our supply chain management business (SCM business) centering on Blue Yonder. Because the SCM business is a high-growth market, the competitive environment is changing rapidly. In light of such circumstances and partly because its own growth would not be enough to keep up with the market, we have judged that\n\n## Capital allocation (FY2023-FY2025)\n\nCash flow generation\n\n## Cash flow allocation\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, Group CEO Yuki Kusumi and I, as Group CFO, attend the board meetings of operating companies to assess the decision-making, from the perspective of Group-wide optimization. After participating in those meetings since April this year, I actually feel that communication with the operating companies has grown much closer than in the past.

How does the Company view these changes and what measures will it focus on going forward?\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2023, profit decreased year-on-year due mainly to price hikes in raw materials, shortage in semiconductor and parts & materials, the Shanghai lockdown enforced from the end of March, despite increased sales and efforts such as price revisions. It appears that the impact of the lockdown bottomed out in May because our operating profit improved sharply in June when lockdown restrictions were lifted. From a year-on-year perspective, the negative impacts from raw material price hikes and shortages of semiconductors and parts & materials remained in this first quarter, because the effects were relatively mild last fiscal year. We will continue our efforts to mitigate the impacts through price revisions and procuring alternatives and work on driving sales in the energy and air quality & air-conditioning businesses where we see strong prospects for growth.\n\nAlso, our inventory continued to increase affected by supply chain disruptions including procurement and logistics since last fiscal year. The fact that we strategically secure enough inventory is also a factor behind the increase. Going forward, we will reassess what the optimal level is, including the strategically secured inventory, and employ other measures, such as reduc-\n\ning the number of different parts by standardizing parts & materials and shortening production lead times. Even though we are facing some headwinds in the operating environment at present, we will capture business opportunities from such changes and unite efforts to focus thoroughly on strengthening our operational capabilities toward the enhanced competitiveness aimed under the new medium-term strategy.\n\nThere are also numerous uncertain factors affecting the outlook for the business environment up ahead, including the risk of prolonged instability in the global political landscape and the risk of a global economic slowdown stemming from the tight monetary policies of governments worldwide. That said, we will continue to invest where necessary and execute our plans for the future.\n\n## Aiming to enhance enterprise value\n\n- -  What kind of policy does the Company intend to employ for dialogue with the capital markets going forward for the purpose of enhancing enterprise value?\n\nIn April when we launched the operating company system as our new Group structure, we also communicated the Group's new medium- to long-term strategy at a Group strategy briefing. Then in June as part of the Panasonic Group IR Day 2022 activities, we had the heads of each operating company communicate with shareholders and investors about their business goals and medium- to long-term strategies, including KGIs. We have thus far communicated with the capital markets what direction the Group is heading in under our new structure. In terms of medium- to long-term strategies and initiatives for enhancing our competitiveness, we believe it is important that we provide the capital markets with easy-to-understand information about our progress and results and continuously engage in dialogue. PHD is at the helm of the Group's management, so it will strive to communicate not only progress on the Group's medium-term management indicators (KGIs) and strategic investments, but also information from a long-term point view, including ESG-oriented sustainability information through briefings. In addition, the heads of each operating company themselves will communicate with the capital markets and explain goals and strategies discussed at IR Day 2022 events. Through this kind of dialogue with the capital markets, we will make good use of the valuable opinions and suggestions received from shareholders and investors to improve our management. The Group will unite efforts toward enhanced enterprise value through a better understanding and higher expectations by our investors in the Group's future growth potential and long-term initiatives towards sustainable growth. On top of this, we will endeavor to extend shareholder returns with ongoing, stable dividend payments. So that the Panasonic Group can become a valued company needed by society, the ongoing support of all stakeholders will be truly appreciated.\n\n26",

In this context, our competitiveness lies in our technology, and to make sure we constantly create the source of our competitiveness, as Group CTO I have four roles to fulfill: (1) displaying the Group's future potential; (2) developing the strengths of the Group's future technology; (3) working with the CTOs of the\n\noperating companies to promote technology management across the Group, human resources development, and technology portfolio building; and (4) enhancing the Group's on-site capabilities in R&D and manufacturing. At the same time, we are working on the creation of innovation, including our environmental initiatives.\n\n## Efforts to realize the vision\n\nIn working from the technological side to support the creation of business pillars for the realization of a society characterized by sustainability and well-being, we must first build a 'technology dam' (a mechanism for improvement, deepening, accumulation, and utilization) that includes the Group's future technologies, and then create new strategies and other mechanisms to make use of those technologies.\n\nWith regard to the first step, building a technology dam, under our autonomous responsible management system, the operating companies have only been able to envision their future three to five years ahead, which is not enough. Looking at the game-changing trends that are occurring these days, we need to envision new environments and business models 10 years ahead and draw roadmaps to get there. Therefore, under the banner of its mission to 'create a world you would never see without us,' the Technology Sector of Panasonic Holdings Corporation, after 'backcasting' from the future 10 years from\n\nnow, is offering Group-wide support to enhance the competitiveness of operating companies (e.g., heat pumps, sensing solutions, automotive batteries, AI and data utilization platforms, etc.) and areas beyond the reach of operating companies (e.g., next-generation solar cells and rechargeable batteries, hydrogen, and other environmental energy technologies). In this way, all technology sectors of the Panasonic Group, including those of operating companies, will continue to interact with our customers, evolve and deepen our technology, and accumulate and utilize it. The Group CTO and the CTOs of the operating companies will also work together to review and strengthen technology management across the Group, human resources development, and the technology portfolio. Armed with the platform as our 'technology dam,' we will set up a Group CTO project to accelerate the creation of innovation and enhance the power to connect it to businesses.\n\n## Sustainability & Well-being\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creation of new business opportunities Enhancing competitiveness\n\nCollaboration with operating companies\n\nRefinement of core technology\n\nSocietal and environmental changes toward 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental issues:\n\nMake the solution of social issues our core business\n\nHuman and social issues:\n\nReturn to a human-centric society\n\nToward the realization of an ideal society with affluence both in matter and mind, we will solve social issues by enhancing our core technology, business creation, and business contribution\n\nRealization of sustainable global environment\n\nCarbon neutrality Circular economy\n\nRealization of well-being in 'lifestyle' & 'workstyle' Relationships among people Relationships between people and society\n\n28",

The key point is to participate responsibly in decision-making from a technological point of view in relation to the business strategy itself. We need to clearly define the value we provide to customers and draw up scenarios that include development strategies for new technologies and businesses to be implemented before moving forward. The Technology Sector of Panasonic Holdings Corporation will strengthen its investments in technology development areas that achieve sustainability and well-being to a ratio of over 80% in fiscal year ending March 2025 (fiscal 2025). In the sustainability area in particular, we will allocate a portion of the strategic investments of 200 billion yen in our medium-term strategy (see 'Medium-term management indicators (KGIs) and strategic investments' on page 11 of the 'Message from the Group CEO') to accelerate the creation of technologies and businesses to achieve avoided emissions.\n\nmental vision, 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT.' Many of the avoided CO2 emissions and reduction impacts we have announced there will need to be supported by technological development. In particular, to achieve the impact of 100 million tons of reductions through new technologies and businesses (FUTURE IMPACT), which is part of our goal to create an impact that reduces CO2 emissions by more than 300 million tons (equivalent to approximately 1% of the current total global emissions), we are working to contribute through R&D and new business creation activities while strengthening our technology pillars in areas such as hydrogen energy.\n\nWe are actively promoting efforts to visualize avoided emissions as a yardstick for objectively evaluating their impact and to obtain understanding from the government and industry. Currently at the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), an international standardization body, we are working on a draft text on 'avoided emissions' for discussion and publication as an international standard. Meanwhile, we are participating in the GX League in Japan, in which we work with participating companies to widely promote understanding and dissemination of the concept of avoided emissions in other industries. In addition, as a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), we are contributing to the resolution of social issues and the realization of a sustainable society while working to ensure that our efforts are appreciated as useful contributions to our customers.\n\n## Steps to publication of the international standard at the IEC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase investment in R&D toward FY2025 at the Technology Sector of Panasonic Holdings Corporation*\n\nSelection and concentration of themes in portfolio management Enhance sustainability and well-being investment areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Included in 'Eliminations and Adjustments' under 'Information by segment.'",

We regard this intellectual property as part of our intangible assets, alongside our data and human resource information. Even though we now operate under an operating company system, we have begun to use the technology index as a Group-wide tool to connect intangible assets and people in order to maximize the use of resources throughout the Group to drive commercialization and new business creation.\n\nBecause we also believe that solving social issues requires the connection and cooperation of a diverse range of people, goods, and services, we are committed to open innovation based on intangible assets. For example, by transferring our unused patents on quick-charging technology to an overseas startup through an external partner, we are co-creating and supporting the company's business of bringing light to areas without electricity. We are also the first Japanese company to participate in the Low Carbon Patent Pledge (LCPP), and have announced that royalty-free licenses to our granted patents related to artificial photosynthesis listed on the LCPP website are available under the terms and conditions set by the LCPP.\n\nGoing forward, the Group will continue to contribute to society by promoting the practical implementation of technologies and intangible assets that contribute to the realization of a society characterized by sustainability and well-being in various forms, including in-house commercialization and commercialization through co-creation with external partners.\n\n## Technology index overview\n\n## Example of open innovation\n\nPromote business co-creation within the Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease refer to 'Charting the Direction of Panasonic Group's Intellectual Property Department.'\n\n## Column\n\n## Announcement of Panasonic Group's AI Ethics Principles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile AI technologies solve various issues and enrich human life, they also pose human rights challenges as a result of inappropriate use, such as invasion of privacy, unjustified surveillance, and discrimination due to biased learning data. The Panasonic Group considers its approach to AI ethics as a promise to the rest of the world on the responsible use of AI, and promotes appropriate development, operation, and utilization of AI products and services in a human-centric manner and with respect for human rights.\n\nWith this in mind, in August 2022, we announced our AI Ethics Principles, which are applicable to the entire Group and are intended to provide customers with peace of mind when using AI products and services. To ensure that the life cycle of AI utilization is carried out appropriately in light of the laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines in each country, we will implement AI ethics initiatives to assess and manage risks associated with AI ethics and mitigate and avoid these risks through technological progress and process improvements.\n\n*For more information on AI ethics, please refer to 'AI Ethics' (p. 97) in the Sustainability Data Book 2022.\n\nBusiness co-creation based on underutilized intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->",

It's digital, it's our value.\n\n## Hajime Tamaoki\n\nExecutive Officer Group Chief Information Officer (Group CIO)\n\nWith 'digital transformation' positioned as a key management agenda of the Panasonic Group, we have been advancing our so-called 'Panasonic Transformation (PX)' project, which is a symbol for Group-wide transformation, since May 2021. Our 'transformation' means not just extending past reforms, but fundamentally re-examining the negative legacy of the past (obsolete IT, inward-looking operations, outdated practices, etc.) in order to make changes, create new value for the Panasonic Group, and help our employees and customers live their best. With this in mind, all employees in the related departments, not just the Information Systems Department, must work together under the ownership of our Group CEO Kusumi to drive the project forward on all three layers.\n\nTransformation framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IT transformation\n\nRenewal of infrastructure and business information systems, digitization of processes and services, etc.\n\n## Operating model transformation\n\nStrengthening of human resources management, organizational structure, delivery mechanisms, relationship with partner companies, cost optimization, etc.\n\n## Culture transformation\n\nPromotion of DEI*, open and flat work environment, breaking out of silos, eliminating inward-looking operations\n\n*Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\n## IT transformation\n\nDue to the business reorganizations over the years, the Group has a number of individually optimized systems and old legacy systems that are hindering the speed of business and management. These are not only problems of IT and technology, but also of the business operation itself, which has followed suit and sticked with individual way of doing things. In parallel with joint efforts by the IT departments, managers, and employees at the operational frontlines of the operating companies to revise their business processes to achieve thorough standardization and efficiency improvements, we are transforming the IT itself through four programs: (1) modernization of legacy systems; (2) maintenance of master data; (3)\n\nuse of cloud computing; and (4) SCM streamlining and improvement. Specifically, we are working on a total of 146 themes (as of December 2022)  across the Group, and we are beginning to reap the benefits of these efforts mainly at the operational frontlines and in employees' workstyle, while making the progress available within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProcurement DX: integration and streamlining of Group-wide indirect materials procurement operations\n\nPreviously, the Panasonic Group had three purchasing systems for indirect materials (office supplies, factory supplies, etc.), which were operated by individual operating companies. Now, the procurement, accounting, and IT departments are working together to drastically revise the procedures for quoting, ordering, receiving inspection, and payment. As a result, we have consolidated, streamlined, and upgraded our purchasing operations, and our revamped 'Group-wide common purchasing platform' is accessible to approximately 90,000 employees in Japan.\n\nThis system is newly integrated into a cloud-based system and makes maximum use of digital technology, including external APIs (a method of seamlessly linking from internal to external sites) and realtime linkage of accounts payable information to the accounting system. This paperless system handles 1.5 million indirect materials purchases per year, saving about 8,900 man-hours per month. In addition to these efficiency improvements, we have also achieved results in procurement rationalization through the centralization of contracts.\n\n## Key points for transformation of procurement\n\n- 1.  Implement a standard process for quoting, ordering, receiving inspection, and payment that is optimal for the entire Group\n- 2. Improve  usability with a simple system interface that is easy to understand and operate\n- 3.  Expand catalog purchasing through seamless linkage with external sites\n- 4.

The Center has also identified 64 business issues (long list) solicited from individuals and 11 cross-departmental issues drafted by the heads of each department. Through a virtual promotion system centered on young people who have obtained the 'Scrum Master' qualification, the Center is practicing an approach that 'flexibly responds to changes in short cycles, not with a plan,' and linking small-scale themes, such as reconsidering the use of official seals on paper documents, to results, such as shorter delivery times and greater operational efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dissemination of PX video series on social media\n\nStarting in November 2022, we released the 'Change and Be Changed with PX' series of videos listed below, showing a concrete picture of Panasonic Transformation.\n\n## 'Achieving Data-driven Management'\n\n## 'How I Work, How I Live'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Currently available only in Japanese\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The next step: evolving to 'genuine DX'\n\nFrom a medium-term perspective, we will focus on the current scenario as PX1.0, which is an activity to solidify our footing.

To that end, we are working to create a pipeline of successors over the medium to long term. Each operating company is responsible for promoting the development of senior management and successor candidates, but for the nurturing of the next generation of operating company CEOs-some of the most important management postings in the Group-we are currently promoting the development of a diverse pool of management executives irrespective of nationality, work history, gender, age, or other attributes based on a policy of fast-tracking and 'the right person for the right job,' * 1 all the while paying particular attention to the following values as a Group-wide approach.\n\n- (1)  Provide career opportunities at a stage earlier than when such opportunities were afforded to oneself in order to develop leaders better than oneself\n- (2) Provide extremely challenging roles\n- (3) Secure a diverse candidate pool\n\nIn addition, a Group Talent Management Committee has been established to discuss and promote, in a multifaceted way, the selection, development, placement, and monitoring of management personnel from a Group perspective. The Committee has identified 100 successors for 23 key posts for the Group's overall optimization, and is working to develop their careers, with the goal of narrowing down multiple candidates for each post in the short, medium, and long term. In addition, talent management committees will be established at each operating company based on the same mechanism, in order to coordinate with the development of management personnel for the overall optimization of the Group.\n\nAs for training sessions for executive candidates, we are currently preparing optimum programs to be hosted within and outside of the Company. We also continue to run the programs we launched in fiscal year ended March 2021 (fiscal 2021): Launching Executive Leaders* 2 and Creating Executive Leaders* 3 . A total of 403 people have participated in the former and 506 in the latter. In addition, since fiscal 2022 we have been conducting and enhancing the contents of the Learning Program for Newly Appointed Panasonic Group Executive Officers and the Panasonic Group Business Philosophy and Management Workshop.\n\nThese systems for developing management executives are now delivering results from the perspective of 'the right person for the right job.' There have been more cases where personnel we have hired from outside the Company play active roles as a leader of business management or of a certain function. We\n\nhave also standardized how we assess human resources in the Group. To facilitate the process, we have developed assessment tools, and the selection and career development plans of hundreds of executive candidates have been discussed at the Group Management Committee.\n\n## Basic process for the development of management executives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revision of performance indicators for executive compensation\n\nIn order to demonstrate management based on the concept of human capital management for the entire Group and to promote employees' well-being, we are implementing revisions to the performance indicators for our executives* 4 starting in fiscal 2023. We now evaluate the contributions and results of each executive from the perspective of non-financial indicators, not just financial indicators such as operating cash flow and ROIC as before, and reflect them in remuneration. The non-financial indicators covered include multiple perspectives that have a significant impact on employees' well-being, such as eradicating workplace accidents, compliance, human resource development, the degree to which DEI is promoted, and the level of employee engagement.\n\n- *1  Nominating a person that is most qualified for the position from within or outside the Company (the right person for the right job).\n- *2  Training that aims to have participants comprehensively leverage their competency to think and act in a way that is conducive to change and put management principles into action.\n- *3  Training that aims to have participants equip themselves with self-awareness of the management skills to adopt a customer-oriented approach, think strategically, and execute reforms by leveraging management literacy.\n- *4  Executive officers of Panasonic Holdings Corporation and operating company CEOs\n\n34",

The Board of Directors of Panasonic Holdings Corporation, as the decision-making body for Group-wide matters and supervisory body for the Group management, is responsible for discussing and directing the Group's medium- to long-term strategy, for example, as well as conducting sound and appropriate monitoring. The Board of Directors is focused on supervision of the operating companies by implementing their autonomous responsible management. When the operating companies bring important proposals to the Board of Directors, we examine and discuss them from the perspective of the holding company, including their alignment with the Group's strategy. As Chairperson of the Board, I intend to position myself one step away from the execution side. Looking at the Panasonic Group objectively from the outside, I strive to draw out as much knowledge as possible from our outside directors in various fields and stimulate discussion with the execution side of the business. By improving the quality of these discussions before making our decisions, the Board of Directors will continue to encourage the operating companies to take on new challenges.\n\n## What we aim as a Board of Directors\n\nWe have continuously sought to strengthen its governance. I believe that the Board of Directors' meetings, where important Group matters are discussed, must be productive. Productive does not mean simply passing or not passing resolutions, but encouraging the execution side by, for example, suggesting the potential of various challenges, and making decisions through discussions from a variety of perspectives. In addition, it is necessary to thoroughly analyze the challenges that did not go well, and discuss how to connect these lessons to the next challenge. Recently, we've been able to swiftly make major decisions based on lively discussions, including the transition to the new structure, medium- to long-term strategy, and the start of preparations for the listing of the supply chain management business. Even when different opinions and views within the Company made it difficult to reach an agreement, we were able\n\n## The Board of Directors should encourage operating companies to take on challenges to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value\n\n## Kazuhiro Tsuga\n\nPanasonic Holdings Corporation\n\nDirector, Chairperson of the Board\n\nto come to a final decision through repeated dialogues and utilizing the wisdom of our outside directors. This is a testament to the productive functioning of the Board of Directors. We will continue to innovate and make efforts to improve the quality of our Board of Directors' meetings.\n\n## Expectations for the execution function of the business\n\nA business cannot be created overnight, and it is inevitable that the values of an organization will tend to become uniform as a result of sharing the same values and building a business through many years of hard work. However, even for those businesses that have been already established, such uniformed values within the organization are not sufficient to deal with the next phase of growth. It is therefore necessary for personnel with diverse perspectives and knowledge to intermingle and multiply and complement each other's strengths while respecting each other's values. Similarly, the Board of Directors also needs diversity. As I have experienced during my time as President, it is not uncommon for senior managers to have difficulty making decisions on their own. I therefore expect the execution function of the business, which we have called on to practice more autonomous responsible management than ever before, to raise the issues which cannot be resolved within the operating companies to and make good use of the Board of Directors of the holding company, thereby improving the quality of decision-making.\n\n## Looking to the futures\n\nUnder our new structure, it is essential for each operating company to fucus on its identified business areas and to continuously take on challenges despite the difficulties that may arise. I believe that the most important point of this change in structure is to ensure that we continue to challenge ourselves to achieve sustainable growth. The Board of Directors will continue to promote governance reforms to raise the quality of decision-making higher than ever and encourage operating companies to take on their challenges in order to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value of the Group.",

Here, Director Sawada, who assumed a new role as the Chairperson of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee in June 2022, shares his thoughts on what the Board of Directors and management should do to enhance corporate value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Michitaka Sawada Outside Director\n\nDirector, Chair, Kao Corporation\n\nLeading a global company, Sawada achieved continuous profit\n\ngrowth and prioritizes ESG-focused management to realize a sustainable society.\n\n(Appointed in June 2020)\n\n## -  What are your thoughts on what the Board of Directors should do to enhance corporate value?\n\nTo enhance corporate value, it is important to exercise governance that balances both proactive approach, which facilitates corporate growth, and defensive approach, which supports continuity. For us today, I believe it is important to further strengthen our proactive posture while firmly maintaining our defensive stance. I hope the Board of Directors will always keep this in mind in its discussions and encourage appropriate risk-taking by management. Governance that is rooted in the culture, history, and spirit of the company is also important, and I hope we will continue to advance the Board of Directors keeping in mind the unique strengths of the Company, which has always valued its founder's philosophy.\n\n## -  To enhance corporate value, a medium- to long-term strategy based on sustainability was formulated. What were your comments during the discussion about the medium- to long-term strategy?\n\nand insight. Specifically, the question is: how do we change in order to survive while building on our principles and aspirations? To achieve this, it is important to have a strategy for 'change' and work together ('coordination') with employees on the operational frontlines to put that strategy into practice. In the Board's discussions on medium- to long-term strategy, there was an active discussion about sustainability and the transition from things to solutions, which are key to 'change,' and about greater sharing with employees on the operational frontlines, which is key to 'coordination.' In the discussion, I have offered a variety of opinions to the Board of Directors based on my own management experience, which I have pursued in the spirit of contributing to consumers, the earth, and society.\n\n## -  What do you think is important in order to achieve higher corporate value in the future?\n\nSustainability is essential for contributing to the enhancement of corporate value through sustainability management. To that end, I believe there are two key points. The first is to put sustainability at the center of our management strategy; in other words, to connect it to our business. The second is to establish a system to instill sustainability in the work of all employees and on the operational frontlines. On both points, the role of the Board of Directors will become even more important in the future. I also intend to stay focused on this and fulfill my role as a shareholder representative.\n\n## -  What are your aspirations as chairperson of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee?\n\nCompanies vary depending on their leaders. Similarly, the role of a 'good' leader also changes with the times. As chairperson of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee, I hope to improve corporate value by appointing top management worthy of leading the Company in the future and by creating a compensation system that will motivate them.\n\nIn order to pave the way through uncertain times and increase corporate value, it's important to pursue in-depth understanding\n\nIn addition to Director Sawada, the following four individuals have been appointed as outside directors.\n\n## Yoshinobu Tsutsui (Appointed in June 2015)\n\nChairman of the Board, Nippon Life Insurance Company Tsutsui brings extensive experience at the highest level of management along with expertise in domestic and international financial developments.\n\n## Kunio Noji (Appointed in June 2019)\n\nSenior Advisor, Komatsu Ltd.\n\nOne of Japan's most noted executives, Noji built Komatsu into a global corporation. Noji advocates reform of business management through innovation.\n\n## Kazuhiko Toyama (Appointed in June 2016)\n\nChairman, IGPI (Industrial Growth Platform, Inc.) Group A leading figure in corporate governance in Japan, Toyama is involved in numerous corporate revitalization projects as the former COO of Industrial Revitalization Corporation of Japan.\n\n## Shinobu Matsui (Appointed in June 2021)\n\nDirector, Uzabase, Inc.\n\nAfter working as an accounting auditor and consulting manager of international taxation, Matsui joined Uzabase and served as COO, etc. as an executive officer.\n\n36\n\n2",

compensation which is the 'basic compensation,' a short-term incentive which is the 'performance-based compensation,' and a long-term incentive which is the 'restricted stock compensation,' based on the duties of Directors. The ratios between the basic compensation, the performance-based compensation (when standard values were achieved), and the restricted stock compensation are set at 1:0.75:0.25 generally. Outside Directors and A&SB Members receive only a fixed compensation or the 'basic compensation' in the form of monthly monetary compensation.\n\nThe optional Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee, majority-staffed and chaired by independent Outside Directors, deliberates on the appropriateness of the Company's policy and system for determining compensation of\n\n- \u00b7  Establish a system so that the members of the Board of Directors can ask questions on agenda items in advance and the responses to the questions can be shared using online tools, etc.\n- \u00b7  There should be more opportunities for communication between outside directors and operating company presidents.

The 'performance-based compensation' is designed in a way that the amount of payment will increase according to the results. The payment rate of the basic compensation ranges from 0% to 150% (when the standard value is achieved: 75%). The performance is measured using a combination of key management indicators which the Company should continue to attach importance to, such as adjusted operating profit (Note), net profit attributable to Panasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders and operating cash flows. Specifically, the performance of Directors is evaluated based on the comparison between the results of each of such indicators in the previous fiscal year and numerical targets of the fiscal year in which they are evaluated.\n\n(Note)  A management indicator for the Company is calculated by subtracting Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses from Net sales.\n\nBased on the new medium- and long-term strategy the Group adopted after the transition into an operating company system, the details of the performance-based compensation system will be revised starting from the timing of reflecting the results of fiscal 2023. In addition to financial indicators such as operating cash flow (cash generating ability), ROIC (return on invested capital), and ROE (return on equity), evaluation will include environmental contributions and other sustainability-related items, compliance-related items, human resources-related items, and non-financial items such as strengthening operational capabilities to support business competitiveness. We are also creating a new evaluation rubric that reflects medium-term performance on top of single-year results. An evaluation system based on the same concepts will also be applied to the presidents of the operating companies under Panasonic Holdings Corporation.\n\n## Restricted stock compensation system\n\nRestricted stock compensation is a type of stock compensation in which the restriction of transfer of shares is lifted subject to Directors serving the Company for a specified period of time, and is allocated with the aim of providing an incentive to continuously improve corporate value and promote further value sharing with the Company's shareholders.

Restricted stock compensation in the above table corresponds to non-monetary compensation.\n\nincentive option to the overall compensation package is designed to increase as the position of the recipient Director gets higher. In addition, the amount for each recipient is set based on overall considerations of various factors, such as duties of each Director and the balance with monetary compensation.\n\nStarting from fiscal 2023, this restricted stock compensation will also be allocated to the presidents of the operating companies under Panasonic Holdings Corporation and the presidents of Panasonic Corporation's subsidiaries, who are engaged in business activities directly related to the corporate value of the Group.\n\n## Method for determining amounts of compensation\n\nCompensation for Directors is determined within the framework of the maximum total amounts of compensation for Directors which was determined by resolution of a general meeting of shareholders. As to the amounts of basic compensation and performance-based compensation to be paid and the number of shares to be allocated to each recipient, the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee examines whether these amounts and number are appropriate in light of the policy for determining the compensation, and reports the results to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has left the decision-making on the compensation solely to Representative Director, President of the Company who objectively comprehends and supervises overall business execution of the\n\n## Illustration of compensation structure* 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1  Excluding Outside Directors\n\nLong-term incentive\n\n- *2  When the standard value is achieved\n- *3  Average compensation of applicable directors.

As Representative Director, President of the Company makes decisions as to basic compensation, performance-based compensation, and restricted stock compensation to each recipient in accordance with the results of deliberation at the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee, the Board of Directors believes his decision is in line with the policy for determining the compensation. Five members of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee,\n\nOutside Director Hiroko Ota (Chair), Outside Director Kazuhiko Toyama, Outside Director Yoshinobu Tsutsui, Director and Chairman of the Board (at the time) Shusaku Nagae, and Representative Director, President (at the time) Kazuhiro Tsuga, held a meeting to discuss the compensation for fiscal 2022. As a result, Representative Director, President Yuki Kusumi (who assumed office on June 24, 2021) determined the details of the compensation based on the results of the discussion.\n\n## Information disclosure / Dialogue\n\n## Information disclosure approach and system\n\nBased on our basic philosophy that 'A company is a public entity of society,' we are committed to transparency in our business activities and accountability to our stakeholders. Our basic approach to information disclosure is set forth in the 'Panasonic Group Code of Ethics and Compliance' which together with practical standards, methodologies, and internal processes is published as the 'Disclosure Policy' on our official corporate website. Our basic policy is to provide fair and accurate financial information, as well as corporate information such as management policies, business activities, and ESG activities, in a timely, appropriate, and easy-to-understand manner.\n\nPanasonic Group Code of Ethics & Compliance https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/about/code-ofconduct.html\n\n## Disclosure Policy\n\nhttps://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/investors/ disclosure-policy.html\n\nUnder this basic policy, we disclose information when the disclosure is required by laws and regulations in the relevant countries and regions, as well as other information that is deemed as necessary to disclose, in a fair and timely manner while at the same time endeavoring to disclose accurately, fairly, and sufficiently.\n\nMoreover, the Company has established disclosure control procedures and in the preparation and submission of annual securities reports, quarterly reports, etc., the Disclosure Committee, which is comprised of general managers from principal departments that handle relevant information, confirms the validity of the descriptive content and the appropriateness of the disclosure procedures under the supervision of the Group CEO and the Group CFO.\n\nCorporate information requiring disclosure under the securities exchange listing rules is promptly reported to the Corporate Finance & IR Department or the Financial & Accounting Center of Panasonic Operational Excellence Co., Ltd. and is disclosed in a timely and appropriate manner.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nIn order to ensure the reliability of financial reporting for the Group as a whole, including subsidiaries, the actual status of internal control from the control infrastructure to the control activities of the business is documented under the supervision of the Internal Control Promotion Office of Panasonic Operational Excellence Co., Ltd.\n\nSpecifically, the operating companies conduct self-inspections using a checklist. Then, internal auditing managers assigned to the operating companies conduct audits, and based on these audits, the Internal Control Promotion Office oversees audits of internal controls for the entire Group, thereby establishing a structure for ensuring the effectiveness of the internal controls. In fiscal 2022, a total of approximately 400 employees throughout the Group were engaged in internal control audits.\n\n## Constructive dialogue with shareholders and investors\n\nAt Panasonic, the Group CFO oversees investor relations (IR) activities. Dialogue with shareholders and investors, including announcements of financial results and individual meetings, is led by the Group CEO, Group CFO, and the presidents of the operating companies. In addition, day-to-day communication is handled by the IR staff in the Corporate Finance & IR Department.\n\nFor IR geared toward institutional investors and securities analysts, the Company conducts presentation meetings of quarterly financial results announcements, annual presentations regarding business policy of the Company and operating companies, and other activities. Also, for overseas investors, the Company holds presentation meetings utilizing conferences hosted by financial institutions.\n\nOpinions and management issues elicited from shareholders and investors through IR activities are fed back to senior management and the operating companies at internal meetings, such as the Group Management Meeting, to help improve the quality of management throughout the Group.\n\n42",

        "page_content": "## Initiatives towards Respect for Human Rights\n\nFor more details, please refer to 'Respect for Human Rights' on our Sustainability Data Book 2022 (P. 66).\n\n## Management System\n\nThe Panasonic Group has defined our Panasonic Group Human Rights and Labor Policy (Human Rights and Labor Policy) with reference to the international standards including the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and International Bill of Human Rights, and ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In keeping with this policy, we set rules within the Group, set up systems to promote the policy, and promote concrete initiatives toward achieving working environments that both respect human rights and provide meaningful work. The Panasonic Group's Code of Ethics & Compliance (Code of Ethics & Compliance), to be made promises that each employee in the Group must fulfill, also includes 'respect for human rights' as a part of 'our social responsibilities' and we make effort to enlighten them to all our employees.\n\n## Policy\n\nOur Human Rights and Labor Policy is predicated on compliance with international standards set by the United Nations and the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the applicable laws in countries where we do business, and includes our commitment to respecting internationally recognized human rights to identify, prevent, and correct risks related to human rights, to promote remedy to people affected by those risks, to create working environments where people are fulfilled by their work and ways in which we use dialogue related to these topics with all our stakeholders. We also create and enforce rules within the Group in order to better spread and promote these initiatives globally while continuously improving upon them.\n\n## Responsible Executive and Framework\n\nThe executive officer responsible for the Group's initiatives to respect human rights is the Group Chief Human Resources Officer, who is also in charge of the CSR and Corporate Citizenship Activities (as of August 2022). This officer's performance indicators include the items of Sustainability (Respect for Human Rights, Labor, etc.) and are linked to his remuneration in the year ending March 31, 2023 (fiscal 2023). The Strategic Human Resources Department of Panasonic Holdings Corporation is the organization with overall responsibility for initiatives connected to human rights and labor for the Group and works together with the Operating Companies to promote initiatives at business sites across the Group.\n\nWhen it comes to human rights in our supply chains, procurement divisions are responsible for protecting them, and these divisions gain the understanding and cooperation from our suppliers all around the world in line with our Group-wide human rights initiatives.\n\n## Major Initiatives\n\nPlease refer to our Sustainability Data Book (P. 67-69) about the initiatives towards prohibiting forced labor, abolishing child labor, prohibiting discrimination, respect for the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, wage management, man-\n\naging working hours, and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion.\n\n## Human Rights Due Diligence\n\nWe establish a Human Rights Due Diligence system (based on the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) for identifying, preventing, and reducing negative impacts related to human rights in relation to our business activities or our products, services, or business dealings. Reflecting the issues that have been identified based on the requirements of society and the operation of the system, we continuously implement and improve the system with the advice of outside experts. As part of those efforts, group companies outside Japan underwent self-assessments related to human rights and labor in fiscal 2022. We will continue to promote initiatives meant to understand the realities and issues in our work environments and improve them on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe will operate the system by building and making continuous improvements through dialogue, discussion, and cooperation with relevant stakeholders both internally and externally. We will also make disclosures about initiatives as appropriate using our official website, relevant reports, and other means of communication.\n\n## Access to Remedy\n\nWe have established a global hotline for our employees and external business partners to report any potential compliance issues, including human rights-related violations, they notice or suspect. We have also established internal regulations to ensure that whistleblowers do not incur any disadvantages for their reports.\n\n## Participation in International and Industrial Partnerships\n\nIn January 2022, the Panasonic Group became a participant in the United Nations Global Compact. In addition to declaring 10 fundamental principles in four different fields, including respect for human rights, we are working to make our human rights and labor compliance efforts refer to international standards, and we will fulfill our duty to communicate with the public by disclosing the progress and results of those efforts. In October 2021, we also joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), an international CSR organization involved in the electronics, ICT, and automotive sectors. We are working to develop a highly reliable management system by their excellent self-assessments tools, the guidance document for solving of issues and participation in their affiliated, Responsible Mineral Initiative for the promotion of responsible mineral procurement.\n\nIn Japan, we participate in initiatives undertaken by the CSR Committee of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) and the Corporate Behavior and SDG's Committee of the Japan Business Federation, and in Europe, we participate in initiatives undertaken by the CSR Committee of the Nikkei Business Association in Europe (JBCE).\n\n48\n\n2",

Then, in January 2022, in response to the acceleration of decarbonization, such as commitments to carbon neutrality from various countries, we announced our new environmental vision, 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT', which expands our focus from energy to CO2 reduction as part of the Group's prioritization of global environmental issues as the main social issue to be addressed through our business.\n\nThe goal of 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT' is to create an impact that reduces CO2 emissions by more than 300 million tons, equivalent to approximately 1% of the current total global emissions, through the following three initiatives: (1) emissions reduction in our own value chain, (2) avoided emissions (contribution to reducing CO2 emissions for society) through existing businesses, and (3) avoided emissions through new technologies and businesses.\n\nWe have set GREEN IMPACT PLAN 2024 and the targets for the fiscal year ending March 2031 (fiscal 2031) as milestones. In terms of our own emissions (OWN IMPACT), our target is a reduction of 16.34 million tons in fiscal 2025 and 31.45 million tons in fiscal 2031. As concrete initiatives, we are promoting energy saving in production facilities through the use of AI and robots, as well as the use of renewable energy, and are increasing the number of zeroCO2 factories. By fiscal 2031, we will reduce CO2 emissions from our factories and offices to virtually zero. In our products and services, we will expand CO2 reductions through rigorous energy saving and co-creation with suppliers.\n\nWe have formulated a new environmental vision, 'Panasonic GREEN IMPACT,' to realize a carbon-neutral society through our business.\n\n## Hirotoshi Uehara\n\nDirector, Quality & Environment Division\n\nIn the area of avoided emissions for society, which is shown in the lower part of the figure, we are contributing to the spread of EVs, promoting electrification through hot water heat pump system, offering comfort and achieving energy saving through integrated control of A/C and ventilation, and promoting the use of hydrogen. Through these efforts, we aim to increase avoided emissions to 38.3 million tons by fiscal 2025 and 93.0 million tons by fiscal 2031.\n\nAt the same time, we will institutionalize our factory waste recycling rate of 99% or more and increase our use of recycled resin to 90,000 tons by fiscal 2025. We are also focused on creating circular economy businesses, and we plan to increase these businesses to at least 13 by fiscal 2025, including subscription services for home appliances and sharing services for electrically assisted bicycles.\n\nIn terms of environmental sustainability management, decisions on targets and key measures are made at the Board of Directors meetings and the Group Management Meetings attended by the Group CEO and the presidents of operating companies. To increase the agility of these efforts, in December 2021 a Sustainability Management Committee was established, presided over by the Group CEO. We also participate in international rule-making and similar activities as a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), which is comprised of about 200 leading global companies. By demonstrating unrivaled competitiveness in each business, we will contribute to solving global environmental issues through our business.\n\n## Size of CO2 emissions & reductions in our own value chain (tons)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n100M",

With regard to occupational health and safety, in order to prevent serious accidents at the manufacturing sites, we are developing and disseminating training on the Equipment Safety Standards to promote fundamental equipment safety, and at the same time working to ensure safety during non-stationary operations based on risk assessment. Furthermore, with regard to hygiene management, in light of recent revisions of the law, we are working to develop human resources and strengthen the workplace management system for the self-sustaining management of chemical substances.\n\nConcerning employee health, we send out 'Panasonic Group Wellbeing Message' to the entire Group on a global basis. We have articulated policies to strengthen health investments to achieve employees' well-being, and each operating company has also launched its own initiatives in addition to the traditional 'Healthy Panasonic Actions,' in which the operating company, the labor union, and the health insurance organization work\n\ntogether as one. The results of regular health checkups, employee opinion surveys, and stress checks are reviewed to confirm the outcomes and to further improve and strengthen the initiatives.\n\nAlso, with regard to compliance, we are implementing training of employees to ensure that they have a correct understanding of relevant laws and regulations pertaining to their business and region and that they know about our global hotline 'EARS' and how it can be used to detect issues from an early stage and prevent incidents from occurring. We are also stepping up awareness activities aimed at eradicating various forms of harassment in the workplace.\n\nAlso, on the issue of human rights, we comply with international norms, and are strengthening our stance particularly on the prohibition of forced labor at corporations, the prohibition of child labor, the elimination of discrimination, the freedom of association, and the acknowledgement of the right to collective bargaining.\n\n## Encouraging employees' self-motivated endeavors and supporting their self-determined career formation\n\nBelieving that seizing the initiative to take on challenges is the key to 'work with a sense of fulfillment,' we, as a company, encourage employees' self-motivated endeavors and support their self-determined career formation. In the full year of fiscal year ending March 2023 (fiscal 2023), we expect approximately 1,000 to 2,000 employees to volunteer for, and around 400-600 to actually take part in, a new challenge, such as job transfer across operating companies within the Group (relocation), external working experience (secondment to external start-up company, etc.), and in-company multitasking (concurrent post-\n\nings within the Company).\n\nOne other Group-wide initiative is the 'A Better Dialogue' project, which supports every employee's personal growth and challenges by enhancing the quality and quantity of dialogue with their respective managers. In addition to one-on-one meetings that bring out the aspirations of each and every employee, this project is comprised of three other components: development of individual career and capabilities, goal setting and management, and competency review. In fiscal 2023, the implementation rate in Japan is 78%, and the satisfaction level is 84%.\n\n## Responding attentively to diverse needs and expanding options\n\nIndividuals who want to take on the challenge of self-determined career formation (side job, volunteer work, self-study, etc.)\n\nIndividuals who want to balance life events and career (childcare, nursing care,\n\npartner relocation, etc.)\n\nI'd like to experience another company's worksite to broaden my professional knowledge.\n\nWorking four days a week to take on a side job at another company\n\nMy partner has been transferred, and it's impossible to raise two children alone.\n\nFlexible and fully remote work without overtime from home outside of commuting distance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI'd like to take on a side job in my hometown.\n\nWithout reducing working hours, taking on a side job from parents' home outside of commuting distance\n\nMy parents need care at their home now!

        "page_content": "Every year we conduct the Employee Opinion Survey (EOS) targeting all Group employees as an initiative for conducting a fixed-point observation of the awareness levels of every employee concerning mainly employee engagement as an indicator of employee self-motivated endeavors, employee enablement, and so on. The results are shared and utilized in the development of human resources and organizations.\n\nWe are also promoting workstyle initiatives with the aim of maximizing results from both organizational and individual perspectives. First, from an organizational perspective, we will improve productivity by optimizing the balance between face-toface and remote workstyles according to the situation of each business and the field in which each person is involved. Next,\n\n## Promoting DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion)\n\nWe are currently promoting DEI from three perspectives based on the Panasonic Group DEI Policy. The first is 'top management commitment.' This means management members themselves are committed to promoting DEI and do so by incorporating it into business strategies. We plan to accelerate the pace of our DEI initiatives to implement actions decided through dialog between management members and employees. Furthermore, we are actively expressing our support for, and providing assistance to, the 30% Club Japan, a global campaign that aims to raise the proportion of women in critical decision-making roles in business, and Equality Act Japan, a petition-based movement for the enactment of an LGBT Equality Act in Japan. We utilize our support of these campaigns in our Group initiatives.\n\nThe second perspective is 'creating an inclusive work environment.' It is about building a management and organizational environment where diverse employee personalities are valued and fully utilized. We hosted the Group DEI Forum, which started in 2021, for the second time in 2022. This event featured a live video feed broadcasted to around 14,000 participants, along with the streaming of pre-recorded videos. Each participant's understanding of, and support for, DEI was deepened. This event has been a good opportunity for participants to take action.\n\nMoreover, we continue to roll out unconscious bias training sessions in each geographical region in which we have a business presence. In Japan we are training ambassadors* at all of our business sites in a bid to continuously expand these sessions to every organization manager and employee in the Group.\n\nThe third one is 'support for every individual.' We are developing a better support system and improving HR management systems and frameworks for each region worldwide in an effort to provide support so that each person can make full use of their diverse individuality to take on their respective challenges. And in Japan too we are engaged in activities to support the formation of communities according to the various attributes of employees. This includes people with a disability, foreign nationals, women, and those who identify as LGBTQ.\n\nFurthermore, we are establishing systems and mechanisms for these communities and constantly re-examining their opera-\n\nfrom an individual perspective, we will expand the options of working hours and workplace in order to achieve employee well-being. We want to support the aspirations of each and every employee so they can continue their careers, whether it's someone who wants to continue doing their job when current circumstances prevent them from working full time, or someone who wants to take on challenges outside of the company, broaden their horizons, and apply what they've learned to their current job. This is what we mean by 'expanding the options of working hours and workplace.' These new options are being introduced first at Panasonic Holdings Corporation and Panasonic Operational Excellence Co., Ltd. as well as certain operating companies from the second half of 2022.\n\ntion. For example, employees who have same-sex partners are regarded as if they were legally married and are eligible for the various personnel systems in the Group, and we maintain accessibility maps to ensure that employees with disabilities do not have problems when working at real business sites.\n\n* Unconscious bias ambassadors: Trainers that run training sessions in the workplace to educate employees so that employees can be alert for the appearance of unconscious bias. Following an in-house application process, employees who have undergone the prescribed training are then internally certified as an 'ambassador.'\n\nIn order to measure the results and progress of these initiatives for the three pillars of employees' well-being, we intend to emphasize the positive response rate in the aforementioned Employee Opinion Survey (EOS), with the goal of reaching the global top level scores in the categories of 'employee engagement' and 'employee enablement.'\n\n## Positive response rate in Employee Opinion Survey (EOS) (Panasonic Group)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n54",

Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets.\n\nCash flow from operating activities was 252.6 billion yen compared to 504.0 billion yen in the previous fiscal year due to the impact of external environmental factors such as port congestion and an increase in inventories to strategically secure parts and materials, despite an increase in net profit.\n\nCash flow from investing activities was -796.1 billion yen, compared to 176.6 billion yen in the previous fiscal year, due mainly to the acquisition of Blue Yonder.\n\nNote:  Lease receivables collected as a result of application of finance lease accounting as lessor - based on product supply contracts determined to contain leases - are included in cash flows from investing activities. (Lease receivables collected amounted to 24.6 billion yen in fiscal 2022, 6.8 billion yen in fiscal 2021, 37.2 billion yen in fiscal 2020, 167.3 billion yen in fiscal 2019, and 19.3 billion yen in fiscal 2018.)\n\nIn addition to utilization of reserved cash, the acquisition of Blue Yonder was financed with a bridge loan, which was subsequently repaid in full by issuing 400 billion yen in hybrid bonds (subordinated bonds).\n\nNote:  Hybrid bonds (subordinated bonds) are bonds with characteristics of both equity and debt, and with characteristics and features similar to equity, such as optional deferral of interest payments, a particularly long payment period, and subordination in liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings. Interest-bearing debt is the sum of 'short-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt,' 'long-term debt,' and 'lease liabilities.'\n\nWe strive to provide stable and continuous dividends with a target consolidated payout ratio of 30%. In fiscal 2022, there was an increase in our net profit and based on the consolidated performance, and after comprehensive consideration of our dividend policy, the status of our financial position, and other factors, the annual dividend per share was increased to 30 yen from 20 yen in the previous fiscal year.\n\nNote:  The dividend payout ratio is not calculated for the fiscal year ended March 2013 because the net profit attributable to Panasonic Holdings Corporation shareholders' equity is negative.\n\n56",

However, the economic outlook remained unclear due to the impact of new COVID-19 variants. In addition, price hikes in raw materials and logistics costs as well as shortage of parts & components were constant negative factors for the economy throughout the year. Furthermore, in the second half of the fiscal year, such factors as accelerating inflation and increasing geopolitical risks led to concerns about economic downturn. Under such management conditions, the Company continued to control fixed costs according to business conditions and to make efforts to capture new business opportunities reflecting changes in society brought about by COVID-19. Through all these efforts, the Company continued to enhance its management structure in the final year of the Mid-term strategy that started in fiscal 2020. Additionally, in all of our businesses, the Company identified the areas in which the Company should be aggressive and thoroughly enhanced the competitiveness in these areas.\n\nMore specifically, with regard to the investment for growth, in the gemba (operational frontlines) process business, the Company completed its acquisition of the 80% of shares of the U.S. company Blue Yonder, which is one of the leading global providers of specialized supply chain software, in September 2021. As a result, the Company made Blue Yonder a wholly-owned subsidiary, together with the 20% of its shares acquired in July 2020. The Company aims to create new value by combining Blue Yonder's software platform, which offers state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities, with the Company's manufacturing expertise, which has been cultivated over many years, as well as its edge devices, IoT applications, and sensing technologies. This acqui-\n\n## Financial results\n\nsition will accelerate an 'Autonomous Supply Chain TM ' and will provide solutions to customers' management issues. In addition, the Company aims to contribute to global environmental conservation and to the realization of a sustainable society through energy-use reduction and effective utilization of recourses.\n\nIn October 2021, the Company started its operations based on the new structure toward the transition to a new organizational structure with the Company serving as a holding company (Panasonic Holdings Corporation) from April 2022. Under the new structure, the Company continued to steadily execute the Mid-term strategy and prepare for the smooth operation of each operating company.\n\n## Net sales\n\nConsolidated group sales increased by 10% to 7,388.8 billion yen from a year ago.\n\nDomestic sales increased from the previous fiscal year due to favorable sales of products for the industrial and information & communication sectors.\n\nOverseas sales increased from the previous fiscal year due\n\n## Sales by region\n\n(Billions of yen)\n\n|                |         |         | Local currency   |\n|----------------|---------|---------|------------------|\n| Region         | 3/2021  | 3/2022  | basis vs. 3/2021 |\n| Japan          | 3,113.3 | 3,189.5 | 102%             |\n| Overseas total | 3,585.5 | 4,199.3 | 110%             |\n| Americas       | 1,117.1 | 1,382.1 | 117%             |\n| Europe         | 662.0   | 736.5   | 106%             |\n| Asia           | 943.7   | 1,091.0 | 109%             |\n| China          | 862.7   | 989.7   | 104%             |\n| Total          | 6,698.8 | 7,388.8 | 106%             |\n\n## (Billions of yen)\n\n|                                                                             |                                                                             | 3/2021   | 3/2022   | vs. 3/2021 %/amount   | vs. 3/2021 %/amount   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Net sales                                                                   | Net sales                                                                   | 6,698.8  | 7,388.8  | 110%                  | +690.0                |\n|                                                                             |                                                                             | 307.2    | 357.7    | 116%                  | +  50.5               |\n| Adjusted operating profit                                                   | Adjusted operating profit                                                   | 258.6    | 357.5    | 138%                  | +  98.9               |\n| Profit before income taxes                                                  | Profit before income taxes                                                  | 260.8    | 360.4    | 138%                  | +  99.6               |\n| Net profit attributable to Panasonic Holdings  Corporation stockholders ROE | Net profit attributable to Panasonic Holdings  Corporation stockholders ROE | 165.1    | 255.3    | 155%                  | +  90.2               |\n|                                                                             |                                                                             | 7.2%     | 8.9%     | -                     | +     1.7%            |\n| Exchange rates                                                              | 1 USD                                                                       | 106 yen  | 112 yen  |                       |                       |\n| Exchange rates                                                              | 1 EUR                                                                       | 124 yen  | 131 yen  |                       |                       |\n| Exchange rates                                                              | 1 RMB                                                                       | 15.7 yen | 17.5 yen |                       |                       |",

The generated cash are utilized efficiently through internal Group finance operations. In cases when it becomes necessary to secure cash for purposes such as for working capital or business investments, corporate financing is secured from an external source by appropriate means after due consideration of the Company's financial standing and financial market conditions.\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2022 totaled 1,205.9 billion yen, a decrease of 387.3 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year. In September 2021, when the Company acquired the additional 80% of the shares of Blue Yonder, the Company utilized reserved cash (approximately USD 3.5 billion) and procured the remaining amount by means of a bridge loan. Subsequently in October 2021, the Company issued 400 billion yen of yen-denominated unsecured hybrid bonds (subordinated bonds)* and completed the repayment of the bridge loan. In addition, the Company redeemed yen-denominated unsecured straight bonds of 200 billion yen in September 2021 and 80 billion yen in March 2022. As a result, the balance of yen-denominated unsecured straight bonds was 600 billion yen, the balance of yen-denominated unsecured hybrid bonds (subordinated bonds) was 400 billion yen, and the balance of US dollar-denominated unsecured straight bonds was USD 2.5 billion as of Mar 31, 2022.\n\nInterest-bearing debt increased to 1,897.3 billion yen as of March 31, 2022 from 1,447.4 billion yen at the end of the previous year. This is due to the issuance of yen-denominated unsecured hybrid bonds and temporary borrowings from financial\n\nCash and cash equivalents (Years ended March 31)\n\nInterest-bearing debt (Years ended March 31)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninstitutions despite the redemption of yen-denominated unsecured straight bonds. In addition, the Company borrowed 300 billion yen from financial institutions when carrying out an absorption-type company split as part its transition to a holding company which took place on April 1, 2022. This borrowing was divided and succeeded as debt obligations by each operating company, and then repayment of the full amount was completed on April 1, 2022.\n\n* Hybrid bonds (subordinated bonds) are bonds with characteristics of both equity and debt, and with characteristics and features similar to equity, such as optional deferral of interest payments, a particularly long payment period, and subordination in liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nThe Company recognizes the importance of increasing free cash flow by strengthening business profitability and developing businesses over the medium to long term. The Company also works simultaneously to create cash flows through continuous reductions of working capital, revisions of asset holdings and other measures.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended March 2022 amounted to 252.6 billion yen, compared with an inflow of 504.0 billion yen a year ago. This is due mainly to increased inventories and an increase in corporate income tax payments despite the increase in net profit.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities amounted to 796.1 billion yen, compared with an inflow of 176.6 billion yen a year ago. This is due mainly to the payment related to making Blue Yonder a subsidiary and temporary receipts such as a proceed from transfer of assets in the previous fiscal year. As a result, free\n\nFree cash flows (Years ended March 31)\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is due mainly to having issued yen-denominated unsecured hybrid bonds in Japan, despite a repayment of interest-bearing debt of Blue Yonder.\n\n## Capital investment, depreciation and amortization\n\nAs a result of making capital investments based on a policy of steady investments primarily in key businesses for future growth, capital investment (capital expenditures) amounted to 305.1 billion yen, compared to 301.5 billion yen in the previous fiscal year.\n\nWe made investments mainly in production facilities for home-use electric appliances, electrical construction materials, and other products in the Lifestyle segment, in production facilities for electronic components, control equipment, and other products in the Industry segment, in production facilities for lithium-ion batteries for automotive use (USA) and other products in the Energy segment, in production facilities for in-vehicle systems and other products in the Automotive segment, in production facilities for systems and other products related to the B2B solutions business in the Connect segment.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses totaled 268.0 billion yen, compared to 247.7 billion yen in the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Fiscal 2022 capital investment by segment\n\n|            | (Billions of yen)   |\n|------------|---------------------|\n| Segments   | Capital investment  |\n| Lifestyle  | 87.3                |\n| Automotive | 47.8                |\n| Connect    | 23.4                |\n| Industry   | 60.6                |\n| Energy     | 36.7                |\n| Other      | 49.3                |\n| Total      | 305.1               |\n\n## Assets, liabilities, and equity\n\nThe Company's consolidated total assets as of March 31, 2022 were 8,023.6 billion yen, an increase of 1,176.5 billion yen from March 31, 2021. This was mainly due to the acquisition of Blue Yonder as a subsidiary and increased inventory.\n\nThe Company's consolidated total liabilities were 4676.4 billion yen, an increase of 597.8 billion yen from March 31, 2021. This is due mainly to yen-denominated unsecured hybrid bonds.\n\nPanasonic Holdings Corporation stockholders' equity increased by 571.0 billion yen to 3,165.0 billion yen, compared with March 31, 2021.
