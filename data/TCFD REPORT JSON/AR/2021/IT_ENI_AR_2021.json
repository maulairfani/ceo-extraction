Eni aims to  contribute,  directly  or  indirectly,  to  the  achievement  of  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, supporting a  just  energy  transition,  which  responds  with  concrete  and  economically sustainable  solutions  to  the  challenges  of  combating  climate  change  and giving access to energy in an efficient and sustainable way, for all. Eni organically combines its business plan with the principles of environmental\n\nand social sustainability, extending its range of action along three pillars:\n\n\uf07d\n\n\uf07d\n\n\uf07d\n\n- 1. Eni  business  is  constantly  focused  on operational  excellence .  This translates into an ongoing commitment to valuing people, safeguarding both  the  health  and  safety  of  people  and  asset  integrity,  protecting the  environment,  integrity  and  respect  for  human  rights,  resilience  and diversification of activities and ensuring sound financial discipline. These elements  allow  the  company  to  seize  the  opportunities  related  to  the possible evolutions of the energy market and to continue on the path of transformation.\n- 2. Eni's business model envisages a decarbonization path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 based on an approach oriented to emissions generated throughout the life cycle of energy products and on a set of actions that will lead to the total decarbonization of processes and products by 2050. This path, achieved through existing technologies, will allow Eni to totally reduce its carbon footprint, both in terms of net emissions and in terms of net carbon intensity.\n- 3. The third guideline refers to Alliances for the promotion of development through  the  enhancement  of  the  resources  of  the  Countries  where  it operates, promoting access to electricity and promoting Local Development Programmes  (LDPs)  with  a  broad  portfolio  of  initiatives  in  favour  of communities. This distinctive approach, referred to as Dual Flag, is based on collaborations with other internationally recognized players in order to identify the needs of communities in line with the National Development Plans  and  the  United  Nations  2030  Agenda.  Eni  is  also  committed  to creating job opportunities and transferring its know-how and expertise to its local partners.\n\nEni's  business  model  is  developed  along  these  three  pillars  by  leveraging internal expertise, the development and application of innovative technologies and the digitalization process.\n\nA fundamental element of the business model is the Corporate Governance system, inspired by the principles of transparency and integrity, outlined further in the 'Governance' section.",

Since 2014, when the international sanctions regime against Russia was applied, we have implemented a policy of progressive disengagement from upstream activities in the Country. Our current activities in Russia are immaterial, limited to the interest in the Blue Stream pipeline for the export of Russian gas to Turkey, of which we announced the divestment. In a context characterized by a geopolitical crisis of such a magnitude and potential huge 'disruptions' in the raw material markets, we are making great efforts with institutions and our partners to ensure the security of energy supplies to Italy and our customers around the world in order to guarantee the normal course of civil life and the economy.\n\nIn  recent  months,  international  gas  supplies  have  run  uninterrupted  thanks  also  to  our diversified  portfolio;  in  any  case,  our  company  is  preparing  to  manage  possible  extreme scenarios, leveraging on the flexibility of gas supplies in our portfolio, on the availability of infrastructures and important volumes of LNG, on the long-term relations with producing Countries overlooking the Mediterranean area.\n\nLooking  at  our  results  and  what  happened  in  2021,  our  Company  reacted  quickly  and decisively to the deep social and economic crisis caused by COVID-19 pandemic, accelerating the transformation of its business model in order to become a leader in the energy transition and pursue the carbon neutrality strategy by 2050.\n\nStrong attention has been paid to safeguarding capital and financial solidity through discipline and redefinition of priorities in capital allocation.\n\nWith  the  mitigation  of  the  health  emergency  due  to  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  strong macroeconomic restart of 2021, progressively extended from Asia to Western countries, has driven the recovery of global oil & gas demand, rebounded synchronously in all the geographies.\n\nThis generated tensions on unresponsive supply due to lower investments in the upstream sector in the latest years, reproposing in all the critical issue of energy security.\n\nIn this framework, hydrocarbon prices reported a wide shoot with natural gas prices at an alltime high and at four-fold increases compared to 2020, while Brent prices increased by 70%. Leveraging on selective capex spending, cost reduction and portfolio optimizations, Eni has been able to seize the strengthening of the scenario, reporting excellent operational and financial results.\n\nEni reported an adjusted operating profit of \u20ac9.7 billion and an adjusted net profit of \u20ac4.3 billion.  The  robust  adjusted  cash  generation  of  \u20ac12.7  billion  easily  funded  organic  capex (\u20ac5.8 billion) to maintain the production plateau and to boost renewable business growth, generating  an  organic  free  cash  flow  of  \u20ac7.6  billion.  Generated  cash  flows  funded  capex focused  on  business'  transition  (\u20ac2.1  billion),  dividends  payment  and  buyback  program (overall \u20ac2.8 billion) which returned to pre-pandemic levels and reduced net borrowings to \u20ac9 billion and leverage to 0.20 compared to 0.31 as of December 31, 2020.\n\nEni will continue to focus on financial discipline to limit cash neutrality currently at a Brent of 40 $/bbl to cover organic capex and dividends, leveraging on technology to accelerate decarbonisation and exploit value from the portfolio restructuring, considering the imminent IPO of Plenitude's retail & renewable business.\n\nThe upstream portfolio is confirmed to be an important lever of value creation for the energy",

Plenitude will be structured as a financially autonomous entity to ensure a more efficient capital structure and will leverage a unique business model, resulting from the synergic combination of the retail customer portfolio, renewables and charging points for electric vehicles to accelerate the growth of green capacity by reducing its risk profile and increasing the market share. The new entity laid the foundation on a solid base of 10 million customers and over 2 GW of renewable capacity, installed and under construction.\n\nIn 2021, we significantly progressed in our path to decarbonization thanks to our pragmatic approach in addressing emissions reduction by enhancing existing technologies, assets and skills to offer immediately applicable industrial and economic solutions, while investing in 'break-through' technologies able to change the energy paradigm in the long-term.\n\nTogether with the Commonwealth Fusion System, a spin-out company of MIT of which we are the main partner, we achieved a breakthrough result in testing superconductors for the confinement of the plasma from fusion, a technology that could represent a game changer in the decarbonization path, being potentially able to produce huge amounts of virtually inexhaustible energy, safely, and with zero emissions. This achievement paves the way for the collection of net energy in a demonstration plant that we aim to build by 2025.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Eni-led HyNet integrated project for the transport, capture and storage of CO 2 , operated by a consortium of companies, has been granted access to priority public funding by the UK government as part of the Country's decarbonization plans. The start of activities is expected by 2025, allowing the access to a tariff-regulated business model.\n\nThe development of biofuels is one of the drivers of Eni's energy transition path based on the circular economy. This target leverages on our two distinctive biorefineries in Gela and Venice, characterized by cutting-edge proprietary technologies and steady product and process improvements.\n\nIn 2021, started the production of sustainable aviation fuels 'SAF' from 'UCO' raw materials (waste oils and  other  waste)  not  in  competition  with  the  food  chain,  by  applying  the  proprietary  technologies  of traditional refining.\n\nThe production of SAF is expected to ramp-up with about 10 thousand tons/year through co-feeding of the oil-loaded plants with UCO, until the start-up in 2024 of the Eni Biojet project at the Gela biorefinery. This latter will allow to sale additional 150 thousand tons/year of SAF, being entirely produced from organic raw materials, able to meet the potential obligation of the Italian market for 2025.\n\nWe confirm our commitment for palm-free biofuels by 2023, thanks to our continuous process innovations and the entry into operation of the BTU unit at Gela which will enable to significantly expand the flexibility of feedstock processing chain. In 2021 we reduced by a third the incidence of palm oil.\n\nIn  partnership  with  several  African  countries  where  we  operate  (Angola,  Benin,  Congo,  Ivory  Coast, Mozambique, Kenya and Ruanda), we are progressing projects based on biofuels to decarbonize the local energy mix, through the set-up of integrated agro-biofeedstock supply chains to supply renewable feedstock to Eni bio-refineries, without impacting the local food chain and promoting circular economy through the recovery and valorization of non strategic area. Furthermore these agreements will allow to create new jobs and to",

In addition, these projects will be supported by Eni research, also by leveraging on the agreement with the Bonifiche Ferraresi Group, aimed at establishing an equal joint venture for the development of agricultural research and experimentation projects of oil plant seeds to be used as feedstock in Eni's biorefineries.\n\nThe sustainability of industrial operations is combined with financial sustainability.\n\nIn 2021 we adopted a set of guidelines on sustainable funding on the capital market (Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework), the first in the world in the energy sector, providing for future financing contracts and derivative instruments a reward mechanism, where possible, according to the achievement of one or more decarbonization targets.\n\nIn application of this framework, in May 2021 we issued the first sustainability-linked bond in our sector, worth \u20ac1 billion at a very competitive cost, linked to the achievement of Net Carbon Footprint Upstream objectives (Scope 1 and 2) and the renewable installed capacity. The success of this operation reflects the credibility of our emission targets and our ability to create value through the energy transition.\n\nThe progress of our decarbonisation strategy and the excellence of Eni's sustainable performance are recognised and appreciated by financial markets and ESG investors.\n\nEni has been included among the top ten companies in Euronext's new MIB ESG index and has been confirmed as a leader in the main ESG ratings and specialist indices (MSCI, Sustainalytics, V.E, FTSE4Good Developed Index, World Benchmark Alliance), obtaining the Prime Status from the ISS ESG rating. Excellent results were also achieved in climate-focused indices (Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Benchmark, Carbon Tracker, Transition Pathway Initiative). Eni has been included for the first time in the Bloomberg's GenderEquality  Index  (GEI),  a  market  capitalization-weighted  index  monitoring  the  performance  of  listed companies committed to transparency in the reporting of gender data. The index, which includes 418 companies in 45 countries and regions, measures gender equality based on five pillars: female leadership and talent development, equal pay and gender pay, inclusive culture, anti-sexual harassment policies, and pro-women brands.\n\nEni's excellent 2021 results were driven by the robust performance of E&P segment, which reported an EBIT of \u20ac9.3 billion, six times that of 2020, with a production of 1.68 million boe/d, in line with our plans.\n\nExploration activity is a driver of growth and value creation for Eni. In 2021, we discovered 700 million boe of new resources at a competitive cost of 1.3 $/boe. The main success of the year was the discovery of the giant Baleine in the deep offshore of the Ivory Coast, with a mineral potential of over 2 billion barrels of oil in place and about 2.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of associated gas.\n\nIt is set to be developed with a phased fast-track approach and will be the first development in Africa at net zero emissions (Scope 1 and 2). The importance of this discovery underpins any opportunities for early monetization through the application of the dual-exploration model. Exploration in areas close to producing assets (ILX - Infrastructure Led Exploration) continued to generate excellent returns in particular in Angola in  Block 15/06 with a sequence of satellite discoveries, in 2021 those of Cabaca N and Cuica, able to maintain the plateau of the FPSO N'Goma operating the area, extending the useful life and cash flows. Other important proximity discoveries were those of Sayulita in Mexico's offshore Block 10, which boosts the area's commercial prospects, Eban, located offshore Ghana, CTP 4 block near the Sankofa production hub, and Maha's appraisal offshore Indonesia.\n\nOur development phase creates value thanks to the integration with the exploration phase to maximize synergies with existing assets, the parallelization of activities and the fast-track approach including the start-up in early production and the subsequent ramp-up to reduce financial exposure. Leveraging this model, we will develop through the 'fast track' approach, the Baleine field expected to start-up in 2023, while in 2021 the Cabaca N/Cuica discoveries in Angola, Merakes in Indonesia, Berkine in Algeria and Mahani in UAE were started up.\n\nEni's significant progress in reducing the time-to-market of reserves is underpinned by our Coral South flagship project, approved in 2017 just thirty-six months after the finalization of the exploratory campaign",

The FLNG has reached the Rovuma Basin, off the coast of Mozambique, where it will be connected to underwater production wells by the second half of 2022 for first gas. The project will  generate  significant  revenues  for  the  country,  and  will  create  more  than  800  new  jobs  during  the operational period.\n\nWe intend to exploit value from our upstream portfolio through the set up with selected partners of autonomous corporate vehicles, with strategic value able to grow and generate returns for shareholders. V\u00e5r Energi, the JV established in 2018 by Eni and HitecVision, the largest independent company in the E&P sector in Norway records the validity and robustness of our model.\n\nThe JV has grown by about 30% since 2018, currently producing 245,000 boe and distributing a stable flow of dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe IPO on the Oslo Stock Exchange in February 2022 allowed us to monetize part of that unexpressed value. On the basis of the V\u00e5r Energi model we are progressing terms for establishing a JV with BP in Angola, which will combine the two partners' assets and will become the top player in the Country.\n\nThe Global Gas/LNG portfolio 'GGP' segment also recorded a record year with an EBIT of almost \u20ac600 million, against the backdrop of a very complex scenario characterized by a tight supply of gas at a global level triggering unprecedented increases in spot prices at continental hubs, but with adverse trends as highlighted by the reversal of the spreads between the price of Italian gas compared to European prices. In this extreme volatile environment, the sector leveraged portfolio flexibilities and contractual renegotiations that underpinned the excellent 2021 performance.\n\nThe set-up of a JV with a strategic partner such as Snam for the management of supply backbones from Algeria is part of our strategy to exploit value from our asset portfolio by freeing up resources for the energy transition.\n\nThe R&M business faced one of the most challenging refining scenarios in history with negative margins throughout the year due to the delay in post-COVID recovery at key segments such as jet fuel and the significant increase in CO 2 costs. The good performance of the marketing activity and plants optimization allowed us to achieve a substantial breakeven. Thanks to the acquisition of the Italian operator FRI-EL, Eni entered the bioenergy sector and leveraging on the upgrading of the acquired assets, we expect to produce biomethane.\n\nThe Chemical business, through Versalis, reported a solid performance with an EBIT of about \u20ac200 million compared to a loss of the same amount in 2020, due to the increase in plant utilization rate granting greater availability of product in a phase of strong recovery of the petrochemical cycle with periods of tension on the supply side and very strong commodity margins.\n\nWe  continued  our  strategy  of  repositioning  the  production  mix  reducing  oil-linked  petrochemicals  by increasing exposure to the specialty and green chemical segments. In this context, we acquired the control of Finproject, consolidating our position in the field of applications of high-performance formulated polymers and compounding, less subject to commodity fluctuations, and acquired technologies and plants of Ecoplastic, a specialized company in the recovery chain of used plastics, with the aim of accelerating the growth of advanced mechanical recycling and expanding the range of polymers for recycling Versalis Revive\u00ae.\n\nIn 2022 we will launch the restructuring of the Porto Marghera site with the conversion into a hub for the production of plastics entirely obtained from recycled raw material. Proprietary technologies will play a  key  role  in  accelerating  the  'green'  conversion  of  Versalis  by  reducing  dependence  on  oil  feedstock; among these, we focus on the chemical recycling of non-reusable plastics (HOOP technology), on the enhancement of forest biomass for the production of bioethanol and biogas (PROESA technology) in collaboration with qualified partners such as Saipem and BTS Biogas.\n\nThe Retail  &  Renewable  segment  managed by  Plenitude  achieved  robust  results  with  an  Ebitda  of  \u20ac0.6",

The acquired projects portfolio and the participation in all three A/B/C phases of the Dogger Bank offshore wind project in the North Sea allow us to revise upwards our installed capacity targets by 2025. Plenitude's products and services offer has been enriched with the entry into the segment of charging points for electric vehicles through the acquisition of BeCharge aiming at developing a network of around 30 thousand charging points by 2025. The partnership between Eni, BeCharge and Enel X for the interoperability of their respective charging networks will make our sustainable mobility strategy even more solid, giving all customers the opportunity to access the service in a simple and economical way, also including customers of the 'eni Live Stations'. In our service stations we intend to install by 2050 about 1,000 fast/ultra-fast charging points to make them more and more 'mobility' point'.\n\n## Strategy and 2022-2025 industrial plan\n\nOver the next four years, we expect Brent prices to be supported by current market dynamics, with demand recovering to pre-pandemic levels by 2022 and supply limited by production issues and financial discipline of international oil and gas companies. Eni forecasts 80 $/bbl in 2022, 75 $/bbl in 2023 and over on a stable price at 70 $/bbl.\n\nIn the long-term, crude oil price is expected to grow in line with inflation until 2035, and then decline due to the progression of the energy transition. This scenario is subject to continuous monitoring in light of the unpredictable evolution of the crisis between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFor  the  next  four  years  we  expect  a  capex  plan  of  \u20ac28  billion  (on  average  about  \u20ac7  billion/year)  that will be implemented according to our parameters of financial and operational discipline, in compliance with  minimum  profitability  thresholds,  ensuring  the  consistency  of  emission  profiles  with  long-term decarbonization objectives and full funding through the operating cash flow. Organic free cash flow and proceeds from the divestment plan, mainly the IPO of Plenitude and V\u00e5r Energi, will allow us to maintain a robust capital structure and ensure competitive returns for our shareholders.\n\nOur capital allocation processes take a further step towards the Paris objectives with a 25% share of the capex plan, compared to 20% of the previous plan, to strengthen renewable generation capacity, grow the circular economy of biofuels and green chemistry, 'scale-up' of new energy solutions and services, as well as energy efficiency and decarbonize legacy assets.\n\nWe confirm the role of our two business groups in implementing distinct but synergic paths of execution of  Eni's  net  zero  emission  strategy  by  2050:  Natural  Resources  is  committed  to  maximize  value  and decarbonize  O&G  assets;  Energy  Evolution  is  engaged  in  the  development  of  renewables  and  circular economy businesses and in the industrial transformation of legacy assets.\n\nWe expect to further improve our emission reduction targets. We are committing to go even further by reaching  -35%  by  2030  and  -80%  by  2040  in  our  net  Absolute  GHG  Emissions  (Scope  1+2+3)  target, compared to -25% and -65% reduction set respectively in 2030 and 2040 in our previous strategic plan. Eni's Net Zero emission (Scope 1+2) has been set at 2035, anticipated of 5 years (compared to the previous 2040) setting a new intermediate target of -40% vs. 2018 by 2025.\n\nIn  line  with  these  guidelines,  the  E&P  segment  will  be  managed  to  maximize  operating  cash  flow while respecting financial discipline, to generate resources needed to fund the growth of the transition businesses and to remunerate shareholders, while developing solutions for capture and storage of CO 2 and Natural Climate Solutions initiatives to accelerate the achievement of the net zero target (Scope 1+2) of the business.\n\nExploration  is  a  strategic  pillar  of  Eni's  decarbonization  path.  It  plays  a  dual  role:  replacing  produced",

Hydrocarbon  production  is expected to increase by 3% per year over the plan period, up to 1.89 million boe/d by 2025 thanks to the contribution of the start-ups and ramp-ups planned in the four-year period. These increases added to the contribution of exploration of proximity will ensure about 800 kboe/d of new production, leveraging also on the optimizations to extend the useful life of fields and offset natural declines. In 2022, we plan the relevant start-up of Coral South LNG in Mozambique, while in 2023 we expect the start-up of Baleine in Ivory Coast and of the LNG project in Congo.\n\nOur upstream decarbonization plan is going on: by 2025 it will reach 65% of net zero emissions (Scope 1 and 2) calculated on equity productions, set for 2030; confirmed the target of reducing emission intensity from operated production by 43% from 2014 thanks to planned energy efficiency actions, the zeroing of routine gas flaring by 2025 and operations optimizations. Furthermore, emissions offset will be reached through initiatives in the field of Natural Climate Solutions, whose carbon credits are certified from leading audit firms. On the basis of the contractual provisions of initiatives in progress, we estimate a progressive growth in emission credits to about 11 million tons by 2025.\n\nReferring to CO 2 capture projects, in 2025 is expected the start-up of the HyNet cluster located in Liverpool Bay in the UK, the completion of the testing phase at Ravenna hub in 2023 and the evaluation/feasibility study of other storage hubs.\n\nLeveraging on the synergies with our biorefining, we will develop on an industrial scale the agribusiness in certain partners countries in Africa, to produce crops to be applied as feedstock for HVO in compliance with the highest sustainability standards. Kenya and Congo are the countries in the start-up phase, where pilot projects have been started up at the beginning of 2022 and where are expected subsequent extensions of crops up to the production of over 170 thousand tons in 2025.\n\nGGP, whose asset base will be simplified thanks to the partial divestment of entities managing the supply backbones from Algeria. Thus, leveraging a de-risky portfolio by mitigating exposure to the TTF vs. PSV spread (Northern European markets vs. Italy) due to the 2021 renegotiations and trading skills, generating stable and sustained EBIT and a robust cash flow. The other driver of value creation will be the growth in the LNG market following the increased equity availability (in Indonesia with the Merakes project and in Nigeria with the launch of new capacity at Bonny plant) and the maximization of the utilization rate of the Damietta equity plant, and targeting contracted volumes of over 15 MTPA of LNG.\n\nPlenitude, leveraging on its financial and operational autonomy, will be one of the drivers of the Group's decarbonization path, reaching the net zero target emissions for its customers by 2040 thanks to the supply of gas and power from 100% renewable sources, bio or carbon neutral (hydrogen) and offsetting residual emissions with green certificates. The four-year plan foresees by 2025 over 11 million delivery points compared to the current 10 million, a three-fold increase in installed capacity to over 6 GW compared to 2022 and the expansion of the EV re-charging network up to around 30 thousand units by 2025. The driver of this development will be the integration between the production of renewable power and retail customers, in particular in the countries of co-presence, which will allow to maximize synergies with an always competitive and progressively greener offer.\n\nThe R&M business has defined a plan for the development of biorefining and the efficiency/optimization",

Biorefining capacity is expected to reach 2 million tonnes by 2025 thanks to the conversion of an extra-European traditional refinery in joint with other partners and the upgrading of the Venice plant. Another driver of value will be the conversion plan of acquired plants for the production of electricity from bioenergy into biomethane with the aim of injecting 200 mcm into the grid by 2025.\n\nThe  sustainable  mobility  project  will  redesign  our  service  stations  transforming  them  into  mobility hubs, combining traditional fuels with the offer for zero-emission vehicles: charging stations, innovative hydrogen fuels, bio lng, 100% HVO and battery replacement services for electric city cars. The service station will become a multi-service hub to respond to customer needs by leveraging partnerships with qualified operators (e-commerce, food & beverage, parking, rent-a-car, merchandise, cards).\n\nVersalis will continue its transformation strategy to become a leading, diversified and sustainable chemical company, applying proprietary technologies for reconversion and growth. The traditional plant set up will be optimized and more efficient; the Porto Marghera hub will be converted into a production hub for mechanical recycling plastics thanks to the integration of Ecoplastic, as well as in an incubator of new businesses with the construction of the hydrogen IPA plant.\n\nThe specialization of Versalis portfolio will allow us to benefit from the strong growth expected in important segments for the energy transition (premium elastomers for EV, polyethylene grades for photovoltaics) and will be enhanced by the solid positioning in compounding, thanks to the integration of Finproject that we fully acquired last year.\n\nEni technologies will play a key role in supporting the decarbonisation process and business growth, contributing to create new attackable markets. One of the main action plan, will be the development of magnetic confinement fusion technology after the excellent results of 2021, with the aim of entering into operation SPARC by 2025, the first fusion plant in the world that will demonstrate net energy production, able to pave the way for the next commercial phase scheduled for the early 30s.\n\nOther actions concern circular economy, with the launch of the HOOP plant for the chemical recycling of otherwise non-reusable plastics, the conversion of the wet fraction of waste into energy products (wasteto-fuels/chemicals/hydrogen), the application of the proprietary PROESA technology for the enhancement of forest biomass through conversion into bioethanol or biogas and new renewable technologies, such as wave-energy exploitation (ISWEC), CO 2 capture through biofixation by algae (mineralisation) and potential developments in the thermoelectric energy production with intrinsic capture of CO 2 . The R&D expenditure plan is about \u20ac1 billion over the four-year period.\n\nOverall, the 2022-2025 action plan foresees a Group with robust fundamentals and growing profitability, thanks to the transformation strategy adopted to face the downturn which, on the one hand, increased the resilience of traditional businesses and their cash generation, and, on the other hand, laid the foundations for a phase of strong development of the transition business hinging on the integration of technologies, on new business models and on the close collaboration with our stakeholders.\n\nThe  audience  of  our  stakeholders  will  benefit  from  the  Company's  increasingly  sustainable  industrial action thanks to the progressive reduction of emissions, attention to local content, respect for human rights in the supply chain, the quality of our products/services and the continuous development programs of our people based on the enhancement of everyone's contribution and engagement.\n\nResults expected in the next four years will make our carbon neutrality strategy to 2050 even more robust thanks to the growing visibility of intermediate targets and milestones. Financial discipline and selective spending, cost control and margin expansion initiatives will allow us to further contain cash neutrality and gain significant operating surplus of cash under our conservative Brent assumptions, which will fund the acceleration of green businesses growth, maintain strong balance sheet ratios and ensure competitive shareholder returns.",

In 2021, once the emergency overcome, the macroeconomic recovery, progressively expanded from Asia to Western countries, has driven global oil & gas demand which after the decline of the pandemic peak is bounced synchronously across all the geographies, creating supply-side tensions due to investment cuts in the upstream sector, re-proposing the issue of energy security.\n\n\uf07d\n\n\uf07d\n\n\uf07d\n\nOutstanding results: Thanks to the spending selectivity, cost reduction and portfolio optimizations, Eni was able to capture the strengthening of the scenario, reporting an excellent set of operating and financial results with an adjusted operating profit of \u20ac9.7 bln (an increase of \u20ac7.8 bln vs. 2020, up by 400%). Cash flow from operations of \u20ac12.7 bln financed net capex of \u20ac5.8 bln. Organic free cash flow of \u20ac7.6 bln funded the payment of dividends and the buy-back (overall \u20ac2.8 bln) and the portfolio operations to support the transition business (\u20ac2.1 bln).  The  capital  structure  remains  solid  and  robust,  reaching  pre-crisis  levels with a reduction in net debt to \u20ac9 bln and the leverage ratio at 0.20 vs. 0.31 reported at the end of 2020.\n\nPortfolio valorization: Eni implemented initiatives targeted to extract value from the portfolio restructuring, through the creation of independent and focused vehicles able to attract capital, create value and accelerate growth. As part of this strategy, launched the listing process of Plenitude, Eni's subsidiary which integrates gas & power retail activities, renewables and electric mobility with the target of decarbonizing Eni's customers portfolio. On February 16, 2022, was listed at the Norwegian stock market a share of about 11.2% of V\u00e5r Energi (including the share of the greenshoe option), representing the largest IPO in the European O&G sector for over a decade, enabling Eni to enhance the investments made so far and ensuring the growth of the company thanks to new possible capital contribution. On March 11, 2022, signed the agreement with BP in Angola for the establishment of Azule Energy, a new controlled business combination aimed at accelerate the development of assets in the country.\n\nBusiness transformation: the transformation of our business model was accelerated in 2021. The target of 'Net Zero Scope 1+2+3 to 2050' will allow Eni's customers to move towards an offer of decarbonised products. Achieved a level of Group's installed capacity from renewables of approximately 1.2 GW, more than tripled in 2021, exceeding the target of more than 2 GW of installed capacity including assets under construction.  In biorefining and production of related bio-feestocks have been achieved important results, reducing the incidence of palm oil in the production of biodiesel. In Africa in collaboration with the governments of Kenya, Angola,  Congo, Benin, Ivory Coast, Mozambique and Rwanda made progress in biofuel projects through the creation of an integrated agro-biofeedstock supply chains not in competition with the food chain to supply Eni's biorefineries and decarbonize the local energy mix. The expertise gained over the years have enabled Eni to achieve solid results and to implement the transformation, ensuring excellent HSE performance in health, safety and asset integrity.",

Since 2018, the understanding of local contexts and the management of stakeholder expectations on sustainability issues have been supported by the use of the company's IT platform called 'Stakeholder Management System' (SMS) that 'maps' stakeholders according to their relevance and their disposition towards the company's activities, in the countries and territories where it operates. In addition, SMS tracks relationships with stakeholders including requests, grievances and response actions undertaken, and supports the traceability required by internal anti-corruption regulatory tools on relationships with relevant parties. In this way, the system allows to understand the main issues relevant to stakeholders and the potential impacts on Human Rights, also identifying the possible presence of vulnerable groups and areas listed cultural and/or natural interest sites by UNESCO (World Heritage Sites, WHS). The system is used for activities and new projects in all Eni business lines, monitoring relations with about 4.800 stakeholders (+20% compared to 2020).\n\n## STAKEHOLDER CATEGORIES\n\nPEOPLE\n\nAND INTERNATIONAL\n\nAND NATIONAL\n\nUNIONS\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nLOCAL COMMUNITIES\n\nBASED ORGANIZATIONS\n\nAND COMMUNITY\n\nCONTRACTORS,\n\nAND COMMERCIAL\n\nSUPPLIERS\n\nPARTNERS\n\nCUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS\n\nDOMESTIC, EUROPEAN\n\nINSTITUTIONS\n\nAND INTERNATIONAL\n\nUNIVERSITIES\n\nCENTRES\n\nAND RESEARCH\n\nVOLUNTARY ADVOCACY\n\nAND INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS\n\nAND CATEGORY ORGANIZATIONS\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nAND DEVELOPMENT\n\nFOR COOPERATION\n\n## MAIN STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES DURING THE YEAR\n\n- \uf07d Professional and training paths on emerging skills related to business strategies and expansion of skills mapping.\n- \uf07d Training  initiatives  to  support  inclusion  and  recognition  of  the  value  of  all  kinds  of  diversity  and international initiatives supporting team building and innovation.\n- \uf07d Capital Markets Day (strategic plan 2021-24 and long term plan to 2050) and virtual Road-Show in major financial centers and Capital Markets Day for Plenitude presentation.\n- \uf07d Road-Shows with investors and proxy advisors on executive compensation 2021.\n- \uf07d Mapping of over 770 local communities (including indigenous ones) in the host countries and definition of local engagement initiatives.\n- \uf07d Consultations  of  local  authorities  and  communities  for  new  exploratory  activities  and/or  for  the development of new projects, as well as for the planning and management of local development projects.\n- \uf07d Involvement of suppliers in the energy transition path through 15 thematic workshops and participation in conferences and events.\n- \uf07d Development and launch of Open-es, the platform open to all for the sustainable development of companies through training and engagement initiatives (measurement of CO2 and drafting of the sustainability report).\n- \uf07d Meetings and workshops with Presidents, General Secretaries and Energy Managers of national and local Consumer Associations (AdC) on topics such as sustainability, circular economy, remediation, environmental restoration, energy transition, energy saving, customer service and new business initiatives.\n- \uf07d Meetings  and  working  tables  with  political  and  institutional  representatives  and  local,  national, European and international organizations on energy, climate, energy transition, environment, sustainable development, research and innovation, digitalization and the circular economy.\n- \uf07d Participation in discussions on energy and environmental issues promoted by the italian Government and Parliament, the european institutions, international bodies and foreign national institutions.\n- \uf07d Meetings with universities, Research centres and public bodies, consortia and third-party companies with which Eni collaborates for the development of innovative technologies.\n- \uf07d Collaborations with a) University of Basilicata to support the Master Geoscience for Energy Transitions b) Enna Kore University for business training contributions for academic courses.\n- \uf07d Agreements and collaborations with the Polytechnic of Milan and Turin, University of Bologna, Naples (Federico II), Pavia, Padua, Milan Bicocca, MIT, CNR, INSTM, ENEA, RSE and INGV (a) .\n- \uf07d Membership and participation in OGCI, IPIECA, WBCSD, UN GLOBAL COMPACT, EITI (b) ; collaboration with IHRB (c) and other international human rights institutions.\n- \uf07d Meetings with associations and participation in working groups on strategic issues, monitoring any legislative developments.\n- \uf07d Conferences, debates, events and training initiatives on sustainability issues (energy, circular economy, remediation, corporate social responsibility); implementation of guidelines and sharing of best practices.\n- \uf07d Consolidation, through collaboration/partnership agreements, of the development activities carried out together  with  international  organizations.

This scenario is subject to continuous monitoring due to the unpredictable evolution of the crisis between Russia and Ukraine. Financial discipline and spending selectivity, cost control and margins expansion will allow Eni to further contain cash neutrality and generate significant operating cash surplus at Eni's conservative scenario Brent assumptions, which will be used to accelerate the growth of green businesses and keep solid asset ratios.\n\nIn the four-year period, Eni's management foresees an investment plan of \u20ac28 billion (on average about \u20ac7 billion/year) which will be implemented according to the parameters of financial and operational discipline of the Group, in compliance with minimum profitability thresholds,  ensuring  the  consistency  of  emission  profiles  with  long-term  decarbonisation objectives and full coverage through flow of operating cash. The organic free cash flow and gains from the disposals, in particular Plenitude and V\u00e5r Energi IPOs on the stock exchange will allow to maintain a solid capital structure and to ensure competitive returns to shareholders.\n\nCapital allocation processes provide a further step forward, coherently with the Paris targets with a 25% share of the capex plan, compared to a 20% share of the previous plan, aimed at strengthening the renewable generation capacity, growing circular economy of biofuels and green chemistry, to the \"scaling up\" of new energy solutions and services (CCS) and energy efficiency and decarbonization of legacy assets. These objectives will be achievable thanks to the two Business Groups able to implement distinct paths in synergy, aimed at the execution of Eni's net zero emission strategy by 2050: the Natural Resources Business Group committed to maximize value and decarbonize the O&G assets; the Energy Evolution Business Group aimed at developing new businesses in renewables and circular economy and implementing the industrial transformation of legacy assets.\n\nOverall,  the  2022-2025  plan  projects  a  Group  with  robust  fundamentals  and  growing profitability, thanks to the transformation strategy implemented in response to downturn that, on the one hand, increased the resilience of traditional businesses and their ability to generate cash, and, on the other hand, created the conditions for a phase of strong development of the transition business, based on the integration of technologies, on new business models and on the closer collaboration with stakeholders. The expected results in the next four years will make Eni's carbon neutrality strategy by 2050 more solid, thanks to the growing visibility of the intermediate targets and the steps closer.",

The evolution of the production mix foresees the gas component at 60% in 2030 and over 90% after the 2040. Net Scope 1 and 2 emissions of upstream assets calculated on the basis of equity output are expected to zeroing in 2030, leveraging, in addition to energy efficiency, on Natural Climate Solutions that will ensure the compensation of residual emissions. Other driver for the achievement of the Group's decarbonization objectives are the projects for CO 2 capture and storage geological with a target of about 10 mmtons per year by 2030 (Eni's share).\n\nThe 2022-25 Plan provides for the growth of cash generation and the progressive reduction of the cash neutrality up to Brent levels of around $25/bbl through:\n\n- \uf07d growth of production in the 2021-2025 period at a 3% average annual rate, thanks to the contribution of projects already started or starting in the four-year period;\n- \uf07d capital discipline with an average expenditure of about \u20ac4.5 billion per year over the 20222025 period  characterized  by  high  flexibility  (>45%  capex  uncommitted  in  the  2024-2025 period);\n- \uf07d further development of integrated initiatives with the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment for the gas equity enhancement;\n- \uf07d maximizing efficiency and business continuity;\n- \uf07d enhancement and rationalization of the exploration portfolio, with the aim of discovering 2.2 bln boe of resources at a unit cost of lower than $1.5 per barrel; exploration will be focused (about 90%) in areas adjacent to near-field production fields and existing or soon to enter into operation infrastructures and will be a strategic driver in the decarbonization path, aligning the portfolio of resources with the objectives of production mix and the medium/long-term emission profiles.\n\nCash generation will also be supported by portfolio transformation with the exit from marginal and/or high break even assets and the focus on high cash generating assets and the creation of the business combination in Angola and the listing of V\u00e5r Energi, in order to reduce financial exposure and enable more accelerated asset growth. The overall contribution of the abovementioned actions will allow to achieve a 2022-2025 cumulative organic free cash flow equal to approximately \u20ac29 billion.",

For this purpose, Eni's CEO, through the IRM process, presents every three months a review of the Eni's main risks to the Board of Directors. The analysis is based on the scope of the work and risks specific of each business area and processes aiming at defining an integrated risk management policy; the CEO also ensures the evolution of the IRM process consistently with business dynamics and the regulatory environment. Furthermore, the Risk Committee, chaired by the CEO, holds the role of consulting body for the latter with regards to major risks. For this purpose, the Risk Committee evaluates and expresses opinions, at the instance of CEO, related to the main results of the IRM process.",

The IRM supports management in the decision-making process by strengthening awareness  of  the  risk  profile  and  the  associated  mitigations.  The  process,  regulated  by  the 'Management System Guideline (MSG) Integrated Risk Management' is continuous, dynamic and includes the following sub-processes: (i) risk governance, methodologies and tools (ii) risk strategy, (iii) integrated risk management, (iv) risk knowledge, training and communication.\n\nThe IRM process starts from the contribution to the definition of medium and long-term plans and Eni's  Strategic  Plan  (risk  strategy)  through  the  definition  of  proposals  for  de-risking  targets  and strategic treatment actions, the analysis of the risk profile underlying the proposed Plan and the identification of the main actions with effective de-risking of the company's top risks. The results of the activities were presented to the Administrative and Control structures in January 2021.\n\nThe 'Integrated Risk Management' sub-process includes: periodic risk assessment and monitoring cycles (Integrated Risk Assessment) in order to understand the risks taken on the basis of the strategic and medium-long term targets and the initiatives defined to achieve them; contract risk management and analysis aimed at the best allocation of the contractual responsibilities with the supplier and their adequate management in the operational phase; integrated analysis of existing risks in the Countries of presence or potential interest (ICR) which represents a reference for risk strategy, risk assessment and project risk analysis activities; support to the decision-making process for the authorization of investment projects and main transactions (Integrated Project Risk Management and M&A).\n\nThe risks  are  assessed  with  quantitative  and  qualitative  tools  considering  both  the  likelihood  of occurrence and the impacts that would occur in a defined time horizon when the risk occurs.\n\nThe assessment is expressed following an inherent and a residual level (taking into account the effectiveness of the mitigation actions) and allows to measure the impact with respect to the achievement of the objectives of the Strategic Plan and for the whole life as regards the business. The risks are represented on the basis of the likelihood of occurrence and the impact on matrices that allow their comparison and classification by relevance.\n\nRisks with economic/financial impact are also analyzed in an integrated perspective on the basis of quantitative models that allow to define on a statistical basis the distribution of risk flows or to simulate the aggregate impact of risks in the face of hypothetical future scenarios (what if analysis or stress test).\n\nIn 2021, two assessment sessions were performed: the Annual Risk Profile Assessment performed in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  involving  125  subsidiaries  in  43  Countries  and  the  Interim  Top  Risk Assessment performed in the second half of the year, relating to the update of the evaluation and treatment of Eni's top risks and the main business risks.\n\nThe two assessment results were submitted to Eni's management and control bodies in July and December 2021. In addition, three monitoring processes were performed on Eni's top risks.\n\nThe monitoring of such risks and the relevant treatment plans allow to analyze the risks evolution (through  update  of  appropriate  indicators)  and  the  progress  in  the  implementation  of  specific treatment measures decided by management.

Eni is\n\ncommitted to building a corporate\n\ngovernance system founded\n\non excellence in our open\n\ndialogue with the market and all\n\nstakeholders.\n\nst\n\nStarting from January 1\n\n, 2021, Eni\n\napplies the recommendations of\n\nthe 2020 Corporate Governance\n\nCode, which Eni's Board of\n\nDirectors adopted on December\n\n23, 2020.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Code\n\nidentifies 'sustainable success'\n\nas the objective that must guide\n\nthe action of the management\n\nbody and which takes the form\n\nof creating long-term value for\n\nshareholders, taking into account\n\nthe interests of other relevant\n\nstakeholders.\n\nEni, however, has been considering the interest of stakeholders other than shareholders as  one  of  the  necessary  elements  Directors  must  evaluate  in  making  informed decisions since 2006.\n\nWith this in mind, we consider ongoing, transparent communication with stakeholders an essential tool for better understanding their needs. It is part of our efforts to ensure the effective exercise of shareholders' rights. In 2021 Eni continued to pursue a dialogue with the market on matters of governance and to seize the opportunities deriving from studies and experience at the international level, in spite of the complications associated with the health emergency which prevented more immediate contacts, in particular with reference to the shareholders' meeting. In any case, shareholders were granted all legal rights and additional information tools in order to allow the greatest possible involvement.\n\nFurthermore,  in  line  with  the  principles  defined  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  Eni  is committed to creating a Corporate Governance system inspired by criteria of excellence, also participating in initiatives to improve it. Initiatives in 2021 in particular include the participation in working groups for in-depth study of issues related to the application of the new Code, including the Observatory on engagement policies, set up by Assonime (the Association of Italian joint stock companies) to offer a permanent forum for discussion between listed companies called upon to define a policy of dialogue with shareholders, as required by the Corporate Governance Code. The in-depth study of the issue, also through the analysis of engagement policies adopted by institutional investors and asset managers as well as by representative trade associations, led to the development of an engagement policy approved on March 8,  2022 by Eni's Board of Directors, upon proposal of the Chairman, in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## The Eni Corporate Governance\n\n## Eni Corporate Governance model\n\nEni's  Corporate  Governance  structure  is  based  on  the  traditional  Italian  model, which - without prejudice to the role of the Shareholders' Meeting - assigns the management of the Company to the Board of Directors, supervisory functions to the Board of Statutory Auditors and statutory auditing to the Audit Firm.\n\n## Appointment and composition of corporate bodies\n\nEni's Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors, and their respective Chairmen, are elected by the Shareholders' Meeting. To ensure the presence of Directors and Statutory Auditors selected by non-controlling shareholders a slate voting mechanism is used. Eni's Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors 2 ,  whose term runs from May 2020 until the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the 2022 financial statements, are made up of 9 and 5 members, respectively. Three directors and two standing statutory auditors, including the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors, are elected\n\n(2) Following the resignation of a standing Statutory Auditor on September 1, 2020, replaced by an alternate Auditor, the Shareholders' Meeting of May 12, 2021 appointed a Statutory Auditor and an alternate Auditor for the duration of the term of the Board of Statutory Auditors in office, to restore full membership of the Board of Statutory Auditors.",

In deciding the composition of the Board of Directors, the Shareholders' Meeting was able to take account of the guidance provided to investors by the previous Board with regard to diversity, professionalism, experience and competence, also with reference to corporate strategies, the Company's transformation and energy transition. The outcome was a balanced and diversified Board of Directors. The Board of Statutory Auditors also prepared new shareholders' advice providing indications on the composition of the body in relation to the tasks it is called upon to perform. The composition of the Board of Directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors is also more diversified in gender terms, in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the By-laws. The latter was promptly amended to be compliant with the law in February 2020 in view of the renewal of the corporate bodies. In particular, for 6 consecutive terms the management and control bodies shall be composed of at least 2/5 of the less represented gender. Furthermore, based on the assessments most recently carried out on February 17, 2022, the number of independent directors on the Board of Directors (7 3 of the 9 serving, of whom 8 are nonexecutive directors including the Chairwoman) remains greater than the number provided for in the Bylaws and by corporate governance best practices.\n\n## COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(a) Independence as defined by applicable law and Corporate Governance Code.

The Committees report, through their Chairmen, on the main issues they address at each meeting of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors also retained the Chairman's major role in internal controls, with specific regard to  the  Internal  Audit  unit.

In this regard, on May 14, 2020 the Eni Board of Directors determined that 2 of the 4 members of the Committee, including the Chairman, have the appropriate experience.\n\n(5) In line with the Recommendation of the 2018 Corporate Governance Code, in force at the time of the appointment, confirmed by the new Corporate Governance Code, the Rules of the Remuneration Committee require that at least one member shall have adequate expertise and experience in finance or compensation policies. These qualifications are assessed by the Board of Directors at the time of appointment. In this regard, on May 14, 2020 the Eni Board of Directors determined that all three members of the Committee have the appropriate expertise and experience. The level of expertise and experience of the Committee members therefore exceeds that provided for in the Committee Rules and Corporate Governance Code.\n\nGender diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

Furthermore, in June 2020, the Board redefined the organizational structure of the Company with the establishment of two General Departments (Energy Evolution and Natural Resources), launching a new structure consistent with the corporate mission and functional to the achievement of strategic objectives.\n\nAmong  the  Board  of  Directors'  most  important  duties  is  the  appointment  of  people  to  key management and control positions in the Company, such as the officer in charge of preparing financial reports, the Head of Internal Audit, the members of the Watch Structure.

The current members of the Board of Directors, who have a diversified range of skills and experience, including on the international stage, are well qualified to conduct comprehensive assessments of the variety of issues they face from multiple perspectives. The directors also receive timely complete briefings on the issues on the agenda of the meetings of  the  Board  of  Directors.  To  ensure  this  operates  smoothly,  Board  meetings  are  governed  by specific procedures that establish deadlines for providing members with documentation and the Chairman ensures that each Director can contribute effectively to Board discussions. The same documentation is provided to the Statutory Auditors. In addition to meeting to perform the duties assigned to the Board of Statutory Auditors by Italian law, including in its capacity as the 'Internal Control and Audit Committee', and by US law in its capacity as the 'Audit Committee', the Statutory Auditors also participate in the meetings of the Board of Directors and, also through individual members, at meetings of the Control and Risk Committee thus ensuring the timely exchange of key information for the performance of their respective duties.\n\nThe adequacy and timeliness of reporting flows towards the Board of Directors is subject to periodic review by the same Board as part of the annual self-assessment process (see next section).\n\n## Ongoing training and self-assessment\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board of Directors conducts a self-assessment (the Board Review) 8 , for which benchmarking against national and international best practices and an examination of Board dynamics are essential elements, also with a view to provide shareholders with guidance on the most appropriate professional profiles for members of the Board. Following the Board Review, the Board of Directors develops an action plan, if necessary, to improve the functioning of the Board and its Committees.\n\nIn 2020, the self-assessment exercise - as reported in last year's Report -was concluded at the meeting of May 27, 2021, with the presentation of the results of the self-assessment process, as  illustrated  by  the  consultant,  identifying,  through  the  use  of  questionnaires  and  individual interviews, role characteristics, responsibility, size, composition and functioning of the Board and its Committees. In this meeting, based on the results of the self-assessment, an action plan was approved with some evaluations and proposals for improving the Board activities.\n\nIn 2021, the self-assessment was carried out in continuity with the previous financial year, taking inspiration from the results of the 2020 board review, as well as from the evaluations and proposals for improvement of the Board activity included in the action plan. In the year 2021 it was decided not to carry out the peer review.\n\nThe  self-assessment  process  was  carried  out  through  questionnaires  and  interviews  which concerned in particular: (i) the size, functioning and composition of the Board and the Committees, also taking into account elements such as professional characteristics, experience, including in management, and diversity, including gender, of its members, as well as their seniority in office; (ii) the strategic and Plan monitoring role, including ESG issues and the internal control and risk management system. The self-assessment activity carried out for 2021 ended in the meeting of February 17, 2022, with the presentation of the results of the process, as illustrated by the consultant, confirming both the positive elements, already emerged from the previous 2020 board review, and the realization of the improvement initiatives expressed in the action plan, and a further, very positive evolution of all the issues subject to analysis and evaluation.\n\nIn addition, in determining the procedures for the performance of the Board Review, the Eni Board also assesses whether to perform a Peer Review of the Directors, in which each director expresses",

The Peer Review, which has been completed five times in the last nine years and was completed, most recently, in conjunction with the Board Review 2020, is best practice among Italian listed companies. Eni was among the first Italian companies to perform one, starting in 2012. The peer review carried out in 2020 highlighted the main dynamics that influence the functioning of the team,  also  identifying  several  strengths  as  well  as  areas  needing  improvement.  The  Board  of Statutory Auditors also conducted its own self-assessment in 2021.\n\nFor a number of years now, Eni has supported the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors with an induction programme, which involves the presentation of the activities and organization of Eni by top management. following the appointment of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, numerous induction sessions were held open to Directors and Statutory Auditors, in the context of meetings of both the Board and the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Board Committees, on issues under the remit of the Committees themselves. During 2020 and 2021, the training activity continued through ongoing training and induction activities. In particular, the issues addressed include those relating to the corporate structure and its business model,  Eni's  mission  and  decarbonization  path,  sustainability,  governance,  compliance,  the internal control and risk management system, accounting and tax issues, remuneration policy and human capital, as well as internal regulations on transactions with related parties, cybersecurity and business strategies pursued by the Company in the most important sectors.\n\n## The governance of sustainability\n\nEni's  governance  structure  reflects  the  Company's  willingness  to  integrate  sustainability, including in the form of 'sustainable success' as outlined in the Corporate Governance Code, into  its  business  model.  The  Board  of  Directors  has  a  central  role  in  defining  sustainability policies and strategies, acting upon proposal of the CEO, in the identification of annual, fouryear and long-term objectives shared between functions and subsidiaries and in verifying the related results, which are also presented to the Shareholders' Meeting. In detail, a central theme in which the Board of Directors plays a key role is challenge related to the process of energy transition to a low carbon future 9 .\n\nIn this regard, it should be noted that the self-assessment process relating to 2021, carried out with the support of an independent external consultant and completed in February 2022 10 ,  provided the Directors with the opportunity to reflect specifically on ESG issues and their implementation in internal policies, the energy transition plan and strategy, climate change, and sustainability in general, issues on which the Board expressed extremely positive opinions. Furthermore, it should be noted that even in the self-assessment process relating to 2020, which ended on May 27, 2021, ESG issues had represented a specific point of attention, and, in particular, there was a positive opinion by the Board on the understanding and attention to these themes, which will be continuously deepened and detailed.\n\nFurthermore, with a view to pursuing sustainable success, Eni's Board of Directors, in line with the 2020 Corporate Governance Code, promotes dialogue with shareholders and other stakeholders relevant  to  the  Company.  In  particular,  as  already  indicated,  the  Board,  upon  proposal  of  the Chairman in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, has adopted the policy for managing dialogue with shareholders, also in order to ensure an orderly and consistent communication.\n\n(9) For further information on the role of the Board of Directors in the process of energy transition and the pursuit of sustainable success, see the section of this Report relating to the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 254/2016. (10) On the basis of the results of the self-assessment process on the last year of term of the outgoing Board, also in relation to the issue of climate change and the role of the Board in facing this future challenge, the outgoing Board prepared its advice to the Shareholders on the composition of the future Board which highlighted the advisability of including members with, among other things, skills and experience to fully understand the decarbonization process as well as, with specific reference to the issue of the energy transition and its centrality in Eni's strategic plan, the importance of professionalism with experience in contexts of strategic change of similar complexity on a global scale, and 'Soft skills' such as the ability to integrate sustainability issues into the business vision.",

The mission highlights the principles that underpin the Company's business model aimed at integrating sustainability into all Company's activities, having regard not only for climate and environment but also for the development, enhancement and training of human resources, considering diversity as an opportunity.\n\n## THE MAIN SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES ADDRESSED BY THE BOARD IN 2021\n\n- \uf07d 2021 Financial sustainability strategy and sustainability reporting\n- \uf07d 2020 Sustainability Report: 'Eni For''\n- \uf07d Update of the UK Modern Slavery Act and Australian 'Modern Slavery Act' statement\n- \uf07d 2020 Financial Statements, including the consolidated Non-Financial Statement\n- \uf07d The Remuneration Report, including sustainability targets in the definition of performance plans\n- \uf07d 2020 HSE Report\n- \uf07d Four-year and long-term Plan (including non-financial targets)\n\nThanks to the growing commitment to transparency and to the business model built by Eni in recent years to create long-term sustainable value, Eni's stock has achieved the top positions in the most popular ESG ratings and confirmed its presence in the main ESG indices 11 .

Eni has adopted rules for the integrated governance of the internal control and risk management system, the guidelines of which were approved by the Board.\n\nFurthermore, on adopting the new Corporate Governance Code, Eni's Board of Directors established various actions and application and improvement methods to comply with the recommendations on the internal control and risk management system (ICRMS), already generally accepted as in line with the best practices of corporate governance 15 .\n\nIn this respect, in order to strengthen the integration between strategic planning and internal controls and risk management, upon the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer and with the support of the Control and Risks Committee, the Board of Directors has called for the definition of \"operational\" guidelines for the ICRMS, that exceed the ICRMS model contained in internal regulations, as part of the Strategic plan, in line with the strategies of the company.\n\nIt was also envisaged that the implementation of the operational guidelines of the ICRMS is subject to periodic monitoring on the basis of a report by the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nEni has also equipped itself with a reference model for Integrated Compliance, which together with Model 231 and the Code of Ethics, is aimed at ensuring that all Eni personnel who are contributing to the achievement of business objectives operate in full compliance with the rules of integrity and applicable laws and regulations in an increasingly complex national and international regulatory framework,  defining  a  comprehensive  process,  developed  using  a  risk-based  approach,  for managing activities to prevent non-compliance.\n\nWith this in mind, risk assessment methodologies were developed aimed at modulating controls, calibrating monitoring activities and planning training and communication activities based on the compliance risk underlying the various cases, to maximize their effectiveness and efficiency. The Integrated Compliance process was designed to stimulate integration between those who work in the business activities and the corporate functions that oversee the various compliance risks, both internal or external to the Integrated Compliance unit.\n\nFurthermore, acting on the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, having obtained a favourable opinion from the Control and Risk Committee, the Board of Directors of Eni approved the internal rules concerning the Market Information Abuse (Issuers). These, by updating the previous Eni rules for the aspects relating to 'issuers', incorporate the amendments introduced by Regulation No. 596/2014/EU of April 16, 2014 and the associated implementing rules, as well as the national regulations, taking account of Italian and foreign institutional guidelines on the matter.\n\nThe updated internal rules lay down principles of conduct for the protection of confidentiality of corporate information in general, to promote maximum compliance, as also required by Eni's Code of Ethics and corporate security measures. Eni recognizes that information is a strategic asset to be managed in such a way as to ensure the protection of the interests of the Company, shareholders and the market.",

These rules were most recently updated in 2021 by the Board of Directors, with the unanimous and favourable opinion of the Control and Risks Committee, with the aim of ensuring regulatory compliance, but also taking into account the experience gained, as well as the indications of the Board Committees and supervisory bodies.\n\nAn integral part of the Eni internal control system is the internal control system for financial reporting, the objective of which is to provide reasonable certainty of the reliability of financial reporting and the ability of the financial report preparation process to generate such reporting in compliance with generally accepted international accounting standards.\n\nEni's CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Head of Accounting and Financial Statements and budget manager, in his capacity as officer in charge of preparing financial reports, are responsible for planning, establishing and maintaining the internal control system for financial reporting. A central role in the Company's internal control and risk management system is played by the Board of Statutory Auditors, which in addition to the supervisory and control functions provided for in the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation, also monitors the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems, consistent with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, including in its capacity as the 'Internal Control and Audit Committee' pursuant to Italian law and as the 'Audit Committee' under US law.",

In particular, the HyNet integrated project in the United Kingdom where Eni operates (100% interest) the transport and storage of CO 2 in depleted gas fields in the Liverpool Bay area. In October 2021 the project has been selected by UK authorities between the two priority CCS projects in the country and granted access to priority public funding by the UK government Carbon Capture Storage Infrastracture Fund (CCSIF) manage by BEIS (Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy department) to support with \u00a31 billion the realization in the United Kingdom of at least 4 CCS hubs by 2030. The project will ensure significant support to the UK's decarbonisation process with 10 mmtonnes/year of CO 2 storage at full capacity compared to the recent ambition in the Net Zero Strategy (October 2021) of 20-30 mmtonnes/year of CO 2 storage capacity as well as with 80% to the 5 GW of low-carbon hydrogen,  target set by the UK government for 2030. Other ongoing initiative concerned a plan to build a hub for the capture and storage of CO 2 in depleted fields off the coast of Ravenna which will be designed to store 500 mmtonnes. Leveraging on the development of CCS projects, the target is to reach a storage capacity of 7 mmtonnes/year net to Eni in 2030.\n- \uf07d Progressed Eni's initiatives within the Natural Climate Solutions, such as projects focusing on the forest's protection, conservation and sustainable management, mainly in developing Countries, by means of the REDD+ project scheme which was designed by the United Nations. In particular, in 2021, Eni launched other projects in the Republic of Zambia and Tanzania, in addition to Luangwa Community Forest project. Eni continues to evaluate further initiatives in different Countries by means of partnerships with governments and international players in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Planned and defined initiatives will ensure the offsetting of residual emissions in the Eni's decarbonization strategy.\n- \uf07d In Africa signed agreements with the government of Kenya, Angola, Congo, Ivory Coast, Benin, Mozambique and Rwanda for biofuel projects through the set-up of integrated agro-biofeedstock supply chains to supply renewable feedstock to Eni's biorefineries, without impacting the local food chain and to decarbonize the local energy mix. In particular, these projects aimed at the production of such feedstock ensure security and strategic supply of sustainable feedstock (Low ILUC) and de-risking with respect to market purchases. The development model of these initiatives also enhances environmental issues, as it contributes to the decarbonization of marketed products and allows the recovery of degraded land and tackle deforestation, as well as social issues with positive impacts on the country such as employment, rural income and market access for farmers. The model enhances human rights protections and promotes the health, food security and access rights to land of country populations.\n- \uf07d Finalized the agreement with the Bonifiche Ferraresi Group aimed at establishing an equal joint venture for the development of agricultural research and experimentation projects of oil plant seeds to be used as feedstock in Eni's biorefineries. Based on the agreement, Eni purchased a minority stake in the subsidiary of BF Bonifiche Ferraresi and in BF SpA.\n- \uf07d Solenova,  a  joint  venture  between  Eni  and  Sonangol,  reached  the  Final  Investment  Decision  (FID)  and signed the EPC contract for the first phase start-up of Caraculo's photovoltaic project, located in Namibe, Angola, to be launched in fourth quarter of 2022. The plant will have a total capacity of 50 MW and will be implemented by stages, the first set to reach a capacity of 25 MW.\n- \uf07d Signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Australian company Santos to jointly seek cooperation opportunities  within  CO 2 capture  and  storage  or  utilization  project  and  to  enhance  partnership  in  the hydrocarbon developments in northern Australia. Other agreements finalized in Egypt and Norway.\n\n## Exploration\n\n- \uf07d Exploration activity achieved excellent results in 2021 with the discovery of 700 mmboe of new resources at a competitive cost of 1.3 $/boe. Exploration is still a distinctive approach of Eni's upstream model, and the achieved results have allowed Eni to get the title of 'explorer of the Year 2021' by the World Energy Capital Assembly.",

The final investment decision for Phase I has been reached after five months from discovery. In particular, defined with the authorities of the Country the development plan of the Baleine discovery, through a phased fast-track development plan, with an expected start-up in early production in the first half of 2023 and a subsequent ramp-up. The project will be a Scope 1 and 2 net-zero development, the first of this kind in Africa. Carbon neutrality will  leverage  on  certain  emission reduction drivers by means of improved cookstoves (sustainable development)  and  forest  conservation  (REDD+)  initiatives.  Baleine  confirms  Eni's  commitment  to generate high value while reducing the carbon footprint and focus to improve the time-to-market of exploration discoveries.\n- \uf07d Achieved near-field exploration successes in Angola, where the Cuica-1 oil discovery will ensure to extend the useful life of the FPSO which operates the block, in Ghana, with the Eban oil discovery in the CTP 4 operated block near to the Sankofa production hub, and in Mexico, with the oil discovery in the Sayuilta exploration prospect following the Saasken discovery made in 2020.

In particular, exploration and  appraisal  activities  comprised  write-offs  of  unsuccessful  exploration  wells  costs  for  \u20ac331  million mainly in Gabon, Montenegro, Myanmar, Bahrain, Egypt and Angola. Write-offs of \u20ac35 million are related to exploration licenses due mainly to exiting from marginal areas for geopolitical or environmental issues. In addition, 100 exploratory drilled wells are in progress at year-end (52.4 net to Eni).\n\n## Development\n\n- \uf07d Achieved production start-up of the following projects:\n- \u00b7 in Indonesia, in the operated East Seppingaan block (Eni's interest 65%) in the deep offshore eastern Kalimantan with the Merakes gas project;\n- \u00b7 in Angola, with the tie-in of the satellite discoveries of Cuica and Cabaca North in offshore operated Block 15/06, leveraging on the existing FPSO in the area;\n- \u00b7 in the onshore Sharjah Emirate, with start-up of the Mahani gas and condensate project in the Area B concession (Eni's interest 50%), just two years after signing the concession agreement and one year since discovery.\n- \uf07d In Angola signed with BP an agreement for establishing the Azule Energy, a new jointly controlled venture, which will combine the two partners' upstream portfolio in the Country to accelerate the assets development.\n- \uf07d Eni and the private equity fund HitecVision, shareholders of V\u00e5r Energi, have finalized the process of listing the investee at the Norwegian stock exchange placing about 11.2% interest.\n- \uf07d Development expenditure amounted to \u20ac3.4 billion, directed mainly outside Italy,  in  particular  in  Egypt, Angola, the United States, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia and Iraq.\n- \uf07d Eni progressed its commitment to initiatives and programs to promote local development through a distinctive approach that is also based on collaborations with other internationally recognized players as well as with public-private partnerships. In particular, in January 2022 signed an agreement with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Mexico to identify joint initiatives that contribute to the sustainable development of the domestic market; in February 2022 in collaboration with the European Union and UNICEF, launched a project in partnership with the Governorate of Basra in Iraq, aimed at improving water quality. In addition, initiatives advanced in Angola with Halo Trust, for the land demining in Benguela area, and the program with FAO to promote water access in Nigeria.\n- \uf07d In 2021, overall R&D expenditure amounted to \u20ac65 million (\u20ac59 million in 2020); a total of 6 new patents were filed.",

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of liquids (including condensates and natural gas liquids) and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain.\n\nOil and natural gas prices used in the estimate of proved reserves are obtained from the official survey published by Platt's Marketwire, except when their calculation derives from existing contractual conditions. Prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements.\n\nEngineering  estimates  of  the  Company's  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  inherently  uncertain.  Although authoritative guidelines exist regarding engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as 'proved', the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality  of  available  data  and  engineering  and  geological  interpretation  and  evaluation.  Consequently, the estimated proved reserves of oil and natural gas may be subject to future revision and upward and downward revisions may be made to the initial booking of reserves due to analysis of new information. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled under concession contracts are determined by applying Eni's equity interest to total proved reserves of the contractual area, until expiration of the relevant mineral right. Eni's proved reserves entitlements under PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements cover expenses incurred by the Group for field development (Cost Oil) and recognize a share of profit set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to service contracts.\n\n## RESERVES GOVERNANCE\n\nEni retains rigorous control over the process of booking proved reserves, through a centralized model of reserves governance. The Reserves Department of the Exploration & Production segment is in charge of: (i)  ensuring the periodic certification process of proved reserves; (ii) updating the Company's guidelines on reserves evaluation and classification and the internal procedures; and (iii) providing training of staff involved  in  the  process  of  reserves  estimation.  Company  guidelines  have  been  reviewed  by  DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), an independent petroleum engineering company, which has stated that those guidelines comply with the SEC rules 1 . D&M has also stated that the Company guidelines provide reasonable interpretation of facts and circumstances in line with generally accepted practices in the industry whenever SEC rules may be less precise. When participating in exploration and production activities operated by other entities, Eni estimates its share of proved reserves on the basis of the above guidelines.\n\nThe process for estimating reserves, as described in the internal procedure, involves the following roles and responsibilities: (i) the business unit managers (geographic units) and Local Reserves Evaluators (LRE)  are  in  charge  with  estimating  and  classifying  gross  reserves  including  assessing  production profiles, capital expenditure, operating expenses and costs related to asset retirement obligations; (ii) the petroleum engineering department and the operations unit at the head office verify the production profiles of such properties where significant changes have occurred and operating expenses, respectively; (iii) geographic area managers verify the commercial conditions and the progress of the projects; (iv) the Planning and Control Department provides the economic evaluation of reserves; and (v) the Reserves Department,  through  the  Headquarter  Reserves  Evaluators  (HRE),  provides  independent  reviews  of",

He has more than 20 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. Staff involved in the reserves evaluation process fulfil the professional qualifications requested by the role and comply with the required level of independence, objectivity and confidentiality in accordance with professional ethics. Reserves Evaluators qualifications comply with international standards defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\n\n## RESERVES INDEPENDENT EVALUATION\n\nEni has its proved reserves audited on a rotational basis by independent oil engineering companies 2 . The description of qualifications of the persons primarily responsible for the reserves audit is included in the third-party audit report. In the preparation of their reports, independent evaluators rely, upon information furnished by Eni without independent verifications with respect to property interests, production, current costs of operations and development, sales agreements, prices and other factual information and data that were accepted as represented by the independent evaluators. These data, equally used by Eni in its internal process, include logs, directional surveys, core and PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) analysis, maps, oil/gas/water production/injection data of wells, reservoir studies, technical analysis relevant to field performance, development plans, future capital and operating costs.\n\nIn order to calculate the net present value of Eni's equity reserves, actual prices applicable to hydrocarbon sales, price adjustments required by applicable contractual arrangements and other pertinent information are provided by Eni to third party evaluators. In 2021 3 Ryder Scott Company, DeGolyer and MacNaughton and Societ\u00e9 Generale de Surveillance provided an independent evaluation of approximately 27% of Eni's total proved reserves at December 31, 2021 4 , confirming, as in previous years, the reasonableness of Eni internal evaluation.\n\nIn the 2019-2021 three-year period, 93% 5 of  Eni  total  proved reserves were subject to an independent evaluation. As at December 31, 2021, Belayim in Egypt and Area 1 in Mexico were the main Eni property, which did not undergo an independent evaluation in the last three years.\n\n## MOVEMENTS IN NET PROVED RESERVES\n\nEni's net proved reserves were determined taking into account Eni's share of proved reserves of equityaccounted entities. Movements in Eni's 2021 proved reserves were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                         | (mmboe)   | Consolidated  subsidiaries   | Equity-accounted  entities   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2020                                                      |           | 5,984                        | 921                          | 6,905   |\n| Extensions, discoveries, revisions of previous estimates  and improved recovery, excluding price effect |           | 68                           | 76                           | 144     |\n| Price effect                                                                                            |           | 48                           | 148                          | 196     |\n| Reserve additions, total                                                                                |           | 116                          | 224                          | 340     |\n| Portfolio                                                                                               |           | (3)                          |                              | (3)     |\n| Production of the year                                                                                  |           | (526)                        | (88)                         | (614)   |\n| Estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2021                                                      |           | 5,571                        | 1,057                        | 6,628   |\n| Reserves replacement ratio, all sources                                                                 | (%)       |                              |                              | 55      |\n\n- (2) From 1991 to 2002, DeGolyer and MacNaughton; from 2003, also Ryder Scott.

Net additions to proved reserves were 340 mmboe and derived from: (i) revisions of previous estimates were up by 258 mmboe, and mainly derived from the E Structure fields in Libya, the Val d'Agri field in Italy, the Karachaganak field in Kazakhstan and the Zubair field in Iraq. Revisions to previous estimates include a positive price effect of 196 mmboe, mainly due to an increased Brent reference price (from 41 $/ barrel in 2020 to 69 $/barrel in 2021) resulting in a recovery of volumes reserves which were uneconomical in the 2020 scenario partially offset by net lower reserves entitlements under PSA contracts; (ii) extensions and discoveries were up by 70 mmboe, mainly due to the final investment decision made for the New Gas Consortium project as well as the Cuica and the Ndungu projects in the operated Block 15/06 in Angola; the Tommeliten Alpha Development project in the PL044 license and other minor assets in Norway; and the BKNEP, Zas and Ret project in the Berkine North in Algeria; and (iii) improved recovery of 12 mmboe mainly related to the Oooguruk project in the United States.\n\nPortfolio transactions include the disposal of the OML 17 block in Nigeria and acquisitions of the Lucius field in the United States and the Conwy field in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe organic 6 and all sources reserves replacement ratio was 55%. The reserves life index was 10.8 years (10.9 years in 2020).\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES\n\nProved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2021 totaled 2,020 mmboe, of which 990 mmbbl of liquids mainly concentrated in Africa and Asia and 5,469 bcf of natural gas mainly located in Africa. Proved undeveloped reserves of consolidated subsidiaries amounted to 775 mmbbl of liquids and 4,152 bcf of natural gas.\n\nMovements in Eni's 2021 proved undeveloped reserves were as follows:\n\n|                                                     | (mmboe)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020 | 2,005     |\n| Additions                                           | (232)     |\n| Extensions and discoveries                          | 62        |\n| Improved recovery                                   | 11        |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2021 | 2,020     |\n\nIn 2021, Eni matured 232 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves due to progress in development activities, production start-ups and project revisions. The main reclassifications to proved developed reserves are related to the following fields/projects: Merakes in Indonesia, Mitzon in Mexico, as well as LNG project in Nigeria.\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2021, capital expenditures amounted to approximately \u20ac4.8 billion.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect the timing of the projects development and execution, such as the complex nature of the development project  in  adverse  and  remote  locations,  physical  limitations  of  infrastructures  or  plant  capacity  and contractual limitations that establish production levels. The Company estimates that 0.45 bboe of proved undeveloped  reserves  have  remained  undeveloped  for  five  years  or  more  at  the  balance  sheet  date",

The proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more at the balance sheet date mainly related to: (i) the Zubair field in Iraq (0.10 bboe), where development of PUDs area making continuing progress by means of drilling additional production wells that were hooked to the existing treatment facilities, which have been already dimensioned based on the expected full field production plateau of 700 kboe/d; (ii) certain Libyan gas fields (0.3 bboe) where development completion and production start-ups are planned according to the delivery obligations set forth in a long-term gas supply agreement currently in force and (iii) other fields in Italy (0.05 bboe) where development activities are in progress.\n\n## DELIVERY COMMITMENTS\n\nEni, through consolidated subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities, sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Some of these contracts, mostly relating to natural gas, specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities.\n\nEni is contractually committed under existing contracts or agreements to deliver in the next three years mainly natural gas to third parties for a total of approximately 623 mmbboe from producing assets located mainly in Algeria, Australia, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Libya, Nigeria, Norway and Venezuela.\n\nThe sales contracts contain a mix of fixed and variable pricing formulas that are generally indexed to the market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products. Management believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available mainly from production of the Company's proved developed reserves and supplies from third parties based on existing contracts. Production is expected to account for approximately 93% of delivery commitments.\n\nEni has met all contractual delivery commitments as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION\n\nIn  2021,  oil  and  natural  gas  production  averaged  1.682  mmboe/d,  down  by  2.2%  from  2020,  net  of  price effects, due to higher maintenance activity at fields in Norway, Italy and the United Kingdom, lower activity in Nigeria and mature fields decline. These decreases were partly offset by continuing production ramp-ups in Egypt and Indonesia at the flagship projects of Zohr and Merakes, in a context of strong global demand for gas and LNG and also thanks to the restart of the Damietta liquefaction plant, as well as the progressive easing of OPEC+ production quotas particularly in the United Arab Emirates and Kazakhstan.\n\nLiquids production amounted to 813 kbbl/d, down by 4% from 2020. The price effects, the reduction in Nigeria and mature fields decline were partly offset by production growth in Egypt and the progressive easing of OPEC+ production quotas.\n\nNatural gas production amounted to 4,613 mmcf/d down by 2% compared to 2020. Mature fields decline and lower production in Nigeria were partly offset by the ramp-ups at Zohr (Egypt) and Merakes (Indonesia) fields, boosted by strong global demand.\n\nOil and gas production sold amounted to 567 mmboe. The 47 mmboe difference over production (614 mmboe) mainly reflected volumes of natural gas consumed in operations (42 mmboe), changes in inventory levels and other variations. Approximately 63% of liquids production sold (295 mmbbl) was destined to Eni's Refining & Marketing business. About 16% of natural gas production sold (1,444 bcf) was destined to Eni's Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment.",

The overall commercial success rate was 54% (49% net to Eni) as compared to 28% (30% net to Eni) in 2020 and 36% (47% net to Eni) in 2019.\n\n## EXPLORATORY WELL ACTIVITY\n\n|                       | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Wells in progress at Dec. 31 (b)   | Wells in progress at Dec. 31 (b)   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2021                      | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2020                      | 2019                      | 2019                      | 2021                               | 2021                               |\n| (units)               | productive                | dry (c)                   | productive                | dry (c)                   | productive                | dry (c)                   | gross                              | net                                |\n| Italy                 |                           |                           |                           |                           |                           | 0.5                       |                                    |                                    |\n| Rest of Europe        | 0.1                       | 0.3                       | 0.8                       | 0.4                       | 0.3                       | 1.4                       | 23.0                               | 5.7                                |\n| North Africa          |                           |                           | 0.5                       | 1.5                       | 0.5                       |                           | 11.0                               | 8.5                                |\n| Egypt                 | 5.0                       | 5.0                       | 0.7                       | 1.5                       | 4.5                       | 1.5                       | 14.0                               | 10.5                               |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa    | 1.1                       | 0.4                       | 0.1                       | 0.9                       | 0.5                       | 0.9                       | 33.0                               | 19.0                               |\n| Kazakhstan            |                           |                           |                           | 1.1                       |                           |                           |                                    |                                    |\n| Rest of Asia          | 0.7                       | 1.0                       | 0.8                       | 0.9                       | 1.7                       |                           | 15.0                               | 6.5                                |\n| Americas              |                           | 0.7                       |                           | 0.6                       |                           |                           | 3.0                                | 1.9                                |\n| Australia and Oceania |                           |                           |                           |                           |                           | 0.5                       | 1.0                                | 0.3                                |\n|                       | 7.0                       | 7.4                       | 2.9                       | 6.9                       | 5.8                       | 6.5                       | 100.0                              | 52.4                               |\n\n- (a) Includes number of wells in Eni's share.\n- (b) Includes temporary suspended wells pending further evaluation.\n- (c) A dry well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.",

As of December 31, 2021, Eni's mineral right portfolio consisted of 771 exclusive or shared rights of exploration and development activities for a total acreage of 335,501 square kilometers net to Eni (336,449 square kilometers net to Eni as of December 31,  2020),  of  which  577  square  kilometers  related  to  the  CCUS  activities  in  the  United  Kingdom.  Developed acreage was 27,697 square kilometers and undeveloped acreage was 307,804 square kilometers net to Eni. In 2021, main changes derived from: (i) new leases were purchased or awarded in Vietnam, Angola, Norway, Ivory Coast, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt for a total increase in acreage of approximately 17,100 square kilometers; (ii) relinquishment for the year related mainly to Myanmar, Ivory Coast, Pakistan, Egypt, Norway, the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom covering an acreage of approximately 11,500 square kilometers; (iii) interest increases were reported mainly in Angola, Timor Leste, Italy and the United States for a total acreage of approximately 700 square kilometers; and (iv) partial relinquishment was reported mainly in Morocco, Kenya, Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Mozambique for approximately 7,250 square kilometers. The gross undeveloped acreages that will expire in the next three years are related to exploration leases, blocks,  concessions  in:  (i)  Rest  of  Europe,  in  particular  in  Cyprus;  (ii)  Rest  of  Asia,  in  particular  in  Oman, Vietnam, Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Myanmar; (iii) North Africa, in particular in Morocco and Libya; (iv) Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular in Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa; and (v) Americas, in particular in  Mexico.  In  most  cases  extension  or  renewal  options  are  contractually  defined  and  may  or  may  not  be exercised depending on the results of the studies and the planned activities. Management believes that a\n\nsignificant amount of acreage will be maintained following extension or renewal.",

These cover virtually all aspects of exploration and production activities,  including  matters  such  as  license  acquisition,  production  rates,  royalties,  pricing,  environmental protection, export, taxes and foreign exchange. The terms and condition of the leases, licenses and contracts under which these Oil & Gas interests are held vary from Country to Country. These leases, licenses and contracts  are  generally  granted  by  or  entered  into  with  a  government  entity  or  state  company  and  are sometimes entered into with private property owners. These contractual arrangements usually take the form of concession agreements or production sharing agreements.\n\nConcessions contracts. Eni operates under concession contracts mainly in Western Countries. Concessions contracts regulate relationships between States and oil companies with regards to hydrocarbon exploration and production activity. Contractual clauses governing mineral concessions, licenses and exploration permits regulate the access of Eni to hydrocarbon reserves. The company holding the mining concession has an exclusive right on exploration, development and production activities, sustaining all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration and development activities, and it is entitled to the productions realized. As a compensation for mineral concessions, pays royalties on production (which may be in cash or in-kind) and taxes on oil revenues to the state in accordance with local tax legislation. Both exploration and production licenses are granted generally for a specified period of time (except for production licenses in the United States which remain in effect until production ceases): the term of Eni's licenses and the extent to which these licenses may be renewed vary by area. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled are determined by applying Eni's share of production to total proved reserves of the contractual area, in respect of the duration of the relevant mineral right.\n\nProduction Sharing Agreement (PSA). Eni operates under PSA in several of the foreign jurisdictions mainly in African, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern Countries. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities  and  can  enter  into  agreements  with  other  local  or  international  entities.  In  this  type  of  contract, the  national  oil  company  assigns  to  the  international  contractor  the  task  of  performing  exploration  and production with the contractor's equipment (technologies) and financial resources. Exploration risks are borne by the contractor and production is divided into two portions: 'Cost Oil' is used to recover costs borne by the contractor and 'Profit Oil' is divided between the contractor and the national company according to variable schemes and represents the profit deriving from exploration and production. Further terms and conditions of these contracts may vary from Country to Country. Pursuant to these contracts, Eni is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The Company's share of production volumes and reserves representing the Profit Oil includes the share of hydrocarbons which corresponds to the taxes to be paid, according to the contractual agreement, by the national government on behalf of the Company. As a consequence, the Company has to recognize at the same time an increase in the taxable profit, through the increase of the revenues, and a tax expense. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled under PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements should cover expenses incurred by the Group to develop a field (Cost Oil) and recognize the Profit Oil set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to some service contracts.\n\n## ITALY\n\nWithin Eni's long-term strategy to minimize carbon footprint, a program was launched to build a hub for the capture and storage of CO 2 (Carbon Capture and Storage - CCS) in depleted fields off the coast of Ravenna which will be designed to store 500 million tonnes of CO 2 . The development program includes a pilot project with expected start-up in 2023, following all necessary authorizations. The development  on an industrial scale is expected in the next phase. The planned activities will benefit on the expected synergies on development cost leveraging on the offshore infrastructure of depleted fields and in addition to be significant impacted on the technology and competence areas.\n\nIn the gas assets of the Adriatic Sea, development activities concerned: (i) maintenance and production",

Among these, in 2019 Eni launched the forest protection, conservation and sustainable management projects,  in  particular  in  developing  Countries.  The  forest  projects  are  considered  the  most  significant  at internationally level within climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nThese  projects  are  framed  in  the  REDD+  (Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  forest  Degradation) scheme. The REDD+ scheme was designed by the United Nations (in particular within the UNFCCC - United Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change)  and  involves  conservation  forest  activities  to  reduce emissions and improve the natural storage capacity of CO 2 , as well as supporting, with a different development model, the local communities through socio-economic projects, in line with sustainable management, forest protection and biodiversity conservation.\n\nIn  this  scheme,  Eni's  protection  forest  activities  support  national  governments,  local  communities  and  UN agencies in the REDD+ strategies, in line with the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) and National Development Plans and, mainly, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of UN.\n\nEni built solid partnerships over time with recognized international developers of REDD+ projects, like BioCarbon Partners, Terra Global, Peace Parks Foundation, First Climate, Carbonsink and Carbon Credits Consulting, which allows to oversee every phase of the projects, from the design to the implementation up to verify the reduction emissions, with an active role in the governance of the project. The Eni's role is essential to allow the alignment with the REDD+ scheme and also the with highest standards for certification of the carbon emissions reduction and  social  and  environmental  effects  (such  as  Verified  Carbon  Standard  -  VCS  and  Climate  Community  & Biodiversity Standards - CCB), internationally recognized and in line with the qualitative standards, target to be achieved by Eni.\n\nEni launched the forestry projects in 2019 by means of the agreement with BioCarbon Partners to became active member in the governance of the Luangwa Community Forests Project (LCFP) in Zambia. The LCFP covers an area of approximately 1 million hectares, involves approximately 200,000 beneficiaries, also with economic diversification initiatives, and is currently one of the largest REDD + projects in Africa. The LCFP achieved the CCB (Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standards) 'triple gold' issued by international no-profit organization Verra, leader in the carbon credits certifying, for its outstanding social and environmental impact. Eni committed to purchase carbon credits generated by the LCFP project until 2038. During the year Eni finalized agreement to support the development of the Ntakata Mountains project in Tanzania and the Lower Zambezi project in Zambia, as well as launched the Amigos de Lakmul project in Mexico. In 2021 Eni achieved allowance of carbon credits by the projects to offset GHG emissions equivalent to over 2 million tonnes of CO 2 .\n\nEni  is  currently  considering  further  different  initiatives  in  several  countries,  by  means  of  partnerships  with governments and international developers in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The medium-long term target is a progressive growth of these initiatives and planned to reach a carbon credit portfolio on yearly basis to offset over 20 million tonnes of CO 2 in 2030.\n\n## AGRO-FEEDSTOCK PROJECTS\n\nDuring the year Eni finalized agreement with the authorities of the Kenya, Congo, Angola, Rwanda and Ivory Coast as well as in Mozambique and Benin in 2022 aiming to decarbonize the local energy mix by means of biofuels value chain by promoting agricultural initiatives for the cultivation of oil plants to be used as feedstock (Low ILUC feedstock - Indirect Land Use Change) for Eni's biorefineries, enhancing marginal areas not destined to the food chain.\n\nThe development activities plan is focused on vertical integration and includes agreements to produce oilseeds by local farmers and cooperatives and the construction of oil collection and extraction centers by Eni (Agri Hubs). The supply chain byproducts will be aimed for domestic market and also for export.\n\nThese initiatives will also support rural development, land restoration through sustainable and regenerative agriculture,  with  positive  impacts  on  socio-economic  development  and  employment,  access  to  market opportunities as well as human rights protection, health and food security.\n\nFurther programs is being evaluated in other countries with a model in analogy to the ones applied.\n\nIn particular, in the first step, industrial production start-up is expected in: (i) Kenya, where development program includes the construction of 20 agri ,hubs with start-up in 2022.

The overall production is expected to subsequently reach a agro-feedstock volume of over 800 thousand tonnes by 2030 leveraging on additional initiatives in other countries.\n\nWithin these development initiatives, in November 2021 Eni finalized strategic partnership agreement with the Bonifiche Ferraresi Group aimed at establishing an equal joint venture. Based on the agreement, Eni purchased a minority stake in the subsidiary of BF Bonifiche Ferraresi. In addition, the agreement include: (i)  research and experimentation projects of oil plant seeds to be used as feedstock in biorefineries; (ii) support in the countries where Eni will develop agro-feedstock projects by means of know-how transfer and agriculture seeds and products supplies.",

This is the first step of the transformation project of Porto Marghera plant, which includes the installation in the next year of the plants acquired for the production of styrene polymers entirely obtained from recycle raw material. The overall capacity of the first phase will be approximately 20 ktonnes per year.\n\nIn September Versalis finalized the acquisition of the control in Finproject, exercising the call option to buy the remaining 60% of share capital, following the initial acquisition of a 40% participating interest in 2020. The acquisition is complementary to Versalis' specialties portfolio and will create an all-Italian leading platform with high-performance formulated polymer applications and compounding, less influenced by commodity fluctuations. In January Finproject has taken the ISCC Plus certification for compound productions and products from renewable raw materials.\n\n## Circular economy and green chemicals\n\nFinalized the full  share  acquisition  of  FRI-EL  Biogas  Holding,  Italian  leader  in  biogas's  production. The company, renamed EniBioCh4in, owns plants generating electricity from biogas and a plant for processing OFMSW, the organic fraction of municipal solid waste, which Eni intends to convert to produce biomethane, that will supply in Eni service stations.\n\nVersalis, coherently with the Eni's decarbonization strategy, has launched a transformation plan which aims to  make its activities and products diversified and sustainable, in accordance with the principles of the circular economy.\n\nIn 2021, Versalis expanded the 'circular' products offering, manufactured with recycled raw materials. A new product called Versalis Revive \u00ae PS Air F - Series Forever was added to Versalis Revive \u00ae product line. It was addressed for food packaging and 75% made by recycled polystyrene from domestic waste sorting. The new product developed by Versalis and Forever Plast SpA, is the result of collaboration with various operators in the polystyrene industry such as Corepla, Pro Food e Unionplast.\n\nConfirmed the commitment aimed at the development of sustainable innovative technologies, through the agreement signed with BTS Biogas, an Italian company engaged in the design and realization of biogas plants, to develop and market an innovative technology to produce biogas and biomethane from residual lignocellulosic biomass. The technology will focus on Versalis' technology integration for biomass thermomechanical  pretreatment,  with  the  BTS  Biogas  technology  for  biogas  and  biomethane  production  via fermentative ways.\n\nFinally, signed an agreement between Matr\u00ecca, a JV Versalis/Novamont company, and Lanxess, a leader in specialty chemicals for the production of biocides from renewable raw materials. In January 2022 started the supply of renewable-source raw materials obtained from vegetable oils to the Porto Torres plant. Lanxess will use these materials to produce biocidal industrial additives for the consumer goods sector.\n\n## Sustainable mobility\n\nAs part of Eni's sustainable mobility growth strategy, signed an agreement in order to offer the battery swapping service for XEV's city car at the Eni service stations. In addition, from 2022, the XEV YOYO zeroemission city car will become part of the Enjoy fleet.\n\nIn  order  to  promote  initiatives  to  decarbonize  the  aviation  sector  and  accelerate  the  process  of  energy transition of airports, signed an agreement with SEA, the Milan Malpensa and Milan Linate airports operator, for the supply of sustainable fuels for aviation (SAF -Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and for ground handling",

This initiative is in line with the agreement finalized in January 2022 with Aeroporti di Roma which launched the first supplies of pure HVO hydrogenated biofuel, produced in Eni's biorefinery in Porto Marghera, to fuel the road vehicles for handling passengers with reduced mobility at the airport.\n\nSAF  production  started  in  October,  are  produced  exclusively  from  waste  and  residues,  in  line  with  the strategic decision of zeroing the use of palm oil from 2023.\n\nAs a step towards the transport decarbonization signed a letter of intent with Air Liquide for development of hydrogen mobility in Italy, in particular a feasibility and sustainability study for the development of the low carbon and renewable hydrogen supply chain to support the market of fuel cell vehicles for heavy and light mobility.\n\nFinally signed a strategic agreement with BASF, related to a new technology that produces advanced biopropanol from glycerin, obtained from the production of industrial biodiesel FAME (Fatty Acid Methil Esters), intended for use as a bio component in fuel formulation.\n\n## Proprietary technologies\n\nProprietary  technologies  will  play  a  key  role  in  accelerating  the  'green'  conversion  of  Versalis  reducing dependence on oil feedstock; Eni is engaged in the chemical recycling of non-reusable plastics (HOOP technology)  and  the  enhancement  of  forest  biomass  for  production  bioethanol  and  biogas  (PROESA technology)  in  collaboration  with  qualified  partners  such  as  Saipem  and  BTS  Biogas.  As  part  of  the valorization  of  proprietary  technologies  and  the  strengthening  of  Eni  presence  in  the  Asian  continent, Versalis has licensed the mass continuous technology to Supreme Petrochem Ltd, an Indian market-leader in compact and expandable polystyrene, to create a plant in Maharashtra (India). This is a technology that allows one to produce styrene polymers with reduced environmental impact, thanks to low emission and low energy consumption.\n\n## REFINING & MARKETING\n\n## SUPPLY AND TRADING\n\nIn  2021,  were  purchased  18.85  mmtonnes  of  crude  (compared  with  17.37  mmtonnes  in  2020),  of  which 3.85 mmtonnes by equity crude oil, 10.79 mmtonnes on the spot market and 4.21 mmtonnes by producer's Countries with term contracts. The breakdown by geographic area was as follows: 20% of purchased crude came from the Middle East, 18% from Russia, 15% from Central Asia, 15% from North Africa, 11% from Italy, 11% from West Africa, 2% from North Sea and 8% from other areas.\n\nPURCHASES\n\n|                                    | (mmtonnes)   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Equity crude oil                   |              | 3.85   | 3.55   | 4.24   | 0.30     | 8.5     |\n| Other crude oil                    |              | 15.00  | 13.82  | 19.19  | 1.18     | 8.5     |\n| Total crude oil purchases          |              | 18.85  | 17.37  | 23.43  | 1.48     | 8.5     |\n| Purchases of intermediate products |              | 0.26   | 0.11   | 0.26   | 0.15     | 136.4   |\n| Purchases of products              |              | 10.66  | 10.31  | 11.45  | 0.35     | 3.4     |\n| TOTAL PURCHASES                    |              | 29.77  | 27.79  | 35.14  | 1.98     | 7.1     |\n| Consumption for power generation   |              | (0.31) | (0.35) | (0.35) | 0.04     | 11.4    |\n| Other changes (a)                  |              | (0.89) | (0.69) | (2.08) | (0.20)   | (29.0)  |\n| TOTAL AVAILABILITY                 |              | 28.57  | 26.75  | 32.71  | 1.82     | 6.8     |\n\n- (a) Include change in inventories, decrease due to transportation, consumption and losses.",

Total throughputs in wholly-owned refineries were 14.01 mmtonnes, increase by 1.29 mmtonnes or 10.1% compared with 2020.\n\nThe refinery utilization rate, ratio between throughputs and refinery capacity, is 76%.\n\nApproximately 21% of processed crude was supplied by Eni's Exploration & Production segment, with a slight decrease from 2020 (21.2%).\n\n## BIOREFINERY\n\nThe volumes of biofuels processed from vegetable oil were 665 mmtonnes down by 6% from the previous period (40 ktonnes), as a result of standstill at Venezia biorefinery in a depressed scenario context.\n\nIn addition, the incidence rate of palm oil supplied for the production of biodiesel was reduced by approximately 34 percentage points compared to 2020, leveraging on the start-up of a new Biomass Treatment Unit (BTU) at the Gela biorefinery, enabling the use of up to 100% of biomass not in competition with the food chain for the production of biofuels. Confirmed the zeroing palm oil by 2023 in the refining processes.\n\nIn  2021  productions  of  biofuels  (HVO)  amounted  to  approximately  585  ktonnes  (down  by  6%)  according  to certifications in use (European RED and related directives).\n\n## AVAILABILITY OF REFINED PRODUCTS\n\n|                                                                | (mmtonnes)   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|\n| ITALY                                                          |              |        |        |        |          |         |\n| At wholly-owned refineries                                     |              | 14.01  | 12.72  | 17.26  | 1.29     | 10.1    |\n| Less input on account of third parties                         |              | (1.71) | (1.75) | (1.25) | 0.04     | 2.3     |\n| At affiliated refineries                                       |              | 4.21   | 3.85   | 4.69   | 0.36     | 9.4     |\n| Refinery throughputs on own account                            |              | 16.51  | 14.82  | 20.70  | 1.69     | 11.4    |\n| Consumption and losses                                         |              | (1.11) | (0.97) | (1.38) | (0.14)   | (14.8)  |\n| Products available for sale                                    |              | 15.40  | 13.85  | 19.32  | 1.55     | 11.2    |\n| Purchases of refined products and change in inventories        |              | 7.38   | 7.18   | 7.27   | 0.20     | 2.8     |\n| Products transferred to operations outside Italy               |              | (0.67) | (0.66) | (0.68) | (0.01)   | (1.5)   |\n| Consumption for power generation                               |              | (0.31) | (0.35) | (0.35) | 0.04     | 11.4    |\n| Sales of products                                              |              | 21.80  | 20.02  | 25.56  | 1.78     | 8.9     |\n| Bio  throughputs                                               |              | 0.67   | 0.71   | 0.31   | (0.04)   | (5.6)   |\n| OUTSIDE ITALY                                                  |              |        |        |        |          |         |\n| Refinery throughputs on own account                            |              | 2.27   | 2.18   | 2.04   | 0.09     | 4.1     |\n| Consumption and losses                                         |              | (0.18) | (0.17) | (0.18) | (0.01)   | (5.9)   |\n| Products available for sale                                    |              | 2.09   | 2.01   | 1.86   | 0.08     | 4.0     |\n| Purchases of refined products and change in inventories        |              | 3.41   | 3.39   | 4.17   | 0.02     | 0.6     |\n| Products transferred from Italian operations                   |              | 0.67   | 0.66   | 0.68   | 0.01     | 1.5     |\n| Sales of products                                              |              | 6.17   | 6.06   | 6.71   | 0.11     | 1.8     |\n| Refinery throughputs on own account in Italy and outside Italy |              | 18.78  | 17.00  | 22.74  | 1.78     | 10.5    |\n| of which: refinery throughputs of equity crude on own account  |              | 3.86   | 3.55   | 4.24   | 0.31     | 8.7     |\n| Total sales of refined products in Italy and outside Italy     |              | 27.97  | 26.08  | 32.27  | 1.89     | 7.2     |\n| Crude oil sales                                                |              | 0.60   | 0.67   | 0.44   | (0.07)   | (10.4)  |\n| TOTAL SALES                                                    |              | 28.57  | 26.75  | 32.71  | 1.82     | 6.8     |",

Possible outcomes of this situation might include a prolonged armed conflict, a possible escalation in the military action, risks of expansion of the ongoing geopolitical crisis and a further tightening  up  of  the  economic  sanctions  against  Russia. These factors could result in a scenario that could eventually sap  consumers'  confidence,  deter  investment  decisions  by operators and cripple industrial activities derailing the global recovery or, in the worst of the outcomes, triggering a new worldwide recession. This scenario would drive a reduction in hydrocarbons demands and of commodity prices and would adversely and significantly affect our results of operations and cash flow, as well as business prospects, with a possible lower remuneration of our shareholders.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of hostilities with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union, the USA, and the UK imposed a raft of stringent economic and financial sanctions against Russia, which have been added to those already in force since 2014.\n\nThe  new  restrictions  have  mainly  targeted  the  Russian financial  sector,  precluding  access  to  funding  from  US  and EU-based  financial  institutions  and  several  relevant  Russian entities operating in the Oil & Gas sector. Currently, the new sanctions continue to permit the purchase of oil, natural gas and  refined  products  exported  by  Russian  entities,  or  the maintenance of business relationships with certain Russian entities;  however,  as  long  as  the  conflict  continues,  it  is possible that increasingly tight sanctions could be imposed. Furthermore,  the  situation  in  the  marketplace  has  evolved concurrently, as many Western traders, oil companies, refiners and brokers have begun reducing purchases of crude oil from Russia giving rise to a sort of a private market sanctioning system. Finally, the President of the USA signed an executive order to ban all imports of Russian energy products. Those developments have destabilized energy markets as evidenced by the  material discount of the Ural Russian crude benchmark, triggering a spike in market volatility and propelling the Brent price at about 130 $/bbl in the last days of February and\n\ninto early March 2022. Natural gas prices for the continental Europe spot benchmark surged to new all-time highs driven by fears of supply disruptions (approximately \u20ac200 Mwh).\n\nThis volatility could increase counterparty and margining risks (see the section 'Risk factors and uncertainties').\n\nEni's  current  presence  in  Russia  is  insignificant.  Exploration projects in the Russian upstream are in a shut-down phase, also due to certain sanctions already in force before the recent crisis, and the related costs have been entirely impaired in previous reporting periods. Eni holds a stake in the Blue Stream pipeline that transports russian-sourced gas across the Black Sea, jointly marketed by Eni and Gazprom to Turkey's stateowned company Botas. It represents a non-significant value in Eni's balance sheet. Management is considering different options for a possible sale of this stake.\n\nThe most significant transactions between Eni and its Russian counterparts concern the purchase of natural gas from the Russian state company Gazprom on the basis of the long-term take-or-pay contracts (in 2021 about 22 billion cubic meters for  the  Italian  market).  Eni's  gas  portfolio  availability  from other geographies, access to transport capacities, contracts flexibility  and  presence  in  the  LNG  segment  (in  particular through the Damietta plant) as well as long-term relations with producing countries (primarily Algeria and Libya) are all options that the Company can activate in the event of unpredictable scenarios of sanctions by the international community against Russian Oil & Gas.\n\nAs  far  as  crude  oil  supplies  are  concerned,  although  Eni's refining  system  has  always  processed  Ural  crudes,  plants flexibility and trading skills in the supply eventually allow us to replace this crude oil in our processes.\n\nFurthermore, in certain upstream projects in different countries in the world the counterparties are Russian.\n\nAny  decision  on  such  presence  is  on  behalf  of  the  State Companies of the Countries where these initiatives are located. Eni  has  taken  the  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  its activities are carried out in accordance with the applicable rules, ensuring continuous monitoring of the evolution of the sanctioning framework, to adapt its activities on an ongoing basis to the restrictions applicable from time to time.",

        "page_content": "## Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe  macroeconomic  environment  has  gradually  improved during  2021  due  to  the  effective  vaccination  campaigns against  the  COVID-19  disease,  together  with  measures  to contain the spread of the virus, particularly in OECD Countries, allowing for a phased reopening of the economic activities and increasing mobility of people. The expansionary monetary policies  adopted  by  the  central  banks  and  the  large  scale fiscal  stimulus  launched  by  the  governments  supported consumptions and investments. In this context, the demand for hydrocarbons and the prices of commodities, main driver of the Group's financial results, recorded a significant rebound. Global energy demand first stabilized and then unexpectedly increased in the last quarter of the year, driven by an acceleration in the pace of the economic recovery, resulting in an increase in the average price of oil for the year by 70% vs. 2020 at about 71 $/barrel, while natural gas prices recorded material increases (in the order of several hundreds percentage points) due to a particularly tight market. These trends were the basis of the strong recovery in profitability in the Exploration & Production and  Global  Gas  &  LNG  Portfolio  segments,  and  to  a  lesser extent  a  solid  performance  of  the  chemical  business  line, driven by a recovery in demand for commodities.\n\nThe  Refining  &  Marketing  business  has  continued  to  be weighted  down  by  the  effects  of  the  pandemic,  due  to\n\nweak  demands  for  jet  fuel  that  penalized  the  profitability of  traditional  refineries  by  creating  an  oversupply  of  gasoil leading to significantly lower products  spreads.  The profitability  was  also  affected  by  the  higher  costs  of  gasindexed energy and plant utilities and the higher costs for the  purchase  of  emission  allowances  to  comply  with  the environmental obligations of the European ETS, which more than doubled due to a recovery in industrial activities and as consumption of coal increased signficantly due to its costcompetitiveness against natural gas to fire power generation and to produce steam.\n\nOverall,  2021  saw  a  significant  rebound  in  consolidated results which closed with a profit of \u20ac5.82 billion compared to a loss of \u20ac8.64 billion in 2020 and an operating cash flow of \u20ac12.86 billion, which increased by approximately \u20ac8 billion compared to 2020.\n\nLooking to the future, the main risks for the Group's financial performance are linked to the possibility of the spread of new vaccine-resistant variants of the virus, as well as the resumption of inflation driven by the spill-over effects through the supply chains of increased raw material costs as the ultimate,  unintended  effect  of  accommodative  monetary policies and big tax measures adopted to help the economy recover from the fallout of the pandemic.\n\n## PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT\n\n|                                                                                       | (\u20ac million)   | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|\n| Sales from operations                                                                 |               | 76,575   | 43,987   | 69,881   | 32,588   | 74.1    |\n| Other income and revenues                                                             |               | 1,196    | 960      | 1,160    | 236      | 24.6    |\n| Operating expenses                                                                    |               | (58,716) | (36,640) | (54,302) | (22,076) | (60.3)  |\n| Other operating income (expense)                                                      |               | 903      | (766)    | 287      | 1,669    | ..      |\n| Depreciation, depletion, amortization                                                 |               | (7,063)  | (7,304)  | (8,106)  | 241      | 3.3     |\n| Net impairment reversals (losses) of tangible and intangible  and right-of-use assets |               | (167)    | (3,183)  | (2,188)  | 3,016    | 94.8    |\n| Write-off of tangible and intangible assets                                           |               | (387)    | (329)    | (300)    | (58)     | (17.6)  |\n| Operating profit (loss)                                                               |               | 12,341   | (3,275)  | 6,432    | 15,616   | ..      |\n| Finance income (expense)                                                              |               | (788)    | (1,045)  | (879)    | 257      | 24.6    |\n| Income (expense) from investments                                                     |               | (868)    | (1,658)  | 193      | 790      | 47.6    |\n| Profit (loss) before income taxes                                                     |               | 10,685   | (5,978)  | 5,746    | 16,663   | ..      |\n| Income taxes                                                                          |               | (4,845)  | (2,650)  | (5,591)  | (2,195)  | (82.8)  |\n| Tax rate (%)                                                                          |               | 45.3     | ..       | 97.3     |          |         |\n| Net profit (loss)                                                                     |               | 5,840    | (8,628)  | 155      | 14,468   | ..      |\n| attributable to:                                                                      |               |          |          |          |          |         |\n| - Eni's shareholders                                                                  |               | 5,821    | (8,635)  | 148      | 14,456   | ..      |\n| - Non-controlling interest                                                            |               | 19       | 7        | 7        | 12       | ..      |",

In 2021 the average reference price of the Brent marker was 71 $/bbl, +70% compared to 2020. The European gas market was characterized by extreme conditions due to the tight supply and uncertainties on supplies from Russia: spot price at the continental hub 'TTF' reached an average of 46 \u20ac/MWh, increasing by more than 300%; aligned values for the Italian spot price 'PSV'.\n\nSimilar  conditions  were  recorded  in  the  wholesale  electricity market with the Italian 'PUN' price at an average 125 \u20ac/MWh, +86% compared to 2020, peaking at 440 \u20ac/MWh in the fourth quarter of  the  year.

This performance was driven  by  the  financial  discipline  and  cost  reduction  initiatives implemented to withstand the enduring impact of COVID-19 and enabled Eni to capture the recovery in energy scenario due to a strong recovery in commodity prices driven by completely different market  conditions,  which  turned  to  balanced/ ii) iii)\n\nundersupplied compared to oversupplied markets a year ago impacted by the pandemic COVID-19, due to the reopening of the economies and a strong macroeconomic cycle which drove hydrocarbons demands and significant drawdowns at global oil and products inventories. Commodities supply was impacted by capex plan reduction of oil companies in response to the crisis of the COVID-19.\n\nThese trends resulted in robust price increases for all energy commodities (in the full year 2021, Brent price was 70.73 $/ bbl on average up 70%; the Italian reference spot price 'PSV' of natural gas was up 487 \u20ac/kcm, or 335%).\n\nFor a detailed disclosure of business performance, see 'Results by business segments'.\n\nIn 2021 Eni Group reported an adjusted  net  profit of \u20ac4,330 million driven by a better operating performance and a lower tax rate (50% in 2021 compared to 175% in 2020).\n\n## Breakdown of special items\n\nNet profit includes special items consisting of net gains of \u20ac431 million, relating to the following:\n\n- i) the accounting effect of certain fair-valued commodity derivatives lacking the formal criteria to be classified as\n\nhedges, as well as the fair value of forward contracts to sell volumes of gas which were not accounted based on the own use exemption (gains of \u20ac2,139 million);\n\n- reversals of previously recognized impairment losses for  \u20ac1,244  million  relating  to  gas  fields  in  Italy  and fields in Congo, Libya, the USA and Algeria, driven by an improved hydrocarbon pricing environment;\n- impairment  losses  at  refineries  (approximately  \u20ac900 million) relating to the book value of operated plants and managed through JV in Italy and in Europe, driven by expected decreasing cash flows reflecting lowered outlook for refining margins and the forecast of higher expenses for emission allowances, as well as the writedown of capital expenditure relating to certain Cash Generating Units in the R&M business. These units were impaired in previous reporting periods and continued to lack any profitability prospects (for an overall impact of approximately \u20ac300 million);\n- iv) the impairment of exploration projects (\u20ac247 million) due to the refocusing of the portfolio with the exiting from marginal areas;\n- v) the impairment of Chemical assets due to a deteriorated margin scenario (\u20ac163 million);\n- vi) the  difference  between  the  value  of  gas  inventories accounted for under the weighted-average cost method provided by IFRS and management's own measure of inventories, which moves forward at the time of inventory drawdown the margins captured on volumes in inventories above their normal levels leveraging the seasonal spread in gas prices net of the effects of the associated commodity derivatives (gains of \u20ac352 million);",

Other finance expense increased by \u20ac97 million mainly due to a discounted receivable in the E&P segment.\n\n## NET INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS\n\n| 2021                                                      | (\u20ac million)   | Exploration  & Production   | Global  Gas & LNG  Portfolio   | Refining  & Marketing  and  Chemicals   | Plenitude  & Power   | Corporate and  other activities   | Group   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Share of gains (losses) from equity-accounted investments |               | 8                           |                                | (333)                                   |                      | (766)                             | (1,091) |\n| Dividends                                                 |               | 171                         |                                | 59                                      |                      |                                   | 230     |\n| Net gains (losses) on disposals                           |               | 1                           |                                |                                         |                      |                                   | 1       |\n| Other income (expense), net                               |               |                             | (5)                            | 3                                       | (3)                  | (3)                               | (8)     |\n|                                                           |               | 180                         | (5)                            | (271)                                   | (3)                  | (769)                             | (868)   |\n\nNet  expense  from  investments  amounted  to  \u20ac868  million related to:\n\n- } a loss of \u20ac1,091 million due to the share of losses at equityaccounted entities, mainly: (i) ADNOC Refining, due to the accounting of extraordinary charges; and (ii) Eni's interest of the JV Saipem losses;\n- } dividends of \u20ac230 million paid by minor investments in certain entities which were designated at fair value through OCI under IFRS 9 except for dividends which are recorded through  profit.

These transactions were part of an hedging program relating to the sale of 157 bcf out of the Company's natural gas proved reserves in the period December 2021 to December 2022.\n\nThe  following  table  reports  the  impact  of  cash  flow  hedge derivatives as described above:\n\n2021\n\n| Natural gas                                                                            |                      |          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------|\n|                                                                                        | (billion cubic feet) |          |\n| Sale volumes                                                                           |                      | 1,446    |\n| Sale volumes hedged by derivatives (cash flow hedge) Total price excluding derivatives | ($/kcf)              | 12  6.71 |\n| Realized gains (losses) on derivatives                                                 |                      | (0.07)   |\n| Total average price                                                                    |                      | 6.64     |\n\n## GLOBAL GAS & LNG PORTFOLIO\n\n|                                                 | (\u20ac million)   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Operating profit (loss)                         |               | 899    | (332)  | 431    | 1,231    | ..      |\n| Exclusion of special items:                     |               | (319)  | 658    | (238)  |          |         |\n| - impairment losses (impairment reversals), net |               | 26     | 2      | (5)    |          |         |\n| - provision for redundancy incentives           |               | 5      | 2      | 1      |          |         |\n| - commodity derivatives                         |               | (207)  | 858    | (576)  |          |         |\n| - exchange rate differences and derivatives     |               | 206    | (183)  | 109    |          |         |\n| - other                                         |               | (349)  | (21)   | 233    |          |         |\n| Adjusted operating profit (loss)                |               | 580    | 326    | 193    | 254      | 77.9    |\n| Net finance (expense) income (a)                |               | (17)   |        | 3      | (17)     |         |\n| Net income (expense) from investments (a)       |               |        | (15)   | (21)   | 15       |         |\n| Income taxes (a)                                |               | (394)  | (100)  | (75)   | (294)    |         |\n| Adjusted net profit (loss)                      |               | 169    | 211    | 100    | (42)     | (19.9)  |\n\n(a) Excluding special items.\n\nIn 2021, the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment reported an adjusted  operating  profit of  \u20ac580  million,  a  robust  growth compared to 2020 (up by \u20ac254 million, or 78%). The positive performance leveraged on the continuous initiatives of portfolio optimization and renegotiations as well as higher gas volumes sold.

Management  uses  the  summarized group  balance  sheet  to  calculate  key  ratios  such  as  the return on invested capital (adjusted ROACE) and the financial soundness/equilibrium (gearing and leverage).\n\n## SUMMARIZED GROUP BALANCE SHEET (a)\n\n|                                                        | (\u20ac million)   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| Fixed assets                                           |               |                     |                     |          |\n| Property,  plant and equipment                         |               | 56,299              | 53,943              | 2,356    |\n| Right of use                                           |               | 4,821               | 4,643               | 178      |\n| Intangible assets                                      |               | 4,799               | 2,936               | 1,863    |\n| Inventories -

Management  periodically  reviews leverage in order to assess the soundness and efficiency of the Group balance sheet in terms of optimal mix between net borrowings and net equity, and to carry out benchmark analysis with industry standards.\n\n|                                                         | (\u20ac million)   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|\n| Total finance debt                                      |               | 27,794              | 26,686              | 1,108    |\n| -  Short-term debt                                      |               | 4,080               | 4,791               | (711)    |\n| -  Long-term debt                                       |               | 23,714              | 21,895              | 1,819    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                               |               | (8,254)             | (9,413)             | 1,159    |\n| Securities held for trading                             |               | (6,301)             | (5,502)             | (799)    |\n| Financing receivables held for non-operating purposes   |               | (4,252)             | (203)               | (4,049)  |\n| Net borrowings before lease liabilities ex IFRS 16      |               | 8,987               | 11,568              | (2,581)  |\n| Lease Liabilities                                       |               | 5,337               | 5,018               | 319      |\n| - of which Eni working interest                         |               | 3,653               | 3,366               | 287      |\n| - of which Joint operators' working interest            |               | 1,684               | 1,652               | 32       |\n| Net borrowings post lease liabilities ex IFRS 16        |               | 14,324              | 16,586              | (2,262)  |\n| Shareholders' equity including non-controlling interest |               | 44,519              | 37,493              | 7,026    |\n| Leverage before lease liability ex IFRS 16              |               | 0.20                | 0.31                | 0.11     |\n| Leverage after lease liability ex IFRS 16               |               | 0.32                | 0.44                | 0.12     |\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  net  borrowings  were  \u20ac14,324 million decreasing by \u20ac2,262 million from 2020.\n\nTotal finance debt of \u20ac27,794 million consisted of \u20ac4,080 million of short-term debt (including the portion of longterm debt due within twelve months of \u20ac1,781 million) and \u20ac23,714 million of long-term debt.\n\nThe  increase  in financing  receivables  held  for  nonoperating  purposes was  due  to  the  material  increase  in commodity  prices  and  in  commodity  derivates  exposure which triggered requests from financial counterparts and commodity exchanges to adjust the financial deposits to\n\n## SUMMARIZED GROUP CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\nEni's Summarized Group Cash Flow Statement derives from the  statutory  statement of cash flows. It enables investors to understand the connection existing between changes in cash and  cash  equivalents  (deriving  from  the  statutory  cash  flows statement) and in net borrowings (deriving from the summarized cash flow statement) that occurred in the reporting period. The measure which links the two statements is represented by the 'free cash flow' which is calculated as difference between the cash flow generated from operations and the net cash used in investing activities. Starting from free cash flow it is possible to\n\nsecure the derivatives transactions (margin calls). Those deposit will be reimbursed to the Company upon settlement of the underlying transactions.\n\nWhen  excluding  the  lease  liabilities,  net  borrowings  were re-determined at \u20ac8,987 million reducing by \u20ac2,581 million from 2020.\n\nLeverage 2 - the ratio of the borrowings to total equity - was 0.32 at December 31, 2021. The impact of the lease liability pertaining to joint operators in Eni-led upstream unincorporated joint ventures weighted on leverage for 4 points. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16 altogether, leverage would be 0.20.\n\ndetermine either: (i) changes in cash and cash equivalents for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to financing debts/receivables (issuance/repayment of debt and receivables related  to  financing  activities),  shareholders'  equity  (dividends paid,  net  repurchase  of  own  shares,  capital  issuance)  and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences; and (ii) change in net borrowings for the period by adding/deducting  cash  flows  relating  to  shareholders'  equity and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences.",

Furthermore, in determining the  business  segments'  adjusted  results,  finance  charges  on finance  debt  and  interest  income  are  excluded  (see  below).  In determining adjusted results, inventory holding gains or losses are excluded from base business performance, which is the difference between the cost of sales of the volumes sold in the period based on the cost of supplies of the same period and the cost of sales of the volumes sold calculated using the weighted average cost method of inventory accounting as required by IFRS, except in those business segments where inventories are utilized as a lever to optimize margins.\n\nFinally, the same special charges/gains are excluded from the Eni's share of results at JVs and other equity accounted entities, including any profit/loss on inventory holding.\n\nManagement is disclosing Non-GAAP measures of performance to facilitate a comparison of base business performance across periods, and to allow financial analysts to evaluate Eni's trading performance on the basis of their forecasting models.\n\nNon-GAAP  financial  measures  should  be  read  together  with information determined by applying IFRS and do not stand in for them. Other companies may adopt different methodologies to determine Non-GAAP measures. Follows the description of the  main  alternative  performance  measures  adopted  by  Eni. The measures reported below refer to the performance of the reporting periods disclosed in this press report.\n\n## Adjusted operating and net profit\n\nAdjusted operating profit and adjusted net profit are determined by excluding inventory holding gains or losses, special items and, in determining the business segments' adjusted results, finance  charges  on  finance  debt  and  interest  income.  The adjusted  operating  profit  of  each  business  segment  reports gains  and  losses  on  derivative  financial  instruments  entered into to manage exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which impact industrial margins and translation of  commercial  payables  and  receivables.  Accordingly,  also currency  translation  effects  recorded  through  profit  and  loss are  reported  within  business  segments'  adjusted  operating\n\nprofit. The taxation effect of the items excluded from adjusted operating or net profit is determined based on the specific rate of taxes applicable to each of them.\n\nFinance charges or income related to net borrowings excluded from the adjusted net profit of business segments are comprised of interest charges on finance debt and interest income earned on  cash  and  cash  equivalents  not  related  to  operations. Therefore, the adjusted net profit of business segments includes finance charges or income deriving from certain segment operated assets,  i.e.,  interest  income  on  certain  receivable  financing  and securities  related  to  operations  and  finance  charge  pertaining  to the accretion of certain provisions recorded on a discounted basis (as in the case of the asset retirement obligations in the Exploration & Production segment).\n\n## Inventory holding gain or loss\n\nThis is the difference between the cost of sales of the volumes sold in the period based on the cost of supplies of the same period and the cost of sales of the volumes sold calculated using the weighted average cost method of inventory accounting as required by IFRS.\n\n## Special items\n\nThese  include  certain  significant  income  or  charges  pertaining to either: (i) infrequent or unusual events and transactions, being identified  as  non-recurring  items  under  such  circumstances; (ii) certain events or transactions which are not considered to be representative of the ordinary course of business, as in the case of environmental provisions, restructuring charges, asset impairments or write ups and gains or losses on divestments even though they occurred in past periods or are likely to occur in  future  ones.  Exchange  rate  differences  and  derivatives relating  to  industrial  activities  and  commercial  payables  and receivables,  particularly  exchange  rate  derivatives  to  manage commodity  pricing  formulas  which  are  quoted  in  a  currency other  than  the  functional  currency  are  reclassified  in  operating profit  with  a  corresponding  adjustment  to  net  finance  charges, notwithstanding the handling of foreign currency exchange risks is  made  centrally  by  netting  off  naturally-occurring  opposite positions and then dealing with any residual risk exposure in the derivative market. Finally, special items include the accounting effects of fair-valued commodity  derivatives relating to commercial exposures, in addition to those which lack the criteria to be designed as hedges, also those which are not eligible for the own use exemption, including the ineffective portion of cash flow  hedges,  as  well  as  the  accounting  effects  of  commodity and exchange rates derivatives whenever it is deemed that the underlying transaction is expected to occur in future reporting periods. As provided for in Decision No. 15519 of July 27, 2006 of the Italian market regulator (CONSOB), non-recurring material income or charges are to be clearly reported in the management's discussion and financial tables.",

Leverage  is  the  reference  ratio  to  assess  the  solidity  and efficiency of the Group balance sheet in terms of incidence of funding sources including third-party funding and equity as well as to carry out benchmark analysis with industry standards.\n\n## Gearing\n\nGearing  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  between  net  borrowings and capital employed net and measures how much of capital employed net is financed recurring to third-party funding.\n\n## Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital at replacement cost\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities before changes in working capital and excluding inventory holding gain or loss.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow represents the link existing between changes in cash and cash equivalents (deriving from the statutory cash flows statement) and in net borrowings (deriving from the summarized cash flow statement) that occurred from the beginning of the period to the end of period. Free cash flow is the cash in excess of capital expenditure needs. Starting from free cash flow it is possible to determine either: (i) changes in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  for  the  period  by  adding/ deducting cash flows relating to financing debts/ receivables (issuance/repayment  of  debt  and  receivables  related  to financing activities), shareholders' equity (dividends paid, net repurchase of own shares, capital issuance) and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences; (ii)  changes  in  net  borrowings  for  the  period  by  adding/ deducting  cash  flows  relating  to  shareholders'  equity  and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences.\n\n## Net borrowings\n\nNet  borrowings  is  calculated  as  total  finance  debt  less cash, cash equivalents and certain very liquid investments not  related  to  operations,  including  among  others  nonoperating financing receivables and securities not related to operations. Financial activities are qualified as 'not related to  operations'  when  these  are  not  strictly  related  to  the business operations.\n\n## ROACE Adjusted\n\nIs the return on average capital invested, calculated as the ratio between net income before minority interests, plus net financial charges on net financial debt, less the related tax effect and net average capital employed.\n\n## Coverage\n\nFinancial  discipline  ratio,  calculated  as  the  ratio  between operating profit and net finance charges.\n\n## Current ratio\n\nMeasures the capability of the company to repay short-term debt, calculated as the ratio between current assets and current liabilities.\n\n## Debt coverage\n\nRating  companies  use  the  debt  coverage  ratio  to  evaluate debt sustainability.

The price of crude oil has a  history  of  volatility  because,  like  other  commodities,  it  is influenced by the ups and downs in the economic cycle and several other macro-variables that are beyond management's control.  Crude  oil  prices  are  mainly  determined  by  the balance between global oil supplies and demand, the global levels  of  commercial  inventories  and  producing  countries' spare  capacity.  In  the  short-term,  worldwide  demand  for crude oil is highly correlated to the macroeconomic cycle. A  downturn  in  economic  activity  normally  triggers  lower global demand for crude oil and possibly a supply and/or an inventory build-up, because in the short-term producers are unable  to  respond  to  swings  in  demand  quickly.  Whenever global supplies of crude oil outstrip demand, crude oil prices weaken.  Factors  that  can  influence  the  global  economic activity in the short-term and demand for crude oil include several,  unpredictable  events,  like  trends  in  the  economic growth  which  shape  crude  oil  demand  in  big  consuming countries  like  China,  India  and  the  United  States,  financial crisis,  geo-political  crisis,  local  conflicts  and  wars,  social instability,  pandemic  diseases,  the  flows  of  international commerce, trade disputes and governments' fiscal policies, among  others.  All  these  events  could  influence  demands for crude oil. Long-term demands for crude oil is driven, on the  positive  side,  by  demographic  growth,  improving  living standards and GDP expansion; on the negative side, factors that in the long-term may significantly reduce demands for crude oil include availability of alternative sources of energy (e.g., nuclear and renewables), technological breakthroughs, shifts  in  consumer  preferences,  and  finally  measures  and other initiatives adopted or planned by governments to tackle climate change and to curb carbon-dioxide emissions (CO 2 emissions),  including  stricter  regulations  and  control  on production and consumption of crude oil. Many governments and supranational institutions, with the USA and EU leading the  way,  have  begun  implementing  policies  to  transition the  economy towards a low carbon model of development\n\nthrough  various  means  and  strategies,  particularly  by supporting  development  of  renewable  energies  and  the replacement  of  internal  combustion  engine  vehicles  with electric vehicles, including the possible adoption of tougher regulations on the use of hydrocarbons such as the taxation of  CO 2 emissions  as  a  mitigation  action  of  the  climate change  risk.  According  to  Eni's  management,  the  push  to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions and an ongoing energy transition  towards  a  low  carbon  economy  are  likely to  materially  affect  the  worldwide  energy  mix  in  the  longterm and may lead to structural lower crude oil demands and prices. Eni also believes that the COVID-19 pandemic could have  possibly  accelerated  those  trends.  See  the  section dedicated to the discussion of climate-related risks below.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  significant  growth  in  US  tight  oil production since 2011, global oil supplies are still controlled to a large degree by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  ('OPEC')  cartel,  which  has  recently  extended to  include  other  important  oil  producers  like  Russia  and Kazakhstan to form the so-called OPEC+ alliance. Saudi Arabia plays a crucial role within the cartel, because it is estimated to  hold  huge  amounts  of  reserves  and  a  vast  majority  of worldwide  spare  production  capacity.  This  explains  why geopolitical developments in the Middle East and particularly in  the  Gulf  area,  like  regional  conflicts,  acts  of  war,  strikes, attacks, sabotages, and social and political tensions can have a  big  influence  on  crude  oil  prices.  Also,  sanctions  imposed by  the  United  States  and  the  EU  against  certain  producing countries may influence trends in crude oil prices.\n\nTo  a  lesser  extent,  extreme  weather  events,  such  as hurricanes  in  areas  of  highly  concentrated  production  like the Gulf of Mexico, and operational issues at key petroleum infrastructure may have an impact on crude oil prices.\n\nThe recovery of crude oil prices that commenced at the end of 2020 has strengthened throughout 2021 due to a favourable combination  of  market  and  macro  developments,  most notably a strong macroeconomic recovery that supported crude  oil  consumption,  continued  financial  discipline  of international oil companies, careful production management on  part  of  the  alliance  of  OPEC+  producing  countries  in",

        "page_content": "adding new supplies and normalizing levels of commercial inventories in OECD countries. The macroeconomic cycle has been driven by the gradual reopening of the economies of the USA and Europe due to the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign against the COVID-19 disease, an acceleration in the pace of economic activity in Asia, robust fiscal policies adopted by governments to help economies emerge from the fallout of the COVID recession and accommodative monetary policies from central banks. Furthermore, the spread of new virus  variants,  like  the  Delta  one  in  summer,  or  the  Omicron variant  in  the  final  part  of  2021,  did  not  derail  the  recovery because  new  lockdowns  were  averted  thanks  to  improved ways  of  restraining  the  pandemic  and  the  resilience  of  the vaccinated  population.  Strong  demand  from  road  transport, maritime and petrochemicals sectors and for people mobility resulted in an increase of approximately 5.5 million barrels/d in global crude oil demand in 2021 from the historic low of 2020 of  approximately  92  million  barrels/d,  more  than  offsetting weak consumption in the civil airline sector which continued to suffer from low activity levels. Global oil demand is expected to  recover  to  the  pre-COVID  pandemic  level  of  100  million barrels/d  reported  in  2019  by  end  the  second  half  of  2022, absent any disruption in the recovery of the global economy.\n\nThe  better  fundamentals  of  the  oil  market  in  2021  were significantly  and  positively  affected  by  a  more  disciplined approach  adopted  by  producers  in  adding  new  supplies. Throughout  2021,  the  OPEC+  alliance  has  implemented effective  production  management  by  gradually  easing  the quotas  agreed  in  May  2020  at  the  peak  of  the  pandemic crisis, to avoid risks of oversupplying the market by restoring too hastily the full pre-COVID output. Differently from past oil cycles, despite recovering prices, international oil companies and listed shale producers in the USA have retained a prudent approach to investing decisions, signalling a historic shift in capital allocation policies driven by the need to repair balance sheets and cash flows which were significantly impaired by the pandemic downturn and by the need to boost financial returns to shareholders. Pressured by investor demanding higher  returns  and  ESG  considerations  and,  in  the  case  of European players, by the need to allocate more funds to the businesses  of  the  energy  transition,  Oil  &  Gas  companies have continued to constrain the spending in the traditional upstream business, reinvesting in the business just a fraction of  the  cash  flows  to  maintain  production,  while  returning excess cash to shareholders via dividend increases and share repurchases. According to market sources, global upstream's capital  expenditures  in  2021  have  barely  increased  from 2020, which represented the lowest level in fifteen years at about  $350  billion  and  are  projected  to  grow  modestly  in 2022.  According  to  market  intelligence,  that  level  of  global upstream  investment  is  insufficient  to  hold  oil  production steady at 100 million barrels/d.\n\nModest growth in worldwide crude oil supplies has led to a substantial drawdown in inventories, which have returned to historic averages. Against this backdrop, in the final months of  2021  many  countries  like  China  and  Western  European countries  have  begun  facing  difficulties  at  meeting  energy needs of their economies due to a global shortage of natural gas and coal to fire power generation, triggering a sharp rally in  energy  commodities.  The  rally  extended  also  to  crude oil  prices due to increasing evidence of gas-to-oil switch to produce electricity.\n\nDue to a more constructive macro environment and better energy  fundamentals,  in  2021  crude  oil  prices  recovered strongly with the Brent crude oil benchmark averaging about 71 $/bbl in the year, up by 70% compared to 2020. The uptrend has continued in the first months of 2022, with Brent crude oil prices climbing above the psychological threshold of 100 $/ bbl to reach the highest mark from 2008 at 120-130 $/bbl, driven by the rising international tensions in connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict (see below).\n\nGas  prices,  also  negatively  affected  in  2020  by  the economic crisis  due  to  COVID-19  pandemic,  recorded  an even more significant recovery than oil, due to strengthened fundamentals driven by a global demand recovery, unusual seasonal factors and much tighter supplies than a year ago. Particularly, on the supply side, the worldwide oversupply of  liquefied  natural  gas  ('LNG')  which  led  to  the  gas prices downturn in 2019-2020 was already expected to be absorbed, in a typical cyclical business after the LNG wave of the previous years, and maintenances deferred during the previous year due to COVID-19 affected 2021 production. This  came  on  top  of  the  financial  discipline  of  the  US shale producers which reduced in 2020 the production of associated  gas.  Moreover,  in  2020  several  LNG  projects that  were  under  construction  or  in  a  pre-FID  stage  of development  have  been  delayed,  revised  or  cancelled due  to  a  combination  of  lack  of  financial  resources  due to  the  COVID-19  downturn,  environmental  and  climate considerations and producers' capital discipline. This  will impact  the  global  gas  and  LNG  market  balance  which  is now expected to remain tight even in a mid-term horizon (2022-2025).  At  the  same  time,  global  gas  demand  grew significantly  in  2021  driven  by  a  strong  macroeconomic recovery and by contingent factors like a particularly cold winter  season  in  the  South-East  Asia  and  in  Texas  and unexpectedly  high  demand  in  South  America  (Argentina due to issues with domestic production and Brazil due to a severe drought impacting power generation). The recovery of gas prices, already remarkable in the first part of 2021, accelerated  dramatically  during  the  summer  months and  with  the  start  of  the  winter  season  in  the  Northern Hemisphere, driven by reduced supplies in Asia and Europe",

Gas prices surged well above any market expectations  and  forecast  in  the  final  part  of  2021,  with spot prices at continental hubs in Europe and for spot LNG cargos to Asia reaching all-time highs over 60 $/mmBTU, which is more than ten times the average price recorded in  2020.  In  2021,  on  average  the  spot  prices  of  natural gas recorded at the main continental hubs in Europe more than quadrupled compared to 2020: the price recorded at the  spot  market  in  Italy  'PSV'  averaged  487  \u20ac/thousand cubic meters (up by 335% compared to 2020, or about 17 $/mmBTU), a similar trend was recorded by the TTF spot price at the continental hubs which directly benefited from decreasing  LNG  import  flows.  Due  to  the  recent  spike  in market  volatility  following  the  outbreak  of  the  RussiaUkraine conflict, natural gas prices have risen materially in late February and in March.\n\nLooking  forward,  we  believe  that  the  fundamentals  of  the oil  and  gas  markets  will  continue  to  be  supported  by  tight supplies due to the underinvestment in the upstream sectors occurred  in  previous  years,  oil  companies'  renewed  focus on  financial  discipline  and  shareholders'  returns  which  will constrain capital budgets, production management on part of OPEC+ alliance and the global economic recovery underway. On the negative side, high energy costs could derail the macro economic  recovery  by  reducing  consumers'  disposable income and could lead to phenomena of demand destruction, like  the  ones  already  observed  in  the  final  months  of  2021 with several commodity producers (like metals and fertilizers) halting  plants  operations.  Finally,  high  energy  costs  could drive up inflationary pressures and alter market expectations about  future  inflationary  rates  pressuring  central  banks to  abandon  loose  monetary  policies  and  to  raise  interest rates,  which could negatively impact economic growth and hydrocarbons consumptions.\n\nThe growing geopolitical risk in connection with the RussiaUkraine  conflict  also  represents  a  factor  in  the  outlook 2022 because rising tensions between Russia and Western countries, the enactment on part of the USA and European countries  of  economic  sanctions  against  Russia,  and  any possible  ground  or  military  escalations  could  derail  the macroeconomic  cycle  by  sapping  consumers  sentiment or  interfering  with  operators' investment decisions and this could lead to lower demands for hydrocarbons (see below).\n\nThe  volatility  of  hydrocarbons  prices  significantly  affects the  Group's  financial  performance.  Lower  hydrocarbon prices from one year to another negatively affect the Group's consolidated results of operations and cash flow; the opposite occurs in case of a rise in prices. This is because lower prices\n\ntranslate  into  lower  revenues  recognised  in  the  Company's Exploration & Production segment at the time of the price change, whereas expenses in this segment are either fixed or less sensitive to changes in crude oil prices than revenues. With respect to our Brent crude oil price assumption of 80 $/ bbl for 2022, we estimate our cash from operations to vary by approximately \u20ac140 million for each one-dollar change in the price of the Brent crude oil.\n\nEni's results of operations and cash flows are less sensitive to movements in natural gas prices because a large part of equity gas volumes are sold based on fixed pricing formulae and also due to the forward sale executed in the final months of 2021 of about 5 bcm of the expected 2022 equity production at fixed prices as part of our risk management activities.\n\nFinally, movements in hydrocarbons prices significantly affect the  reportable  amount  of  production  and  proved  reserves under  our  production  sharing  agreements  ('PSAs'),  which represented  about  58%  of  our  proved  reserves  as  of  end of  2021.  The  entitlement  mechanism  of  PSAs  foresees  the Company is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of  which  is  intended  to  cover  expenditures  incurred  by  the Company  to  develop  and  operate  the  field.  The  higher  the reference  prices  for  Brent  crude  oil  used  to  estimate  Eni's proved  reserves,  the  lower  the  number  of  barrels  necessary to recover the same amount of expenditure, and vice versa. In 2021 our reported production and reserves were lowered by an estimated amount of respectively 13 KBOE/d and by 168 mmboe due to an increased Brent reference price. Considering the current portfolio of oil&gas assets, the Company estimates its production to vary by about 0.3 KBOE/d for each one-dollar change in the price of the Brent crude oil.\n\nEni's  Refining  &  Marketing  and  Chemical  businesses  are cyclical. Their results are impacted by trends in the supply and demand of oil products and plastic commodities, which are  influenced  by  the  macro-economic  scenario  and  by products  margins.  Generally  speaking,  margins  for  refined and  chemical  products  depend  upon  the  speed  at  which products' prices adjust to reflect movements in oil prices.\n\nAll  these  risks  may  adversely  and  materially  impact  the Group's  results  of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity,  business prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder  returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's share.\n\n## Risks in connection with the war in Ukraine\n\nThe crisis in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine that in February 2022 gave rise to the Russian military invasion and an open conflict on a large scale with violent armed clashes and tragic loss of human lives, constitutes a macroeconomic",

Possible  outcomes  of  this  situation  might  include  a prolonged armed conflict, a possible escalation in the military action,  risks  of  enlargement  of  the  ongoing  geopolitical crisis and a further tightening up of the economic sanctions against  Russia.  These  factors  could  result  in  a  scenario that  could  eventually  sap  consumers'  confidence,  deter investment  decisions  by  operators  and  cripple  industrial activities derailing the global recovery or, in the worst of the outcomes, triggering  a  new  worldwide  recession,  while  the economy has been still recovering from the fallout of the COVID-19 downturn. This scenario would drove a reduction in hydrocarbons demands and of commodity prices and would adversely  and  significantly  affect  our  results  of  operations and cash flow, as well as business prospects, with a possible lower remuneration of our shareholders.\n\nShortly  after  the  outbreak  of  hostilities  with  the  Russian military  invasion  of  Ukraine,  the  European  Union,  the  USA, and the UK imposed a raft of tough economic and financial sanctions  against  Russia,  which  have  added  up  to  those already in force since 2014.\n\nThe  new  restrictions  mainly  targeted  the  Russian  financial sector, precluding access to funding from US and EU-based financial  institutions  and  several  relevant  Russian  entities operating in the Oil & Gas sector. This first round of sanctions waivered the purchase of oil, natural gas and refined products exported by Russian entities, or the maintenance of business relationships  with  certain  Russian  entities.  However,  the situation in the marketplace evolved unexpectedly, as many Western traders, oil companies, refiners and brokers began reducing purchases of crude oil from Russia giving rise to a sort  of  spontaneous,  auto-sanctioning  system.  Finally,  the President  of  the  USA  signed  an  executive  order  to  ban  all imports  of  Russian  energy  products.  Those  developments destabilized  energy  markets  as  evidenced  by  the  material discount of the Ural Russian crude benchmark vs. the Brent above  20  $/bbl,  triggering  a  spike  in  market  volatility  and propelling the Brent price at about 130 $/bbl in the last days of February and into early March 2022. Natural gas prices for the  continental  Europe  spot  benchmark  surged  to  new  alltime highs driven by fears of supply disruptions. If the conflict continues,  it  is  possible  that  increasingly  tight  sanctions could be imposed.\n\nThis volatility is expected to significantly affect the Group's operating expenses and revenues in 2022. Furthermore, the increased volatility could drive: (i) an increased counterparty risk due to the significant expansion of the nominal value of trading receivables.; (ii) a higher level of financial risk of the Company due to the need of increasing the cash deposits to  guarantee  the  settlement  of  derivative  transactions  with financial institutions and commodity exchanges to fulfil the\n\nmargining obligations (margin call). To counter the ongoing phase of extreme volatility in the energy commodities market the  Group  is  planning  to  strengthen  its  financial  headroom by  increasing  the  liquidity  reserves  (cash  on  hands  and committed borrowing facilities).\n\nEni's assets in Russia are immaterial to the Group results and business prospects. Our exploration projects in the Russian Oil & Gas sector have been suspended indefinitely following the previous sanction regime, and the expenditures incurred in relation to those projects in past reporting periods have been written off. Currently, we do not have booked reserves in Russia.\n\nThe Group has announced the intention to divest its interest in the Blue Stream joint operations which manages the gas pipeline  that  transports  natural  gas  produced  in  Russia  to Turkey  through  the  Black  Sea.  Those  volumes  of  gas  are jointly  marketed  by  Eni  and  Gazprom  to  the  Turkish  stateowned company Botas. This divestment is not expected to have a significant effect on the Group consolidated results and  balance  sheet;  the  book  value  of  this  asset  was  \u20ac40 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, the Group has decided  to  cease  signing  new  supply  contracts  of  Russian crude oil. This decision is expected to negatively affect our refining system. In 2021 the purchase of crude oil from Russia represented 18% of the total volumes of crudes traded by Eni to support its refining system.\n\nFinally,  Russian  Oil  &  Gas  companies  are  currently  joint operators  in  certain  upstream  projects  where  we  have a  working  interest.  Every  possible  decision  about  the participation  of  the  Russian  counterparts  to  those  projects are in the power of the state-owned companies of the host countries where such projects are located.\n\nThe  most  important  transactions  that  involve  Russian counterparts relate to the purchase of natural gas from the Russian  state-owned  company  Gazprom,  based  on  longterm supply contracts with take-or-pay clauses. The volumes supplied  from  Russia  represent  a  material  amount  of  our global portfolio of natural gas supplies, being about 43% of the total in 2021 (see table 'Natural gas supply' in the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio operating review). Eni has entered into delivery commitments that rely in part on such supply of natural gas. Although we have access to increased supplies from other geographies in our portfolio and from producing countries  where  we  have  established  relationships,  should supplies  from  Gazprom  and  other  Russian  natural  gas suppliers  be  disrupted  (including  as  a  result  of  sanctions prohibiting  or  restricting  purchases  of  natural  gas  from Russia)  we  may  suffer  adverse  effects  which  we  cannot currently predict or quantify but could be material.",

As  commodity prices  are  beyond  the  Company's  control,  Eni's  ability  to remain  competitive  and  profitable  in  this  environment requires  continuous  focus  on  technological  innovation,  the achievement  of  efficiencies  in  operating  costs,  effective management of capital resources and the ability to provide valuable services to energy buyers. It also depends on Eni's ability to gain access to new investment opportunities. The economic  crisis  caused  by  the  suppression  of  industrial activity and travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic materially and negatively impacted demand for the Company's products, driving a strong increase in the level of competition across all sectors where Eni operates. Eni believes that the pandemic will have enduring effects on the competition within the Oil & Gas sectors, including the refining and marketing of fuels and other energy commodities and the supply of energy products to the retail segment.\n\nIn  the  Exploration  &  Production  segment,  Eni  is  facing competition  from  both  international  and  state-owned  oil companies for obtaining exploration and development rights and developing and applying new technologies to maximise hydrocarbon recovery. Because of its smaller size relative to other international oil companies, Eni may face a competitive disadvantage when bidding for large scale or capital intensive projects and it may be exposed to the risk of obtaining lower cost  savings  in  a  deflationary  environment  compared  to its  larger  competitors  given  its  potentially  smaller  market power  with  respect  to  suppliers,  whereas  in  case  of  rising input costs due to a shortage of materials, labour and other productive  factors  Eni  may  experience  higher  pressure from its suppliers to raise the price of goods and services to the Company compared to Eni's larger competitors. Due to  those  competitive  pressures,  Eni  may  fail  to  obtain  new exploration and development acreage, to apply and develop new  technologies  and  to  control  costs.  The  COVID-19 pandemic has caused Exploration & Production companies to  significantly  reduce  their  capital  investment  in  response to  lower  cash  flows  from  operations  and  to  focus  on  the\n\nmore profitable and scenario-resilient projects. The Company believes that this development will be long-lasting and likely drive increased competition among players to gain access to relatively cheaper reserves (onshore vs. offshore; proven areas vs. unexplored areas).\n\nIn  the  Global  Gas  &  LNG  Portfolio  business,  Eni  is  facing strong  competition  in  the  European  wholesale  markets  to sell  gas  to  industrial  customers,  the  thermoelectric  sector and retail companies from other gas wholesalers, upstream companies,  traders  and  other  players.  The  results  of  Eni's wholesale gas business are affected by global and regional dynamics  of  gas  demand  and  supplies,  as  well  as  by  the constraints of its portfolio of long-term, take-or-pay supply, whereby the Company is obligated to offtake minimum annual volumes of gas or in case of failure to pay the corresponding purchase  price  (see  below).  Due  to  the  competitive  nature of  the  business,  sales  margins  tend  to  be  small.  In  2021, despite  natural  gas  prices  surging  to  record  levels,  our wholesale  margins  were  negatively  affected  by  narrowing spreads between prices at continental hubs, to which our gas procurement costs are indexed, and spot prices for the main Italian benchmark to which our selling prices are indexed. We believe wholesale margins of gas to remain challenged in the medium-term due to competitive pressures and as renewable sources  of  energy  continue  growing  their  market  share  in covering European energy needs.\n\nThe results of the LNG business are mainly influenced by the global  balance  between  demand  and  supplies,  considering the  higher  level  of  flexibility  of  LNG  with  respect  to  gas delivered via pipeline.\n\nIn its Refining & Marketing segment, Eni is facing competition both in the refining business and in the retail marketing of fuels.\n\nEni's  refining  business  has  been  negatively  affected  for many years by structural headwinds due to muted trends in the European demand for fuels, refining overcapacity and continued competitive pressure from players in the Middle East, the United States and Far East Asia. Those competitors can  leverage  on  larger  plant  scale  and  cost  economies, availability of cheaper  feedstock  and  lower  energy expenses. This unfavourable competitive environment has been exacerbated by the economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the negative effects of travel restrictions imposed by governments all over the world to contain the spread of the virus, which were only partially  lifted  during  the  course  of  2021.  The  COVID-19 fallout  has  negatively  affected  Eni's  refining  sector  in  two ways. On one side, the cost of the oil-based feedstock has recovered strongly from the second half of 2020 throughout the whole of 2021 due to effective production management",

On  the  other  side,  the continuing downturn of the civil airline sector due to bans on long-haul flights have left the market of refined products with  huge  imbalances  due  to  a  depressed  demand  for jet  fuel  and  gasoil  oversupplies.  Finally,  in  the  last  part  of 2021 escalating costs of natural gas which is a key input to refining processes added more pressure to an already weak margin backdrop.\n\nAgainst  the  backdrop  of  these  challenged  fundamentals,  in 2021  the  Company's  own  internal  performance  measure  to gauge the profitability of its refineries, the SERM, plunged to historic lows, remaining into negative territory throughout the year and averaging minus 0.9 $/bbl compared to positive 1.7 $/ bbl in 2020. Furthermore, operating expenses were negatively affected by an increase in the cost for the purchase of emission allowances to comply with the requirements of the European ETS,  which  reached  all-time  highs  due  to  a  combination  of macroeconomic  recovery  which  drove  industrial  production and rising coal consumption to fire power generation due to a shortage of gas supplies and cost competitiveness. The cost for emission allowance was on average 53.4 \u20ac/tonn, more than doubling versus 2020; this uptrend has strengthened further in  the  first  months  of  2022  with  the  cost  breaking above 90 \u20ac/tonn.  On  the  basis  of  these  developments  in  the  trading environment, management revised downwardly the projections of refining margins in the short to medium-term, which together with the forecast of higher compliance expenses to purchase carbon  emission  allowances  under  the  European  Emission Trading  Schema  led  to  the  projections  of  materially  lower expected future cash flows associated with the refinery activity driving assets impairment losses of approximately \u20ac0.9 billion. These added to approximately \u20ac2 billion of impairment losses recorded in the previous two reporting periods, writing-off the entire book value of Eni's European refineries.\n\nEni's Chemical business has been facing for years strong competition from well-established international players and state-owned  petrochemical  companies,  particularly  in  the most commoditised market segments such as the production of basic petrochemical products (like polyethylene), where demand is a function of macroeconomic growth. Many of these  competitors  based  in  the  Far  East  and  the  Middle East have been able to benefit from cost economies due to  larger  plant  scale,  wide  geographic  moat,  availability of  cheap  feedstock and proximity to end-markets. Excess worldwide  capacity  of  petrochemical  commodities  has also  fuelled  competition  in  this  business.  Furthermore, petrochemical producers based in the United States have regained market share, as their cost structure has become competitive  due  to  the  availability  of  cheap  feedstock deriving from the production of domestic shale gas from which  ethane  is  derived,  which  is  a  cheaper  raw  material\n\nfor the production of ethylene than the oil-based feedstock utilised  by  Eni's  petrochemical  subsidiaries.  Finally,  it  is likely  rising  public  concern  about  climate  change  and  the preservation  of  the  environment  will  negatively  affect  the consumption of single-use plastics going forward. In 2021 those challenged business fundamentals were mitigated by the post-pandemic strong economic recovery, which drove significant  demands  for  all  kinds  of  plastic  products  and supply disruptions of global reach due to contingent events. These  developments  supported  petrochemical  products margins  and  the  business  performance,  particularly  in the  first  part  of  the  year.  We  expect  products  margins  to normalize  in  the  near  term,  falling  back  to  pre-pandemic levels as more supplies come online.\n\nEni's  retail  gas  and  power  business  engages  in  the  supply of  gas  and  electricity  to  customers  in  the  retail  markets mainly in Italy, France, Spain and other countries in Europe. Customers  include  households,  large  residential  accounts (hospitals,  schools,  public  administration  buildings,  offices) and small and medium-sized businesses. The retail market is characterised  by  strong  competition  among  selling companies  which  mainly  compete  in  terms  of  pricing  and the  ability  to  bundle  valuable  services  with  the  supply  of the  energy  commodity.  In  this  segment,  competition  has intensified in recent years due to the progressive liberalisation of  the  market  and  the  ability  of  residential  customers  to switch smoothly from one supplier to another.\n\nEni  also  engages  in  the  business  of  producing  gas-fired electricity that is largely sold in the wholesale market and in the balancing market ('Mercato dei Servizi di Dispacciamento or  'MSD')  to  the  manager  of  the  national  grid.  As  far  as the  wholesale  market  is  concerned,  margins  of  electricity production  from  gas-fired  plants  ('Clean  Spark  Spread'  or 'CSS')  have  experienced  some  fluctuations  in  recent  years due  to  oversupplies,  weak  economic  growth,  and  inter-fuel competition.  Management  believes  that  these  factors  will progressively  reduce  the  CSS  in  the  future,  whereas  MSD margins have shown higher resilience also in more stressed conditions.\n\nIn case the Company is unable to effectively manage the above  described  competitive  risks,  which  may  increase in  case  of  a  weaker-than-anticipated  recovery  in  the  postpandemic  economy  or  in  a  worst  case  scenario  of  the imposition  by  governments  of  new  lockdown  measures and  other  restrictions  in  response  to  the  pandemic,  the Group's  future  results  of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares may be adversely and significantly affected.",

This has led to a significant increase in Eni's financial risks\n\nIn  the  course  of  the  fourth  quarter  2021,  a  strengthening global macroeconomic recovery has driven pent-up demand for  energy  commodities  across  all  geographies,  against the  backdrop  of  a  challenged  supply  particularly  of  natural gas due to the sharp cuts made by Oil & Gas companies to capital expenditures to navigate the oil downturn, resulting in a very tight market for gas and electricity. Market imbalances have  been  particularly  problematic  in  Europe  because  in addition  to  global  macroeconomic  forces,  the  continent  has faced  regional,  specific  issues.  The  final  months  of  2021 have  been  characterized  by  an  apparent  underperformance of  plants  producing  renewable  electricity,  while  natural  gas storage  levels  were  at  historical  lows  in  correspondence  to the  injection  peak  season  before  the  start  of  the  seasonal increase  in  gas  consumption.  Markets  have  been  also pressured  by  uncertainties  about  the  natural  gas  import flows  from  Russia.  Russia  state-owned  company,  Gazprom has been corresponding to their long-term supply contracts' commitments  with  European  traders,  while  limiting  spot supplies,  against  the  backdrop  of  the  complex  regulatory issue relating to the start-up of line 2 of the Nord Stream gas pipeline,  which  would  considerably  increase  the  natural  gas flow  to  Europe.  Finally,  European  gas  production  have  been decreasing steadily in recent years due to mature field decline, while new developments have been constrained by the climate targets and policies adopted by EU member states.\n\nThose developments triggered an unprecedented volatility in European commodity markets, with spot prices of natural gas and power rising several  hundred  percentage  points  within few months, setting all-times highs (the average spot price of natural gas at the Dutch hub 'TTF' increased by more than 500% in the fourth quarter 2021 vs. 2020).\n\nThe  spike  in  commodity  prices  caused  financial  tensions at  European energy players, like Eni, which are making use of  commodity  forward  sale  contracts  and  commodity financial derivatives to hedge commercial margins or also for speculative objectives due to the requirements of margining payments envisaged by contracts.\n\nFinancial institutions which are the counterparts of derivatives contracts  and  wholesale  and  exchange-based  commodity markets  of  gas,  power  and  other  energy  commodities routinely  require  down  payments  for  traders  to  cover  open liabilities  or  to  settle  derivative  contracts.  Selling  forward future commodity availability (from production or long-term supply contracts) also requires down payments, in favour of\n\nthe buyers as guarantee in case the trader or the producer cannot deliver. These down-payments which amount is linked to the level and volatility of commodity prices are temporarily and they are unwound on delivery of the commodity, with the deposited money flowing back to the traders.\n\nUnder normal market conditions, this way of operating does not  entail  financial  risks.  However,  when  commodity  prices rise  sharply  as  was  the  case  during  the  fourth  quarter  of 2021 with prices increasing many times over the recent few months, the negative value of forward sales at fixed prices and the negative value of short positions grow proportionally and traders are required to deposit extra funds to cover payments tied  to  commodity  forward  sales  and  the  settlement  of derivatives, known as margin calls. Margin calls typically arise when the gap between spot commodity prices and the level at which traders have sold their commodity availability on a forward basis becomes too wide, forcing them to post the margin as proof that they can deliver in the event of default.\n\nDue to the extreme market conditions experienced in the fourth quarter 2021, especially during the month of December, Eni substantially  increased  the  Company's  financial  headroom to cope with the disbursements required by its margin calls. The Group has drawn \u20ac4 billion from its available committed credit  facilities  to  manage  the  critical  market  phase.  The situation  improved somewhat in the final business days of the year due to a sharp correction in commodity prices. The underlying commodity derivatives that triggered the margin calls were accounted at fair value through profit and loss or as cash flow hedges in 2021 accounts.\n\nNotwithstanding the Group retains a liquidity reserve, in case of a prolonged phase of extreme volatility in the commodity markets,  the  Group  may  be  exposed  to  a  financial  risk  of being  unable  to  cover  its  margin  calls  requirements,  which may force the Group to unwind positions at a loss or to sell assets at a discount.\n\nThe  outbreak  of  the  conflict  between  Russia  and  Ukraine triggered a spike in the volatility of commodity prices and this could result in more financial risks to us.\n\n## Safety, security, environmental and other operational risk\n\nThe Group engages in the exploration and production of oil and  natural  gas,  processing,  transportation  and  refining  of crude oil,  transport  of  natural  gas,  storage  and  distribution of petroleum products and the production of base chemicals, plastics,  and  elastomers.  By  their  nature,  the  Group's operations expose Eni to a wide range of significant health, safety,  security,  and  environmental  risks.  Technical  faults, malfunctioning  of  plants,  equipment  and  facilities,  control systems  failure,  human  errors,  acts  of  sabotage,  attacks,",

The magnitude  of  these  risks  is  influenced  by  the  geographic range, operational diversity, and technical complexity of Eni's activities.  Eni's  future  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  and liquidity depend on its ability to identify and address the risks and hazards inherent to operating in those industries.\n\nIn  the  Exploration  &  Production  segment,  Eni  faces  natural hazards and other operational risks including those relating to  the  physical  and  geological  characteristics  of  oil  and natural  gas  fields.  These  include  the  risks  of  eruptions  of crude oil or of natural gas, discovery of hydrocarbon pockets with abnormal pressure, crumbling of well openings, oil spills, gas  leaks,  risks  of  blowout,  fire  or  explosion  and  risks  of earthquake in connection with drilling activities.\n\nEni's  activities  in  the  Refining  &  Marketing  and  Chemical segment entail health, safety and environmental risks related to  the  handling,  transformation  and  distribution  of  oil,  oil products and certain petrochemical products. These risks can arise from the intrinsic characteristics and the overall lifecycle of  the  products  manufactured  and  the  raw  materials  used in  the  manufacturing process, such as oil-based feedstock, catalysts,  additives  and  monomer  feedstock.  These  risks comprise  flammability,  toxicity,  long-term  environmental impact  such  as  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  risks  of various forms of pollution and contamination of the soil and the  groundwater,  emissions  and  discharges  resulting  from their use and from recycling or disposing of materials and wastes at the end of their useful life.\n\nAll of Eni's segments of operations involve, to varying degrees, the  transportation  of  hydrocarbons.  Risks  in  transportation activities  depend  on  several  factors  and  variables,  including the hazardous nature of the products transported due to their flammability and toxicity, the transportation methods utilised (pipelines, shipping, river freight, rail, road and gas distribution networks), the volumes involved and the sensitivity of the regions through which the transport passes (quality of infrastructure, population density, environmental considerations). All modes of transportation of hydrocarbons are particularly susceptible to risks of blowout, fire and loss of containment and, given that normally high volumes are involved, could present significant risks to people, the environment and the property.\n\nEni has  material  offshore  operations  relating  to  the exploration  and  production  of  hydrocarbons.  In  2021, approximately 70% of Eni's total oil and gas production for the year derived from offshore fields, mainly in Egypt, Norway, Libya,  Angola,  Kazakhstan,  Congo,  Indonesia,  the  United\n\nStates,  the  United  Arab  Emirates  and  Venezuela.  Offshore operations  in  the  oil  and  gas  industry  are  inherently  riskier than onshore activities. Offshore accidents and spills could cause damage of catastrophic proportions to the ecosystem and to communities' health and security due to the apparent difficulties  in  handling  hydrocarbons  containment  in  the sea,  pollution,  poisoning  of  water  and  organisms,  length and  complexity  of  cleaning  operations  and  other  factors. Furthermore, offshore operations are subject to marine risks, including storms and other adverse weather conditions and perils of vessel collisions, which may cause material adverse effects on the Group's operations and the ecosystem.\n\nThe  Company  has  invested  and  will  continue  to  invest significant  financial  resources  to  continuously  upgrade  the methods and systems for safeguarding the reliability of its plants,  production  facilities,  vessels,  transport  and  storage infrastructures,  the  safety  and  the  health  of  its  employees, contractors,  local  communities  and  the  environment,  to prevent  risks,  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  policies and  to  respond  to  and  learn  from  unforeseen  incidents. Eni  seeks  to  manage  these  operational  risks  by  carefully designing  and  building  facilities,  including  wells,  industrial complexes,  plants  and  equipment,  pipelines,  storage  sites and other facilities, and managing its operations in a safe and reliable  manner and in compliance with all applicable rules and  regulations,  as  well  as  by  applying  the  best  available techniques  in  the  marketplace.  However,  these  measures may ultimately not be completely successful in preventing and/or altogether eliminating risks of adverse events. Failure to properly manage these risks as well as accidental events like human errors, unexpected system failure, sabotages or other  unexpected  drivers  could  cause  oil  spills,  blowouts, fire, release of toxic gas and pollutants into the atmosphere or  the  environment  or  in  underground  water  and  other incidents, all of which could lead to loss of life, damage to properties,  environmental  pollution,  legal  liabilities  and/or damage claims and consequently a disruption in operations and potential economic losses that could have a material and adverse effect on the Group's results of operations, cash flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\nEni also faces risks once production is discontinued because Eni's  activities  require  the  decommissioning  of  productive infrastructures, well plugging and the environmental remediation and clean-up of industrial hubs and oil and gas fields  once  production  and  manufacturing  activities  cease. Furthermore, in certain situations where Eni is not the operator, the  Company  may  have  limited  influence  and  control  over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Eni retains worldwide third-party liability insurance",

As of the date of this Base Prospectus, maximum compensation allowed under such insurance coverage is equal to $1.2 billion in case of offshore incident and $1.4 billion in case of incident at onshore facilities (refineries). Additionally, the Company may also  activate  further  insurance  coverage  in  case  of  specific capital projects and other industrial initiatives. Management believes  that  its  insurance  coverage  is  in  line  with  industry practice and is enough to cover normal risks in its operations. However,  the  Company  is  not  insured  against  all  potential risks. In the event of a major environmental disaster, such as the incident which occurred at the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico several years ago, Eni's third-party liability insurance would  not  provide  any  material  coverage  and  thus  the Company's liability would far exceed the maximum coverage provided by its insurance. The loss Eni could suffer in case of a disaster of material proportions would depend on all the facts  and  circumstances  of  the  event  and  would  be  subject to a whole range of uncertainties, including legal uncertainty as to the scope of liability for consequential damages, which may include economic damage not directly connected to the disaster. The Company cannot guarantee that it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no guarantee, particularly in the case of a major environmental disaster or industrial accident, that such a loss would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above mentioned risks could have a material and adverse impact on the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition,  and  shareholder  returns,  including  dividends,  the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares and could also damage the Group's reputation.\n\n## Risks deriving from Eni's exposure to weather conditions\n\nSignificant  changes  in  weather  conditions  in  Italy  and  in the rest of Europe from year to year may affect demand for natural gas and some refined products.\n\nIn  colder  years,  demand  for  such  products  is  higher. Accordingly, the results of operations of Eni's businesses engaged in the marketing of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, the Refining & Marketing business, as well as the comparability  of  results  over  different  periods  may  be affected  by  such  changes  in  weather  conditions.  Over recent years, this pattern could have been possibly affected by the rising frequency of weather trends like milder winter or  extreme  weather  events  like  heatwaves  or  unusually cold snaps, which are possible consequences of climate change.\n\n## Risks associated with the exploration and production of oil and natural gas\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and natural gas require high levels of capital expenditures and are subject to natural hazards  and  other  uncertainties,  including  those  relating to  the  physical  characteristics  of  oil  and  gas  fields.  The exploration and production activities are subject to mining risk  and  the  risks  of  cost  overruns  and  delayed  start-up  at the projects to develop and produce hydrocarbons reserves. Those risks could have an adverse, significant impact on Eni's future  growth  prospects,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows, liquidity, and shareholders' returns.\n\nThe production of oil and natural gas is highly regulated and is subject to conditions imposed by governments throughout the  world  in  matters  such  as  the  award  of  exploration  and production leases, the imposition of specific drilling and other work obligations, higher-than-average rates of income taxes, additional royalties and taxes on production, environmental protection  measures,  control  over  the  development  and decommissioning of fields and installations, and restrictions on  production.  A  description  of  the  main  risks  facing  the Company's business in the exploration and production of oil and gas is provided below.\n\n## Exploratory drilling efforts may be unsuccessful\n\nExploration  activities  are  mainly  subject  to  mining  risk,  i.e. the risk of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. The costs of drilling and completing wells have margins of uncertainty, and drilling operations may be unsuccessful because of a large variety of factors, including geological  failure,  unexpected  drilling  conditions,  pressure or  heterogeneities  in  formations,  equipment  failures,  well control (blowouts) and other forms of accidents. A large part of  the  Company  exploratory  drilling  operations  is  located offshore, including in deep and ultra-deep waters, in remote areas and in environmentally-sensitive locations (such as the Barents Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, deep water leases off West Africa,  Indonesia,  the  Mediterranean  Sea  and  the  Caspian Sea). In these locations, the Company generally experiences higher operational risks and more challenging conditions and incurs  higher  exploration  costs  than  onshore.  Furthermore, deep and ultra-deep water operations require significant time before commercial production of discovered reserves can commence, increasing both the operational and the financial risks associated with these activities.\n\nBecause  Eni  plans  to  make  significant  investments  in executing exploration projects, it is likely that the Company will incur significant amounts of dry hole expenses in future years.  Unsuccessful  exploration  activities  and  failure  to discover additional commercial reserves could reduce future production of oil and natural gas, which is highly dependent",

Key  factors  that  may affect the economics of these projects include:\n\n- } the  outcome of  negotiations  with  joint  venture  partners, governments and state-owned companies, suppliers and potential customers to define project terms and conditions, including, for example, Eni's ability to negotiate favourable long-term contracts to market gas reserves;\n- } timely issuance of permits and licenses by government agencies, including obtaining all necessary administrative authorisations to drill locations, install producing infrastructures,  build  pipelines  and  related  equipment  to transport and market hydrocarbons;\n- } the ability to carry out the front-end engineering design in order to prevent the occurrence of technical inconvenience during the execution phase;\n- } timely manufacturing and delivery of critical plants and equipment by contractors, like floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels and platforms. For example, due to adoption of emergency measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, activities have slowed down  at  critical  shipyards  resulting  in  delays  for  the execution of few projects in our portfolio;\n- } risks associated with the use of new technologies and the inability to develop advanced technologies to maximise the recoverability rate of hydrocarbons or gain access to previously inaccessible reservoirs;\n- } delays in the commissioning and hook-up phase;\n- } changes  in  operating  conditions  and  cost  overruns.  We expect  the  prices  of  key  input  factors  such  as  labour, basic  materials  (steel,  cement  and  other  metals)  and utilities  to  increase  meaningfully  in  the  next  year  or  two due  to  rising  inflationary  pressures  rippling  through  the entire  supply  chain  at  our  development  projects  driven by higher worldwide demand for commodities and semifinished goods as well as a shortage of productive factors. However, other input expenses like rental fees of rigs have exhibited less dynamicity due to existence of idle capacity driven by the low level of investments in capital projects in the upstream sector;\n- } the actual performance of the reservoir and natural field decline;\n- } and  the  ability  and  time  necessary  to  build  suitable transport  infrastructures  to  export  production  to  final markets.\n\nDevelopment  projects  normally  have  long  lead  times  due to  complexity  of  the  activities  and  tasks  that  need  to  be performed before a project final investment decision is made and commercial production can be achieved. Those activities include the appraisal of a discovery to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the development project, obtaining the  necessary  authorisations  from  governments,  state agencies or national oil companies, signing agreements with the first party regulating a project's contractual terms such as the production sharing and cost recovery, obtaining partners' approval, environmental permits and other conditions, signing long-term gas contracts, carrying out the concept design and the front-end engineering and building and commissioning the related plants and facilities. All these activities can take years to be finalised. Moreover, projects executed with partners and joint venture partners reduce the ability of the Company to manage risks and costs, and Eni could have limited influence over and control of the operations and performance of its partners.\n\nThe occurrence of any of such risks may negatively affect the time-to-market of the reserves and may cause cost overruns and start-up delays, lengthening the project pay-back period. Those would adversely affect the economic returns of Eni's development  projects  and  the  achievement  of  production growth  targets,  also  considering  that  those  projects  are exposed  to  the  volatility  of  oil  and  gas  prices  which  may be  substantially  different  from  those  estimated  when  the investment  decision  was  made,  thereby  leading  to  lower return rates.\n\nFinally, if the Company is unable to develop and operate major projects  as  planned,  it  could  incur  significant  impairment losses  of  capitalised  costs  associated  with  reduced  future cash flows of those projects.\n\n## Inability  to  replace  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  could adversely  impact  results  of  operations  and  financial condition, including cash flows\n\nIn case the Company's exploration efforts are unsuccessful at  replacing  produced  oil  and  natural  gas,  its  reserves  will decline. In addition to being a function of production, revisions and new discoveries, the Company's reserve replacement is also affected by the entitlement mechanism in its production sharing  agreements  ('PSAs'),  whereby  the  Company  is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The higher the reference prices for Brent crude oil used to estimate Eni's proved reserves, the lower the number of barrels necessary to recover the same amount of expenditure, and vice versa.\n\nFuture oil and gas production is a function of the Company's",

If Eni is unsuccessful in meeting its long-term targets of reserve replacement, Eni's future total proved reserves and production will decline.\n\n## Uncertainties in estimates of oil and natural gas reserves\n\nThe accuracy of proved reserve estimates and of projections of  future  rates  of  production  and  timing  of  development costs depends on several factors, assumptions and variables, including:\n\n- } the quality of available geological, technical and economic data and their interpretation and judgment;\n- } management's assumptions regarding future rates of  production  and  costs  and  timing  of  operating  and development costs. The projections of higher operating and  development  costs  may  impair  the  ability  of  the Company  to  economically  produce  reserves  leading  to downward reserve revisions;\n- } changes  in  the  prevailing  tax  rules,  other  government regulations and contractual terms and conditions;\n- } results  of  drilling,  testing  and  the  actual  production performance  of  Eni's  reservoirs  after  the  date  of  the estimates  which  may  drive  substantial  upward  or downward revisions; and\n- } changes in oil and natural gas prices which could affect the quantities of Eni's proved reserves since the estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs existing as of the date when these estimates are made.\n\nLower  oil  prices  may  impair  the  ability  of  the  Company  to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.\n\nMany of the factors, assumptions and variables underlying the  estimation  of  proved  reserves  involve  management's judgment  or  are  outside  management's  control  (prices, governmental  regulations)  and  may  change  over  time, therefore  affecting  the  estimates  of  oil  and  natural  gas reserves from year-to-year.\n\nThe prices used in calculating Eni's estimated proved reserves are, in accordance with the SEC requirements, calculated by determining  the  unweighted  arithmetic  average  of  the  first day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Accordingly, the estimated reserves reported as of the end of any given year could be significantly different from the  quantities  of  oil  and  natural  gas  that  will  be  ultimately recovered.  Any  downward  revision  in  Eni's  estimated\n\nquantities  of  proved  reserves  would  indicate  lower  future production  volumes,  which  could  adversely  impact  Eni's business  prospects,  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and liquidity.\n\n## The  development  of  the  Group's  proved  undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than it currently anticipates or the Group's proved undeveloped reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 30% of the Group's total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and  successful  drilling  operations.  The  Group's  reserve estimates assume it can and will make these expenditures and conduct  these  operations  successfully.  These  assumptions may not prove to be accurate and are subject to the risk of a structural decline in the prices of hydrocarbons due to a possible  acceleration  towards  a  low  carbon  economy  and a  shift  in  consumers'  behaviour  and  preferences.  In  case of  a  prolonged  decline  in  the  prices  of  hydrocarbon  the Group may not have enough financial resources to make the necessary  expenditures  to  recover  undeveloped  reserves. The Group's reserve report as of December 31, 2021 includes estimates of total future development and decommissioning costs  associated  with  the  Group's  proved  total  reserves of approximately  \u20ac32.2  billion  (undiscounted,  including consolidated  subsidiaries  and  equity-accounted  entities).  It cannot be certain that estimated costs of the development of  these  reserves  will  prove  correct,  development  will  occur as  scheduled,  or  the  results  of  such  development  will  be  as estimated. In case of change in the Company's plans to develop those  reserves,  or  if  it  is  not  otherwise  able  to  successfully develop these reserves as a result of the Group's inability to fund  necessary  capital  expenditures  or  otherwise,  it  will  be required to remove the associated volumes from the Group's reported proved reserves.\n\n## The Oil & Gas industry is a capital-intensive business and needs large amount of funds to find and develop reserves. In case the Group does not have access to sufficient funds its Oil & Gas business may decline\n\nThe  Oil  &  Gas  industry  is  capital  intensive.  Eni  makes  and expects to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in its business  for  the  exploration,  development  and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Over the next four years, the Company plans to invest in the Oil & Gas business approximately \u20ac4.5 billion  per  year  on  average.  Historically, Eni's  capital  expenditures  have  been  financed  with  cash generated from operations, proceeds from asset disposals, borrowings under its credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and bonds. The actual amount and timing",

Eni's cash flows from operations and access to capital markets are subject to several variables, including but not limited to:\n\n- } the amount of Eni's proved reserves;\n- } the volume of crude oil and natural gas Eni is able to produce and sell from existing wells;\n- } the prices at which crude oil and natural gas are sold;\n- } Eni's ability to acquire, find and produce new reserves; and\n- } the ability and willingness of Eni's lenders to extend credit or of participants in the capital markets to invest in Eni's bonds.\n\nIf  revenues  or  Eni's  ability  to  borrow  decrease  significantly due to factors such as a prolonged decline in crude oil and natural gas prices or a more stringent investment framework on  part  of  lenders  and  financing  institutions  due  to  ESG considerations,  Eni  might  have  limited  ability  to  obtain  the capital necessary to sustain its planned capital expenditures. If cash generated by operations, cash from asset disposals, or  cash  available  under  Eni's  liquidity  reserves  or  its  credit facilities  is  not  sufficient  to  meet  capital  requirements, the  failure  to  obtain  additional  financing  could  result  in  a curtailment of operations relating to development of Eni's reserves, which in turn could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows and its ability to achieve its growth plans.  In  addition,  funding  Eni's  capital  expenditures  with additional  debt  will  increase  its  leverage  and  the  issuance of  additional  debt  will  require  a  portion  of  Eni's  cash  flows from operations to be used for the payment of interest and principal on its debt, thereby reducing its ability to use cash flows to fund capital expenditures and dividends.\n\n## Oil & Gas activity may be subject to increasingly high levels of income taxes and royalties\n\nOil & Gas operations are subject to the payment of royalties and income taxes, which tend to be higher than those payable in many other commercial activities. Furthermore, in recent years, Eni has experienced adverse changes in the tax regimes applicable to Oil & Gas operations in a number of countries where  the  Company  conducts  its  upstream  operations.  As a  result  of  these  trends,  management  estimates  that  the tax rate applicable to the Company's Oil & Gas operations is  materially  higher  than  the  Italian  statutory  tax  rate  for corporate profit, which currently stands at 24%. Management believes that the marginal tax rate in the Oil & Gas industry tends to increase in correlation with higher oil prices, which could  make  it  more  difficult  for  Eni  to  translate  higher  oil prices  into  increased  net  profit.  However,  the  Company does not expect that the marginal tax rate will decrease in\n\nresponse to falling oil prices. Adverse changes in the tax rate applicable to the Group's profit before income taxes in its Oil & Gas operations would have a negative impact on Eni's future results of operations and cash flows.\n\nIn the current uncertain financial and economic environment, governments are facing greater pressure on public finances, which may induce them to intervene in the fiscal framework for the Oil & Gas industry, including the risk of increased taxation, windfall taxes, and even nationalisations and expropriations. Due to increasing public concern about rising energy costs in connection with the announcement of strong profits for the year  2021  by  oil  companies,  governments  may  seek  ways to reduce the energy bill by increasing the fiscal take on oil companies,  also  by  enacting  windfall  taxes  on  companies' extra-profits, or by introducing some forms of price controls.\n\nIn  March  2022,  the  Italian  government  enacted  a  windfall tax scheme on domestic extra-profits of energy companies. Considering that further legislative and implementing steps are  required  and  since  the  full  set  of  comparison  data, extending till March 2022, are not fully available,  to date it not feasible  a  reliable  estimation  of  the  possible  impact  which however is expected non-significant at Group level.\n\n## The present value of future net revenues from Eni's proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of Eni's estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves\n\nThe present value of future net revenues from Eni's proved reserves  may  differ  from  the  current  market  value  of  Eni's estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with  the  SEC  rules,  Eni  bases  the  estimated  discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on the 12-month un-weighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than the SEC pricing used in the calculations. Actual future net revenues from crude oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\n- } the actual prices Eni receives for sales of crude oil and natural gas;\n- } the actual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n- } the timing and amount of actual production; and\n- } changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\n\nThe  timing  of  both  Eni's  production  and  its  incurrence  of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and  amount  of  actual  future  net  revenues  from  proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. Additionally, the 10% discount  factor  Eni  uses  when  calculating  discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount",

These risks can limit the Group's access to hydrocarbons reserves or may cause the Group to redesign, curtail or cease its Oil & Gas operations with significant  effects  on  the  Group's  business prospects, results of operations and cash flow.\n\nIn  Italy,  the  activities  of  hydrocarbon  development  and production are performed by oil companies in accordance with concessions granted by the Ministry of Economic Development in agreement with the relevant Region territorially involved in the case of onshore concessions. Concessions are granted for an initial twenty-year term; the concessionaire is entitled to a ten-year extension and then to one or more five-year extensions to  fully  recover  a  field's  reserves  and  investments  on  the condition  that  the  concessionaire  has  fulfilled  all  obligations related to the work program agreed in the original concession award.  In  case  of  delay  in  the  award  of  an  extension,  the original concession remains fully effective until completion of the administrative procedure to grant an extension.\n\nIn February 2022, the Italian government adopted a national plan designed to identify areas that are suitable for carrying out exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons in  the  national  territory  and  offshore  territorial  waters,  in accordance  with  environmental  and  other  sustainability criteria. The granting of new concessions or the extension of existing  ones  must  comply  with  the  plan  criteria.  However, Eni's ongoing development concessions located partially or totally in environmentally-sensitive areas retains their efficacy as far as the analysis of economic costs and benefits of the petroleum initiative proves to yield a net benefit.\n\nEni's future performance depends on its ability to identify and mitigate  the  above-mentioned  risks  and  hazards  which  are inherent to its Oil & Gas business. Failure to properly manage those risks, the Company's underperformance at exploration, development  and  reserve  replacement  activities  or  the occurrence  of  unforeseen  regulatory  risks  may  adversely and materially impact the Group's results of operations, cash\n\nflow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Risks related to political considerations\n\nAs  at  31  December  2021,  80%  of  Eni's  proved  hydrocarbon reserves were located in non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and  Development)  countries,  mainly  in  Africa, where the socio-political framework, the financial system and the macroeconomic outlook are less stable than in the OECD countries.  In  those  non-OECD  countries,  Eni  is  exposed  to  a wide  range  of  political  risks  and  uncertainties,  which  may impair Eni's ability to continue operating economically on a temporary or permanent basis, and Eni's ability to access oil and  gas  reserves.  Particularly,  Eni  faces  risks  in  connection with the following potential issues and risks:\n\n- } socio-political  instability  leading  to  internal  conflicts, revolutions,  establishment  of  non-democratic  regimes, protests,  attacks,  and  other  forms  of  civil  disorder  and unrest,  such  as  strikes,  riots,  sabotage,  acts  of  violence and similar events. These risks could result in disruptions to  economic  activity,  loss  of  output,  plant  closures  and shutdowns, project delays, loss of assets and threats to the security of personnel. They may disrupt financial and commercial markets, including the supply of and pricing for oil and natural gas, and generate greater political and economic instability in some of the geographical areas in which Eni operates. Additionally, any possible reprisals because  of  military  or  other  action,  such  as  acts  of terrorism in Europe, the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on the world economy and hence on the global demand for hydrocarbons;\n- } lack  of  well-established  and  reliable  legal  systems  and uncertainties surrounding the enforcement of contractual rights;\n- } unfavourable  enforcement  of  laws,  regulations  and contractual arrangements  leading, for example, to expropriation,  nationalisation  or  forced  divestiture  of assets  and  unilateral  cancellation  or  modification  of contractual terms;\n- } sovereign  default  or  financial  instability  due  to  the  fact that those countries rely heavily on petroleum revenues to  sustain  public  finance  and  petroleum  revenues  have materially contracted in 2020 due plunging hydrocarbons prices  as  a  consequence  of  the  global  economic  crisis caused  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Financial  difficulties at country level often translate into failure by state-owned companies and agencies to fulfil their financial obligations towards  Eni  relating  to  funding  capital  commitments  in projects operated by Eni or to timely paying for supplies of equity oil and gas volumes;\n- } restrictions  on  exploration,  production,  imports  and exports;",

The  social  and  political  instability  of  the Country dates back to the revolution of 2011 that brought a change of regime and a civil war, triggering an uninterrupted period of lack of well-established institutions and recurrent events  of  internal  conflict,  clashes,  disorders  and  other forms of civil turmoil and unrest between the two conflicting factions. In the year of the revolution, Eni's operations in Libya were  materially  affected  by  a  full-scale  war,  which  forced the  Company to shut down its development and extractive activities  for  almost  all  of  2011,  with  a  significant  negative impact on the Group's results of operation and cash flow. In subsequent years, Eni has experienced frequent disruptions to its operations, albeit on a smaller scale than in 2011, due to  security  threats  to  its  installations  and  personnel.  The situation begun to improve in September 2020, thanks to a peace  agreement  between  the  conflicting  factions,  which enabled full resumption of operations at all Libyan oilfields, revoking force majeure declared at the start of 2020. In 2021, Eni's production in Libya amounted to 168 kboe/d and was in line with management's plans. Despite this, management believes  that  Libya's  geopolitical  situation  will  continue  to represent a source of risk and uncertainty to Eni's operations in the country and to the Group's results of operations and cash flow.  Currently,  Libyan  production  represents  approximately 10%  of  the  Group's  total  production;  this  percentage  is forecasted to decrease in the medium-term in line with the expected implementation of the Group's strategy intended to diversify the Group's geographical presence to better balance the geopolitical risk of the portfolio by expanding the Group's presence in the United Arabian Emirates and Norway.\n\nVenezuela  is  currently  experiencing  a  situation  of  financial stress,  which  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  economic recession caused by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack  of  financial  resources  to  support  the  development  of the country's hydrocarbons reserves has negatively affected the  country's  production  levels  and  hence  fiscal  revenues. The situation has been made worse by certain international sanctions  targeting  the  country's  financial  system  and  its ability to export crude oil to U.S. markets, which is the main outlet of Venezuelan production.\n\nCurrently, the Company retains only one asset in Venezuela: the 50%-participated Card\u00f3n IV joint venture, which is operating\n\nan offshore natural gas field and is supplying its production to  the  national  oil  company,  Petroleos  de  Venezuela  SA ('PDVSA'), under a long-term supply agreement. PDVSA has failed to pay regularly the receivables for the gas volumes supplied by Card\u00f3n IV and consequently a significant amount of overdue receivables is outstanding at the closing date of the financial year 2021 and a credit loss provision has been booked to reflect the counterparty risk. The Company incurred in past years significant impairment losses and reserves debookings at the other main project in Venezuela relating to the  PetroJun\u00edn  onshore  oilfield;  the  residual  book  value  of the property was completely written off in 2021 due to lack of any prospects of economic returns. As at December 31, 2021, Eni's invested capital in Venezuela was approximately \u20ac1.3  billion,  mainly  relating  to  trade  receivable  owed  to  us by PDVSA for the supplies of volumes of equity natural gas produced by the Card\u00f3n IV joint venture. Due to a tightening of  the  international  sanction  regime,  during  the  course  of 2021, Eni was unable to obtain any in-kind reimbursement of its outstanding trade receivables owed by PDVSA.\n\nThe Group has significant credit exposure to state-owned and privately-held local companies in Nigeria, where the financial and economic outlook of the country has been made worse by the contraction of petroleum revenues due to the crisis of the oil sector in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Eni's credit exposure amounting to about \u20ac0.7 billion relates to the funding of the share of capital expenditures pertaining to Nigerian joint operators at Eni-operated oil projects. Eni has incurred significant credit losses because of the ongoing difficulties  of  Eni's  Nigerian  counterparts  to  reimburse amounts past due.\n\nIn Nigeria, the Oil Prospecting License 245 held by Eni expired in May 2021 and a request is pending to convert the license into an oil mining license to start reserve development before the Nigerian authorities in charge. The management believes the request of conversion complies with the contractual terms, deadline, and any other applicable conditions. However, the Nigerian  authorities  are  holding  back  the  approval.  Eni  has started an arbitration before an ICSID court to preserve the value of its asset.\n\n## Sanction targets\n\nThe most relevant sanction programs for Eni are those issued by the European Union and the United States of America and in particular, as of today, the restrictive measures adopted by such authorities in respect of Russia and Venezuela.\n\nIn response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis of 2014 and again to  the  Russia  invasion  of  Ukraine  of  February  2022,  the European  Union  and  the  United  States  have  enacted  a broad regime of sanctions targeting, inter alia, the financial",

In  response to  these  restrictions,  the  Company  has  put  on  hold  its projects  in  the  upstream  sectors  in  Russia  in  past  years and currently is not engaged in any Oil & Gas project in the country. It is not possible to rule out the possibility that wider sanctions targeting the Russian energy, banking and/ or  finance  industries  be  implemented.  Further  sanctions imposed on Russia, Russian citizens or Russian companies by  the  international  community,  such  as  restrictions  on purchases  of  Russian  gas  by  European  companies  or measures restricting dealings with Russian counterparties, could adversely impact Eni's business, results of operations and cash flow given Eni's exposure to natural gas supplies from Russia as further described in the risk factor on the Russia  Ukraine  war  above.  Furthermore,  an  escalation  of the international crisis, resulting in a tightening of sanctions, could entail a significant disruption of energy supply and trade  flows  globally,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse effect on the Group's business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFrom  2017,  the  United  States  have  enacted  a  regime  of economic  and  financial  sanctions  against  Venezuela.  The scope  of  the  restrictions,  initially  targeting  certain  financial instruments issued or sold by the Government of Venezuela, was gradually expanded over 2017 and 2018 and then significantly broadened during the course of 2019 when PDVSA, the main national  state-owned  enterprise,  has  been  added  to  the 'Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List' and the Venezuelan government and its controlled entities became subject to assets freeze in the United States. Even if such U.S. sanctions are substantially 'primary' and therefore dedicated in principle to U.S. persons only, retaliatory measures and other adverse consequences may also interest foreign entities which operate with Venezuelan listed entities and/or in the oil sector of the country. The U.S. sanction regime against Venezuela has been further tightened in the final part of 2020 by restricting any Venezuelan oil exports, including swap schemes utilised by foreign entities to recover trade and financing receivables from PDVSA and other Venezuelan counterparties. This latter tightening of the sanction regime has reduced the Group's ability to collect the trade receivable owed to Eni for its activity in the country in the course of 2021.\n\nEni carefully evaluates on a case by case basis the adoption of adequate measures to minimise its exposure to any sanctions risk which may affect its business operation. In any case, the U.S. sanctions add stress to the already complex financial, political and operating outlook of the country, which could further limit the ability of Eni to recover its investments in Venezuela.\n\n## 2  RISKS SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY'S GAS BUSINESS IN ITALY\n\nCurrent, negative trends in the gas competitive environment in Europe may impair the Company's ability to fulfil its minimum off-take obligations in connection with its take-or-pay, long-term gas supply contracts\n\nEni  is  currently  party  to  a  few  long-term  gas  supply contracts  with  state-owned  companies  of  key  producing countries, from where most of the gas supplies directed to Europe are sourced via pipeline (Russia, Algeria, Libya and Norway). These contracts which were intended to support Eni's  sales  plan  in  Italy  and  in  other  European  markets, provide take-or-pay clauses whereby the Company has an obligation to lift minimum, pre-set volumes of gas in each year of the contractual term or, in case of failure, to pay the whole  price,  or  a  fraction  of  that  price,  up  to  a  minimum contractual  quantity.  Similar  considerations  apply  to  shipor-pay  contractual  obligations  which  arise  from  contracts with  pipeline  owners,  which  the  Company  has  entered into  to  secure  long-term  transport  capacity.  Long-term gas supply contracts with take-or-pay clauses expose the Company  to  a  volume  risk,  as  the  Company  is  obligated to purchase an annual minimum volume of gas, or in case of failure, to pay the underlying price. The structure of the Company's portfolio of gas supply contracts is a risk to the profitability  outlook  of  Eni's  wholesale  gas  business  due to the current competitive dynamics in the European gas markets. In past downturns of the gas sector, the Company incurred significant cash outflows in response to its takeor-pay obligations. Furthermore, the Company's wholesale business  is  exposed  to  volatile  spreads  between  the procurement costs of gas, which are linked to spot prices at European hubs or to the price of crude oil, and the selling prices of gas which are mainly indexed to spot prices at the Italian hub.\n\nEni's  management  is  planning  to  continue  its  strategy of  renegotiating  the  Company's  long-term  gas  supply contracts  in  order  to  constantly  align  pricing  terms  to current  market  conditions  as  they  evolve  and  to  obtain greater  operational  flexibility  to  better  manage  the  takeor-pay  obligations  (volumes  and  delivery  points  among others), considering the risk factors described above. The revision clauses included in these contracts state the right of  each  counterparty  to  renegotiate  the  economic  terms and other contractual conditions periodically, in relation to ongoing changes in the gas scenario. Management believes that the outcome of those renegotiations is uncertain in respect of both the amount of the economic benefits that will be ultimately obtained and the timing of recognition of profit.  Furthermore,  in  case  Eni  and  the  gas  suppliers  fail to  agree  on  revised  contractual  terms,  both  parties  can",

All  these  possible  developments  within  the renegotiation process could increase the level of risks and uncertainties relating the outcome of those renegotiations.\n\n## Risks  associated  with  the  regulatory  powers  entrusted to the Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and Environment in the matter of pricing to residential customers\n\nEni's wholesale gas and retail gas and power businesses are subject to regulatory risks mainly in Italy's domestic market. The Italian  Regulatory  Authority  for  Energy,  Networks  and Environment  (the  'Authority')  is  entrusted  with  certain powers  in  the  matter  of  natural  gas  and  power  pricing. Specifically,  the  Authority  retains  a  surveillance  power  on pricing  in  the  natural  gas  market  in  Italy  and  the  power to establish selling tariffs for the supply of natural gas to residential  and  commercial  users  until  the  market  is  fully opened. Developments in the regulatory framework intended to increase the level of market liquidity or of deregulation or intended to reduce operators' ability to transfer to customers cost increases in raw materials may negatively affect future sales  margins  of  gas  and  electricity,  operating  results and  cash  flow.  In  the  current  environment  characterized by  rising  energy  costs,  it  is  increasingly  possible  that  the Authority may enact measures intended to put a cap on the wholesale prices of natural gas and electricity or to reduce the  indexation  of  the  cost  of  the  raw  materials  in  pricing formulae  applied  by  retail  companies  that  market  natural gas  and  electricity  to  residential  customers.  Our  GGP business that engages in the wholesale marketing of natural gas and our Plenitude subsidiary that engages in the retail marketing of natural gas and electricity are exposed to this regulatory risk.\n\n## 3  RISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS AND LEGAL RISKS\n\nEni has incurred in the past, and will continue incurring, material  operating  expenses  and  expenditures,  and  is exposed to business risk in relation to compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety regulations in future years, including compliance with any national or  international  regulation  on  greenhouse  gas  (GHG) emissions\n\nEni  is  subject  to  numerous  European  Union,  international, national, regional and local laws and regulations regarding the impact of its operations on the environment and on health and  safety  of  employees,  contractors,  communities  and on the value of properties. Laws and regulations intended to preserve the environment and to safeguard health and\n\nsafety  of  workers  and  communities  are  particularly  strict in the Company's businesses due to their inherent nature because of flammability and toxicity of hydrocarbons and of objective risks of industrial processes to develop, extract, refine and transport oil, gas and products. Generally, these laws and regulations require acquisition of a permit before drilling for hydrocarbons may commence, restrict the types, quantities  and  concentration  of  various  substances  that can  be  released  into  the  environment  in  connection  with exploration,  drilling  and  production  activities,  including refinery and petrochemical plant operations, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected areas, require to remove and dismantle drilling platforms and other equipment and well  plug-in  once  oil  and  gas  operations  have  terminated, provide for measures to be taken to protect the safety of the workplace, the health of employees, contractors and other Company collaborators and of communities involved by the Company's activities, and impose criminal or civil liabilities for  polluting  the  environment  or  harming  employees'  or communities' health and safety as result from the Group's operations. These laws and regulations control the emission of scrap substances and pollutants, discipline the handling of  hazardous  materials  and  set  limits  to  or  prohibit  the discharge  of  soil,  water  or  groundwater  contaminants, emissions of toxic gases and other air pollutants or can impose taxes on carbon dioxide emissions, as in the case of the European Trading Scheme that requires the payment of  a  tax  for  each  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emitted  in  the environment above a pre-set allowance, resulting from the operation of oil and natural gas extraction and processing plants,  petrochemical  plants,  refineries,  service  stations, vessels,  oil  carriers,  pipeline  systems  and  other  facilities owned or operated by Eni.\n\nIn addition, Eni's operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to the production, handling, transportation, storage, disposal and treatment of waste. Breaches of environmental, health  and  safety  laws  and  regulations  as  in  the  case  of negligent or wilful release of pollutants and contaminants into  the  atmosphere,  the  soil,  water  or  groundwater  or exceeding  the  concentration  thresholds  of  contaminants set  by  the  law  expose  the  Company  to  the  incurrence  of liabilities associated with compensation for environmental, health or safety damage and expenses for environmental remediation  and  clean-up.  Furthermore,  in  the  case  of violation  of  certain  rules  regarding  the  safeguard  of  the environment and the health of employees, contractors and other  collaborators  of  the  Company,  and  of  communities, the  Company  may  incur  liabilities  in  connection  with  the negligent or wilful violation of laws by its employees as per Italian Law Decree no. 231/2001.\n\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations have a substantial impact on Eni's operations.

If  any  of  the  risks  set  out  above  materialise,  they  could adversely  impact  the  Group's  results  of  operations,  cash flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Climate change-related risks\n\nIncreasing worldwide efforts to tackle climate change may lead to the adoption of stricter regulations to curb carbon emissions and this may end up suppressing demands for our products in medium-to-long-term\n\nGovernments  of  the  nations  that  have  signed  the  2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement have been advancing plans and initiatives intended to transition the economy towards a low carbon model in the long run to pursue the objective to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and  tackle  risks  of  structural  modifications  to  the  Earth climate, which would pose serious threat to life on the planet. The scientific community has been sounding alarms over\n\nthe potential, catastrophic consequences caused by rising global temperatures to the environment and has established that the release in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a result of burning fossil fuels and other human activities and the emissions of other harmful gases like methane are the main drivers of climate change. The rising in frequency and  dangerousness  of  many  extreme  weather  events has  been  widely  recognized  as  a  direct  consequence  of the  climate  change  such  as  floods,  drought,  hurricanes, heat  waves,  cold  snaps,  rising  sea  levels,  fires  and  other environmental mutations, which have been causing material damage to economies, loss of human lives and destruction of  ecosystems  and  other  negative  impacts.  The  energy transition, as well as increasingly stricter regulations in the field of CO 2 emission, could adversely and materially affect demands for the Group's products and hence our business, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe dramatic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity and people's lifestyle could have possibly accelerated the evolution toward a low carbon model of development. This is because many governments and the EU deployed massive amounts of resources to help the economy recover and a large part of this economic stimulus has been or is planned to be directed to help transitioning the economy and the energy mix towards a low carbon model, as in the case of the EU's recovery fund,  which  provides  for  huge  investments  in  the  sector  of renewable energies and the green economy, including largescale adoption of hydrogen as a new energy source.\n\nThose risks may emerge in the short, medium and long-term.\n\nEni expects that the achievement of the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the rise in temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels in this century, or the more ambitious goal of limiting  global  warming  to  1.5\u00b0C,  will  strengthen  the  global response to the issue of climate change and spur governments to introduce measures and policies targeting the reduction of GHG emissions, which are expected to bring about a gradual reduction in the use of fossil fuels over the medium-to-longterm,  notably  through  the  diversification  of  the  energy  mix, likely  reducing  local  demand  for  fossil  fuels  and  negatively affecting global demand for oil and natural gas.\n\nAlthough the Company is investing a significant amount of resources  to  develop  decarbonized  products  and  to  grow the  generation  capacity  of  renewable  power  and  other  low and zero  carbon  technologies  to  produce  power  or  absorb carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 )  from  the  atmosphere,  the  Group's financial performance and business prospects still depends in  a  substantial  way  on  the  legacy  business  of  Exploration &  Production.  In  case  demands  for  hydrocarbons  decline rapidly  due  to  widespread  adoption  of  regulations,  rules  or",

Some governments have already introduced carbon pricing schemes, which can be an effective measure to reduce GHG emissions at the lowest overall cost to society. Currently, about half of the direct GHG emissions coming from Eni's operated assets are included in national or  supranational  Carbon  Pricing  Mechanisms,  such  as  the European  Emission  Trading  Scheme  (ETS),  which  provides an  obligation  to  purchase,  on  the  open  market,  emission allowances in case GHG emissions exceed a pre-set amount of emission allowances allotted for free. In 2021 to comply with  this  carbon  emissions  scheme,  Eni  purchased  on  the open  market  allowances  corresponding  to  12.42  million tonnes  of  CO 2 emissions  incurring  expenses  of    around \u20ac660  million,  which  were  significantly  higher  than  in  2020 due  to  expectations  of  lower  allotment  of  free  allowances by the EU going forward and rising costs of the emissions permits. Due to the likelihood of new regulations in this area and expectations of a reduction in free allowances under the European ETS and the likely adoption of similar schemes by a rising number of governments, Eni is aware of the risk that a growing share of the Group's GHG emissions could be subject to carbon-pricing and other forms of climate regulation in the  near  future,  leading  to  additional  compliance  and  cost obligations  with  respect  to  the  release  in  the  atmosphere of  carbon  dioxide.  In  the  future,  we  could  incur  increased investments  and  significantly  higher  operating  expenses  in case the Company is unable to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations. Eni also expects that governments will require companies to apply technical measures to reduce their GHG emissions.\n\nOur portfolio of Oil & Gas properties features a large weight of natural gas, the least GHG-emitting fossil energy source. As  of  December  31,  2021,  natural  gas  proved  reserves represented approximately 51% of Eni's total proved reserves of its subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures. The other constituencies of our portfolio of Oil & Gas properties which are mitigating the risk of stranded assets are the large weight of  conventional  projects,  featuring  low  CO 2 intensity  and the low Brent price of breakeven. We estimate our reserves to have an average breakeven price of about 20 $/bbl (this estimation  includes  our  proved  reserves  and  a  certain amount  of  unproved  reserves),  thus  underpinning  a  rapid pay-back  period  as  about  90%  of  the  net  present  value  of those reserves (corresponding to 78% of the underlying boe) is estimated to be recovered by 2035 under the Eni pricing scenario assumptions.\n\nThe  low  breakeven  price  of  our  reserves  has  been  driven by  our  exploration  and  development  model  that  features: effective exploration concentrated on near-field and proven/mature plays to leverage on existing infrastructures and  readily  put  new  reserves  into  production;  selected exploration  in  risky  areas;  a  focus  on  low-complexity developments; and a phased approach to putting reserves into  production  featuring  early  production  start-up  and subsequent  ramp  up  to  reduce  the  financial  exposure  of development  projects  and  accelerate  the  time-to-market and the pay-back period. Based on those drivers, we have gradually reduced the breakeven price of our reserves and improved  the  resilience  to  low  carbon  scenarios,  which considering  also  the  emissive  profiles  of  our  assets  are expected  to  mitigate  the  risk  of  stranded  reserves  going forward. The risk of stranded assets might emerge in case of a structural decline in hydrocarbons demands because of stricter global environmental constraints and regulations and changing consumers' preferences resulting in trends like the mass adoption of electric vehicles or a lower weight of hydrocarbons in the energy mix, or regulatory constraints like a global adoption of carbon pricing schemes.\n\nEni's  portfolio  exposure  to  this  risk  is  reviewed  annually against changing GHG  regulatory regimes, evolving consumers' preferences,  technological  developments,  and physical conditions to identify emerging risks. To test the resilience  of  new  capital  projects,  Eni  assesses  potential costs  associated  with  GHG  emissions  and  how  projects' returns  may  be  affected.  The  development  process  and internal authorization procedures of each E&P capital project feature several checks that may require additional and well detailed  GHG  and  energy  management  plans  to  address potential risks of underperformance in relation to possible scenarios  of  global  or  regional  adoption  of  regulations introducing  mechanisms  of  carbon  cap  and  trade  or carbon pricing. These processes and internal authorization hurdles can lead to projects being stopped, designs being changed, and potential GHG mitigation investments being identified, in preparation for when the economic conditions imposed by new regulations would make these investments commercially compelling.\n\nManagement  stress-tested  the  recoverability  of  the  book values  of  the  Company's  Oil  &  Gas  assets  under  the assumptions set forth in the IEA SDS WEO 2021 and also the  IEA  Net  Zero  'NZE  2050'  scenarios  to  evaluate  the reasonableness of the outcome of the impairment review of those assets under the base case management scenario as well as possible risks of stranded assets. Those stress tests  covered the whole of the Oil & Gas cash generating units  (CGUs)  that  are  regularly  tested  for  impairment  in accordance with IAS 36. The IEA SDS sets out an energy",

The automotive industry is investing material amounts of resources to upgrade its assembly line to ramp up production of electric vehicles (EVs) and to boost the EVs line-up, with R&D efforts focused on reducing the performance and cost gap with the internal-combustion-engine cars and light-duty vehicles, particularly by extending batteries range. The EV market has attracted large amounts of venture capital and financing,  which  have  propelled  the  growth  of  an  entirely new batch of pure-EV players, which are introducing smart EV models to gain consumers preference and market share, fuelling continuing innovation in the sector and accelerating the strategic shift of well-established car companies. Sales of  EVs  have  grown  exponentially  in  2021,  also  thanks  to fiscal incentives designed to increase the affordability of\n\nEVs by middle and low-income households, and according to  market  projections  sales  of  EVs  will  surpass  internalcombustion-engine sales by 2030 also helped by proposed measures to be introduced by states and local administration to ban sales of new internal-combustion-engine cars. This trend  could  disrupt  in  the  long-term  the  consumption  of gasoline which is one of the main drivers of global crude oil demand.  Other  potentially  disruptive  technologies designated to produce clean energy and fuels are emerging, driven by the development of hydrogen-based solutions as an energy vector or the utilization of renewables feedstock to manufacture fuels and other goods replacing oil-based products.  Production  of  hydrogen  by  means  of  green technologies will also reduce hydrocarbons demands. The electricity generation from wind power or solar technologies is projected to grow massively in line with the stated targets by several governments and institutions like the EU, the USA and the UK to decarbonize the electricity sector in the next one or two decades, replacing gas-fired generation.\n\nThese trends could disrupt demand for hydrocarbons in the future,  with  many  forecasters,  both  within  the  industry,  or state agencies and independent observers predicting peak oil demand in the next ten years or earlier; some operators still consider 2019 as the peak year for oil demand.",

If existing or future laws, regulations,  treaties,  or  international  agreements  related to  GHG  and  climate  change,  including  state  incentives to  conserve  energy  or  use  alternative  energy  sources, technological  breakthroughs  in  the  field  of  renewable energies, hydrogen, production of nuclear energy or mass adoption of electric vehicles trigger a structural decline in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, Eni's results of operations and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Supranational institutions, like the United Nations, civil society  and  the  scientific  community  are  calling  for bold action to tackle climate change and this may lead governments to take extraordinary measures to cut carbon emissions\n\nThe United Nations, representatives from the civil society,  some  Non-Governmental  Organizations  ('NGO'), international  institutions  and  the  scientific  community have  become  increasingly  vocal  about  the  dramatic consequences of climate change for the life on the planet, warning about irreversible damages to the ecosystem and calling for drastic and immediate actions by governments to tackle the emergency. In a report issued on May 18, 2021 the International Energy Agency has claimed that to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and commitments set out in  the  Paris  Agreement,  there  must  be  an  immediate  ban on investments in new oil and gas projects. In response to those  requests  for  intervention,  it  is  possible  that  certain governments in  jurisdictions  where  we  operate  may  deny permissions to start new oil and gas projects or may impose further  restrictions  on  drilling  and  other  field  activities or  ban  Oil  &  Gas  operations  altogether.  These  possible developments could significantly and negatively affect our business's prospects and results of operations.\n\n## We are exposed to growing legal risks in connection with the hundreds of lawsuits pending in various jurisdictions against  Oil  &  Gas  companies  claiming  compensation for  damages  associated  with  climate  change  or  other restrictive measures\n\nIn  May  2021,  a  Dutch  court  ordered  Royal  Dutch  Shell Plc to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by a certain amount by 2030 upholding requests of the claimants Dutch environmentalist  associations,  arguing  that  the  Company had  violated  human  rights  and  an  unwritten  principle  of duty of care towards the environment. This sentence could pave  the  way  for  additional  lawsuits  against  Oil  &  Gas companies  or  influence  the  outcome  of  already  pending similar proceedings.\n\nIn some countries, governments, regulators, organizations,\n\nNGOs and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold Oil & Gas companies liable for costs associated with climate change. For example, we are defending in California against claims of damage compensation from local administrations and certain associations of individuals in connection with alleged consequences of climate change which could have disrupted economic activities and caused damage to the environment.\n\nThere are also risks that governments, regulators, organizations, NGOs and individuals may sue us for alleged crimes against the environment in connection with past and present GHG emissions related to our operations and the use of the products we have manufactured.\n\nIn  case  the  Company  is  condemned  to  reduce  its  GHG emissions at a much faster rate than planned by management or to compensate for damage related to climate change as a result of these ongoing or potential lawsuits, we could incur a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business's prospects.\n\n## Asset managers, banks and other financing institutions have  been  increasingly  adopting  ESG  criteria  in  their investment and financing decisions and this could reduce the attractiveness of our share or limit our ability to access the capital markets\n\nMany  professional  investors  like  asset  managers,  mutual funds,  global  allocation  funds,  generalist  investors  and pensions  funds  have  been  reducing  their  exposure  to the  fossil  fuel  industry  due  to  the  adoption  of  stricter ESG  criteria  in  selecting  investing  opportunities.  In  some cases, those funds have adopted climate change targets in determining their policies of asset allocations. Many of them have announced plans to completely divest from the fossil fuel  industry.  This  trend  could  reduce  the  market  for  our share and negatively affect shareholders' returns. Likewise, professional  investors,  banks,  financing  institutions  and also insurance companies are cutting exposure to the fossil fuel industry due to the need to comply with ESG mandate or to reach emission reduction targets in their portfolios and  this  could  limit  our  ability  to  access  new  financing, could drive a rise in borrowing costs to us or increase the costs  of  insuring  our  assets.  During  COP  26  at  Glasgow (UK),  450 financial institutions, mostly banks and pension funds, in 45 countries with assets estimated at $130 trillion have committed to limiting greenhouse gas emissions in their portfolios. The finance pledge, known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), will mean that by 2050 all the assets under management by the institutions that signed on can be counted toward a net-zero emission pathway.  However,  this  pledge  does  not  preclude  the continued funding of fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.",

Similar resolutions were also approved at other U.S. Oil & Gas companies.\n\nMeanwhile, an activist hedge fund conducted a successful proxy fight at ExxonMobil and won a few seats in its board of  directors. This  will  likely  lead  to  greater  scrutiny  of  the company  strategies  and  capital  allocation  plans  by  the board.\n\nThese events underscore the growing pressure from investors and capital markets on Oil & Gas companies towards a future based  on  renewables  energies  and  an  acceleration  in  the phase-out of investments into fossil fuels. We believe that our company is exposed to that kind of risk.\n\n## Extreme  weather  phenomena,  which  has  been  widely recognized as a direct consequence of climate change, may disrupt our operations\n\nThe  scientific  community  has  concluded  that  increasing global average temperature produces significant physical effects,  such  as  the  increased  frequency  and  severity  of hurricanes,  storms,  droughts,  floods,  or  other  extreme climatic events that could interfere with Eni's operations and damage Eni's facilities. Extreme and unpredictable weather phenomena  can  result  in  material  disruption  to  Eni's operations, and consequent loss of or damage to properties and facilities, as well as a loss of output, loss of revenues, increasing maintenance and repair expenses and cash flow shortfall.\n\n## We are exposed to reputational risks in connection with the public perception of Oil & Gas companies as entities primarily responsible for the climate change\n\nThere  is  a  reputational  risk  linked  to  the  fact  that  oil companies  are  increasingly  perceived  by  governments, financial  institutions  and  the  general  public  as  entities primarily responsible for global warming  due  to\n\nGHG  emissions  across  the  hydrocarbon  value  chain, particularly  related  to  the  use  of  energy  products,  and as poorly-performing players alongside ESG dimensions. This could possibly impair the company reputation and the social license to operate. This could also make Eni's shares  and  debt  instruments  less  attractive  to  banks, funds and individual investors who have been increasingly applying ESG criteria and have been growing cautions in assessing the risk profile of oil and gas companies due to  their  carbon  footprint  when  making  investment  and lending decisions.\n\nAs a result of these trends, climate-related risks could have a  material  and  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  results  of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of  funds  available  for  stock  repurchases  and  the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Eni  is  exposed  to  the  risk  of  material  environmental liabilities in addition to the provisions already accrued in the consolidated financial statement\n\nEni has incurred in the past and may incur in the future material  environmental  liabilities  in  connection  with  the environmental  impact  of  its  past  and  present  industrial activities. Eni is also exposed to claims under environmental requirements and, from time to time, such claims have been made  against  it.  Furthermore,  environmental  regulations in Italy and elsewhere typically impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations Eni could be exposed to liability for clean-up and remediation costs, environmental damage, and other damages as a result of Eni's conduct of operations that was lawful at the time it occurred or of the conduct of prior operators or other third parties. In addition, plaintiffs  may  seek  to  obtain  compensation  for  damage resulting  from  events  of  contamination  and  pollution  or in case the Company is found liable for violations of any environmental laws or regulations. In Italy, Eni is exposed to  the  risk  of  expenses  and  environmental  liabilities  in connection with the impact of its past activities at certain industrial hubs where the Group's products were produced, processed,  stored,  distributed  or  sold,  such  as  chemical plants,  mineral-metallurgic  plants,  refineries  and  other facilities, which were subsequently disposed of, liquidated, closed  or  shut  down.  At  these  industrial  hubs,  Eni  has undertaken  several  initiatives  to  remediate  and  clean up  proprietary  or  concession  areas  that  were  allegedly contaminated  and  polluted  by  the  Group's  industrial activities.  State  or  local  public  administrations  have  sued Eni for environmental and other damages and for cleanup  and  remediation  measures  in  addition  to  those  which were  performed  by  the  Company,  or  which  the  Company has committed to performing. In some cases, Eni has been sued for alleged breach of criminal laws (for example for",

        "page_content": "alleged  environmental  crimes  such  as  failure  to  perform soil  or  groundwater  reclamation,  environmental  disaster and contamination, discharge of toxic materials, amongst others). Although Eni believes that it may not be held liable for having exceeded in the past pollution thresholds that are unlawful according to current regulations but were allowed by  laws  then  effective,  or  because  the  Group  took  over operations from third parties, it cannot be excluded that Eni could potentially incur such environmental liabilities. Eni's financial statements account for provisions relating to the costs to be incurred with respect to clean ups and remediation of contaminated areas and groundwater for which legal or constructive obligations exist and the associated costs can be  reasonably  estimated  in  a  reliable  manner,  regardless of any previous liability attributable to other parties. The accrued amounts represent management's best estimates of the Company's existing liabilities. Management believes that it is possible that in the future Eni may incur significant or material  environmental  expenses  and  liabilities  in addition  to  the  amounts  already  accrued  due  to:  (i)  the likelihood of as yet unknown contamination; (ii) the results of  ongoing  surveys  or  surveys  to  be  carried  out  on  the environmental  status  of  certain  Eni's  industrial  sites  as required  by  the  applicable  regulations  on  contaminated sites;  (iii)  unfavourable  developments  in  ongoing  litigation on the environmental status of certain of the Company's sites where a number of public administrations, the Italian Ministry of the Environment or third parties are claiming compensation  for  environmental  or  other  damages  such as damages to people's health and loss of property value; (iv)  the  possibility  that  new  litigation  might  arise;  (v)  the probability that new and stricter environmental laws might be implemented; and (vi) the circumstance that the extent and  cost  of  environmental  restoration  and  remediation programs are often inherently difficult to estimate leading to underestimation of the future costs of remediation and restoration,  as  well  as  unforeseen  adverse  developments both in the final remediation costs and with respect to the final liability allocation among the various parties involved at the sites. As a result of these risks, environmental liabilities could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on  the  Group's  results  of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity, business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Risks related to legal proceedings and compliance with anti-corruption legislation\n\nEni is the defendant in a number of civil and criminal actions and  administrative  proceedings.  In  future  years  Eni  may incur significant losses due to: (i) uncertainty regarding the final  outcome  of  each  proceeding;  (ii)  the  occurrence  of new  developments  that  management  could  not  take  into\n\nconsideration when evaluating the likely outcome of each proceeding in order to accrue the risk provisions as of the date of the latest financial statements or to judge a negative outcome only as possible or to conclude that a contingency loss could not be estimated reliably; (iii) the emergence of new evidence and information; and (iv) underestimation of probable future losses due to circumstances that are often inherently difficult to estimate. Certain legal proceedings and investigations in which Eni or its subsidiaries or its officers and employees are defendants involve the alleged breach of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations and other ethical misconduct. Such proceedings are described in the notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, under the heading 'Legal Proceedings'. Ethical misconduct  and  noncompliance  with  applicable  laws  and regulations, including noncompliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, by Eni, its officers and employees, its partners,  agents  or  others  that  act  on  the  Group's  behalf, could expose Eni and its employees to criminal and civil penalties and could be damaging to Eni's reputation and shareholder value.\n\n## 4  INTERNAL CONTROL RISKS\n\n## Risks from acquisitions\n\nEni is constantly monitoring the oil and gas market in search of opportunities to acquire individual assets or companies with a view of achieving its growth targets or complementing its asset portfolio. Acquisitions entail an execution risk - the risk that the acquirer will not be able to effectively integrate the purchased assets so as to achieve expected synergies. In addition, acquisitions entail a financial risk - the risk of not being able to recover the purchase costs of acquired assets, in case a prolonged decline in the market prices of oil and natural gas occurs. Eni may also incur unanticipated costs or assume unexpected liabilities and losses in connection with companies or assets it acquires. If the integration and financial risks related to acquisitions materialise, expected synergies from acquisition may fall short of management's targets and Eni's financial performance and shareholders' returns may be adversely affected.\n\n## Eni's crisis management systems may be ineffective\n\nEni has developed contingency plans to continue or recover operations following a disruption or incident. An inability to restore or replace critical capacity to an agreed level within an agreed period could prolong the impact of any disruption and could severely affect business, operations and financial results. Eni has crisis management plans and the capability to deal with emergencies at every level of its operations. If Eni does not respond or is not seen to respond in an appropriate manner  to  either  an  external  or  internal  crisis,  this  could",

The Group's IT systems, some of which are managed by third parties, are susceptible to being compromised, damaged, disrupted or shutdown due to failures during the process of upgrading  or  replacing  software,  databases  or  components, power  or  network  outages,  hardware  failures,  cyber-attacks (viruses, computer intrusions), user errors or natural disasters. The  cyber  threat  is  constantly  evolving.  The  oil  and  gas industry  is  subject  to  fast-evolving  risks  from  cyber  threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. Attacks are becoming more sophisticated with regularly renewed techniques while the digital transformation amplifies  exposure  to  these  cyber  threats.  The  adoption  of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) or the migration to the cloud, as well as the evolution of architectures for  increasingly  interconnected  systems,  are  all  areas  where cyber security is a very important issue. The Group and its service providers may not be able to prevent third parties from breaking  into  the  Group's  IT  systems,  disrupting  business operations or communications infrastructure through denialof-service  attacks,  or  gaining  access  to  confidential  or sensitive information held in the system. The Group, like many companies, has been and expects to continue to be the target of attempted cybersecurity attacks. While the Group has not experienced any such attack that has had a material impact on its business, the Group cannot guarantee that its security measures  will  be  sufficient  to  prevent  a  material  disruption, breach or compromise in the future. As a result, the Group's activities and assets could sustain serious damage, services to  clients  could  be  interrupted,  material  intellectual  property could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury, property damage, environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur. If any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely  impact  the  Group's  results  of  operations,  cash flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's share.\n\n## Violations of data protection laws carry fines and expose the Company and/or its employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits\n\nData protection laws and regulations apply to Eni and its joint ventures and associates in the vast majority of countries\n\nin  which  they  do  business.  The  General  Data  Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) came into effect in May 2018 and increased penalties up to a maximum of 4% of global  annual  turnover  for  breach  of  the  regulation.  The GDPR requires  mandatory  breach  notification,  a  standard also followed outside of the EU (particularly in Asia). Noncompliance  with  data  protection  laws  could  expose  Eni to  regulatory  investigations,  which  could  result  in  fines and  penalties  as  well  as  harm  the  Company's  reputation. In  addition  to  imposing  fines,  regulators  may  also  issue orders  to  stop  processing  personal  data,  which  could disrupt  operations.  The  Company  could  also  be  subject to litigation from  persons  or  corporations  allegedly affected  by  data  protection  violations.  Violation  of  data protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals  can  be  imprisoned or fined.  If  any  of  the  risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder  returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## 5  RISKS RELATED TO FINANCIAL MATTERS\n\nExposure to financial risk - Eni is exposed to treasury and trading  risks,  including  liquidity  risk,  interest  rate  risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and credit risk and may incur substantial losses in connection with those risks\n\nEni's business is exposed to the risk that changes in interest rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  or  the  prices  of  crude  oil, natural  gas,  LNG,  refined  products,  chemical  feedstocks, power and carbon emission rights will adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.\n\nThe  Group  does  not  hedge  its  exposure  to  volatile hydrocarbons  prices  in  its  business  of  developing  and extracting  hydrocarbons  reserves  and  other  types  of commodity  exposures  (e.g.  exposure  to  the  volatility of  refining  margins  and  of  certain  portions  of  the  gas long-term  supply  portfolio)  except  for  specific  markets or  business  conditions.  The  Group  has  established  risk management procedures and enters derivatives commodity contracts to hedge exposure to the commodity risk relating to  commercial  activities,  which  derives  from  different indexation  formulas  between  purchase  and  selling  prices of  commodities.  However,  hedging  may  not  function  as expected.  In  addition,  Eni  undertakes  commodity  trading to optimise commercial margins or with a view of profiting from  expected  movements  in  market  prices.  Although Eni  believes  it  has  established  sound  risk  management procedures to monitor and control commodity trading, this",

This translation risk is normally unhedged.\n\nFurthermore,  Eni's  euro-denominated  subsidiaries  incur revenues and expenses in currencies other than the euro or are otherwise exposed to currency fluctuations because prices of oil, natural gas and refined products generally are denominated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar, while a significant portion of Eni's expenses are incurred in euros and because movements in exchange rates may negatively affect the fair value  of  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies other than the euro. Therefore, movements in the U.S. dollar (or other foreign currencies) exchange rate versus the euro affect  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  and  year-onyear  comparability  of  the  performance.  These  exposures are normally pooled at Group level and net exposures to exchange rate volatility are netted on the marketplace using derivative transactions. However, the effectiveness of such hedging activity is uncertain, and the Company may incur losses also of significant  amounts. As a rule of thumb, a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro generally has an adverse impact on Eni's results of operations and liquidity because it reduces booked revenues by an amount greater than the decrease in U.S. dollar-denominated expenses and may also result in significant translation adjustments that impact Eni's shareholders' equity.\n\nEni is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates that may affect the fair value of Eni's financial assets and liabilities as well as the amount of finance expense recorded through profit. Eni enters into derivative transactions with the purpose of minimising its exposure to the interest rate risk.\n\nEni's  credit  ratings  are  potentially  exposed  to  risk  from possible reductions of sovereign credit rating of Italy. On the basis of the methodologies used by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, a potential downgrade of Italy's credit rating may have a potential knock-on effect on the credit rating of Italian issuers such as Eni and make it more likely that the credit rating of the debt instruments issued by the Company could be downgraded.\n\nEni  is  exposed  to  credit  risk.  Eni's  counterparties  could default, could be unable to pay the amounts owed to it in\n\na  timely  manner  or  meet  their  performance  obligations under contractual arrangements. These events could cause the Company to recognise loss provisions with respect to amounts owed to it by debtors of the Company. In recent years,  the  Group  has  experienced  a  significant  level  of counterparty default due to the severity of the economic and financial downturn that has negatively affected several Group counterparties,  customers  and  partners  and  to  the fact that Italy, which is still the largest market to Eni's gas wholesale and retail businesses, has underperformed other OECD countries in terms of GDP growth. Those trends have been  aggravated  by  the  2020  economic  crisis  triggered by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  resulting  in  a  significantly deteriorated  credit  and  financial  profile  of  many  of  Eni's counterparties,  including  joint  operators  and  national  oil companies  in  Eni's  upstream  projects,  retail  customers in  the  gas  retail  business  and  other  industrial  accounts. In  2021,  the  enduring  effects  of  the  pandemic  and,  in  the final months of 2021 the significant rise in the volatility of energy markets have weighed significantly on the capacity of certain of Eni's customers, joint operators or state-owned companies  to  fulfil  payments  obligations  towards  the Company.\n\nEni  believes  that  the  management  of  doubtful  accounts in  the  post  pandemic  environment  and  in  a  scenario featured  by  greater  commodity  volatility  represents  a  risk to  the  Company,  which  will  require  management  focus and  commitment  going  forward.  Eni  cannot  exclude  the recognition of significant provisions for doubtful accounts in future reporting periods. Management is closely monitoring exposure  to  the  counterparty  risk  in  its  Exploration  & Production business due to the magnitude of the exposure at risk and to the long-lasting effects of the oil price downturn on  its  industrial  partners.  Also  the  retail  Gas  &  Power business managed by Plenitude is particularly exposed to credit  risk  due  to  its  large  and  diversified  customer  base, which includes a large number of medium and small-sized businesses and retail customers whose financial condition could deteriorate in case the Italian recovery is weaker than anticipated.\n\nIf  any  of  the  risks  set  out  above  materialises,  this  could adversely  impact  the  Group's  results  of  operations,  cash flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder  returns,  including  dividends,  the  amount  of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  suitable  sources  of  funding for  the  Group  may  not  be  available,  or  that  the  Group  is unable to sell its assets on the marketplace to meet short-",

Such a  situation  would  negatively  affect  the  Group's  results  of operations and cash flows as it would result in Eni incurring higher borrowing expenses to meet its obligations or, under the worst conditions, the inability of Eni to continue as a going concern. Global financial markets are volatile due to several macroeconomic risk factors, including the fiscal outlook of the hydrocarbons-producing countries. In case new restrictive measures in response to a resurgence of the pandemic or the war in Ukraine lead to a double-dip in economic activity and  energy  demand,  in  the  event  of  extended  periods  of constraints  in  the  financial  markets,  or  if  Eni  is  unable  to\n\naccess the financial markets (including cases where this is due to Eni's financial position or market sentiment as to Eni's prospects)  at  a  time  when  cash  flows  from  Eni's  business operations may be under pressure, the Company may incur significantly  higher  borrowing  costs  than  in  the  past  or difficulties obtaining the necessary financial resources to fund Eni's development plans, therefore jeopardising Eni's ability to maintain long-term investment programs.

In 2021, the reporting obligations provided for in Article 8 of EU Regulation 852/2020 entered into force as defined and coded in the relevant Commission Disclosures Delegated Act, relating to economic activities and assets eligible for the purposes of achieving the objectives of the Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Regulation. These disclosure requirements apply to companies listed on regulated EU markets that are required to draw up an NFS. In continuity with previous editions, the document is structured according to the three levers of the integrated business model, Carbon Neutrality by 2050, Operational Excellence and Alliances for Development, which aim to create long-term value for all stakeholders. The contents of the 'Carbon neutrality by 2050' chapter have been organized according to the voluntary recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board, of which Eni has been a member since its foundation, in order to provide even clearer and more in-depth disclosure on these issues. In addition, the main United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that constitute an important reference for Eni in the conduct of its activities, have been mentioned in the various chapters.\n\nThe NFI is included in the Management Report in the Annual Report, to meet the information needs of Eni stakeholders in a clear and concise manner, further favouring the integrated disclosure  of  financial  and  non-financial  information.  In  order  to  avoid  duplication  of information and ensure that disclosures are as concise as possible, the NFI provides integrated disclosures, which may include references to other sections of the Management Report, the Corporate Governance and Shareholding Structure Report and the Report on remuneration policy and remuneration paid, when the issues required by Legislative Decree 254/2016 are already contained therein or for further details. Specifically, the Management Report describes the Eni business model and governance, the main results and targets, the integrated risk management system and the risk and uncertainty factors in which the main risks, possible impacts and treatment actions are detailed, in line with the disclosure requirements of Italian regulations. The NFI contains detailed information on corporate policies, management and organizational models, an in-depth analysis of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, the strategy on the topics covered, the most important initiatives of the year, the main performances with related comments and the 2021 materiality analysis. In the 2021 NFI, the \"core\" metrics defined by the World Economic Forum 2 (WEF) were also included in the 2020 White Paper \"Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation\".\n\nAs in previous years, on the occasion of the Shareholders' Meeting, Eni will also publish Eni for, the voluntary sustainability report that aims to further enhance non-financial information. The 2021 edition of Eni for will also include the annex \"Carbon neutrality by 2050\" and a report dedicated to human rights (Eni for - Human Rights 3 ).

This cultural change constitues a continous drive towards continuous innovation, respect and promotion of human rights, considering diversity as a resource, integrity in business management and environmental protection. The mission confirms Eni's commitment to a Just Transition to guarantee access to efficient and sustainable energy by achieving the goal of net- zero emissions by 2050, with a view to sharing social  and  economic  benefits  with  workers,  the  value  chain, communities and customers in an inclusive, transparent and socially equitable manner, taking into consideration the different level  of  development  of  the  countries  in  which  it  operates, minimising existing inequalities. In addition, to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs and to the growth of the countries in which it operates, Eni is committed to building alliances with national and international development cooperation actors, as underlined by the Third International Conference on Investment Financing for Development, organized by the United Nations\n\nin Addis Ababa in July 2015. The approach highlighted by the mission is also confirmed by the application from January 1 st , 2021 of the 2020 Corporate Governance Code, which identifies \"sustainable success' as the objective that must guide the action of the board of directors and consists of creating longterm value for the benefit of shareholders, taking into account the interests of other relevant stakeholders (see pp. 34-43). Eni, however, has been considering the interest of stakeholders other than shareholders as one of the necessary elements directors must evaluate in making informed decisions since 2006. In compliance with the Code, on March 8 th , 2022 the Board  of  Directors  also  approved,  at  the  proposal  of  the Chairman, in agreement with the CEO, a policy for dialogue with  shareholders  that  identifies  the  parties  responsible  for its management and the manner in which it is carried out at the initiative of shareholders or the Company; the policy also governs reporting to the Board on the development and significant content of the dialogue that has taken place and the manner in which it is disclosed and updated.\n\n## The effects and management of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nCOVID-19 and its impacts on people and communities have confirmed the importance of health and related issues as one of the priorities on global policy agendas. In this crisis scenario, the company has renewed its commitment to achieving the 2030 Agenda and has intervened on several fronts to manage the consequences of COVID-19, exploiting its expertise in order to protect the health of its employees and contractors. Eni has also worked in synergy with governments, institutions and local and international NGOs with the aim of preventing and countering the spread of the pandemic and minimizing its impact on local communities, both in Italy and abroad, and improving the resilience of the most vulnerable communities. Despite the scope and speed with which the pandemic spread, Eni intervened promptly, also by virtue of the experience gained managing  past  epidemics  such  as  Sars-Cov-1  and  Ebola, and thanks to the regulatory, organizational and operational tools it had already adopted in 2011 for the management of epidemic and pandemic events, implementing its own risk management model for Health, Safety, Environment, Security and Public Health and Safety. In continuity with last year, and based on the indications of the Crisis Unit, each employer has put in place the appropriate measures and operational actions with respect to its production unit taking into account the  specificities  of  the  work  environments,  to  counter  and contain the spread of the virus.\n\nThe main areas of activity were: (i) communication, information and training; (ii) hygiene and prevention; (iii) management and use of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment); (iv) sanitization of work environments; (v) reorganization of work arrangements\n\nand  agile  work;  (vi)  access  to  workplaces  and  aggregation areas;  (vii)  management  of  suspected  and  confirmed  cases; (viii) health surveillance and protection of fragile workers; (ix) maintenance of essential services and business continuity plan. In 2021 all the activities continued with significant recourse to  Smart  Working  (remote  working),  in  fact  office  working was modulated according to the trend of the epidemiological curve (with a range of between 20% and 40% of attendances). During the year, Eni maintained a constant dialogue with the trade  unions  through  the  Covid-Committee  organization, at  various  levels  of  the  company  organisation,  for  the implementation  of  measures  suitable  for  protecting  the health and safety of workers and ensuring the operational continuity  of  the  assets.  Also  at  international  level,  the industrial  relations  model  continued  with  the  constant updating and the appropriate studies - carried out by specific Covid  Committees  and  within  the  EWC  (European  Works Council) Restricted Committee - of the pandemic situation in the various countries of presence and the main business developments. Additional and complementary actions have been activated in support of health institutions and important initiatives have been put in place in favour of Eni's people (see  sections  on  People  and  Health,  pp.  165-170)  and  in support of Community Health (see section on Alliances for Development, pp. 186-187). Finally, for more information on the impact of the pandemic on Eni operating performance, see  pp.  97-98  and  for  impacts  on  non-financial  indicators, see the Metrics and Performance Comments sections of the various topics covered in Non financial Declaration.",

The Policies cut across all processes and are focused on a key element of business management; they apply to Eni SpA and, following the implementation process, to all subsidiaries;\n- \uf07d the Management System Guidelines ('MSGs') are the guidelines common  to  all  Eni's  companies  and  may  be  process  or compliance/governance guidelines (the latter normally approved by the Board of Directors) and include sustainability aspects. The individual MSGs issued by Eni SpA apply to subsidiaries, which ensure their implementation, unless a derogation is needed;\n- \uf07d the Procedures set out the operating procedures by which the companies' activities are to be carried out. They describe the tasks and responsibilities of the organizational contacts involved, management and control methods and communication flows. They also regulate operations in order to pursue the objectives\n- of compliance with local regulations. The content is defined in compliance with the Policies and MSGs as implemented by the companies;\n- \uf07d the Operating Instructions define the details of the operating procedures referring to a specific function/organizational unit/ professional area or professional area, or to Eni's people and functions involved in the fulfilments regulated therein.\n\nThe  regulatory  instruments  are  published  on  the  Company's Intranet site and, in some cases, on the Company's website. In addition, in 2020 Eni updated its Code of Ethics in which it renewed the corporate values that characterize the commitment of Eni people and all third parties who work with the Company: integrity, respect and protection of human rights, transparency, promotion of  development,  operational  excellence,  innovation,  teamwork and collaboration. In the first of the two following tables (p. 152153), in addition to the Policies and the Code of Ethics, other Eni regulatory instruments approved by the CEO and/or the Board of Directors are also considered. On the other hand, the second table (p. 154-155) shows the management and organization models, including management systems, multi-year plans, processes and cross-functional working groups.\n\n(4) On December 23, 2020, the Eni Board of Directors resolved to adhere to the new Code, the recommendations of which are applicable as of January 1 st , 2021. Therefore, as from that date, roles, responsibilities and regulatory instruments must take into account the new recommendations on the subject provided for by the new Code, as well as the decisions taken by the Board of Directors on how to apply these recommendations.",

Risks  are assessed  with  quantitative  and  qualitative  tools,  taking into  account  environmental,  health  and  safety,  social  and reputational  impacts.  The  results  of  the  risk  assessment, including the main ESG  (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, are submitted to the Board of Directors and the Control and Risk Committee on a half yearly basis. In the current context, which sees further increased global attention  to  climate  change  and  and  the  emergence  of jurisprudential trends on corporate liability for climate change, the climate change risk, already a top risk, remains relevant also in light of the management's commitment to achieve carbon neutrality goals and keep global warming within the threshold  of  1,5\u00b0C.  Although  the  progress  of  vaccination campaigns contributes to mitigating clinical risk, the nonuniform coverage rates and spread of new variants have kept biological risk among the Top Risks, assessed both as a risk\n\nto  people's  health  and  as  a  systemic  risk  able  to  influence the Eni risk portfolio as a whole and, in particular, market, country and operational risks. The table below provides a summary view of Eni ESG risks classified according to the areas of Legislative Decree 254/2016. For each risk event, the type of risk - top risk and non-top risk - and the page references, where the main treatment actions are set out, are indicated. For the potential effects of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, reference should be made to the paragraph entitled Possible consequences of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine in the Management report. In the new international scenario, Eni's strategy is aimed at ensuring the security and sustainability of the energy system while maintaining a clear focus on a fair energy transition and the creation of value for stakeholders. In this regard, during the Capital Markets Day on March 18, 2022, Eni in fact announced that it intends to accelerate the path to zero absolute net Scope 1+2+3 emissions with new reduction targets of -35% by 2030 and -80% by 2040 compared to 2018.

Eni has long been committed to promoting comprehensive and effective disclosure on climate change and in this respect confirms its commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board, which Eni has adopted since 2017, the first year applicable for reporting.\n\nLeadership in disclosure - Transparency in climate related disclosure and the strategy implemented by the Company have enabled Eni to be confirmed, once again in 2021, as a leading Company in the Climate Change disclosure programme of the CDP. The A- rating achieved by Eni is higher than the overall average rating of B 9 . In addition, in 2021, TPI 10 assessment awarded  Eni  the  highest  rating  for  management  quality  in the strategic assessment of climate risks and opportunities, and recognised, for the first time in the assessment relating to carbon performance, the alignment of long-term emission targets  with  the  more  ambitious  objective  of  the  Paris Agreement to limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century. In the same year, Carbon Tracker's 11 research  on  Integrated  Energy  Companies  (IEC) placed  Eni  first  among  the  peers  for  the  completeness  of the GHG emissions accounting methodology, the medium/ long-term intermediate targets and the emission accounting boundary extended to the entire company.\n\nCommitment  to  partnerships -  Partnerships  are  one  of  the key  elements  of  the  decarbonization  process,  as  Eni  always collaborated  with  academia,  civil  society,  institutions  and companies to facilitate the energy transition. Eni's CEO sits on the\n\n- (9) On an assessment scale from D (minimum) to A (maximum).\n- (11) Independent financial think tank that has been conducting analyses for years to assess the impact of the energy transition on carbon intensive companies and financial markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteering Committee of the \"Oil and Gas Climate Initiative\" (OGCI). Established in 2014 by 5 Oil & Gas companies, including Eni, OGCI  now  counts  twelve  companies,  representing  about one-third of global hydrocarbon production. To reinforce its commitment to reduce GHG emissions, OGCI announced in 2021 the new collective target of Net Zero Operations 12 , which adds to the GHG emission intensity and methane intensity reduction  targets  of  the  Upstream  assets,  announced respectively in 2020 and 2018. In addition, Eni's commitment continued to the joint investment in a fund of over 1 billion dollars for the development of technologies to reduce GHG emissions throughout the energy value chain at a global scale and  to  promote,  following  the  CCUS  KickStarter  initiative launched  in  2019,  wide-scale  marketing  of  CO 2 capture, use  and  storage  technology  (CCUS).  Eni  also  promotes the need for alignment among the methodologies for GHG reporting in order to make the Oil & Gas sector performances and decarbonization targets comparable. In this sense, Eni collaborates  in  the  Science  Based  Target  Initiative  (SBTi), which is working on the definition of guidelines and standards applicable to the sector to define decarbonization targets in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nDisclosure  on  Carbon  neutrality  by  2050  is  organized according to the four TCFD thematic areas: governance, risk management, strategy and metrics and targets. In 2021, Eni was recognised by TCFD 13 as a best practice for disclosure regarding the potential impacts of climate change risks on its portfolio. The key elements of each area are presented below; please see Eni for 2021 - Carbon Neutrality by 2050 14 ; report for a complete analysis; further details will be available through Eni's disclosure to CDP Climate Change questionnaire 2022.\n\n- (10) Transition Pathway Initiative, an investor-led global initiative that assesses companies' progress in the low carbon transition.

Eni's  decarbonization  strategy  is  part  of  a structured system of Corporate Governance, in which the BoD and the CEO play a central role in managing the main aspects linked  to  climate  change.  Based  on  the  CEO's  proposal,  the BoD examines and approves the Strategic Plan, which sets out strategies and targets, including those related to climate change and energy transition. Since 2014, the BoD has been supported in  performing  its  duties  by  the  Sustainability  and  Scenarios Committee (SSC), with whom it examines, on a periodic basis, integration between strategy, future scenarios and the medium/ long-term  sustainability  of  the  business.  During  2021,  the SSC explored topics related to climate change in all meetings, including  updates  on  the  activities  of  the  CFO  Taskforce  for SDGs, the hydrogen supply chain and technologies, the Open-es 15 platform, forestry activities, carbon pricing, Eni's commitment to safeguarding water resources, Eni's results in the ESG indexes and ratings (or sustainability ratings), the resolutions on climate and the assembly disclosures of the reference peers with a focus on \"Say on climate\" 16 , the insights on the activities of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCUS) and human rights 17 .\n\nAs from 2019, the BoD examines and approves Eni's shortmedium, long-term plan, aiming to guarantee the sustainability of its business portfolio in a time frame up to 2050, in line with  what  is  provided  for  in  the  Four-Year  Strategic  Plan. Furthermore, with reference to the composition of the Board, it is reported that on the basis of the self-assessment conducted, about  80%  of  the  Board  Members  expressed  their  positive opinion on the professionalism within the Board - understood in terms of knowledge, experience and skills (with particular regard  to  advisory,  training  and  publication  activities  in  the energy  and  environmental  field,  participation  in  governmental and non-governmental, national and international bodies that deal with these issues) - and on the personal contribution that the individual Board Members consider to make to the Board of Directors in matters of sustainability, ESG and energy transition. The commitment of the entire Board is unanimously recognised on the issues of energy transition, climate change, sustainability and ESG, as well as the specific support of the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee - due to its specific functions, in terms of the quality and depth of the discussion both on ESG and sustainability issues and on those relating to energy transition\n\n- (15) For more information https://www.openes.io/it.\n- (17) For further information, please refer to the \"Sustainability and Scenarios Committee\" paragraph of the 2021 Corporate Governance Report.",

Immediately  after  the  appointment  of  the  Board  of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, a board induction programme  was  implemented  for  directors  and  statutory auditors, which covered, among other topics, issues related to the decarbonization process and the environmental and social sustainability  of  Eni's  activities.  Eni's  economic  and  financial exposure  to  the  risk  deriving  from  the  introduction  of  new carbon pricing mechanisms is examined by the BoD both during preliminary approval of the investment and in the following halfyear monitoring of the entire project portfolio. The BoD is also informed annually on the results of the impairment test carried out on the main Cash Generating Units in the E&P sector and elaborated with the introduction of a carbon tax value aligned with IEA 18 Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). From 2021, the IEA's Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario is included in the scenarios for portfolio evaluations (see pp. 138-143, par. \"Climate Change Risk\"). Finally, the BoD is informed on a quarterly basis on the results of the risk assessment and monitoring activities related to Eni's top risks, including climate change.\n\nRole of management. All company structures are involved in the definition or implementation of the carbon neutrality strategy that  is  reflected  in  Eni's  organizational  structure  with  the  two business groups: Natural Resources, active in the sustainable valorization of the upstream Oil & Gas portfolio, in marketing of wholesale natural gas, in Natural Climate Solutions initiatives and  projects  of    carbon  storage  and  Energy  Evolution,  to support the development of the production, transformation and marketing activities from fossil fuel based to bio, blue and green products, also through the merge of the retail and renewable businesses. As of 2019, climate strategy issues are part of longterm planning and managed by the CFO area through dedicated structures with the aim of overseeing the process of defining Eni's climate strategy and the related portfolio of initiatives, in  line  with  international  climate  agreements.  The  strategic commitment  in  carbon  footprint  reduction  is  part  of  the essential goals of the Company and is therefore also reflected in  the  Variable  Incentive  Plans  for  the  CEO  and  Company's management. In particular, the 2020-2022 Long-Term Stockbased Incentive Plan provides for a specific objective on issues of  environmental  sustainability  and  energy  transition  (total weight 35%), based on the targets related to decarbonization, energy transition and circular economy processes consistent with the objectives communicated to the market and with a view to aligning with the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nThe Short-Term deferral Incentive Plan (IBT) 2021 is closely linked to the Company's strategy, as it is aimed at measuring the achievement of annual objectives in line with Eni's new\n\ndecarbonization targets. In particular, the upstream emission intensity on an equity basis is considered, which includes indirect emissions  (so-called  Scope  2)  and  non-operated  activities. Starting from 2021, the IBT plan also includes the incremental renewable installed capacity KPI, replacing the one related with the exploration of resources, to support the energy transition strategy. Each of these targets is assigned to the CEO with a weight of 12.5% and to all the Company's managers according to percentages in line with the attributed responsibilities.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe  process  for  identifying  and  assessing  climate-related risks  and  opportunities  is  part  of  Eni's  Integrated  Risk Management Model developed to ensure that management makes decisions that take into account current and potential risks,  including  medium-  and  long-term  risks,  and  with  an integrated, comprehensive and prospective view. In light of the link between risk and opportunity management and Eni's strategic objectives, the IRM process starts with a contribution in defining Eni's medium- and long-term plan and four-year plan (objectives and actions with de-risking value), and continues with  supporting  their  implementation  through  periodic  risk assessments  and  monitoring  cycles.  The  IRM  process ensures the detection, consolidation and analysis of all Eni's risks and supports the BoD in checking the compatibility of the risk profile with the strategic targets, also in a  long-term perspective. Risks are:\n\n- \uf07d assessed with quantitative and qualitative tools considering both the probability of occurrence and the impacts that will be determined in a given time frame should the risk occur;\n- \uf07d represented, based on the probability of occurrence and on the impact, by matrices that allow comparison and classification according to relevance.\n\nMain risks and opportunities. Risks related to climate change are analysed, assessed and managed by considering the aspects identified in the TCFD recommendations, which refer both to the risks related to energy transition (market scenario, regulatory and technological evolution, reputation issues) and to physical risk (acute and chronic) associated with climate change. The analysis is carried out using an integrated and cross-cutting approach that involves specialist departments and business lines and considers the related risks and opportunities.\n\nMarket scenario. The global energy landscape is facing major challenges in the coming years, balancing the growth in energy consumption with the urgency of tackling climate change.\n\nIn order to model the evolution of the energy system in such context,  the  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  develops  a series  of  reference  scenarios,  such  as  the  Stated  Policies (STEPS) and the Announced Pledges (APS) 19 and decarbonized",

        "page_content": "scenarios  that  use  a  backcasting  logic 20 to  identify  the actions required to achieve the main energy and sustainable development goals (including full access to energy and the limiting  the  global  average  temperature  increase).  Among these,  in  the  Sustainable  Development  Scenario  (SDS), considered by Eni as the main reference for assessing the risks  and  opportunities  associated  with  energy  transition, the global energy demand by 2040 is expected to decrease compared  to  today  (-5.3%  vs.  2019).  The  energy  mix  will move towards low carbon sources, with an increasing share of nuclear and intermittent sources that will increase from about 2% to 17% in 2040 and to 26% in 2050. Fossil sources will maintain a central role in the energy mix (Oil & Gas equal to 40% of the mix in 2040 vs. 53% in 2020). In particular, natural gas will count for about 20% in the energy mix as the fossil fuel with the best future perspectives both for integration with renewable sources and for replacement of other sources with higher environmental impact. In this scenario, although the demand for oil is expected to fall drastically (up to 47 Mb/g at 2050 vs. 97 Mb/d of 2019), significant upstream investments are still needed to compensate the decline in production from existing fields, although uncertainty remains on the influence that  regulatory  changes  and  technological  breakthroughs could have on the scenario.\n\nIn 2021 IEA developed, for the first time, a path aimed at achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with a temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century (NZE2050). This path is based on levers such as electrification, efficiency and a radical change in consumer behaviour, which demand an immediate change in the energy paradigm. According to the NZE2050, in the next ten years, emissions may be reduced by existing technologies already established on the market, but in 2050 solutions that, at this time, are still in the prototype or demonstration phase and not yet available on a large scale will have to be adopted. Global energy demand by 2040 is expected to decrease compared to today (-13% vs. 2019), despite the projected doubling of the global economy and a population growth of 2 billion.\n\nRegulatory  developments. Adoption  of  policies  suitable  to sustain the energy transition towards low carbon sources could have  significant  impacts  on  the  evolution  of  Eni's  business portfolio.  In  particular,  at  COP26,  a  package  of  decisions (Glasgow Climate Act) was defined, representing an important step  forward  in  the  climate  negotiations.  Among  the  most important elements, the importance of relevance the increase in temperature to 1.5\u00b0C by the end of the century compared to the pre-industrial era is recognised, and to this end a goal has been defined of reducing global CO 2 emissions by 45% in 2030 vs. 2010 and achieving net zero \"around the middle of the century\". At the same time, several countries have announced net zero commitments that to date cover more than 90% of\n\nworld emissions. In this context, the EU has also committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and has increased its GHG emission reduction target from 40% to 55% in 2030, making it  binding with the Climate Law approved in June 2021. In the same year, the European Commission published the Fit for 55 package, which revises the main climate directives in line with the new 2030 target, within a broader review of its climate policies (i.e. the EU regulation on taxonomy and hydrogen and decarbonized gas packages).\n\nLegal  risk. Some  public  and  private  parties  have  begun proceedings,  legal  or  otherwise,  against  the  major  Oil  & Gas  companies,  including  companies  belonging  to  Eni's Group,  deeming  them  responsible  for  the  impacts  related to  climate  change  and  human  rights,  as  well  as  for  socalled  'greenwashing' 21 . Eni  has  long  been  committed  to promoting  a  constant,  open  and  transparent  exchange  of views  on  climate  change  and  human  rights  issues  which are an integral part of its strategy and therefore the subject of communications to all stakeholders. This commitment is part of a wider relationship that Eni has established with its stakeholders on important sustainability issues with initiatives on the subjects of governance, dialogue with investors and targeted communication campaigns, as well as participation in international initiatives and partnerships.\n\nTechnological developments. The  need  to  build  a  final  energy consumption  model  with  a  low  carbon  footprint  will  favour technologies  for  GHG  emissions  capture  and  reduction, production  of  hydrogen  from  gas  as  well  as  technologies that support methane emissions control along the Oil & Gas production chain. In this way it will be possible to aspire to a rapid and realistic transition from a predominantly fossil scenario to one with a low carbon footprint. Furthermore, technological evolution in  the  field  of  energy  production  and  storage  from  renewable sources and in the field of bio-based activities will be a key lever for the industrial transformation of Eni's business. Scientific and technological research is therefore one of the levers on which Eni's decarbonization strategy is based which levers of action are described in the Strategy and Targets section.\n\nReputation. Awareness-raising campaigns by NGOs and other environmentalist organizations, shareholder resolutions during meetings, disinvestments by some investors, class actions by  groups  of  stakeholders,  are  increasingly  more  oriented towards greater transparency on the tangible commitments of Oil & Gas companies towards energy transition.\n\nIn 2020, upholding requests from a number of investors, Eni published its guidelines on responsible engagement on climate change within business associations, in which it commits to periodically check the consistency of its climate and energy advocacy positions and those of the trade associations to which it belongs.",

Intensification  of  extreme/chronic  weather phenomena  in  the  medium/long-term  could  cause  damage to  plants  and  infrastructures,  resulting  in  an  interruption  of industrial  activities  and  increased  recovery  and  maintenance costs.  Regarding  extreme  phenomena,  such  as  hurricanes or  typhoons,  Eni's  current  portfolio  of  assets,  designed  in accordance  with  applicable  regulations  to  withstand  extreme environmental conditions, has a geographical distribution that does  not  result  in  concentrations  of  high  risk.  With  regard  to more  gradual  phenomena,  such  as  sea  level  rise  or  coastal erosion, vulnerability of Eni's assets affected by the phenomenon is  assessed  through  specific  analysis,  as  in  the  case  of  Eni's assets in the Nile Delta area, where the impact is however limited and it is therefore possible to plan and implement preventive mitigation interventions to counter the phenomenon. In parallel with its commitment to ensuring the integrity of its operations, Eni is active on Climate Change adaptation, also with regard to the socio-economic and environmental impacts in the Countries where Eni operates. To this end, Eni completed a project in 2021, in collaboration with FEEM (Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei) and Pisa Institute of Management (IDM), for the assessment of the main risks/opportunities related to Climate Change, leading to the development of guidelines and measures that will provide methodological support for the identification and implementation of adaptation actions in Countries of interest to Eni.\n\n## STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES\n\nAware of the ongoing climate emergency, Eni wants to be an active part of the energy sector's transition with a long-term strategy towards carbon neutrality in 2050, in line with scenarios compatible  with  keeping  global  warming  within  the  1.5\u00b0C threshold at the end of the century. In 2022, Eni has accelerated its transformation strategy, which will leverage the integration of technologies, new business models and close collaboration with  stakeholders  to  develop  an  increasingly  broad  offer  of decarbonized solutions for its customers. Eni's decarbonization path towards net zero in 2050 is traced through clear targets inclusive  of  all  GHG  Scope  1+2+3  emissions,  integrated  and reinforced by new short and medium term targets that confirm Eni's commitment to further align the reduction trajectory to 1.5\u00b0C scenarios:\n\n- \uf07d -35%  of  Net  GHG  Lifecycle  Emissions  (Scope  1+2+3) @2030 vs. 2018, -55% @2035 and -80% @2040;\n- \uf07d -15% of Net Carbon Intensity of energy products sold @2030 vs. 2018 and -50% @2040;\n- \uf07d Net-zero Carbon Footprint Upstream (Scope 1+2) @2030, with a new target of reducing by 65% @2025 vs. 2018;\n- \uf07d Net-zero Carbon Footprint Eni (Scope 1+2) anticipated to 2035, with a new target of reducing by 40% @2025 vs. 2018.\n\nThe  remaining  emissions  will  be  compensated  through offsets, mainly from Natural Climate Solutions, which will contribute to about 5% of the overall reduction of the value chain emissions in 2050.\n\nEni's decarbonization objectives are in fact underpinned by an industrial transformation plan designed on concrete and economically feasible solutions, driven by already available technologies:\n\n- \uf07d reduction of hydrocarbon production in the medium term, with gradual growth of the gas share, which will reach more than 90% by 2050;\n- \uf07d conversion of traditional refining using circular economy hubs, with an increase in 'bio' refining capacity to 6 mln ton by 2035, palm oil free starting from 2023;\n- \uf07d progressive  increase  in  Plenitude's  green  electricity offerings as part of the growth in the customer base to 15 million with over 15 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030 and reach 60 GW in 2050;\n- \uf07d business  development  for  sustainable  mobility  with 30,000 EV charging points by 2025 and around 160,000 in 2050;\n- \uf07d progressive  increase  in  the  production  of  new  energy carriers  including  hydrogen,  which  will  contribute  to about 4MTPA from 2050, and magnetic fusion, with the first operational plant expected in 10 years;\n- \uf07d development  of  CO 2 storage  hubs  for  hard-to-abate emissions both from Eni and third-party industrial sites, reaching a storage capacity of over 50 MtCO 2 in 2050.\n\nThe  evolution  towards  a  portfolio  of  totally  decarbonised products  will  be  supported  by  a  progressive  growth  of investments dedicated to new energy solutions and services, reaching 30% of total investments in 2025, 60% in 2030 and up to 80% in 2040.\n\nIn ten years, these activities will generate positive Free Cash Flow\n\nand reach 75% contribution to the group's cash flow from 2040. For  the  next  four-year  period  2022-25,  Eni  has  planned investments  in  decarbonisation,  circular  economy  and renewables  equal  to  approximately  \u20ac9.7  billion,  including scientific and technological research activities in these areas. Eni is also committed to aligning its plans and investment decisions  to  its  decarbonisation  strategy,  progressively reducing  the  share  of  expenditures  dedicated  to  O&G activities, selecting investment projects according to strict emission thresholds and gradually eliminating investments in \"unabated\" activities or products as a necessary condition for achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century.\n\nThe  decarbonization  plan  is  integrated  into  Eni's  financing strategy, which aligns economic and environmental sustainability, with the issuance, in 2021, of the first sustainability-linked bond of the O&G sector whose interest rate is linked to the energy transition objectives announced by the company.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nEni has historically been committed to reducing its direct GHG emissions  and  was  among  the  first  in  the  industry  to  define,",

In  addition  to  these,  in  2020  new  targets  were  defined, accounted for on an equity basis. These indicators refer to a  distinctive  GHG  accounting  methodology  that  considers all  energy  products  managed  by  Eni's  various  businesses, including purchases from third parties, and all the emissions they generate along the entire supply chain (Scope 1+2+3), according to a well-to-wheel approach. The resulting indicators therefore trace Eni's path towards carbon neutrality both in absolute terms (Net GHG Lifecycle Emisisons) and in terms of intensity (Net Carbon Intensity).\n\nThe performance of the indicators relating to the medium/ long-term targets is shown below.\n\nNet Zero GHG Lifecycle Emissions by 2050: the indicator refers to all Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions associated with Eni activities and products, along their value chain, net of  offsets  mainly  by  Natural  Climate  Solutions.  In  2021,  it increased mostly in relation to the resumption of activities following the health emergency and greater sales of Oil & Gas retail products.\n\nNet Zero Carbon Intensity by 2050: the indicator is calculated as the ratio between absolute net GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) along the value chain of energy products and the amount of energy they contain. In 2021 it decreased by 2% compared to 2020 thanks to the increase of the gas share in the energy mix and the role of offsets.\n\nThese metrics are integrated  by specific indicators to monitor operational emissions:\n\nNet Zero Carbon Footprint upstream by 2030: the indicator considers  Scope  1+2  emissions  from  all  upstream  assets, operated by Eni and by third parties, net of offsets mainly from  Natural  Climate  Solutions.  In  2021,  the  indicator  is substantially stable as the slight increase in emissions was balanced by increased compensation through forestry credits for 2 MtCO 2 eq.\n\nNet Zero Carbon Footprint Eni by 2035: the indicator considers Scope 1+2 emissions from activities carried out by Eni and third parties, net of offsets mainly from Natural Climate Solutions. The indicator is substantially stable as the slight increase in emissions was partially balanced by increased compensation through forestry credits for 2 MtCO 2 eq.\n\nWith  specific reference to short-term  decarbonization targets, defined on operated assets and accounted for on a\n\n100% basis, the following is a summary of the results obtained in 2021 and the progress towards defined targets.\n\nReduction of the upstream GHG emission intensity index by 43% in 2025 vs. 2014: the upstream GHG intensity index, expressed as the ratio between direct Scope 1 emissions and operated gross production in 2021 was substantially stable compared  to  2020.  The  trend  is  related  to  an  increase  in emissions mainly linked to emergency shutdowns in Nigeria and Angola and the resumption of onshore activities in Libya, partially offset by the reduction in fugitive emissions and a general  optimisation  of  consumptions.  In  2021,  the  index registered a value of 20.2 tonsCO 2 eq./mgl boe, up 1% vs. 2020. The overall reduction vs. to 2014 is 25% and in line with the 2025 target.\n\nRoutine zero gas flaring in 2025 in upstream operated  assets: in 2021, the volumes of hydrocarbons sent to routine flaring, equal to 1.16 billion Sm 3 , increased by 12% compared to 2020, mainly due to the resumption of activities at the Abu-Attifel and El Feel plants in Libya, which had been shutdown for most of 2020. The overall reduction from 2014 is 31%, in line with the 2025 target.\n\nReduction of upstream methane fugitive emissions by 80% in 2025 vs. 2014: in 2021, upstream fugitive methane emissions amounted to 9.2 ktCH4, a reduction of 18% compared to 2020 thanks to the monitoring and maintenance activities as part of the LDAR (Leak Detection And Repair) campaigns that are carried out on a periodic basis. The overall reduction compared to 2014 is 92%, confirming the achievement starting 2019, of the 80% reduction target set for 2025.\n\nAverage improvement of 2% per year in 2021 compared to 2014 in the operational efficiency index: the target extends the GHG reduction commitment (Scope 1 and Scope 2) to all business areas with an overall Eni index which in 2021 was around 32 tonsCO 2 eq./mgl kboe, slightly increased compared to 2020 mainly due to the resumption of activities, not yet fully operational. This effect was partially offset by energy efficiency projects started or completed during the year.\n\nIn 2021, Eni went ahead with its investment plan both in projects aimed directly at increasing energy efficiency in assets (\u20ac10M) and  in  development  and  revamping  projects  with  significant effects on the energy performance of operations.\n\nOverall, direct GHG emissions deriving from the assets operated by Eni in 2021 amounted to 40.1 million tons of CO 2 eq., up 6% compared to 2020, mainly due to the resumption of activities in the upstream and gas transport, power and chemical sectors.\n\nIn 2021, the Renewables business grew significantly, reaching an installed  capacity  from  renewable  sources  of  1,188  MW  (more",

This acceleration, obtained mainly as a result of the recent acquisitions in Europe and the United States, has also been carried out with the broader perspective of integration with Plenitude's retail business, in order to exploit all the possible synergies between the two businesses.\n\nRenewable  energy  production  reached  1,166  GWh  (about triple the result of 2020), due to the greater

Planned  evolution  of  business  activities, strategic directions and the challenges posed by changes in  technology  and  the  labour  market  in  general  imply  an important  commitment  to  increase  the  value  of  human capital over time through upskilling and reskilling initiatives, aimed at enriching or redirecting the set of skills required. Eni's commitment on human rights has also included an instrument for monitoring of human rights in the workplace (see chapter \"Human rights\").\n\n## A CULTURE OF PLURALITY AND PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nEni's  approach  to  Diversity  &  Inclusion  (D&I)  is  based  not only  on  the  fundamental  principles  of  non-discrimination and  equal  opportunities  but  on  the  active  commitment  to creating  a  working  environment  where  different  personal and cultural characteristics or orientations are considered a source of mutual enrichment and an indispensable element of business sustainability. Eni ensures that all its people are treated fairly regardless of any differences in gender, religion, nationality, political opinion, sexual orientation, social status, physical  abilities,  medical  conditions,  family  circumstances and  age  and  any  other  irrelevant  aspects;  furthermore,  Eni aims to establish working relationships free from any form of discrimination, requiring that similar values are adopted by all third parties working with Eni. Diversity is in fact a resource to be safeguarded and enhanced both within the Company and in all relations with external stakeholders, including suppliers, commercial and industrial partners, as underlined by its mission and Code of Ethics. To develop the business strategy on D&I and coordinate the portfolio of initiatives, a unit dedicated to D&I issues was established in 2021. To identify the priority objectives in this area, listening initiatives have been activated by the top\n\n(professional  and  non-professional),  and  ensuring  health  and safety,  environmental  protection,  respect  and  promotion  of human rights and attention to transparency and anti-corruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanagement (D&I as a strategic lever for business objectives) and Eni people (surveys, focus groups and the activation of a direct communication channel with the people concerned) to receive warning signals and thoughts on D&I. Activities for the inclusion and enhancement and development of diversity in the company are also ongoing, in particular Eni promotes cross professional exchange through a series of processes, including geographical mobility, as an important experience in the path of personal growth. The consolidation over the years of the processes of induction of new recruits, coaching, training and sharing of skills and best practices with local personnel has ensured continuity in operating activities, characterized by many returns to headquarters and few expatriates in recent years. With regard to gender diversity, Eni pays particular attention to the promotion of initiatives to attract female talents at a national and international level, and to the development of managerial and professional growth paths for the women in the Company. In this context, Eni organizes initiatives for high school students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects, with a focus on gender equality (Think About Tomorrow) and participates in national and international initiatives 23 with the aim of constantly enhancing its processes and operating practices with a view to gender equality. These activities have continued throughout the year through the 'dematerialization' of events and meetings that has allowed reaching places, people and realities inaccessible to date, breaking down language and geographical barriers.\n\nRemuneration policies for Eni employees are defined according to  an  integrated  model  at  global  level  and  promote  salary progression linked exclusively to meritocratic criteria referring to the skills expressed in the role held, the performance achieved and the references of the local remuneration market. In order to verify the implementation of these policies, since 2011, Eni has annually monitored the remuneration gap between women and  men,  noting  the  substantial  alignment  of  remuneration (total pay ratio Italy women vs. men equal to 101 for the fixed",

In addition, in relation to ILO (International  Labour  Organization)  standards,  Eni  performs annual analyses on the remuneration of local personnel in the main  Countries  in  which  it  operates,  which  show  minimum salary levels of Eni personnel significantly higher than both the minimum legal salaries and the minimum market remuneration levels,  identified  for  each  Country  by  international  providers (for  further  information,  see  Report  on  remuneration  policy and  remuneration  paid  2022).  Relating  to  the  professional management of its resources, Eni has implemented managerial development  and  excellence  pathways  aimed  at  the  core professional areas, which it supports through training activities, mobility initiatives, job rotation and development tools. Eni uses various assessment tools to support these pathways, including the annual review, the performance and feedback process with a  focus  on  senior  managers,  middle  managers  and  young graduates and soft skills assessment processes. 2021 also saw a reduction in mobility initiatives, especially international ones, however, the internal growth and development continued, held  remotely.  In  2021,  the  performance  assessment  and management  review  process  covered  94%  while  potential assessment  activities  were  100%  of  the  total  programmed with an overall improving trend (+5 p.p. vs. 2020); finally, senior managers  and  middle  managers  were  assessed  using  the Management Appraisal methodology.\n\n## TRAINING\n\nAlso in 2021, the commitment to training activities continued with a focus on transition and strategic and business development. In  fact,  to  support  the  process  of  corporate  transformation, the redevelopment process continued through upskilling and reskilling  initiatives  (in  2021,  for  example,  a  training  project linked to the expansion contract was presented to the Ministry of labour and social policies, consisting of various training paths) to integrate new professional and behavioural skills necessary for the evolution of businesses, or for the challenges posed by technological evolution and the labour market. In order to support  people  to  best  contribute  to  the  profound  business transformation, two new training initiatives were developed in 2021: a leadership path aimed at managers and team leaders, the other open to all Eni people with the use of a Web App. HSE training initiatives also remain a priority for Eni through the timely provision of mandatory training and the provision of additional HSE training to support the Business. In addition, in May 2021 the new MyChange digital platform was created, as a support tool for Eni people for the change in progress, in which issues such as the Eni Mission, energy transition, the Sustainable Development Goals, Diversity & Inclusion and others are explored.\n\n## INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nIn December 2020, the protocol INSIEME, a model of industrial relations to support the energy transition path was signed with the national trade unions. With this protocol, Eni and the\n\ntrade unions considered it increasingly important to accelerate the energy transition process and shared that this process will require a transparent sharing of information, goals and initiatives and for this reason they considered that an even more effective and participatory system of industrial relations is  necessary  to  accompany  the  transformation  processes that  combine  economic  sustainability  with  the  principles of environmental and social sustainability. In April 2021, the expansion contract was signed with the trade unions at the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, which made it possible to promote generational change, with the introduction of new skills  and  new  trades,  significant  investment  for  the  training and  retraining  of  Eni  people,  confirming  the  great  strategic importance that the company attributes to skills. In October 2021,  the  new  agreement  for  Smart  Working  in  Italy  was signed.  With  this  agreement,  organizational  Smart  Working was  strengthened  (providing  for  8  days/month  for  office locations and 4 days/month for operational sites) with the addition of new types of Smart Working to support corporate welfare  (described  in  the  following  paragraph).  In  the agreement, the workers' fundamental right to disconnection is ensured, introducing precise standards and basic measures to be respected for remote work in order to support the correct balance between working life and private life and avoid negative effects that the prolonged use of digital tools can determine on health and well-being, while trade union rights have been guaranteed, also operating remotely, also strengthening the measures to protect the safety of people.\n\nIn December 2021, the international industrial relations meetings and the 24 th meeting of the EWC of Eni employees, the European Observatory for Health, Safety and the Environment and the annual meeting provided for by the Global Framework Agreement on International Industrial Relations and Social Responsibility of the Company on the issues of sustainability, decarbonization, health and safety of workers and with a focus on the theme of diversity & inclusion, for the enhancement of diversity, as an element of enrichment of experiences in the social and work context.  During  the  meeting,  the  Agreement  for  integration into the GFA - Global Framework Agreement on International Industrial Relations and Corporate Social Responsibility - of ILO Convention No.190 and ILO Recommendation No. 206 on eliminating violence and harassment in the world of work was also signed.\n\n## CORPORATE WELFARE AND WORKLIFE BALANCE\n\nDespite  the  difficult  context,  in  2021,  continuity  was guaranteed for services to people and a safe and compliant way of organizing initiatives.\n\nIn  the  2021  agreement  on  Smart  Working,  described  in the previous paragraph, new types of Smart Working have been introduced that can be requested by Eni people to support parenting, disability and that generally guarantee greater  attention  to  the  needs  of  employees  at  different",

Finally, again in relation to parenting, in all countries where Eni operates, it continues to recognise: 10 working days 100% paid to both parents, 14 minimum weeks' leave for the primary carer as per the ILO convention and the payment of an allowance equal to at least 2/3 of the salary received in the previous period. The training/information paths dedicated to parents were also proposed again to support them in understanding a constantly redefining context, while the fragility service was confirmed, which through a contact centre provides support and advice to caregivers to tackle problems related to the management of elderly or dependent family members and for the care of children and young people with specific learning  disorders.  Also  in  2021,  Eni  guaranteed  support for working parents by offering a nursery school service by  implementing  all  actions  aimed  at  mitigating  the  risk of infection and protecting the safety and organization of summer camps with a revised proposal to ensure maximum protection for participants without affecting the quality of the proposals.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nEni  considers  health  protection  an  essential  requirement and promotes the physical, psychological and social wellbeing of its people, their families and the communities of the Countries in which it operates (see chapter \"Alliances for development\"). The extreme variability of working contexts requires a constant effort to update health risk matrices and makes it particularly challenging to guarantee health at every stage of the business cycle. To rise to this challenge, Eni has developed an operational platform that ensures services to its people, covering occupational health, industrial hygiene, traveller health, healthcare and medical emergency, as well as the assessment of the impacts of business operations on the health of communities, as well as health promotion initiatives for Eni people and the communities in which it operates. Eni's strategy for health management is oriented, in  addition  to  maintaining  and  continuously  improving health services, to: (i) enhancing access to assistance for all Eni people; interventions in favour of communities and emergency  provisions  to  support  situations  of  fragility created or aggravated by the pandemic; (ii) spreading the culture  of  health  through  initiatives  in  favour  of  workers, their  families  and  communities  identified  downstream of  risk  assessment  and  impacts  in  the  health  field;  (iii)\n\nimplementing  occupational  medicine  activities  also  in consideration of the risks inherent to new projects, industrial processes and the results of industrial hygiene activities; (iv)  promoting  the  digitalization  of  health  processes  and services. In 2021, all of the Group companies continued the implementation  of  health  management  systems  with  the objective of promoting and maintaining the health and wellbeing of Eni people and ensuring adequate risk management in  the  workplace.  Among  the  initiatives  launched  during the year, we also highlight those aimed at supporting the psychosocial  well-being  of  Eni  people,  with  the  aim  of creating an environment attentive to the quality of life, inside and outside the company: since February 1 st , a psychological listening service has been launched, active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, dedicated to Eni people both in Italy and abroad; since November 27 in conjunction with the international day against  gender  violence,  a  counselling  service  has  been activated for victims of violence or gender harassment. In the  critical  global  health  context,  Eni  has  implemented  a series of prevention and assistance interventions in order to support those in the front line managing health emergencies and local health structures, also thanks to the numerous experiences  in  health  projects  gained  in  response  to epidemic events around the world 24 . In fact, the Eni centre of competence for the management of health emergencies has supported  the  business  units  through:  (i)  epidemiological updates and new guidelines issued by international bodies, (ii) hygiene measures for the prevention and containment of  outbreaks  and  epidemics/pandemics,  (iii)  clinical  and care  flow  management  best  practices,  vaccinations  and recommendations  for  travel  medicine  and  (iv)  support  in defining  technical  specifications  for  services  related  to emergency response.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\n## EMPLOYMENT AND DIVERSITY\n\nOverview - Overall employment amounts to 31,888 people, of whom 20,632 in Italy (64.7% of Eni's employees) and 11,256 abroad (35.3% of Eni's employees). In 2021, employment at global level grew by 1,113 people compared to 2020, equal to +3.6%, with a decrease in Italy (-538 employees) and growth abroad (+1,651 employees). Employment growth is linked to Eni's development plans as part of the initiatives to support the  energy  transition,  also  through  the  acquisition  of  new companies  operating  in  the  renewable  energy  and  circular economy  sectors.  Despite  the  discontinuity  of  the  energy market,  Eni  continued  to  pursue  its  diversity  objectives:  in",

About 81% 25 of permanent contracts involved employees up to the age of 40. Of the total number of hires, approximately 58% in DG Energy Evolution (total 754 of which 612 permanent and 142 permanent), 30% in the Natural Resources Department (total 389 of which 233 permanent and 156  fixed-term)  and  the  remaining  12%  in  Support  Function (total 162 of which 122 permanent and 40 fixed-term).\n\nTerminations -  2,517  contracts  were  terminated  (1,694 in Italy and 823 abroad), 2,275 of which were permanent contracts 26 , and  27%  regarded  female  employees.  In 2021, 25% 25 of employees with permanent contracts who ended their employment were under 50 years of age. Eni's transformation  process,  which  requires  a  strong  skills turnover, is  also  reflected  in  the  trend  in  the  turnover  rate, which in 2021 was the highest of the last 3 years (2019: 9.8%, 2020: 6.1%; 2021: 10.5%).\n\nDiversity & Inclusion - In 2021, the percentage of female staff grew by 1.6% compared to 2020 and stood at 26.2%, divided as follows: 16.7% of executives, 28.5% of middle management, 30.1% of white collar workers, 14.7% of blue collar workers. The overall percentage of women on the control bodies of subsidiaries increased to 43% (37% in 2020), while the overall percentage of women on the management bodies  of subsidiaries decreased slightly compared to the past to 24% in 2021 (26% in 2020). In 2021, the percentage of women in positions of responsibility rose  to  27.3%  compared  to  26.6%  in  2020,  in  all,  women accounted for 26.22% of the total workforce. At Eni, 33% of the figures reporting directly to the CEO are women. There were 314 permanent female hires in 2021 out of 967, counting for 32.46%, down slightly on 2020 (approx. -2 p.p.).\n\nThe  reason  for  this  slight  decrease  is  attributable  mainly to the extraordinary plan of the 2021 redundancies carried out in Italy through the expansion contract that facilitated the  termination  of  female  staff  together  with  a  targeted and extremely selective recruitment of resources from the external market with priority on business sectors and critical activities  (e.g.  asset  integrity,  operational  activities,  etc.). In  recent  years,  approximately  20%  of  resources  holding positions of responsibility are non-Italian, with an increase of 2 p.p. in 2021 compared to 2020; this increase falls within the scope of professional development paths that provide for periods of activity in Eni offices in Italy or in countries other\n\nthan the country of origin. Eni's population consists of 108 different nationalities.\n\nEmployment in Italy - There were 596 hires in Italy, of which 460  permanent  contracts  (32.4%  women).  The  reduction in  employment  of  -538  units  (-3%),  carried  out  through an  extraordinary  exit  plan,  together  with  a  selective  and punctual turnover plan, has allowed the population under 30 to increase by 4% in favour of a reduction in the senior age groups: the population over 50 has decreased by 1.5%. Again in Italy, in 2021 there were 1,694 terminations, 1,658 of whom were permanently employed (of which 26% women). Overall, in Italy at the end of 2021 there was a replacement ratio between new hires and terminations of approximately 1:3.6 (1 hire vs. 3.6 terminations).\n\nEmployment abroad - Average presence of local employees abroad is constant and around 86% in the last three years on  average,  that  confirms  Eni  commitment  to  local  content through the engagement of local communities in its business activities in the Countries. Use of expatriate personnel is limited to  specific  expertise  and  competences  hardly  available  in  the Country. Abroad, in 2021, there were 709 new hires, of which 507 with permanent contracts (32.5% women). The population of employees under the age of 30 has doubled (in part due to the Finproject acquisition).\n\nThe balance between hires and terminations abroad at the end of the year was -114 (+709 hires and -823 terminations) and this trend is also attributable to contractual terminations of international resources employed in the E&P business. There were 823 terminations, 617 of whom permanently employed. Of these, 40% 25 regarded employees under the age of 40, and 29% 25 were women. Abroad, there was an increase of 1,651 resources compared to the previous year (+17.2%), mainly referring to +1,624 local resources (+19.5%), Italian expatriates +24  (+2.5%)  while  the  number  of  international  expatriates remained substantially stable +3 (+1%). The growth in local personnel is mainly due to extraordinary M&A operations. A total of 1,305 expatriates work abroad (992 Italians and 313 international expatriates).\n\nEmployment by business line - About 35% of permanent hires were in the chemical sector, which has strengthened both in countries with traditional activities (e.g. France, UK, Hungary) and in countries with new activities (e.g. Mexico, India, Romania, Vietnam). Growth also concerned the Retail G&P (France and Greece) and GT/R&M (UK, Germany and Ecuador) business areas, which further consolidated their competitive structure. Terminations mainly concerned the Upstream (30%), Chemical (24%) and GT/R&M (18%) businesses.",

Abroad,  in  relation  to  the specific  regulations  operating  in  the  individual  countries,  this percentage stands at 41.6%. In countries where employees are not covered by collective bargaining, Eni ensures in any case full compliance with international and local legislation applicable to the employment relationship as well as some higher standards of protection guaranteed by Eni throughout the group through the application of its company policies worldwide.\n\n## TRAINING\n\nIn  continuity  with  2020,  2021  was  still  marked  by  a predominance of distance learning compared to that in the classroom, continuing to manage the pandemic emergency (67% as in 2020). The total hours of training remained stable\n\ncompared  to  2020  (-0.3%)  with  an  increase  in  average expenditure  due  to  an  increase  in  the  training  courses designed for Businesses to also respond to the needs of the expansion contract.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nIn 2021, the number of health services sustained by Eni was 379,481, of which 261,618 for employees, 43,835 for family members, 70,970 for contractors and 3,058 for others (e.g. visitors and external patients). The number of participants in health promotion initiatives in 2021 was 158,784, of whom 85,776 were employees, 58,031 contractors and 14,977 family members. As concerns occupational illnesses, in 2021 there were  30  claims,  of  which  7  related  to  current  employees and 23 related to former employees. Of the 30 occupational disease claims submitted in 2021, 4 were submitted by heirs (all relating to former employees).\n\nFinally,  in  2021,  with  the  aim  of  assessing  the  potential impacts of the projects on the health of the communities involved, Eni completed 10 HIAs (Health Impact Assessment), of  which  7  were  integrated  ESHIA  preliminary  studies (Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment) and 3 as integrated ESHIA.",

In 2021, several projects and initiatives were promoted mainly focused on the following issues: (i) behavioural safety and Human Factor, with the application  at  the  operating  sites  of  an  Eni  methodology (THEME),  developed  in  collaboration  with  the  University of  Bologna,  to  identify  and  analyze  incorrect  behaviours and  habits, including the cultural and  organizational components,  that  characterize  and  influence  the  action  of workers, and strengthen the role of the person as an active agent  and  first  barrier  in  preventing  any  incidental  event; (ii)  Digital  Safety,  through  the  creation  of  digital  tools  to promote the HSE culture, facilitate the activities in the field and  support  the  analysis  and  reporting  of  HSE  risks;  (iii) Process  Safety  Fundamentals,  widespread  dissemination, through  in-depth  sessions  dedicated  to  employees  and contractors, of the 10 Eni rules on the safety of processes and  assets.  In  addition  to  these  innovative  activities,  Eni continued to pay particular attention to reinforcing safety during activities at operating sites, further standardizing in special regulatory instruments, valid for all Eni entities, the minimum basic principles to be applied in the most critical activities  and  developing  training  courses  to  increase operators' knowledge and awareness of the minimum safety requirements. Regarding the management of contractors, the 147 people of the Safety Competence Centre (SCC) 27 continued to proactively monitor and support the process of improvement of companies towards management models characterised  by  a  safety  culture  that  is  more  preventive than  reactive,  monitoring  over  2,500  suppliers,  equal  to 70%  of  those  with  potential  HSE  criticalities  in  Italy,  and managing the anomalies detected with immediate corrective actions and sharing innovative good practices. In addition, agreements (so-called 'Safety Pacts') were developed with various contractors operating in Nigeria, Tunisia, Congo and Mexico. Furthermore, Eni applies the Asset Integrity process to its assets and ensures they are well-designed, well-built and  with  the  most  appropriate  materials,  well  run,  and decommissioned properly, by managing residual risk with the aim of guaranteeing maximum reliability and, above all, safety of people and the environment. The Asset Integrity Management System develops from the initial design stage (Design Integrity), to procurement, construction, installation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand testing (Technical Integrity) through to operational and decommissioning  (Operating  Integrity).  During  2021,  Eni continued the organization of initiatives to further promote the  Asset  Integrity  culture  with  a  cross  and  widespread approach, also including the new energy transition supply chains.  With  regard  to industrial  hygiene ,  great  attention was paid to the identification and management of personal protective  devices  (PPE)  and  various  specific  training initiatives were promoted for workers. Within the emergency field,  particular  attention  was  paid  to  the  prevention  and management of emergencies induced by natural risks and in November 2021 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Department of Civil Protection, to further strengthen  cooperation  relationships  and  define  specific emergency plans for each type of risk with an impact on the continuity of energy supply on the national territory. The main company  objectives  in  2021  in  terms  of  industrial  safety and hygiene were: (i) the improvement of the SIR (Severity Incident Rate), an internal Eni index weighted against the level of severity of accidents and used in the short-term incentive plan of the CEO and managers with strategic responsibilities, in order to focus Eni's commitment on reducing the most severe accidents; (ii) the consolidation of the Safety Culture Programme, an indicator that monitors the level of pro-activity through aspects of preventive safety management; (iii) the application  of  the  methodology  for  analysing  the  human factor  THEME  in  operational  sites;  (iv)  the  dissemination and application of Eni risk management tools on operational sites; (v) the continuation of the dissemination of the 10 Process Safety Fundamentals; (vi) the extension on all Eni sites of projects that apply new technologies and new digital devices to support safety; (vii) the strengthening of oversight in specific areas of industrial hygiene.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nIn 2021, the total recordable injury frequency ratio (TRIR) of the workforce improved compared to 2020 (-4%), thanks to the performance recorded by contractors (-10%), while the employee ratio deteriorated due to the increase in the number of accidents (33 compared to 30 in 2020).\n\nThe ratio for injuries at work with serious consequences is null, since there were no events falling into this category (i.e. no injuries with more than 180 days of absence or with consequences such as total or partial permanent disability). In addition, no fatal accidents were recorded.",

Particular attention is paid to the efficient use of natural resources, like water, to reducing oil spills, to managing waste, to managing the interaction with biodiversity and ecosystem services. For Eni, environmental culture is an important lever for the correct management of environmental issues and for this reason in 2021 it continued with the awareness-raising activities that involved the operating sites (with surveys on environmental culture for employees, information sessions and site-specific interventions  on  Environmental  Cultural  Engagement)  and environmental  communication  launched  in  2020,  to  raise awareness among all employees and strengthen commitment. During  the  year,  about  2,000  people  participated  in  the\n\n\"Together  for  the  environment\"  training  course  and  about 300 people were updated on environmental risks; the new Eni methodology for integrated risk assessment common to the entire company was also presented via webinars in Italy and abroad. In addition, the Environmental Golden Rules were also developed and issued in 2021, to promote virtuous behaviours of  employees  and  suppliers,  and  the  campaign  for  their promotion among all Eni people, as well as suppliers, whose activities must reflect Eni values, commitment and standards. During the year, the dissemination of environmental culture led to the signature of 15 Environment and Safety Pacts involving several suppliers who have committed to implement tangible improvement actions that can be measured through the Safety and Environment Performance Index. In continuity with last year, the company has continued the activities dedicated to environmental digitisation for process optimisation through the creation of IT tools for the management of environmental\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, the Easy Permit platform has been developed in the main operating sites to support the management of regulatory obligations, requirements and deadlines deriving from environmental authorization processes.\n\nThe transition path towards a circular economy represents for Eni one of the main responses to current environmental challenges, through the promotion of a regenerative model. This  approach  is  based  on  the  revision  of  the  Company's production  processes  and  the  management  of  its  assets, reducing  the  withdrawal  of  natural  resources  in  favour  of materials from renewable sources in favour of sustainable inputs, reducing and enhancing waste through recycling or recovery actions and extending the useful life of products and assets through reuse or reconversion actions; in the case of CO 2 , also removing and offsetting the residual part present in the atmosphere. For example, the conversion of refineries to biorefineries plays a central role for the total decarbonization of products and processes by 2050; it is also expected that by 2023 palm oil will no longer be used in production cycles, replaced by alternative (e.g. used and frying food oils, animal fats and waste from the processing of vegetable oils) and advanced products (e.g. lignocellulosic material, and bio-oils). The production of biomethane also falls within the context of the circular economy, allowing the enhancement of agricultural and livestock waste and waste water. Eni has also developed the Waste to Fuel technology for the transformation of organic biomass into bio-oil and biomethane with recovery of the water naturally  contained  in  the  wet  waste.  The  bio-oil  produced can be mixed in the low-sulphur fuel for maritime transport or  refined  to  obtain  biofuels,  while  the  recovered  water  can be  used  for  industrial  purposes.  Eni  has  also  developed a  Circularity  analysis  model,  applied  to  different  business contexts, validated by a third-party certification body, which is an essential tool for the control, management, transparency and credibility of the goals and commitments undertaken on the path towards a circular economy model.\n\nEni's waste  management pays  particular  attention  to  the traceability  of  the  entire  process  and  to  the  verification  of the parties involved in the disposal/recovery chain, in order to ensure compliance with regulations and the environment. Eni also envisages that all feasible solutions aimed at waste prevention  should  be  sought.  Almost  all  Eni  waste  in  Italy is  managed  by  Eni  Rewind 28 which  in  2021  continued  the digitalization  project  launched  in  2020  for  the  efficiency  and monitoring of its waste management process.\n\nIn order to limit the negative impacts related to waste (e.g. loss of resources, possible contamination of environmental matrices due to possible unapproved management, impacts related to transport and treatment at the destination plants), exclusive use is made of authorised parties, favouring recovery over  disposal,  in  line  with  the  priority  criteria  indicated  by European and national regulations. Eni Rewind, on the basis of the characteristics of the individual waste, selects technically viable recovery/disposal solutions, prioritising recovery, treatment operations that reduce the quantities to be sent for final  disposal  and suitable plants at a shorter distance from the waste production site; furthermore, audits are carried out on environmental suppliers, to assess their operational waste management.\n\nWith  reference  to water  resources, Eni  operates  efficient management by evaluating the use of water and the impacts of  its  activities  on  water  resources  for  the  benefit  of  the ecosystem, other users and the Company itself. Eni, especially in stressed areas, carries out the mapping and monitoring of water  risks  and  drought  scenarios  to  define  short,  medium and long-term actions aimed at preventing and mitigating the effects of climate change, also involving suppliers throughout the procurement process, from selection and qualification to the award of the contract. In 2021 Eni published its own position on water resources 29 , in which it undertakes to pursue the CEO Water Mandate and, in particular, to minimise its fresh water withdrawals in areas under water stress. The commitments undertaken lead Eni to seek a stewardship for optimal water management also beyond the industrial boundary, integrated into the territory and able to minimise the exposure of its activities to water risk, through an integrated approach at river basin level. In terms of transparency, also in 2021 Eni gave a  public  response  to  the  CDP  Water  Security  questionnaire, confirming the A- score obtained last year.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  management  of  risks  associated with oil  spills, Eni  is  constantly  engaged  in  every  area of  intervention:  prevention,  preparedness,  followed  by mitigation, response and recovery. In the area of prevention, in Italy the e-vpms\u00ae 30 system was installed on the pipeline that  connects  the  Val  d'Agri  Oil  Centre  to  the  Taranto Refinery  and  the  maintenance  and  technological  update of this system on the pipeline network in Val d'Agri, and on other installations, were completed. In Val d'Agri the advance weather warning monitoring, Kassandra Meteo Forecast 31 , was also implemented, applied not only to the continuous control of pipeline losses, but also to hydrogeological risks, the management of water discharges and the monitoring\n\n(28) Eni Rewind is Eni's environmental company that operates in line with the principles of the circular economy to enhance industrial land, water and waste, or those derived from remediation activities, through sustainable remediation and recovery projects, both in Italy and abroad.

In Nigeria, where the e-vpms\u00ae system is  already  operational  on  the  Kwale-Akri  and  OgboinbiriTebidaba  pipelines,  the  technological  update  programme for the e-vpms\u00ae system began, while on the trunkline from Clough Creek to Tebidaba (52 km), installation work will continue in 2022. In the meantime, a plan was launched to extend monitoring to the production network. As part of the sustainable recovery of places that have been sabotaged, remediation work is also being carried out using a technology that makes use of plant species (phyto-remediation) and the use of these plants is also being assessed for the production of hydrogen from biomass and for the treatment of both industrial  waste  water  and  contaminated  groundwater. Finally, on the R&D front, experiments continued with various technologies, including those for monitoring the integrity of pipelines and fluid storage tanks and tank interconnection piping. In addition, the development of a methodology for assessing the risks deriving from natural events, such as landslides, floods and seismic events, which may involve pipelines, has been launched. Collaborations continued with IPIECA and IOGP 32 in order to strengthen the capacity to respond to marine pollution, both through the updating and dissemination of Good Practices on Oil Spill Preparedness &  Response  and  in  the  context  of  the  regional  initiative Global Initiative for West, Central and Southern Africa 33 , in 2021 some information events were held to increase and raise awareness among stakeholders on the preparedness and response to emergencies, also with the participation of staff from the foreign branches. Finally, asset monitoring continued  within  the  framework  of  the  OSPRI  -  Oil  Spill Preparedness Regional Initiative 34 , in the Caspian Sea, Black Sea and Central Eurasia regions.\n\nEni's commitment to Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (BES) is an integral part of the Integrated HSE Management System,  confirming  its  awareness  of  the  risks  for  the natural  environment  resulting  from  its  sites  and  activities. Operating on a global scale in environmental contexts with different ecological sensitivities and regulatory systems, Eni has  adopted  a  specific  BES  management  model  that  has evolved  over  time  thanks  also  to  long-term  collaborations with recognized international organizations that are leaders in  biodiversity  conservation.  The  BES  management  model is aligned with the strategic objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and ensures that the interactions between  environmental  aspects  (such  as  BES,  climate change,  water  management)  and  social  aspects  (such  as the  sustainable  development  of  local  communities)  are\n\nidentified  and  managed  correctly  from  the  early  planning stages. Through the application of the Mitigation Hierarchy, Eni  gives  priority  to  preventive  measures  over  corrective ones with the primary objective of no net loss of biodiversity. The active involvement of stakeholders is fundamental for the  implementation  and  continuous  improvement  in  the management  of  the  BES  issue  and  ensures  the  effective application  of  the  Mitigation  Hierarchy.  Consultation  and collaboration with local communities, indigenous peoples and other local stakeholders helps to understand their expectations and  concerns,  determine  how  ecosystem  services  and biodiversity are being used, and identify management options that include their needs. The involvement of key stakeholders is an inclusive and transparent process that takes place from the early stages of a project and continues throughout its life cycle. Eni biodiversity risk exposure is periodically assessed by mapping the geographical proximity to protected areas and areas important for biodiversity conservation. This mapping allows  identifying  priority  sites  where  to  take  action  with higher  resolution  inquiries  to  characterize  the  operational and environmental context and assess potential impacts to be  mitigated  through  Action  Plans,  thus  ensuring  effective management  of  risk  exposure.  Moreover,  since  2019,  Eni has committed not to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activities within the boundaries of Natural Sites included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. This commitment confirms the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Policy that Eni has been following for a long time in its operations, in line with  the  corporate  mission,  and  reaffirms  both  its  approach to nature conservation in every area with a high biodiversity value and the spread of good management practices in joint ventures where Eni is not operator. In 2020, Eni adhered to the 'Together with Nature' principles, committing, in addition to  recognizing  the  close  link  between  climate  change  and biodiversity loss, to minimizing risks and maximizing efforts to  protect  and  conserve  existing  ecosystems  through  the application  of  Nature-based  Solutions,  based  on  rigorous ecological principles.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nIn 2021, seawater withdrawals were overall down 4%, due to the significant decrease recorded at the R&MeC sector (-188 Mm 3 ) for the maintenance shutdown at the Brindisi petrochemical plant and due to the end of the functionality tests on the seawater network that in 2020 had led to an",

        "page_content": "increase in the related withdrawals. Freshwater withdrawals, accounting  for  about  7%  of  total  water  withdrawals  and over 73% attributable to the R&MeC sector, increased by 10%. The trend is mainly attributable to the petrochemical plant in Mantua (+7 Mm 3 ) where the withdrawals returned to normal after the minimum of 2020 linked to the stress tests carried out on site to verify which could be, in favourable conditions, the minimum consumption of the plant. Eni's freshwater reuse rate in 2021 remained stable at 91%. The E&P sector's produced water re-injection rate increased to 58% (53% in 2020), thanks to the complete resumption of re-injection  activities  in  Congo  (Loango  and  Zatchi)  and Libya (Abu-Attifel and El Feel). Analysis of the stress level of hydrographic basins 35 and further studies carried out locally shows that freshwater withdrawals from areas under stress account for 1.5% of Eni total water withdrawals in 2021 (data unchanged compared to 2020). In 2021, in particular, Eni withdrew 125 Mm 3 of freshwater, of which 25.9 Mm 3 from water-stressed areas (11.9 Mm 3 from superficial water bodies,  6.1  Mm 3 from  groundwater,  2.6  Mm 3 from  third parties, 3.5 Mm 3 from urban net and 1.8 Mm 3 from TAF). Onshore produced water in water-stressed areas was 22.7 Mm 3 .  In  2021,  Eni  discharged  94  Mm 3 of  freshwater,  of which 19 Mm 3 in water-stressed areas, equal to 20% as in 2020. In 2021 Eni's freshwater consumption was 40 Mm 3 (of which 12 Mm 3 in water-stressed areas).\n\nSpilled barrels following operational oil spills increased by 41% compared to 2020 due to a spill of almost 900 barrels at the Gela Refinery, due to an error during oil transfer operations from tanks to ships (more than half of the barrels have already been recovered). 73% of the barrels spilled are attributable to activities in Italy, 15% to Nigeria. Overall, 51% of the operational oil spill volumes  were  recovered.  With  regard  to  sabotage  events,  in 2021 there was an increase in events (+13% compared to 2020), but almost half of the barrels spilled (-48% compared to the previous year). All the sabotage events took place in Nigeria, where the quantities spilled decreased by 31% compared to the previous year and 83% of the volumes were recovered.\n\nVolumes spilled as a result of chemical spills (68 total barrels) are mainly attributable to Versalis' activities, in particular for an event that occurred at the Grangemouth plant with a loss of 55 barrels. In 2021, volumes spilled from operating spills impacted 97% soil and 3% water bodies, while those from sabotage impacted 99.8% soil and 0.2% water bodies.\n\nWaste generated by Eni from production activities in 2021\n\nincreased  by  19%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  the  growing contribution of both non-hazardous waste (equal to 78% of the total) and hazardous waste. The increase is mainly linked to the E&P sector (which accounts for over 88% of Eni waste), where a total of over 334,000 tonnes more were generated compared to 2020, in line with the progressive resumption of activities after  the  COVID-19  emergency.  In  the  E&P  sector,  drilling activities in Egypt, the USA, Vietnam, Mexico and Norway also had an impact. Plenitude & Power and R&MeC also contributed to the growing trend of non-hazardous waste, in particular the EniPower plant in Ravenna (construction of new temporary waste  storage  and  start  of  piling-foundations  of  the  new boiler) and the Taranto refinery (progress of the Tempa Rossa project). In 2021, recovered and recycled waste increased by 15% compared to 2020, representing 11% of the total waste disposed 36 , for the growing contributions of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste in the E&P and R&MeC sectors. In 2021, a total of 4.2 million tons of waste were generated by remediation activities (of which 3.9 million from Eni Rewind), consisting of over 89% of groundwater treated by TAF plants, partly  reused  and  partly  returned  to  the  environment;  the remaining volumes are handled and transferred to third-party plants.  Expenditure  on  remediation  activities  amounted  to \u20ac452 million.\n\nEmissions of pollutants into the atmosphere increased, with the exception of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which decreased by 6% compared to the previous year, thanks to the decrease in consumption of internal combustion engines recorded in some operating entities of the E&P sector. The increase in emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) are also mainly attributable to the E&P sector: in particular, the increase in SOx is due to the increase in the H 2 S content in the gas sent for flaring in KPO, while the increase in NMVOC is linked to the increase in nonroutine  flaring  recorded  in  NAOC  due  to  problems  with  the compressors.\n\nIn 2021,  Eni  updated  the  assessment  of  exposure  to biodiversity risk to the concessions under development or exploitation in the upstream sector and the operational sites of the other Business Lines, in order to identify where Eni activities fall, even only partially, within protected areas 37 or key biodiversity sites (KBA 38 ).

(36) Specifically, in 2021, 9% of the hazardous waste disposed of by Eni was recovered/recycled, 2% was subjected to chemical/physical/biological treatment, 38% was incinerated, 1% was disposed of in landfill, while the remaining 50% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal). With regard to non-hazardous waste, 12% was recovered/recycled, 4% was disposed of in landfill, while the remaining 84% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal and incineration of a small quantity).

This commitment, based on the dignity of each human being and on the responsibility of the Company to contribute to the well-being of individuals and communities in the Countries in which it operates, is set out in the Eni's Statement on Respect for Human Rights approved in December 2018 by Eni's Board of Directors (BoD). The document highlights the priority areas on which this commitment is focused and on which Eni exercises in-depth due diligence, according to an approach developed in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) 42 and pursuing  continuous  improvement.  These  aspects  are described within a dedicated report, Eni for Human Rights 43 , published  annually  since  2019,  which  provides  a  full representation of the management model adopted by Eni on the issue and the activities carried out in recent years, using the  UNGP  Reporting  Framework  to  report  commitments and results. Human rights are one of the areas in which Eni's Sustainability  and  Scenarios  Committee  (SSC)  performs consultative  and  advisory  functions  for  the  BoD.  Also  in 2021, the SSC investigated the activities carried out during the  year,  including  the  risk-based  management  model adopted  by  Eni  and  the  Slavery  and  Human  Trafficking Statement approved by the BoD in April 2021.\n\n- (42) UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n- (43) See: https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/eni-report-human-rights.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, Eni further strengthened the process of awarding management incentives linked to human rights performance, assigning  specific  objectives  to  all  managers  reporting directly  to  the  CEO  and  other  management  levels.  With regard to training, following on with the internal human rights awareness process launched in 2016 with an engagement workshop held by the CEO, also in 2021 specific e-learning courses were provided to the functions most involved, in order to create a common and shared language and culture throughout the Company and to improve the understanding of the possible impacts of the business on human rights. In particular, a general training module was developed for all staff and in-depth courses were built on topics of interest to individual activities/professional families.\n\nEni's commitment, the management model and the activities carried out on human rights focus on the issues considered most significant for the company - as also requested by the UNGP - in light of the business activities conducted and the contexts in which the company operates. 13 \"salient human  rights  issues\"  are  identified  by  Eni,  grouped  into 4 categories: human rights (i) in the workplace; (ii) in the communities hosting Eni activities; (iii) in business relations (with  suppliers,  contactors  and  other  business  partners) and (iv) in security services.\n\nIn 2020, an evaluation model was established for monitoring human rights in the workplace .\n\nThis is a \"risk-based\" model, which  segments  Eni",

This approach identifies possible risk areas or improvements, requiring specific actions to be defined and monitored over time. During 2021, the model was extended to all subsidiaries of the upstream business, expanding the assessment of human rights monitoring in the workplace. Eni is committed to preventing possible negative impacts on the human rights of individuals and host communities resulting from the implementation of industrial projects. To this end, in 2018, Eni adopted a risk-based model that uses elements related to the operating context, such as risk indices of the data provider Verisk Maplecroft, and project characteristics,  in  order  to  classify  upstream  business projects according to potential human rights risks and to identify  appropriate  management  measures.  Higher-risk projects  are  specifically  investigated  through  a  \"Human Rights  Impact  Assessment\"  (HRIA)  or  a  'Human  Rights Risk Analysis' (HRRA) - the latter carried out according to a desk-based analysis methodology developed in 2021 - to identify measures to prevent potential impacts on human rights and manage the existing ones. In 2021, these analysis were conducted for the seismic aquisition projects planned in Cabinda Centro in Angola; on Block 47 in Oman; on the Dumre block in Albania; on Area C of the Sharjah Emirate (UAE). A number of recommendations have been identified for each project to mitigate the potential negative impacts, set out in Action Plans to be implemented in 2022. Again with regard to industrial projects, in 2021 an in-depth study was conducted on decommissioning activities, to develop a methodology for analysing the potential impacts on human rights in this phase and which will be consolidated over the next two years. In some Countries, such as Norway, Australia and Alaska, Eni operates in areas where indigenous peoples are present, towards which it has adopted specific policies to protect their rights, culture and traditions and to promote their free, prior and informed consultation. The most recent of these Policies, referring to the indigenous populations in Alaska 44 affected by the business activities carried out by the Eni US Operating company in the area, was adopted in 2020 and renewed in 2021.\n\nRespect for human rights in the supply chain is an essential requirement for Eni and is ensured through the adoption of transparent,  impartial,  consistent  and  non-discriminatory\n\nconduct  in  the  selection  of  suppliers,  the  evaluation  of offers  and  the  verification  of  contractual  activities  (see chapter \"Suppliers\"). Companies that collaborate with Eni must share, by signing the Code of Conduct, principles of social responsibility which, inter alia, include the following protection  of  human  rights.  Suppliers,  candidates  for the  qualification  and/or  procurement  procedures,  are responsible for fulfilling specific requirements, consistent with the SA8000 international standards. In the procurement process, the assessment model and oversight of the respect for  human  rights 45 , based  on  a  risk-based  assessment, segments qualified suppliers according to a potential risk of human rights violations in consideration of Country and product risk level 46 . High-risk activities are both industrial activities,  such  as  maintenance,  construction,  assembly, logistics, and  general  goods  and  services,  such  as cleaning services, catering, security services and property management.  The  countries  with  the  highest  number  of suppliers at risk are Nigeria, Congo and Mozambique, for a  total  of  1,266  high-risk  suppliers  and  1,214  medium/ high-risk suppliers. Based on the model, all suppliers are periodically  subject  to  due  diligence,  tender  evaluation, performance feedback and periodic updates with dedicated questionnaires, towards direct suppliers and sub-suppliers. In line with the risk-based approach, in addition to the social responsibility checks carried out on all suppliers (over 6,000) subjected to the qualification process, including updates, as well as the evaluations carried out during the tender, contractual feedback, in 2021 in-depth studies were carried out on 24 relevant suppliers in terms of contractual value, also through surveys during the contract execution phase, plus a further 11 audits inspired by the SA8000 principles on direct contractors and subcontractors, planned following red  flags  relating  to  the  timely  payment  of  wages  and recognition of overtime, without recording any critical issues. To promote knowledge of human rights safeguards, training programmes were organized via webinars, which involved all the resources of the professional procurement family, in Italy and abroad. Human rights clauses in contractual standards have also been strengthened. Further actions to counteract forms of modern slavery and human trafficking and to prevent the exploitation of minerals associated with human rights violations in the supply chain are discussed respectively in the 'Slavery and Human  Trafficking Statement' 47 and the 'Position on Conflict Minerals' 48 . The Position  on  Conflict  Minerals  describes  the  policies  and systems for the procurement of \"conflict minerals\" (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) by Eni, with the aim of minimising the\n\n- (44)  See: https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/Indigenous%20Peoples%20Policy%201DEC2020\\_final.pdf\n- (46) Based on vulnerabilities and probabilities related to specific conditions such as the level of training and skills needed, the level of work intensity, the use of manpower agencies, HSE risks.\n- (45) In 2021, an Operating Instruction was issued for the Procurement professional area in order to strengthen the oversight on the subject.\n- (47) In accordance with the English Modern Slavery Act 2015 and, from this year, the Australian Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act 2018.\n- (48) Compliance with the US SEC regulations.",

Eni  manages  its security operations in  accordance  with  international  principles, including  the  Voluntary  Principles  on  Security  &  Human Rights, adhered to by Eni in 2020 as an 'Engaged Corporate Participant'.  The  VPI  is  a  multi-stakeholder  initiative dedicated to respect of human rights in the management of Security operations that involves governments, companies and NGOs. In February 2021, Eni prepared its first Annual Report and in May it gave a Verification Presentation to the Secretariat of the Voluntary Principles in which companies, NGOs and Governments took part. On this occasion, Eni was able to illustrate the activities carried out in terms of Voluntary  Principles  on  Security  &  Human  Rights  in  the first year after joining the VPI. As a result, Eni launched the Implementation Plan, drawn up by the Steering Committee and received by the VPI Secretariat, containing a series of requested  actions  aimed  at  implementing  Eni's  activities in the protection of Human Rights. In addition, in 2021 Eni updated the \"Human Rights due diligence\" model, launched in 2020 and aimed at identifying the risk of negative impact on human rights of security activities and evaluating the use of possible preventive and/or mitigation measures. In this regard, a new indicator was introduced, relating to the risk of involving the Business in the violation of Human Rights by public and/or private Security Forces. Based on the results of the application of the model, the \"Security & Human Rights\" Action Plan was drawn up which, with reference to the first 10 countries resulting from the risk-based model, provided for: (i) sampling of existing surveillance contracts, in order to verify the presence or absence of human rights clauses in them; (ii) verification of the allocation/use of security-related goods  and  services  made  available  to  public  and  private security forces. Eni's commitment to the dissemination of the principles of human rights protection includes the creation of the training and information workshop on \"Security & Human Rights\" held in Mexico in November 2021.\n\nMoreover,  since  2006,  Eni  has  adopted  an  internal procedure, updated over time and most recently in 2020, also included in the Anti-Corruption Regulatory Instruments, which regulates the process for receiving, analyzing and processing whistleblowing reports, also related to human rights,  that  are  sent  by  or  transmitted  from  anyone, stakeholders, Eni's People or other third parties, even if sent anonymously or in confidence.\n\nIn April 2021, also on the input of Eni SpA's Watch Structure, a  multidisciplinary  Working  Group  was  established,  to promptly respond to the provisions of Convention no. 190 of the International Labour Organization on the elimination of violence and harassment in the workplace (ratified by Italy on January 4, 2021). Eni wanted to move forward on\n\nan issue of central importance, using Convention no. 190 as a starting point, which provides for a series of obligations for  companies  to  prevent  violence  and  harassment  at work.  To  this  end,  on  December  21,  2021,  Annex  E  \"Eni against violence and harassment at work\" was issued to the \"Internal Control and Risk Management System\" MSG. Finally, in line with the principles of \"responsible contracting\" suggested by the best practices and international guidelines on Business & Human Rights, Eni has prepared a series of  standard  clauses  on  human  rights  compliance  to  be included on the basis of a risk-based approach in the main Eni contractual cases, and provides support to the business for their definition and negotiation.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nMandatory  training  for  senior  managers  and  middle managers  (Italy  and  abroad)  of  the  4  specific  modules continued in 2021: \"Security and Human Rights\", \"Human Rights  and  relations  with  Communities\",  \"Human  Rights in the Workplace\" and \"Human rights in the Supply Chain\". In  addition,  the  provision  of  sustainability  and  human rights courses to the entire Eni population continued: the reduction in hours of training on human rights is linked to the scheduling of training activities over several years. However, the overall percentage of users of the course increased to 94.2% (vs. 92% in 2020).\n\nAs  regards  the  Security  professional  area,  in  2021  the percentage  of  personnel  trained  in  human  rights  stood at 90%. The percentage of Security Personnel who have received training on human rights reflects the qualitative/ quantitative turnover of incoming and outgoing resources from the Professional Area year on year.\n\nIn addition, since 2009 Eni has been conducting a training programme  for  public  and  private  security  forces  at  its subsidiaries, which was recognized as a best practice in the 2013 joint publication by the Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) of the United Nations. In 2021, the training session was held in Mexico and was attended in class by 88 representatives of the security forces. The event was attended, in class or remotely, by 116 other people, including Eni's management and employees, belonging to other oil companies and NGOs.\n\nIn 2021, two \"Human Rights Impact Assessments\" (HRIAs) were  conducted  in  Angola  and  Albania  and  two  \"Human Rights Risk Analyses\" (HRRAs) in Oman and the Emirate of Sharjah (UAE). Furthermore, the implementation of the actions provided  for  in  the  Action  Plans  relating  to  human  rights impact analyses, carried out during 2019 and 2018 on the development of Area 1 in Mexico and on the development of Area 4 in Mozambique, continued.

Among these, 40 assertions 51 were verified; for 5 of these, the reported facts  were  confirmed,  even  partially,  and  corrective  actions were  taken  to  mitigate  and/or  minimise  their  impacts.  In\n\nparticular, the following were undertaken: (i) actions on the Internal  Control  and  Risk  Management  System,  relating  to the implementation and strengthening of controls in place; (ii) actions against suppliers and (iii) actions against employees, including  disciplinary  measures,  in  accordance  with  the collective  labour  agreement  and  other  applicable  national laws. At the end of the year, 15 files were still open, 5 of which referred to human rights aspects, mainly concerning potential impacts on workers' rights.\n\n| KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS                                                               |          | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Human rights training hours                                                              | (number) | 23,893  | 33,112  | 25,845  |\n| In class                                                                                 |          | 0       | 260     | 108     |\n| Distance                                                                                 |          | 23,893  | 32,852  | 25,737  |\n| Employees trained on human rights (a)                                                    | (%)      | 94      | 92      | 97      |\n| Security personnel trained on human rights (b)                                           | (number) | 88      | 32      | 696     |\n| Security personnel (professional area) trained on human rights (c)                       | (%)      | 90      | 91      | 92      |\n| Security contracts containing clauses on human rights                                    |          | 98      | 97      | 97      |\n| Whistleblowing files (assertions) (d)  on human rights violations closed during the year | (number) | 30 (40) | 25 (28) | 20 (26) |\n| Founded assertions                                                                       |          | 2       | 11      | 7       |\n| Partially founded assertions                                                             |          | 3       |         |         |\n| Unfounded assertions, with the adoption of corrective/improvement measures               |          | 7       | 9       | 8       |\n| Unfounded (e) /Not ascertainable (f) /Not applicable (g)  assertions                     |          | 28      | 8       | 11      |\n\n- (a) This percentage is calculated as the ratio between the number of registered employees who have completed a course and the total number of registered employees.\n- (b)  The variations of the KPI Security personnel trained on human rights, in some cases even significant from one year and the next, are related to the different characteristics of the training projects and to the operating contingencies.\n- (c) This data is a cumulative percentage value.

        "page_content": "## Suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEni has developed a procurement model, from the selection and qualification of suppliers to tender procedures, which combines economic-financial sustainability with social and environmental sustainability,  with  the  aim  of  promoting  the  generation  of shared and lasting value at the supply chain, thanks to an active participation in the energy transition. Eni meets this commitment by promoting its own values with its suppliers, involving them in development initiatives and including them in risk prevention activities. To this end, as part of the sustainable procurement process, Eni: (i) periodically subjects all suppliers to qualification and due diligence processes to verify their ethical, economic, technical-operational  reliability  and  supervision  in  the  areas of health, safety, the environment, cyber security and human rights, to minimise the risks along the supply chain; (ii) requires all suppliers to sign the Supplier Code of Conduct as a mutual commitment  to  recognise  and  protect  the  value  of  all  their people, to commit to tackling climate change and its effects, to operate with integrity, protect company resources, promoting the adoption of these principles by their people and their supply chain; (iii) monitors compliance with these commitments with periodic checks to ensure that suppliers maintain their qualification and tender requirements over time. To this end, both environmental 52 and social 53 issues are assessed throughout the procurement process,  consistent  with  a  fair  and  sustainable  approach  to energy transition and in line with the time and investment required to  design  and  implement  new  technologies  and  solutions; (iv)  if  critical  issues  emerge,  requires  the  implementation  of improvement  actions  or,  if  they  do  not  meet  the  minimum standards  of  acceptability  where  applicable,  limits  or  inhibits supplier invitations to to tender.\n\nTo  promote  the  sustainable  supply  chain  development,  in 2021 Eni further strengthened the initiatives aimed at involving suppliers  in  the  fair  and  sustainable  energy  transition  path, enhancing the aspects of environmental protection, economic development and social growth thanks to tools and initiatives for the development of a sustainable supply chain. The Programme (JUST - join us in sustainable transition) has made it possible to: (i) define a systemic path through the launch of the Open-es platform that already has more than 3,000 companies, of which almost  2,500  belong  to  the  Eni  supply  chain.  This  platform provides industrial supply chains with concrete tools to improve their ESG performance, based on the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics,  the  metrics  defined  by  the  World  Economic  Forum (WEF). Participation in the initiative is an essential requirement for evaluating and enhancing the commitment made by each of Eni's suppliers in pursuing an equitable path of sustainable development, with the aim of involving the entire supply chain;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(ii)  deepen  knowledge  through  workshops  on  ESG  issues, involving 350 qualified suppliers from a dozen different product sectors, to share sustainability objectives.\n\nOnce the challenges  that  characterize  the  specific  sector  have been  identified,  targets  and  action  plans  are  defined  to  be monitored  over  time.  Moments  of  training  and  engagement on  digital  issues  were  also  organized,  with  particular  focus on cyber security, targeting about 1,000 suppliers and on CO 2 measurement methods and drafting of the sustainability report; (iii) strengthen the procedural framework through the inclusion of cyber security safeguards, in qualification and tender procedures, and  sustainability  in  the  standard  tender  and  contractual documentation;  (iv)  support  the  supply  chain  from  a  financial point of view to reward the commitment in the energy transition and promote the creation of sustainable business models with the launch of the \"Basket Bond - Sustainable Energy\" Programme, an innovative financing tool dedicated to Eni's direct and indirect suppliers and the entire energy chain. In addition, specific clauses have been included providing for the possibility of using factoring services at advantageous conditions in the Request for Offer standards;  (v)  enhance  the  commitment  and  encourage  the adoption of best practices by suppliers through the adoption of sustainability criteria and rewarding mechanisms in the evaluation of offers of over 280 procedures for approximately \u20ac2.5 billion in value.  In  addition,  specific  contractual  clauses  were  introduced to monitor progress over time with respect to the improvement plans that emerged during the qualification phase or participation in the tender.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nDuring 2021, 6,318 54 suppliers were subject to checks and assessments with reference to environmental and social sustainability aspects (including health, safety, environment, human  rights,  anti-corruption  and  compliance).  Potential critical issues and/or areas for improvement were identified for 8% (487) of the suppliers audited. The critical issues mainly  refer  to  shortcomings  in  compliance  with  health and safety regulations and the principles established by the Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics. The total number of  suppliers  involved  decreased  compared  to  2020,  the year in which the critical issues recorded concerned the numerous foreign branches of international suppliers. For the same reason, there was a reduction in the number of suppliers with whom relations were interrupted (34), due to a negative evaluation during the qualification phase or due to suspension or revocation of the qualification.\n\n(52) Tender procedures have introduced rewarding requirements such as energy efficiency, use of energy produced from renewable sources, sustainability certifications,\n\n(53) In order to incentivize the vendor, for example, to ensure gender parity in the teams, maintenance of employment levels, etc.\n\nvehicle fleet, use of recycled material, waste disposal methods, etc.\n\n- (54) It also includes all new suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These principles, including the repudiation of corruption, are reflected in Eni's Code of Ethics, which is distributed to all employees at the time of hiring, and in Model 231 of Eni SpA. Moreover, since 2009, Eni has designed and developed the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program , in compliance  with  the  applicable  provisions  in  force  and international conventions and taking into account guidance and best  practices,  as  well  as  the  policies  adopted  by  leading international organizations. It is an organic system of rules and controls to prevent corrupt practices, and is also instrumental to the prevention of the phenomenon of money laundering in the context  of  the  non-financial  activities  of  Eni  SpA  and  its Subsidiaries. At regulatory level, the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program is represented by the MSG Anti-Corruption 55 and by regulatory instruments that constitute the reference framework in the identification of the activities at risk and the control tools that Eni makes available to its people to prevent and counter the risk of corruption and money laundering. All Eni's subsidiaries, in Italy and abroad, must adopt, by resolution of their BoD 56 , all the anti-corruption regulatory instruments issued by Eni SpA. In addition,  companies  and  entities  in  which  it  holds  a  noncontrolling interest are encouraged to comply with the standards set forth in internal anti-corruption regulations by adopting and maintaining  an  adequate  internal  control  system  consistent with the requirements of the relevant laws. Eni's Anti-Corruption Compliance Program has evolved over the years with the aim of continuous improvement; in January 2017, Eni SpA was the first Italian Company to achieve the ISO 37001:2016 'Anti-bribery Management Systems' certification.  In  order  to  maintain  this certification, Eni cyclically undergoes surveillance and recertification audits, which have always ended with a positive outcome. In addition, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program, Eni, through its anticorruption unit, supports its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad,\n\nproviding specialized assistance in the activity of assessing the reliability of potential counterparties at risk ( \"due diligence\"), the management of any critical issues/red flags that emerge and the  development  of  the  related  contractual  safeguards.  In particular,  specific  anti-corruption  clauses  are  included  in contracts  with  counterparties,  which  also  provide  for  a commitment to view and abide by the principles contained in Eni's Anti-Corruption regulations. The relevant activities in the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program and the planning of such activities for the subsequent periods are the subject of an annual report that is an integral part of the Integrated Compliance Report and follows the relative information flows addressed to the Eni supervisory bodies. Every six months,  unless extraordinary events demand a different frequency, an update of the report is also prepared on the activities carried out in the reference  six-month  period  and  any  significant  events  that occurred during the period. Eni has also defined and implemented a  structured  process  of  Compliance  risk  assessment  and monitoring aimed respectively at: (i) identifying, assessing and tracking the risks of corruption in the context of its business activities  and  for  the  definition  and  updating  of  the  control measures  provided  for  in  the  Anti-Corruption  Regulatory instruments; (ii) periodically analysing the trend of the corruption risks identified, through specific controls and the analysis of risk indicators aimed at ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements and the effectiveness of the models placed under their control. The activities at risk identified by Eni through the Compliance  risk  assessment,  due  to  its  operational  and organizational context, include, for example: (i) contracts with Third Parties at Risk of corruption and money laundering (such as, for example, business associates, joint venture partners, brokers, counterparties in real estate management operations, commercial  network  operators,  suppliers,  credit  buyers/ assignees, etc.); (ii) transactions for the sale of corporate shares, companies and business units, mining rights and securities, etc. and  joint  venture  contracts;  (iii)  non-profit  initiatives,  social\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Compliance risk assessment activities and anti-corruption Compliance Monitoring interventions are planned annually according to a risk-based approach. During 2021, the anti-corruption Compliance Risk Assessments carried out concerned the entire Anti-Corruption scope and the activity at risk \"Transactions for the purchase and sale of company shares, companies and company branches, mining rights and securities, etc. and joint venture contracts\". In the light of the results of these interventions, the level of risk of the scope of corruption and the adequacy of the mitigation measures put in place,  identified  in  the  previous  activities  carried  out,  were confirmed  and  specific  requirements  regarding  the  assessed activity  at  risk  were  also  defined.  In  2021,  the  Compliance Monitoring interventions carried out in the Anti-Corruption field concerned the activities at risk: 'Joint Ventures' and 'Business Associates' ('Sales channels', 'Consultants' and 'Other Business Associates'). The results of the audits showed a trend in the level of risk of the activities in line with that recorded during the Compliance Risk Assessment and confirmed the effectiveness  of  the  compliance  model  adopted.  Eni  also implements  an  anti-corruption  training  programme,  both through  e-learning  and  with  classroom  events,  general workshops  and  job  specific  training.  The  workshops  offer  an overview of the anti-corruption laws applicable to Eni, the risks that could result from their infringement for natural and legal persons and the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program adopted to address  these  risks.  Generally, the workshops  are accompanied by job specific training, or training for professional areas particularly at risk in terms of corruption. In order to optimize  the  identification  of  the  recipients  of  the  various training  initiatives,  a  methodology  has  been  defined  for  the systematic  segmentation  of  Eni's  people  based  on  specific corruption  risk  drivers  such  as  Country,  qualification,  and professional  area.  In  addition,  periodic  information  and updating activities continued through the preparation of short information briefs on compliance, including any anti-corruption issues. In addition, it should be noted that in 2020, on the occasion of their inauguration, the members of the Board of Directors of Eni SpA were shown the key elements of the AntiCorruption Compliance Program for training purposes, also in terms  of  its  consistency  with  international  best  practices. During 2021, the following were brought to the attention of the Board:  (i)  some  revisions  to  the  anti-corruption  legislation, aimed at incorporating some changes to the organizational and  process  structure,  as  well  as  improvements  gradually made  to  the  Anti-Corruption  Regulatory  Tools;  (ii)  some\n\nproposals for updating the Model 231 and the related sensitive activities and control standards, for the purposes of regulatory alignment  and  rationalisation  and  enhancement  in  the document, with a view to integrated compliance of the Eni internal control system and the various related compliance programs.  As  part  of  the  anti-corruption  training  for  third parties,  Eni  has  launched  an  online  training  program  for employees of Green-Stream BV (a company 50% owned by Eni North Africa BV and 50% by the Libyan National Oil Corporation) and for the associated businesses of Eni G&P France SA. Eni's experience in the field of anti-corruption also matures through continuous participation in international conferences, events and working groups, which represent a tool for Eni to grow and promote and disseminate its values. In this regard, in 2021, Eni actively  participated  in  the  Partnering  Against  Corruption Initiative (PACI) of the World Economic Forum, the O&G ABC Compliance  Attorney  Group  (discussion  group  on  anticorruption issues in the Oil & Gas sector) and the B20 Italy Integrity & Compliance Task Force. As part of the integrated audit plan approved annually by the BoD, Eni carries out specific checks  in  order  to  verify  the  fulfilment  of  the  Compliance Program's provisions through dedicated audits and analyses of  processes  and  companies,  identified  according  to  the relevant Country's Risk level and the related size of business, as well as through checks on high-risk third parties, where contractually foreseen. Moreover, since 2006 Eni has issued an internal procedure, updated over time and most recently in 2020, aligned with national and international best practices as well as with the Italian law (L. 179/2017), in order to manage the process of receiving, analysing and processing whistleblowing  reports  received,  even  in  confidential  or anonymous form, by Eni SpA and its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad. This regulation allows employees and third parties to report  facts  pertaining  to  the  Internal  Control  and  Risk Management System that concern behaviours in violation of the  Code  of  Ethics,  any  laws,  regulations,  provisions  of authorities,  internal  regulations,  231  Model  or  compliance models for foreign subsidiaries that may cause damage or prejudice to Eni, even if only to its public image. In this regard, dedicated and easily accessible information channels have been set up and are available on eni.com.\n\nEni's tax strategy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors and is available on the Company's website 57 , is based on the principles of transparency, honesty, fairness and good faith set forth in its Code of Ethics and in the 'OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises' 58 and has as its primary objective the  payment  of  taxes  in  the  various  Countries  in  which  it operates, in the knowledge that it can contribute significantly to tax revenues in those Countries, supporting local economic and social development.",

As part of its tax and litigation activities risk management, Eni adopts prior communication with  the  tax  authorities  and  maintains  relations  based  on transparency,  dialogue  and  cooperation,  participating,  where appropriate, in projects of enhanced cooperation (Co-operative Compliance). True to the commitment to better governance and greater transparency in the extraction sector, which is crucial to foster responsible use of resources and prevent corruption, Eni takes part in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) since 2005. In this context, Eni actively participates both at local level, through the Multi-Stakeholder Groups in the member Countries, and in the Board's initiatives at international level. In accordance with Italian Law no. 208/2015, Eni prepares the 'Country-by-Country Report' required by Action 13 of the 'Base erosion and profit shifting - BEPS' project, promoted by the OECD with the sponsorship of the G-20, whose objective is to have the profits of multinational companies declared in the jurisdictions where the economic activities that generate them are carried out, in proportion to the value generated. With a view to fostering fiscal transparency for the benefit of all interested stakeholders, this report is published voluntarily by Eni, although there are no regulatory obligations in this regard 59 . The publication of this report has been recognized as best practice by the EITI 60 . Also in line with its support for the EITI, Eni has published a public position on contract transparency in which governments are encouraged to comply with the new requirement on contracts publication and it is expressed the support to the mechanisms and initiatives that will be launched by Countries to promote transparency in this area.\n\nFinally, anticipating by two years the reporting requirements on transparency of payments to States in the exercise of extraction activities introduced by the EU Directive 2013/34 EU (Accounting Directive), Eni had begun in 2015 to provide disclosure on a voluntary basis of a series of summary data on cash flows paid to States in which it conducts hydrocarbon exploration and production activities.\n\n## PERFORMANCE METRICS AND COMMENTS\n\nIn  2021  the  anti-corruption  checks,  based  on  the  AntiCorruption  Compliance  Program's  provisions,  have  been performed in 20 audits, carried out in 9 countries,  moreover 22  supervisory  activities  were  carried  out  on  the  231/ Compliance Models of the Italian/foreign subsidiaries. As in 2020,  the  ascertained  cases  of  corruption 61 relating  to  Eni Spa amounted to 0. For the proceedings in progress, ongoing proceedings see the section \"Legal Proceedings\" on page 288. In 2021, due to the emergency related to COVID-19, planned classroom training events were conducted in distance mode. In addition, in 2021, the online training continued on anticorruption issues according to the risk-based methodology started in 2019, aimed at the entire corporate population. Regarding  the  commitment  with  EITI,  Eni  follows  the activities  conducted  at  international  level  and  contributes annually to preparation of the Reports in member Countries; additionally, as a member, Eni takes part in the activities of the Multi Stakeholder Groups in Congo, Ghana, Timor Est, and the United Kingdom.

The resulting development strategies are reinforced by the launch of publicprivate partnerships and alliances with actors engaged in the territory, from International Organizations to development banks, from national institutions to the private sector, from universities to research centres, from cooperation bodies to civil society organizations. The added value of these collaborations allows the sharing of resources not only economically but also in terms of know-how and experience, contributes to the improvement of people's quality of life and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Starting from the analysis of the local socio-economic context, which accompanies the various business project phases in order to ensure greater efficiency and systematicity in the decision-making approach, from the time of license acquisition to decommissioning, Eni adopts tools and methodologies consistent with the main international standards to meet the needs of local populations. These activities, defined in specific Local Development Programmes (LDPs) in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the National Development Plans, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the commitments under the Paris Agreement (Nationally Determined Contributions - NDCs), include five lines of action: (i) contribution to the socio-economic development of local communities, in accordance with national legislation and development plans, also based on the knowledge acquired. These initiatives are aimed at improving access to off-grid energy and  clean  cooking,  economic  diversification  (e.g.  agricultural projects,  micro-credit,  infrastructure  interventions)  and  forest protection and conservation, education and vocational training, access to water and sanitation and support of health services/ systems, as well as improving the health status of vulnerable groups; (ii) Local Content: generation of added value through the transfer of skills and know-how, activation of labour along the local supply chain and the implementation of development projects;  (iii)  Land  management:  optimal  land  management starting from the assessment of the impacts deriving from the acquisition of land on which Eni's activities are carried out in order to find possible alternatives and mitigation measures; Eni undertakes to evaluate possible project alternatives with the aim of pursuing the well-being of local communities; (iv) Stakeholder engagement: the Company's ability to relate to stakeholders and strengthen mutual understanding and trust is a fundamental element for the definition and conduct of stakeholder dialogue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand involvement activities, as well as the best actions to be implemented  to  achieve  sustainable  development  in  synergy with  local  communities;  (v)  Human  Rights:  assessment  of potential or actual impacts attributable - directly or indirectly to Eni's activities through HRIA or HRRA (see section \"Human Rights\" above), definition of the related prevention or mitigation measures, in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs)  and  promotion  of  human  rights  through  the  Local Development Projects mentioned above.\n\nThe  definition  of  Local  Development  Programme  implies  the commitment  of  Eni  in  the  front  line  on  site  and  alongside other  development  players  to  contribute  to  the  sustainable development of Countries. Many of the partnerships developed by Eni with International Organizations and - more generally -  of  development  cooperation  move  in  this  direction,  such as the agreements signed in 2021: in Angola with VIS for the integrated project in Cabinda, with CUAMM (College of Aspiring Missionary Doctors) for a project aimed at improving health for communities in Cunene; the agreement was also renewed with IIA (Instituto de Investiga\u00e7ao Agronomica) and with ADPP an agreement was signed for the installation of solar panels in 4 health centres; in Mozambique with AVSI and CUAMM in response to the humanitarian emergency and with UNILURIO for the implementation of a climate change resilience project for communities in the district of Mecufi; in Kenya a cooperation agreement  for  the  pilot  installation  of  organic  photovoltaic panels (OPV) in a school in Kwale County; in Egypt a cooperation agreement was signed for the start of the Zohr School of Applied Technology in Port Said with Elsewedi Foundation, the Ministry of Education and Technical Training, the Ministry of Oil and Mineral Resources, the government of Port Said and the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company; with AICS (Italian Agency for Cooperation and  Development)  in  Mozambique  to  collaborate  in  the  fields of education and technical training, food security and nutrition, health,  access  to  energy  and  economic  diversification,  with particular reference to agriculture and in Kenya in key sectors for the development of the country such as agriculture and value chains in environment, health, training and vocational education, as well as access to energy/green energy and innovation; in Kazakhstan,  a  cooperation  agreement  with  UNDP  (United Nations Development Programme) for the implementation of an energy efficiency project and the installation of a solar thermal plant in a school in the Turkistan region. In the various business design phases, in line with internationally recognized standard principles/methodologies, Eni has developed: (i) analysis tools to better understand the reference context and appropriately address  local  development  projects,  such  as  Social  Context",

Overall, approximately \u20ac39.8 million was invested in infrastructure development activities, of which \u20ac20.5 million in Asia, \u20ac14.3 million in Africa, and \u20ac5.0 million in Central and South America. Key projects implemented in 2021 include initiatives to promote: (i) access to water through the construction of a water treatment plant in Iraq; maintenance of 10 wells fed by photovoltaic systems in North-East Nigeria, the installation of seven water points in Ghana, maintenance of existing water points and awareness activities about the use of clean and drinking water in Angola; (ii) access to electricity in Libya through support to Libyan General Electricity Company (GECOL) in terms of spare parts and training; in Angola through maintenance  of  solar  energy  systems  installed  in  schools and  medical  centres;  activities  have  also  been  carried  out to facilitate access to clean cooking in Mozambique, Ghana\n\n## 187\n\nand Angola through awareness campaigns and distribution of  improved  cooking  systems;  (iii)  economic  diversification both in the agricultural sector in Angola, Congo and Nigeria and to support local and youth entrepreneurship in Ghana and Egypt; (iv) access to education with activities for both students and trainers in Angola, Egypt, Mozambique, Ghana, Iraq and Mexico. As part of the interventions implemented in response to health needs in 2021, Eni supported 11 initiatives against the COVID-19 pandemic, in 8 foreign countries, aimed in particular at local vulnerable groups, hospitals, health institutions and ministries  of  health,  providing:  ventilators  and  respirators; intensive  care  equipment  and  other  medical  equipment; personal  protective  equipment.  In  addition,  the  emergency response  plan  included:  (i)  implementation  of  community awareness campaigns and 'community engagement' actions aimed at preventing the spread of the virus; (ii) distribution of hygiene and health information and hand washing equipment; (iii) social protection and food assistance measures such as  the  distribution  of  meals  for  families  and  vulnerable groups. In addition to support to combat the pandemic, Eni has carried out 37 initiatives in 14 countries to improve the health status of the populations of partner Countries as an essential  prerequisite  for  socio-economic  development, through the strengthening of the skills of health personnel, the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  health  facilities  and their  equipment,  access  to  drinking  water,  information, education and awareness-raising on health issues among the populations involved. The total expenditure for community health initiatives in 2021 was \u20ac11.6 million, of which \u20ac3.1 million for support to local communities in the context of the COVID-19 emergency.\n\nDuring 2021, 245 grievances 64 were received, 53% of which were resolved and closed. The complaints mainly concerned: management of relations with the communities, management of  environmental  aspects,  land  management,  employment development.\n\nFinally, in 2021, with the aim of assessing the potential impacts of the projects on the health of the communities involved, Eni completed 10 HIAs (Health Impact Assessment), of which 7 were integrated ESHIA preliminary studies (Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment) and 3 as integrated ESHIA.\n\n| KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS   |             | 2021   | 2021                                   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                              |             | Total  | of which fully  consolidated  entities | Total  | Total  |\n| Local development investment | (\u20ac million) | 105.3  | 95.6                                   | 96.1   | 95.3   |\n| of which: infrastructure     |             | 39.8   | 36.6                                   | 41.8   | 43.4   |",

Based  on  the  Regulation,  an  economic  activity  qualifies  as environmentally sustainable where that economic activity:\n\n- (a)  contributes substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives of the EU (set out  in article 9 of the Regulation);\n- (b)  does  not  significantly  harm  any  of  the  environmental objectives;\n- (c)  is carried out in compliance with the  minimum safeguards foreseen by the Regulation, which are procedures implemented  by  an  undertaking  that  is  carrying  out  an economic activity to ensure the alignment with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the principles  and  rights  set  out  in  the  eight  fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organisation on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights;\n- (d)  complies  with  technical  screening  criteria  that  have been  established  by  the  Commission,  which  define  the performance thresholds whereby an economic activity offers a substantial contribution to an environmental objective and at the same time does not hurt any of the other objectives.\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation has established six environmental objectives:\n\n- 1.  Climate change mitigation;\n- 2.  Climate change adaptation;\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources;\n- 4.  The transition to a circular economy;\n- 5.  Pollution prevention and control;\n- 6.  The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n- The technical screening criteria for each of the above-mentioned environmental objectives are established by the Commission, who adopts delegated acts based on the power conferred by the Taxonomy Regulation and subject to the conditions laid down in the Regulation itself.\n\nA  delegated  act  identifies  the  economic  activities  that  are eligible for an environmental objective and the performance criteria  to  be  verified  so  that  each  economic  activity  makes a substantial contribution and does not significantly harm any of other environmental objectives. Currently the Commission has adopted the delegated acts relating to the objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nThis regulation applies to undertakings which are subject to the obligation to publish a non-financial statement or a consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to article 19a or article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on article 8 of the Regulation, non-financial undertakings which are subject to the obligation to publish a non-financial statement or a consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to article 19a or article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council are required to comply with a transparency regime by disclosing in their non-financial statements  three  key  performance  indicators  (KPI)  relating to the proportion of their turnover derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable and the proportion of their capital expenditure and the proportion of their operating expenditure related  to  assets  or  processes  associated  with  economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable as per the Regulation.\n\nThe Commission has adopted a delegated regulation (2178/2021) specifying the content and presentation of information to be disclosed  by  non-financial  undertakings  subject  to  articles  19a or  29a  of  Directive  2013/34/EU  concerning  environmentally sustainable economic activities, and specifying the methodology to comply with that disclosure obligation.\n\nThe new reporting obligation is in force from the non-financial disclosure for the financial year 2021.\n\nFor the first year, non-financial undertakings shall only disclose the  proportion  of  Taxonomy-eligible  and  Taxonomy  noneligible economic activities in their total turnover, capital and operational  expenditure  and  certain  qualitative  information.

This analysis covers the following phases:\n\n- 1. Identification of relevant aspects: through an analysis that, in line with the concept of double materiality, considered a double perspective: INSIDE-OUT: topics  that  reflect  the real  or  potential  significant  impacts,  negative  or  positive, connected to Eni's activities as well as its value chain, such as: (i) main themes emerged both from the Stakeholder Management  System  platform,  (see  pp.  20-21),  and through interviews with the internal functions that manage the relationships with specific categories of stakeholders, (ii)  relevant  topics  following  benchmark  analysis  of  the main  peers,  etc., OUTSIDE-IN: risks  and  sustainability opportunities that can influence the development, performance  and  position  of  the  organization,  such  as: (i)  results  of  ESG  risk  assessments  emerged  from  the Integrated Risk Management process, also considering the evidence provided by external providers and (ii) historical and current macro-trends relevant to the Eni sector.\n\n## PRIORITY MATERIAL TOPICS\n\nTIER 1 TIER 2 TIER 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| CARBON  NEUTRALITY BY 2050   | Combat climate change/Reduce GHG emissions Low carbon technologies   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OPERATIONAL                  | Relations with clients                                               |\n| EXCELLENCE                   | Development of human capital                                         |\n|                              | Diversity, inclusion and work-life balance                           |\n|                              | Health and safety of workers                                         |\n|                              | Asset integrity                                                      |\n|                              | Biodiversity                                                         |\n|                              | Reduction of environmental impacts                                   |\n|                              | Circular economy                                                     |\n|                              | Protection of human rights                                           |\n|                              | Responsible supply chain management                                  |\n|                              | Transparency, anti-corruption and tax strategy                       |\n| ALLIANCES FOR                | Energy access                                                        |\n| DEVELOPMENT                  | Local content                                                        |\n|                              | Local development                                                    |\n| TRANSVERSAL                  | Digitalization and Cyber Security                                    |\n| THEMES                       | Innovation                                                           |\n\n- 2. Involvement of Top Management and the main stakeholders: once the relevant aspects were identified, they were prioritised through the direct involvement of Top Management and a representative sample of Eni's main stakeholders, to whom an online questionnaire was submitted.\n- 3. Prioritisation  of  the  relevant  topics: the  results  of  the questionnaires, together with the results of the 2021 ESG risk assessment activity (see Main ESG Risks pp. 156-157) made it possible to assign an order of priority to the material issues for the 2021 sustainability reporting, allowing them to be represented in 3 TIERS of relevance.\n- 4. Sharing  and  validation  with  the  Governing  Body: the management involved in the non-financial reporting process validated the material aspects, which, in turn, were presented to the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee and the Board of Directors. The Non-Financial Statement is presented to the  Sustainability  and  Scenarios  Committee,  the  Control and Risk Committee, the Board of Statutory Auditors and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Consolidated  Non-Financial  Information  was  prepared  in accordance with the Legislative Decree 254/2016 transposing the European Directive on Non-Financial Information, and the 'Sustainability Reporting Standards', published by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards), with a level of adherence 'in accordance Core' and has been subject to a limited review by  the  independent  Company,  which  is  also  the  auditor of  Eni's  Annual  Report  as  of  December  31,  2021.  All  GRI indicators in the Content Index refer to the version of the GRI Standards published in 2016, with the exception of those of: (i) \"Standard 403: Occupational Health and Safety\", (ii) \"Standard 303: Water and Effluents' - which refer to the 2018 edition -, (iii) \"Standard 207: Tax\" of 2019 and (iv) \"Standard 306: Waste' of 2020. In addition, the recommendations reported by  ESMA  (European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority)  on non-financial  statements  were  incorporated  both  within the NFI and in the Management Report, as well as the set of core metrics defined by the WEF in the September 2020 White  Paper  \"Measuring  Stakeholder  Capitalism  -  Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value  Creation  The  Declaration  includes  the  information required by article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the \"Taxonomy Regulation\") and the related Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2178 and (EU) 2021/2139. The limited examination carried out by the auditing firm (PwC SpA) on the NFI does not extend to the information, provided pursuant to  the  Taxonomy  Regulation,  contained  in  the  dedicated paragraph (pp. 188-190).\n\nPerformance  indicators. KPIs  are  selected  based  on  the topics  identified  as  most  significant,  are  collected  on  an annual basis according to the consolidation scope of the reference year and refer to the period 2019-2021 period. In general, trends in data and performance indicators are also calculated using decimal places not shown in the document. The data for the year 2021 are the best possible estimate with the data available at the time of preparation of this report. In addition, some data published in previous years may be subject to restatement in this edition for one of the following reasons:  refinement/change  in  estimation  or  calculation\n\nmethods, significant changes in the consolidation scope, or if significant updated information becomes available\n\nIf a restatement is made, the reasons for it are appropriately disclosed in the text. Most of the KPIs presented are collected and  aggregated  automatically  through  the  use  of  specific Company software.\n\nBoundary. The scope of the performance indicators is aligned with the objectives set by the company and represents the potential impacts of the activities Eni manages. In particular:\n\n- (i)  for KPIs relating to safety, the environment and climate, the perimeter consists not only of Eni SpA's subsidiaries, but  also  of  the  companies  in  joint  operation,  jointly controlled or associated companies reported in note 65 ;\n- (ii)  the  perimeter  relating  to  KPIs  relating  to  health  is also  extended  to  companies  in  joint  operation,  jointly controlled  or  associated  companies  in  which  Eni  has control  of  operations  (with  the  sole  exception  of  data relating to reports of occupational illness, which refer only to companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis);\n- (iii) with regard to data referring to anti-corruption training, the perimeter includes Eni SpA and its subsidiaries;\n- (iv) with  regard  to  data  referring  to  investments  for  local development, the perimeter includes Eni SpA, subsidiaries and joint ventures;\n- (v)  the  perimeter referring to data relating to reporting files includes Eni SpA and its subsidiaries;\n- (vi)  finally,  the  perimeter  of  the  data  related  to  the  audits covering the anti-corruption checks includes controlled subsidiaries,  associated  companies  based  on  specific agreements and third parties deemed to have a higher risk, as provided for under the contracts entered with Eni.\n\nThe comments on performance refer to these perimeters. In addition, these performance indicators are accompanied by an additional view only relating to 2021 in which the data of fully consolidated companies are presented.\n\nWith regard to all other KPIs/data, the perimeter, consistently with the reference legislation, coincides with the companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis for the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements by the Eni Group.",

The capacity is considered 'installed' once the power plants are in operation or the mechanical completion phase has been reached. The mechanical completion represents the final construction stage excluding the grid connection.\n\n## PEOPLE, HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\n## INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nRegarding industrial relations, the minimum notice period for operational changes is in line with the provisions of the laws in force and the trade union agreements signed in the Countries in which Eni operates.\n\nGENDER PAY GAP RAW\n\nThe raw pay ratio is calculated as the ratio of the average pay of the female population to the average pay of the male population for the individual job title and for the overall population.\n\nSENIORITY\n\nAverage number of years worked by employees at Eni and its subsidiaries.\n\nTRAINING HOURS\n\nHours provided to Eni SpA and subsidiaries employees through training courses managed and carried out by Eni Corporate University (classroom and remote) and through activities carried out by the organizational units of Eni's Business areas/ Companies independently, also through on-the-job training. Average training hours are calculated as total training hours divided by the average number of employees in the year\n\n- \uf07d R&M: indicator focused on emissions related to traditional and biorefineries. Denominator refers to refinery throughputs (raw and semi-finished materials).\n\nScope 2: are the indirect GHG emissions related to the generation of electricity, steam and heat purchased by third parties and intended for internal consumption.\n\nScope 1: direct GHG emissions are those deriving from sources associated to the company's assets (e.g. combustion, flaring, fugitive and venting), and include CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O; the Global Warming Potential used for conversion to CO 2 equivalent is 25 for CH 4 and 298 for N 2 O. I. Contributions of biogenic CO 2 emissions are not included.\n\nScope 3: indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni's products, which involve an analysis by category of activity. In the Oil & Gas sector, the most significant category is that related to the use of energy products (end-use), which Eni calculates according to internationally consolidated methodologies (GHG Protocol and IPIECA), based on upstream production.\n\n- \uf07d Upstream: indicator focused on emissions associated to development and production of hydrocarbons. Denominator refers to gross operated production.\n- \uf07d EniPower: indicator focused on emissions related to electricity and steam production of thermoelectric plants. Denominator refers to equivalent electricity produced (excluding the Bolgiano cogeneration plant).\n\nOperational efficiency expresses the intensity of GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 in tonCO 2 eq.) of the main industrial activities operated by Eni divided by the productions (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni's average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference, thus measuring their degree of operating efficiency in a decarbonization scenario. In particular, the following specifications apply:\n\n- \uf07d R&M: includes only refineries;\n- \uf07d Upstream: includes the hydrocarbon production and electricity plants;\n- \uf07d Chemicals: includes all plants;\n\nDifferently from the other emission intensity indicators, which refer to single businesses and consider only GHG Scope 1 emissions, the operating efficiency index effectively measures Eni's commitment for reducing its GHG emission intensity by including also Scope 2 emissions.\n\n- \uf07d EniPower: includes thermoelectric plants except for the Bolgiano cogeneration plant.\n\nThe refining energy intensity index represents the total amount of energy actually used in the reference year among the various refinery processing plants, divided by the corresponding value of preset standard consumption values for each processing plant. To allow comparison over the years, 2009 data is taken as a reference (100%). For other sectors, the index represents the ratio between significant energy consumption associated to operated plants and the related production.\n\nEni net carbon footprint: the indicator considers GHG Scope 1+2 emissions associated to hydrocarbons development and production activities, operated by Eni and by third parties, accounted for on an equity basis (Revenue Interest), net of offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions occurred in the reference reporting year.\n\nNet carbon footprint upstream: the indicator considers the GHG Scope 1+2 emissions associated to hydrocarbon development and production activities operated or not by Eni, accounted for on an equity basis (revenue interest) and net of the offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions occurred in the reference year.\n\nThe indicator refers to GHG Scope 1+2+3 emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from own productions and those purchased from third parties, accounted for on an equity basis, net of offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions. Differently from Scope 3 end-use emissions, which Eni reports based on upstream production, the Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions indicator considers a much wider perimeter, including Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions referred to the whole value chain of energy products sold by Eni, thus including Scope 3 end-use emissions associated to gas purchased by third parties and petroleum products sold by Eni.\n\nEmployees covered by collective bargaining: are those employees whose employment relationship is governed by collective agreements or contracts, whether national, industry, Company or site. This is the only KPI dedicated to people that considers role-based employees (Company with which the employee enters into the employment contract). All others, including indicators on training, are calculated according to the utilisation method (Company where the work is actually done). It should be noted that, using this second method, the two aspects (role companies and service) could coincide.",

The risk may be caused by the processing carried out, or by the environment in which the processing takes place. The main risk agents whose prolonged exposure may lead to an occupational disease are: (i) chemical agents (example of disease: neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, blood diseases); (ii) biological agents (example of disease: malaria); (iii) physical agents (example of disease: hearing loss).\n\nRecordable cases of occupational diseases: number of occupational disease reports.\n\nWater withdrawals: sum of sea water, freshwater, and brackish water from subsoil or surface withdrawn. TAF (groundwater treatment plant) water represents the amount of polluted groundwater treated and reused in the production cycle. The limit for freshwater, which is more conservative than that indicated by the GRI reference standard (equal to 1,000 ppm), is 2,000 ppm TDS, as provided in the IPIECA/API/IOGP 2020 guidance.\n\nWater discharges: The internal procedures relating to the operational management of water discharges regulate the control of the minimum quality standards and the authorization limits prescribed for each operational site, ensuring that they are respected and promptly resolved if they are exceeded.\n\nNumber of sites overlapping with protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites and pipelines in Italy and abroad, which are located within (or partially within) the boundaries of one or more protected areas or KBAs (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), with activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located within the intersection area.\n\nNumber of sites adjacent to protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): R&M, Versalis and EniPower operational sites in Italy and abroad which, although outside the boundaries of protected areas or KBA, are less than 1 km away (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), without activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present  in  the  Company's  databases  in  June  of  each  reference  year  that  overlap  one  or  more  protected  areas  or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located outside the intersection area.\n\n- \uf07d it is globally recognized that there is an overlap between the different databases of protected areas and KBAs, which may have led to a certain degree of duplication in the analysis (some protected areas/KBAs could be counted several times);\n\nThe sources used for the census of protected areas and KBAs are the \"World Database on Protected Areas\" and the \"World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas\" respectively; the data was made available to Eni in the framework of its membership in the UNEP-WCMC Proteus Partnership (UN Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Center). There are some limitations to consider when interpreting the results of this analysis:\n\n- \uf07d the databases of protected or key biodiversity areas used for the analysis, while representing the most up-to-date information available at global level, may not be complete for each Country.\n\nSpills from primary or secondary containment into the environment of oil or petroleum derivative from refining or oil waste occurring during operation or as a result of sabotage, theft or vandalism.\n\nNumber of local senior managers + middle managers (employees born in the Country in which their main working activity is based) divided by total employment abroad.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The perimeter is progressively extended each year as the VMS system is deployed.\n\nThis indicator is included in the \"Suppliers subject to assessment\" indicator and represents all new suppliers subjected to a new qualification process.\n\n## TRANSPARENCY, ANTI-CORRUPTION AND TAX STRATEGY\n\nCOUNTRYBY-COUNTRY REPORT\n\nThe disclosure relating to the Country-by-Country report is covered by means of a reference to the last published document (generally the financial year preceding the NFI reporting year) reporting the main information required by GRI standard (207-4).\n\nANTI-CORRUPTION TRAINING\n\nE-learning for resources in a context at medium/high risk of corruption.\n\nGeneral workshop: classroom training events for staff in a context of high risk of corruption.\n\nE-learning for resources in a context of low risk of corruption.\n\nJob specific training: classroom training events for specific professional areas operating in contexts with a high risk of corruption.\n\n## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nLOCAL DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS\n\nThe indicator refers to the Eni share of spending in local development initiatives carried out by Eni in favour of local communities  to  promote  the  improvement  of  the  quality  of  life  and  sustainable  socio-economic  development  of communities in operational contexts.\n\nSPENDING TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS\n\nThe indicator refers to the 2021 share of expenditure to local suppliers. \"Spending to local suppliers\" has been defined according to the following alternative methods on the basis of the specific characteristics of the Countries analysed: 1)\"Equity method\" (Ghana): the share of expenditure towards local suppliers is determined on the basis of the percentage of ownership of the corporate structure (e.g. for a Joint Venture with 60% local components, 60% of total expenditure towards the Joint Venture is considered as expenditure towards local suppliers); 2) \"Local currency method' (Angola, Vietnam and the UK): the share paid in local currency is identified as expenditure towards local suppliers; 3) \"Country registration method\" (Iraq, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Mozambique and the USA): the expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country and not belonging to international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of drilling services/auxiliary drilling services) is identified as local; 4) \"Method of registration in the Country + local currency\" (Congo and Mexico): expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country and not belonging to international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of drilling services) is identified as local. For the latter, spending in local currency is considered to be local. The selected countries are Ghana, Angola, UK, Iraq, Nigeria, Congo, Mexico, Mozambique, USA, Indonesia, UAE and Vietnam. The Countries selected are those most representative for Eni business from a strategic point of view and in which a relevant procurement plan for the four-year period 21-24 has been recorded compared to the total spent by the Eni Group.\n\nWaste from production: waste from production activities, including waste from drilling activities and construction sites. Waste from remediation activities: this includes waste from soil securing and remediation activities, demolition and groundwater classified as waste.\n\nThe waste disposal method is communicated to Eni by the third party authorised for disposal.\n\nNOx: total direct emissions of nitrogen oxide due to combustion processes with air. It includes emissions of NOx from flaring activities, sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc. It includes emissions of NO and NO 2 , excluding N 2 O. SOx: total direct emissions of sulphur oxides, including emissions of SO 2 and SO 3 .\n\nPST: direct emissions of Total Suspended Particulates, finely divided solid or liquid material suspended in gaseous flows. Standard emission factors.\n\nNMVOC: total direct emissions of hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon substitutes and oxygenated hydrocarbons that evaporate at normal temperature. They include LPG and exclude methane.",

Below is a selection of the most frequently used terms.\n\n2nd  and  3rd  generation  feedstock Are  feedstocks  not  in competition with the food supply chain as the first generation feedstock  (vegetable  oils).  Second  generation  are  mostly agricultural non-food and agro/urban waste (such as animal fats, used cooking oils and agricultural waste) and the third generation  feedstocks  are  non-agricultural  high  innovation feedstocks (deriving from algae or waste).\n\nAverage  reserve  life  index Ratio  between  the  amount  of reserves at the end of the year and total production for the year.\n\nBarrel/bbl Volume unit corresponding to 159 liters. A barrel of oil corresponds to about 0.137 metric tonnes.\n\nBoe  (Barrel  of  Oil  Equivalent) Is  used  as  a  standard  unit measure for oil and natural gas. Effective January 1, 2019, Eni has updated the conversion rate of gas produced to 5,310 cubic feet of gas equals 1 barrel of oil.\n\nCompounding Activity  specialized  in  production  of  semifinished  products  in  granular  form  resulting  from  the combination of two or more chemical products.\n\nConversion Refinery  process  allowing  the  transformation  of heavy fractions into lighter fractions. Conversion processes are  cracking,  visbreaking,  coking,  the  gasification  of  refinery residues, etc. The ration of overall treatment capacity of these plants  and  that  of  primary  crude  fractioning  plants  is  the conversion  rate  of  a  refinery.  Flexible  refineries  have  higher rates and higher profitability.\n\nElastomers (or Rubber) Polymers, either natural or synthetic, which, unlike plastic, when stress is applied, return, to a certain degree, to their original shape, once the stress ceases to be applied. The main synthetic elastomers are polybutadiene (BR), styrene-butadiene  rubber  (SBR),  ethylenepropylene  rubber (EPR), thermoplastic rubber (TPR) and nitrylic rubber (NBR).\n\nEmissions of NO x (Nitrogen Oxides) Total direct emissions of nitrogen oxides deriving from combustion processes in air. They  include  NO x emissions  from  flaring  activities,  sulphur recovery  processes,  FCC  regeneration,  etc.  They  include  NO and NO 2 emissions and exclude N 2 O emissions.\n\nEmissions of SO x (Sulphur Oxides) Total direct emissions of\n\nsulfur oxides including SO 2 and SO 3 emissions. Main sources are  combustion  plants,  diesel  engines  (including  maritime engines), gas flaring (if the gas contains H 2 S), sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc.\n\nEnhanced recovery Techniques used to increase or stretch over time the production of wells.\n\nEni  carbon  efficiency  index Ratio  between  GHG  emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 in tonnes CO 2 eq.) of the main industrial activities operated by Eni divided by the productions (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni's average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference.\n\nGreen  House  Gases  (GHG) Gases  in  the  atmosphere, transparent to solar radiation, that trap infrared radiation emitted by the earth's surface. The greenhouse gases relevant within Eni's  activities  are  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 ),  methane  (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). GHG emissions are commonly reported in CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq.) according to Global Warming Potential values in line with IPCC AR4, 4 th Assessment Report.\n\nInfilling wells Infilling wells are wells drilled in a producing area in order to improve the recovery of hydrocarbons from the field and to maintain and/or increase production levels.\n\nLNG Liquefied  Natural  Gas  obtained  through  the  cooling  of natural gas to minus 160\u00b0C at normal pressure. The gas is liquefied to allow transportation from the place of extraction to the sites at which it is transformed and consumed. One ton of LNG corresponds to 1,400 cubic meters of gas.\n\nLPG Liquefied  Petroleum  Gas,  a  mix  of  light  petroleum fractions, gaseous at normal pressure and easily liquefied at room temperature through limited compression.\n\nMineral  Potential  (potentially  recoverable  hydrocarbon volumes) Estimated  recoverable  volumes  which  cannot be  defined  as  reserves  due  to  a  number  of  reasons, such as the temporary lack of viable markets, a possible commercial recovery dependent on the development of new technologies, or for their location in accumulations yet to be developed or where evaluation of known accumulations is still at an early stage.\n\nMoulding Activity  of  moulding  of  expanded  polyolefins  for production of ultra-light products.\n\nNatural gas liquids Liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered",

Propane, normal-butane and isobutane, isopentane and pentane plus, that used to be defined natural gasoline, are natural gas liquids.\n\nNet  Carbon  Footprint Overall  Scope  1  and  Scope  2  GHG emissions  associated  with  Eni's  operations,  accounted  for on an equity basis, net of carbon sinks mainly from Natural Climate Solutions.\n\nNet Carbon Intensity Ratio  between  the  Net  GHG  lifecycle emissions and the energy products sold, accounted for on an equity basis.\n\nNet GHG Lifecycle Emissions GHG  Scope  1+2+3  emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from own productions and those purchased from third parties, accounted for on an equity basis, net of offset mainly from Natural Climate Solutions.\n\nOil spills Discharge of oil or oil products from refining or oil waste occurring in the normal course of operations (when accidental)  or  deriving  from  actions  intended  to  hinder operations of business units or from sabotage by organized groups (when due to sabotage or terrorism).\n\nOilfield chemicals Innovative  solutions for supply of chemicals and related ancillary services for Oil & Gas business.\n\nOlefins  (or  Alkenes) Hydrocarbons  that  are  particularly active chemically, used for this reason as raw materials in the synthesis of intermediate products and of polymers.\n\nOver/underlifting Agreements  stipulated  between  partners regulate the right of each to its share in the production of a set period of time. Amounts different from the agreed ones determine temporary over/underlifting situations.\n\nPlasmix The collective name for the different plastics that currently have no use in the market of recycling and can be used as a feedstock in the new circular economy businesses of Eni.\n\nProduction  Sharing  Agreement  (PSA) Contract  in  use  in African,  Middle  Eastern,  Far  Eastern  and  Latin  American Countries,  among  others,  regulating  relationships  between states and oil companies with regard to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities and can enter into agreements with other local or international entities. In this type of contract, the national oil company assigns to the international contractor the  task  of  performing  exploration  and  production  with  the\n\ncontractor's  equipment  and  financial  resources.  Exploration risks are borne by the contractor and production is divided into two portions: 'cost oil' is used to recover costs borne by the contractor  and  'profit  oil'  is  divided  between  the  contractor and the national company according to variable schemes and represents the profit deriving from exploration and production. Further terms and conditions of these contracts may vary from Country to Country.\n\nProved  reserves Proved  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\nRenewable Installed Capacity Is measured as the maximun generating capacity of Eni's share of power plants that use renewable energy sources (wind, solar and wave, and any other  non-fossil  fuel  source  of  generation  deriving  from natural  resources,  excluding,  from  the  avoidance  of  doubt, nuclear  energy)  to  produce  electricity.  The  capacity  is considered 'installed' once the power plants are in operation or the mechanical completion phase has been reached. The mechanical  completion  represents  the  final  construction stage excluding the grid connection.\n\nReserves Quantities  of  oil  and  gas  and  related  substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In  addition,  there  must  exist,  or  there  must  be  a  reasonable expectation that will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest  in  the  production,  installed  means  of  delivering  oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves can be: (i) developed reserves quantities of oil and gas anticipated to be  through  installed  extraction  equipment  and  infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate; (ii) undeveloped reserves: oil and gas expected to be recovered from new wells, facilities and operating methods.\n\nScope 1 GHG Emissions Direct greenhouse gas emissions from company's operations, produced from sources that are owned or controlled by the company.\n\nScope 2 GHG Emissions Indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the generation of electricity, steam and heat purchased from third parties.\n\nScope 3 GHG Emissions Indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni's products.",

These factors could resultin in a scenario that could eventually sap consumers' confidence, deter investment decisions by operators and cripple industrial activities derailing the global recovery or, in the worst of the outcomes, triggering a new worldwide recession, while the economy has been still recovering from the fallout of the  COVID-19  downturn. This  scenario  would  drive  a  reduction in hydrocarbons demand and of commodity prices and would adversely  and  significantly  affect  our  results  of  operations  and cash flow.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of hostilities with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the European Union, the USA, and the UK imposed a raft of tough economic and financial sanctions against Russia, which have added up to those already in force since 2014 as result of the illegal annexation of Crimea.\n\n## Risks associated with the supply of natural gas and oil from Russia\n\nThe restrictions imposed by the international community against Russia  have  mainly  targeted  the  Russian  financial  sector, precluding  access  to  funding  from  European  and  US-based financial institutions. As for energy products imported from Russia, many operators, traders, oil companies, refiners and others have decided on a voluntary basis to suspend purchases of crude oil and products from Russia, giving rise to an auto-sanctioning system; also the President of the United States signed an executive order to ban all imports of Russian energy products. As long as the conflict continues,  it  is  possible  that  new  increasingly  tight  restrictions could be imposed. At the moment, the flow of gas supplies from Russia  has  continued  regularly;  purchases  of  natural  gas  from Russia  represent  approximately  43%  of  the  total  procured  by Eni  in  2021  (approximately  30  billion  cubic  meters,  of  which  22 destined to Italy). Management, in coordination with government institutions, is evaluating plans aimed at diversifying/strengthening alternative sources of supply by leveraging portfolio flexibility, equity reserves, infrastructure availability and long-term relationships with\n\nCaCFttsc\n\noil states overlooking the Mediterranean area. These options could mitigate possible impacts, at the moment unpredictable, in case of wider sanction scenarios adopted by the international community against the Russian energy sector or supply disruptions.\n\nFurthermore, at present the Group has decided to cease signing new supply contracts of Russian crude oil. This decision is expected to lead to a worsening of our refining system, supply downturn and higher expenses which are not possible to quantify currently.\n\n## Financial risks associated with the volatility of commodity prices\n\nSince  the  outbreak  of  the  crisis,  the  energy  commodity  markets have entered a phase of extreme tension and volatility due to the uncertainties  of  European  operators  about  the  stability  of  gas supplies via pipeline from Russia and possible restrictions on oil flows. The spot prices of crude oil for the Brent benchmark and the main benchmarks of the spot prices for natural gas in the European markets recorded significant increases, reaching their highest levels since 2008 for Brent (at about 130 $/bbl) and historical records for gas.  This  volatility  will  significantly  affect  the  Group's  operating expenses and revenues in 2022, driven by possible higher prices of energy commodities which might affect both revenues and purchase costs of oil feedstocks and natural gas.\n\nFurthermore,  the  increased  volatility  could  drive:  (i)  an  increased counterparty  risk  due  to  the  significant  increase  of  the  nominal value  of  trading  receivables  and  the  difficulties  of  the  industrial sector  in  managing  the  significant  increase  in  energy  and  raw material costs caused by the crisis; (ii) a higher level of financial risk of the Company in connection to the need to increase security deposits to secure the settlement of derivative transactions to fulfill the  margining  obligations  (margin  call).  To  counter  the  ongoing phase  of  extreme  volatility  in  the  energy  commodities  market the  Group  is  planning  to  strengthen  its  financial  headroom  by increasing  the  liquidity  reserves  (cash  on  hand  and  committed borrowing facilities).\n\n## Possible impacts on the value of balance sheet assets\n\nEni's companies operating in Russia are indicated in note 37 - Other information  about  investments.  The  Group  has  announced  the intention to divest its interest in the joint operation Blue Stream with a carrying amount of \u20ac40 million (Eni's share 50%) which manages the gas pipeline that transports natural gas produced in Russia to Turkey  through  the  Black  Sea.  Those  volumes  of  gas  are  jointly marketed by Eni and Gazprom to the Turkish state-owned company Botas. This divestment is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated results and balance sheet.\n\nThe Group does not hold any other significant assets in Russia.

        "page_content": "performance in 2022 and beyond are currently unpredictable.\n\n## IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nThe macroeconomic environment has gradually improved during 2021 due to the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19, together with measures to contain the spread of the virus, particularly  in  OECD  Countries,  allowing  for  a  phased  reopening of  economic  activities  and  increasing  mobility  of  people.  The expansionary monetary policies adopted by the central banks and the massive fiscal stimulus launched by governments supported consumptions  and  investments.  In  this  context,  the  demand  for hydrocarbons and the prices of commodities, the main driver of the Group's financial results, recorded a significant rebound.\n\nGlobal  energy  demand  first  stabilized  and  then  unexpectedly increased in the last quarter of the year, driven by an acceleration in  the  pace  of  the  economic  recovery,  resulting  in  an  increase  in the price of oil of 70% vs. 2020 at about 71 $/barrel on an annual average, while natural gas prices recorded material increases (in the order of several hundred percentage points) due to a particularly tight market. These trends were the basis of the strong recovery in  profitability  in  the  Exploration  &  Production  and  Global  Gas  & LNG Portfolio  segments,  together  with  the  solid  performance  of the  chemical  business  line,  driven  by  a  recovery  in  demand  for commodities, and of the Plenitude businesses.\n\nThe Refining & Marketing business has continued to be weighted down  by  the  effects  of  the  pandemic,  which  affected  its performance due to weak demand for jet fuel which penalized the profitability of traditional refining by creating an oversupply of gasoil leading  to  significantly  lower  products  spreads.  The  profitability was also affected by higher costs of gas-indexed utilities and the higher costs for the purchase of emission allowances to comply with  the  environmental  obligations  of  the  European  ETS,  which more than doubled due to a recovery in industrial activities and as  consumption  of  coal  increased  signficantly  due  to  its  costcomptetitiveness against natural gas to fire power generation and to produce steam.\n\nOverall,  2021  saw  a  significant  rebound  in  consolidated  results which closed with a profit of \u20ac5.8 billion compared to a loss of \u20ac8.6 billion  in  2020 and an operating cash flow of \u20ac12.9 billion, which increased by approximately \u20ac8 billion compared to 2020.\n\nLooking  to  the  future,  the  main  risks  for  the  Group's  financial performance are linked to the possibility of the spread of new vaccine-resistant variants of the virus, as well as the resumption of inflation driven by the spill-over effects through the supply chains of increased raw material costs as the ultimate, unintended effect of accomodative monetary policies and big tax measures adopted to help the economy recover from the fallout of the pandemic.\n\n## 1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  Eni  SpA  and  its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Eni or the Group) have been prepared on a going concern 1 basis in accordance with International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS) 2 as issued by  the  International  Accounting  Standards  Board  (IASB)  and adopted by the European Union (EU) pursuant to article 6 of the EC Regulation No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002, and in accordance with article 9 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 38/05 3 .\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  have  been  prepared under the historical cost convention, taking into account, where appropriate,  value  adjustments,  except  for  certain  items  that under IFRSs must be measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies that follow. The principles of consolidation and  the  significant  accounting  policies  that  follow  have  been consistently  applied  to  all  years  presented,  except  where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe  2021  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  approved  by  the Eni's Board of Directors on March 17, 2022, were audited by the external  auditor  PricewaterhouseCoopers  SpA.  The  external auditor of Eni SpA, as the main external auditor, is wholly in charge of the auditing activities of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consolidated  companies'  financial  statements,  as  well  as their  reporting  packages  prepared  for  use  by  the  Group  in preparing  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  are  audited by  external  auditors;  when  there  are  other  external  auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers  SpA  takes  the  responsibility  of  their work. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest million euros (\u20ac million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements requires  the  use  of  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  recognised  in  the financial  statements,  as  well  as  amounts  included  in  the  notes thereto, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities.  Estimates  made  are  based  on  complex  judgments and past experience of other assumptions deemed reasonable in  consideration  of  the  information  available  at  the  time.  The accounting  policies  and  areas  that  require  the  most  significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are in relation to the accounting for oil and natural gas activities, specifically in the determination of\n\n- (1) With reference to the impacts of COVID-19, see information provided in the previous paragraph.\n\n(2)  IFRSs include also International Accounting Standards (IAS), currently effective, as well as the interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee,\n\npreviously named International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and initially Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC).\n\n- (3) As applied to Eni, there are no differences between IFRSs as issued by the IASB and those adopted by the EU, effective for the year 2021.",

Although  the  Company  uses  its  best  estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions  used.  The  accounting  estimates  and  judgments relevant  for  the  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statement are described below.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS MADE IN ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS\n\nSignificant  accounting  estimates  and  judgments  made  by management  for  the  preparation  of  the  2021  Consolidated Financial Statements are affected by the effects of actions to address climate change and by the potential impact of the energy transition. In particular, the global pressure towards a low carbon economy, increasingly restrictive regulatory requirements for oil & gas activities and hydrocarbons consumption, carbon pricing schemes,  the  technological  evolution  of  alternative  energy sources  for  transportation,  as  well  as  changes  in  consumer preferences could imply a structural decline of the demand for hydrocarbons in the medium-long term, an increase in operating costs and a higher risk of stranded assets for Eni.\n\nThe Eni strategy provides for the achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with the provisions of the scenarios compatible with  maintaining  global  warming  within  the  1.5\u00b0C  threshold; furthermore, this strategy sets intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040 in terms of reduction in absolute emissions and carbon intensity. Scenarios adopted by management take into account policies,  regulatory  requirements  and  current  and  expected developments in technology and set out a development path of  the  future  energy  system,  on  the  basis  of  an  economic  and demographic  framework,  analysis  of  existing  and  announced policies and technologies, identifying those which can reasonably reach maturity within the considered time horizon. Price variables reflect  the  best  estimate  by  management  of  the  fundamentals of several energy markets, which incorporates the ongoing and reasonably expected decarbonisation trends, and are subject to continuous benchmarking with the views of market analysts and peers.\n\nSuch  scenarios  represent  the  basis  for  significant  estimates and  judgments  relating  to:  (i)  the  assessment  of  the  intention to  continue  exploration  projects;  (ii)  the  assessment  of  the recoverability of non-current assets and credit exposures towards National  Oil  Companies;  (iii)  the  definition  of  useful  lives  and residual values of fixed assets; (iv) impacts on provisions.\n\nFor  further  information  on  sensitivity  analyses  performed  on\n\nthe values of assets considering the low carbon scenarios of international bodies, see the Management Report -Consolidated disclosure of Non-Financial Information.\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n## SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  comprise  the  financial statements  of  the  parent  Company  Eni  SpA  and  those  of  its subsidiaries,  being  those  entities  over  which  the  Company  has control, either directly or indirectly, through exposure or rights to their variable returns and the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investees. To have power over an investee, the investor must have existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee, i.e. the activities that significantly affect the investee's returns.\n\nSubsidiaries  are  consolidated,  on  the  basis  of  consistent accounting policies, from the date on which control is obtained until the date that control ceases.\n\nAssets, liabilities, income  and  expenses  of  consolidated subsidiaries are fully recognised with those of the parent in the Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  taking  into  account  the appropriate  eliminations  of  intragroup  transactions  (see  the accounting  policy  for  'Intragroup  transactions');  the  parent's investment  in  each  subsidiary  is  eliminated  against  the corresponding parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary. Noncontrolling  interests  are  presented  separately  on  the  balance sheet within equity; the profit or loss and comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests are presented in specific line items, respectively, in the profit and loss account and in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nTaking into account the lack of any material 4 impact on the representation  of  the  financial  position  and  performance  of the  Group 5 , the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  do  not consolidate:  (i)  some  subsidiaries  that  are  immaterial,  both individually and in the aggregate, and; (ii) subsidiaries acting as sole-operator in the management of oil and gas contracts on behalf of companies participating in a joint project. In the latter case, the activities are financed proportionally based on a budget approved by the participating companies upon presentation of periodical reports of proceeds and expenses. Costs and revenue and other operating data (production, reserves, etc.) of the project, as  well  as  the  related  obligations  arising  from  the  project,  are recognised directly in the financial statements of the companies involved based on their own share.\n\nWhen the proportion of the equity held by non-controlling interests changes, any difference between the consideration paid/received and the amount by which the related non-controlling interests are  adjusted  is  attributed  to  Eni  owners'  equity.

Any  investment retained in the former subsidiary is recognised at its fair value at the date when control is lost and shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria.\n\n## INTERESTS IN JOINT ARRANGEMENTS\n\nJoint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities  require  the  unanimous  consent  of  the  parties  sharing control.\n\nA  joint  venture  is  a  joint  arrangement  whereby  the  parties  that have  joint  control  of  the  arrangement  have  rights  to  the  net assets  of  the  arrangement.  Investments  in  joint  ventures  are accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  as  described  in  the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have enforceable rights to the assets,  and  enforceable  obligations  for  the  liabilities,  relating to  the  arrangement;  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements, Eni  recognises  its  share  of  the  assets/liabilities  and  revenues/ expenses  of  joint  operations  on  the  basis  of  its  rights  and obligations relating to the arrangements.\n\nAfter  the  initial  recognition,  the  assets/liabilities  and  revenues/ expenses of the joint operations are measured in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria. Immaterial joint operations structured through a separate vehicle are accounted for using the equity method or, if this does not result in a misrepresentation of the Company's financial position and performance, at cost less any impairment losses.\n\nInvestments  in  joint  ventures  previously  classified  as  joint operations  are  measured  on  the  date  of  change  in  the classification  of  the  joint  arrangement  at  the  net  amount  of the  carrying  amounts  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  that  Eni  had previously recognised, line by line, on the basis of its rights and obligations relating to the arrangement.\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES\n\nAn associate is an entity over which Eni has significant influence, that  is  the  power  to  participate  in  the  financial  and  operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of  those  policies.  Investments  in  associates  are  accounted  for\n\nusing the equity method as described in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. Investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are presented separately in the annex 'List of companies owned by Eni SpA as of December 31, 2021'. This annex includes also the changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\n## THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING\n\nInvestments  in  joint  ventures,  associates  and  immaterial unconsolidated  subsidiaries,  are  accounted  for  using  the equity method 7 .\n\nUnder the equity method, investments are initially recognised at  cost,  allocating  it,  similarly  to  business  combinations procedures, to the investee's identifiable assets/liabilities; any excess of the cost of the investment over the share of the net fair  value  of  the  investee's  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities is  accounted  for  as  goodwill,  not  separately  recognised  but included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment.  If  this allocation  is  provisionally  recognised  at  initial  recognition, it can be retrospectively adjusted within one year from the acquisition  date,  to  reflect  new  information  obtained  about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Subsequently,  the  carrying  amount  is  adjusted  to  reflect:  (i) the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization  and  any  impairment  losses  of  the  equityaccounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of  acquisition;  and  (ii)  the  investor's  share  of  the  investee's other  comprehensive  income.  Distributions  received  from an equity-accounted investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. In applying the equity method, consolidation adjustments  are  considered  (see  also  the  accounting  policy for  'Subsidiaries').  Losses  arising  from  the  application  of the  equity  method  in  excess  of  the  carrying  amount  of  the investment, recognised in the profit and loss account within 'Income  (Expense)  from  investments',  reduce  the  carrying amount,  net  of  the  related  expected  credit  losses  (see below), of any financing receivables towards the investee for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable  future  (the  so-called  long-term  interests),  which are, in substance, an extension of the investment in the investee. The  investor's  share  of  any  losses  of  an  equity-accounted investee that exceeds the carrying amount of the investment and any long-term interests (the so-called net investment), is recognised in a specific provision only to the extent that the investor has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nWhenever  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment  (e.g. relevant  breaches  of  contracts,  significant  financial  difficulty,\n\n(7) Joint ventures, associates and immaterial unconsolidated subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less any impairment losses, if this does not result in a misrepresentation of the Company's financial position and performance.",

When  an  impairment loss  no  longer  exists  or  has  decreased,  any  reversal  of  the impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account within  'Income  (Expense)  from  investments'. The  impairment reversal of the net investment shall not exceed the previously recognised impairment losses.\n\nThe  sale  of  equity  interests  with  loss  of  joint  control  or significant  influence  over  the  investee  determines  the recognition in the profit and loss account of: (i) any gain or loss calculated as the difference between the consideration received  and  the  corresponding  transferred  share;  (ii)  any gain or loss recognised as a result of the remeasurement of  any  investment  retained  in  the  former  joint  venture/ associate at its fair value 8 ;  and  (iii)  any  amount  related  to the  former  joint  venture/associate  previously  recognised in  other  comprehensive  income  which  may  be  reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account 9 . Any investment retained in the former joint venture/associate is recognised at its fair value at the date when joint control or significant influence  is  lost  and  shall  be  accounted  for  in  accordance with the applicable measurement criteria.\n\n## BUSINESS COMBINATION\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for  by  applying  the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes also the fair value of any assets or liabilities resulting from contingent considerations, contractually agreed and dependent upon  the  occurrence  of  specified  future  events.  Acquisition\n\nrelated costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred. The acquirer shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values 10 , unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs. The excess of  the  consideration transferred over the Group's share of the acquisition-date  fair  values  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised, on the balance sheet, as goodwill; conversely, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAny non-controlling interests are measured as the proportionate  share  in  the  recognised  amounts  of  the\n\nacquiree's  identifiable  net  assets  at  the  acquisition  date excluding the portion of goodwill attributable to them (partial goodwill  method).  In  a  business  combination  achieved  in stages,  the  purchase  price  is  determined  by  summing  the acquisition-date fair value of previously held equity interests in the acquiree and the consideration transferred for obtaining control; the previously held equity interests are remeasured at  their  acquisition-date  fair  value  and  the  resulting  gain or loss, if  any,  is  recognized  in  the  profit  and  loss  account. Furthermore, on obtaining control, any amount recognised in other comprehensive income related to the previously held equity interests is reclassified to the profit and loss account, or in another item of equity when such amount may not be reclassified to the profit and loss account.\n\nIf the  initial  accounting  for  a  business  combination  is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination  occurs,  the  provisional  amounts  recognised  at the  acquisition  date  shall  be  retrospectively  adjusted  within one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe acquisition of interests in a joint operation whose activity constitutes a business is accounted for applying the principles on business combinations accounting. In this regard, if the entity obtains control over a business that was a joint operation, the previously held interest in the joint operation is remeasured at the acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account 11 .\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgments: investments and business\n\nThe  assessment  of  the  existence  of  control,  joint  control, significant  influence  over  an  investee,  as  well  as  for  joint operations,  the  assessment  of  the  existence  of  enforceable rights to the investee's assets and enforceable obligations for the investee's liabilities imply that management makes complex judgments on the basis of the characteristics of the investee's structure,  arrangements  between  parties  and  other  relevant facts and circumstances. Significant accounting estimates by management are  required  also  for  measuring  the  identifiable assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business combination  at  their  acquisition-date  fair  values.  For  such measurement, to be performed also for the application of the equity  method,  Eni  adopts  the  valuation  techniques  generally used by market participants taking into account the available information; for the most significant business combinations, Eni engages external independent evaluators.",

Unrealised profits arising from transactions between the Group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the equity-accounted entity. In both cases, unrealised losses are not eliminated as the transaction provides evidence of an impairment loss of the asset transferred.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  foreign  operations  having  a functional  currency  other  than  the  euro,  that  represents  the parent's functional currency as well as the presentation currency of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  are  translated  into euros using the spot exchange rates on the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, historical exchange rates for equity and average exchange rates for the profit and loss account and the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe cumulative resulting exchange differences are presented in  the  separate  component  of  Eni  owners'  equity  'Cumulative currency  translation  differences' 12 . Cumulative  amount  of exchange  differences  relating  to  a  foreign  operation  are\n\nreclassified  to  the  profit  and  loss  account  when  the  entity disposes the entire interest in that foreign operation or when the  partial  disposal  involves  the  loss  of  control,  joint  control or significant influence over the foreign operation. On a partial disposal that does not involve loss of control of a subsidiary that  includes  a  foreign  operation,  the  proportionate  share  of the  cumulative  exchange  differences  is  reattributed  to  the non-controlling interests in that foreign operation. On a partial disposal of interests in joint arrangements or in associates that does not involve loss of joint control or significant influence, the proportionate share of the cumulative exchange differences is reclassified  to  the  profit  and  loss  account.  The  repayment  of share capital made by a subsidiary having a functional currency other than the euro, without a change in the ownership interest, implies that the proportionate share of the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to the subsidiary is reclassified to the profit and loss account.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  foreign  operations  which  are translated into euro are denominated in the foreign operations' functional currencies which generally is the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe  main  foreign  exchange  rates  used  to  translate  the financial statements into the parent's functional currency are indicated below:\n\n| (currency amount for 1\u20ac)   |   Annual average  exchange rate  2021 |   Exchange rate  at December  31, 2021 |   Annual average  exchange  rate 2020 |   Exchange rate  at December  31, 2020 |   Annual average  exchange  rate 2019 |   Exchange rate  at December  31, 2019 |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| U.S. Dollar                |                                  1.18 |                                   1.13 |                                  1.14 |                                   1.23 |                                  1.12 |                                   1.12 |\n| Pound Sterling             |                                  0.86 |                                   0.84 |                                  0.89 |                                   0.9  |                                  0.88 |                                   0.85 |\n| Australian Dollar          |                                  1.57 |                                   1.56 |                                  1.66 |                                   1.59 |                                  1.61 |                                   1.6  |\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe  most  significant  accounting  policies  used  in  the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are described below.\n\n## OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION, APPRAISAL, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES\n\nOil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development activities  are  accounted  for  using  the  principles  of  the successful  efforts  method  of  accounting  as  described below.\n\n## ACQUISITION OF EXPLORATION RIGHTS\n\nCosts  incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  exploration  rights\n\n(or  their  extension)  are  initially  capitalised  within  the  line item 'Intangible assets' as 'exploration rights - unproved' pending  determination  of  whether  the  exploration  and appraisal activities in the reference areas are successful or not. Unproved exploration rights are not amortised, but reviewed  to  confirm  that  there  is  no  indication  that  the carrying  amount  exceeds  the  recoverable  amount.  This review is based on the confirmation of the commitment of the Company to continue the exploration activities and on the analysis of facts and circumstances that indicate the absence of uncertainties related to the recoverability of the carrying amount. If no future activity is planned, the carrying amount of the related exploration rights is recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Lower value exploration rights  are  pooled  and  amortised  on  a  straight-line  basis over  the  estimated  period  of  exploration.  In  the  event  of a  discovery  of  proved  reserves  (i.e.  upon  recognition  of proved reserves and internal approval for development), the",

Upon  reclassification,  as  well  as whether there is any indication of impairment, the carrying amount  of  exploration  rights  to  reclassify  as  proved  is tested for impairment considering the higher of their value in use and their fair value less costs of disposal. From the commencement  of  production,  proved  exploration  rights are amortised according to the unit of production method (the  so-called  UOP  method,  described  in  the  accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\n## ACQUISITION OF MINERAL INTERESTS\n\nCosts incurred for the acquisition of mineral interests are capitalised in connection with the assets acquired (such as exploration  potential,  possible  and  probable  reserves  and proved reserves). When the acquisition is related to a set of exploration potential and reserves, the cost is allocated to  the  different  assets  acquired  based  on  their  expected discounted cash flows.\n\nAcquired exploration potential is measured in accordance with  the  criteria  illustrated  in  the  accounting  policy  for 'Acquisition  of  exploration  rights'.  Costs  associated  with proved  reserves  are  amortised  according  to  the  UOP method (see the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation'). Expenditure associated with possible and probable reserves (unproved mineral interests) is not amortised until classified as proved reserves; in case of a negative result of the subsequent appraisal activities, it is written off.\n\n## EXPLORATION AND APPRAISAL EXPENDITURE\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\nCosts  directly  associated  with  an  exploration  well  are initially  recognised  within  tangible  assets  in  progress,  as 'exploration  and  appraisal  costs  -  unproved'  (exploration wells in progress) until the drilling of the well is completed and can continue to be capitalised in the following 12-month period pending the evaluation of drilling results (suspended exploration wells). If, at the end of this period, it is ascertained that the result is negative (no hydrocarbon found) or that the  discovery  is  not  sufficiently  significant  to  justify  the development, the wells are declared dry/unsuccessful and the  related  costs  are  written-off.  Conversely,  these  costs continue to be capitalised if and until: (i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, and (ii) the entity is making sufficient progress assessing  the  reserves  and  the  economic  and  operating viability of the project; on the contrary, the capitalised costs are recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Analogous  recognition  criteria  are  adopted  for  the  costs related to the appraisal activity. When proved reserves of oil\n\nand/or natural gas are determined, the relevant expenditure recognised as unproved is reclassified to proved exploration and  appraisal  costs  within  tangible  assets  in  progress. Upon  reclassification,  or  when  there  is  any  indication  of impairment, the carrying amount of the costs to reclassify as proved is tested for impairment considering the higher of their value in use and their fair value less costs of disposal. From the commencement of production, proved exploration and appraisal costs are depreciated according to the UOP method (see the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\n## DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n\nDevelopment  costs, including the costs related to unsuccessful and damaged  development  wells,  are capitalised  as  'Tangible  asset  in  progress  -  proved'. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  and  to  provide  facilities  for  extracting,  treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. They are amortised, from  the  commencement  of  production,  generally  on  a UOP basis. When development projects are unfeasible/not carried on, the related costs are written off when it is decided to abandon the project. Development costs are tested for impairment in accordance with the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\n## UOP DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTISATION\n\nProved oil and gas assets are depreciated generally under the UOP method, as their useful life is closely related to the availability  of  proved  oil  and  gas  reserves,  by  applying,  to the depreciable amounts at the end of each quarter a rate representing the ratio between the volumes extracted during the quarter and the reserves existing at the end of the quarter, increased by the volumes extracted during the quarter. This method is applied with reference to the smallest aggregate representing a direct correlation between expenditures to be depreciated and oil and gas reserves. Proved exploration rights and acquired proved mineral interests are amortised over  proved  reserves;  proved  exploration  and  appraisal costs  and  development  costs  are  depreciated  over proved  developed  reserves,  while  common  facilities  are depreciated  over  total  proved  reserves.  Proved  reserves are determined according to US SEC rules that require the use of the yearly average oil and gas prices for assessing the  economic  producibility;  material  changes  in  reference prices could result in depreciation charges not reflecting the pattern in which the assets' future economic benefits are expected to be consumed to the extent that, for example, certain non-current assets would be fully depreciated within a  short-term.  In  these  cases  the  reserves  considered  in determining the UOP rate are estimated on the basis of economic viability  parameters,  reasonable  and  consistent with  management's  expectations  of  production,  in  order",

Revenues from the sale of the lifted production, against both Cost Oil and Profit Oil, are accounted for on an accrual basis, whilst exploration, development  and  production  costs  are  accounted  for according  to  the  above-mentioned  accounting  policies. The Company's share of production volumes and reserves includes the share of hydrocarbons that corresponds to the taxes to be paid, according to the contractual agreement, by the national government on behalf of the Company. As a consequence, the Company has to recognise at the same time an increase in the taxable profit, through the increase of the revenue, and a tax expense.\n\nA similar scheme applies to service contracts.\n\n## PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT OF WELLS\n\nCosts expected to be incurred with respect to the plugging and  abandonment  of  a  well,  dismantlement  and  removal of  production  facilities,  as  well  as  site  restoration,  are capitalised, consistent with the accounting policy described under 'Property, plant and equipment', and then depreciated on a UOP basis.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgments: oil and natural gas activities\n\nEngineering  estimates  of  the  Company's  oil  and  gas reserves  are  inherently  uncertain.  Proved  reserves  are the  estimated volumes of crude oil, natural gas and gas condensates,  liquids  and  associated  substances  which geological and engineering data demonstrate that can be economically  producible  with  reasonable  certainty  from known  reservoirs  under  existing  economic  conditions and  operating  methods.  Although  there  are  authoritative guidelines  regarding  the  engineering  and  geological criteria  that  must  be  met  before  estimated  oil  and  gas reserves  can  be  categorised  as  'proved',  the  accuracy of  reserve  estimates  depends  on  a  number  of  factors, assumptions  and  variables,  including:  (i)  the  quality  of\n\navailable  geological,  technical  and  economic  data  and their interpretation and judgment; (ii) projections regarding future  rates  of  production  and  operating  costs  and development costs; (iii) changes in the prevailing tax rules, other government regulations and contractual conditions; (iv)  results  of  drilling,  testing  and  the  actual  production performance  of  Company's  reservoirs  after  the  date  of the  estimates  which  may  drive  substantial  upward  or downward revisions; and (v) changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices which could affect expected future cash flows  and  the  quantities  of  Company's  proved  reserves since  the  estimates  of  reserves  are  based  on  prices and costs existing as of the date when these estimates are  made.  Lower  oil  prices  or  the  projections  of  higher operating and development costs may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.\n\nMany of the factors, assumptions and variables involved in estimating proved reserves are subject to change over time and therefore affect the estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. Similar uncertainties concern unproved reserves. The  determination  of  whether  potentially  economic  oil and  natural  gas  reserves  have  been  discovered  by  an exploration well is made within a year after well completion. The  evaluation  process  of  a  discovery,  which  requires performing additional appraisal activities on the potential oil  and  natural  gas  field  and  establishing  the  optimum development  plans,  can  take  longer,  in  most  cases, depending on the complexity of the project and on the size of  capital  expenditures  required.  During  this  period,  the costs related to these exploration wells remain suspended on the balance sheet. In any case, all such capitalised costs are  reviewed,  at  least,  on  an  annual  basis  to  confirm  the continued intent to develop, or otherwise to extract value from the discovery.\n\nField  reserves  will  be  categorised  as  proved  only  when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met.  Proved  reserves  can  be  classified  as  developed  or undeveloped. Volumes are classified into proved developed reserves  as  a  consequence  of  development  activity. Generally, reserves are booked as proved developed at the start  of  production.  Major  development  projects  typically take one to four years from the time of initial booking to the start of production.\n\nEstimated  proved  reserves  are  used  in  determining depreciation,  amortisation  and  depletion  charges  (see the  accounting  policy  for  'UOP  depreciation,  depletion and  amortisation').  Assuming  all  other  variables  are  held constant,  an  increase  in  estimated  proved  developed reserves for each field decreases depreciation, amortisation and depletion charge under the UOP method. Conversely, a decrease in estimated proved developed reserves increases depreciation, amortisation and depletion charge.",

For assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to  get  ready  for  their  intended  use,  the  purchase  price  or construction cost comprises the borrowing costs incurred in the period to get the asset ready for use that would have been avoided if the expenditure had not been made.\n\nIn  the  case  of  a  present  obligation  for  dismantling  and removal of assets and restoration of sites, the initial carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the estimated (discounted) costs to be incurred when the removal event occurs; a corresponding amount is recognised as part of a specific provision (see the accounting policy for 'Decommissioning  and  restoration  liabilities').  Analogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects in oil and gas development areas.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are not revalued for financial reporting purposes.\n\nExpenditures  on  upgrading,  revamping  and  reconversion are  recognised  as  items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment when it is probable that they will increase the expected future economic benefits of the asset. Assets acquired for safety or environmental  reasons,  although  not  directly  increasing  the future  economic  benefits  of  any  particular  existing  item  of property, plant and equipment, qualify for recognition as assets when they are necessary for running the business.\n\nDepreciation of tangible assets begins when they are available for  use,  i.e.  when  they  are  in  the  location  and  condition necessary for it to be capable of operating as planned. Property, plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  on  a  systematic  basis over their useful life. The useful life is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by the Company. When tangible assets are composed of more than one significant part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately. The depreciable amount is the asset's carrying amount less its residual value at the end of its useful life, if it is significant and can be reasonably determined. Land is not depreciated, even when acquired together with a building. Tangible assets held for sale are not depreciated (see the accounting policy for\n\n'Assets held for sale and discontinued operations'). Changes in the asset's useful life, in its residual value or in the pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for prospectively.\n\nAssets  to  be  handed  over  for  no  consideration  are depreciated over the shorter term between the duration of the concession or the asset's useful life.\n\nReplacement costs of identifiable parts in complex assets are  capitalised  and  depreciated  over  their  useful  life; the  residual  carrying  amount  of  the  part  that  has  been substituted is charged to the profit and loss account. Nonremovable  leasehold  improvements  are  depreciated  over the earlier of the useful life of the improvements and the lease  term.  Expenditures  for  ordinary  maintenance  and repairs are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is derecognised  on  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal; the arising gain or loss is recognized in the profit and loss account.\n\n## LEASING 13\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration 14 ;  such  right  exists whether,  throughout  the  period  of  use,  the  customer  has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset and the right to direct the use of the identified asset.\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date on which the underlying asset is available for use), a lessee recognises on the balance sheet an asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset (hereinafter also referred as right-of-use asset) and a liability representing its obligation to make lease payments  during  the  lease  term  (hereinafter  also  referred  as lease liability 15 ). The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a contract, together with, if reasonably certain, periods covered by extension options or by the non-exercise of termination options. In particular, the lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the following lease payments 16 that are not  paid  at  the  commencement  date:  (i)  fixed  payments (including  in-substance  fixed  payments),  less  any  lease incentives  receivable;  (ii)  variable  lease  payments  that depend on an index or a rate 17 ;  (iii)  amounts  expected  to\n\n- (13) As expressly provided for in IFRS 16, this accounting policy does not apply to leases to explore for and extract resources such as those for oil and gas rights, leases of land and any rights of way related to oil and gas activities.\n- (14) The assessment of whether the contract is, or contains, a lease is performed at the inception date, that is the earlier of the date of a lease agreement and the date of commitment by the parties to the principal terms and conditions of the lease.\n- (15) Eni applies the recognition exemptions allowed for short-term leases (for certain classes of underlying assets) and low-value leases, by recognising the lease payments associated with those leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n- (16) Eni, in accordance with the practical expedient allowed by the accounting standard, does not separate non-lease components from lease components except for main contracts related to upstream activities (drilling rigs), which provide for single payments relating to both lease and non-lease components.\n- (17) Conversely, the other kinds of variable lease payments (e.g. payments that depend on the use of an underlying leased asset) are not included in the carrying amount of the lease liability, but are recognised in the profit and loss account as operating expenses over the lease term.",

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate  implicit  in  the  lease  or,  if  that  rate  cannot  be  readily determined,  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate.  The latter is determined considering the term of the lease, the frequency and currency of the contractual lease payments, as well as the features of the lessee's economic environment (reflected  in  the  country  risk  premium  assigned  to  each country where Eni operates).\n\nAfter  the  initial  recognition,  the  lease  liability  is  measured on an amortised cost basis and is remeasured, normally, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related rightof-use asset, to reflect changes to the lease payments due, essentially,  to:  (i)  modifications  in  the  lease  contract  not accounted as a separate lease; (ii)  changes  in  indexes  or rates  (used  to  determine  the  variable  lease  payments);  or (iii) changes in the assessment of contractual options (e.g. options  to  purchase  the  underlying  asset,  extension  or termination options).\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially  measured  at  cost,  which comprises:  (i)  the  amount  of  the  initial  measurement  of the lease liability; (ii) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee 18 ;  (iii)  any  lease  payments  made  at  or  before  the commencement  date,  less  any  lease  incentives  received; and (iv) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of  the  lease.  After  the  initial  recognition,  the  right-of-use asset  is  adjusted  for  any  accumulated  depreciation 19 , any  accumulated  impairment  losses  (see  the  accounting policy  for  'Impairment  of  non-financial  assets')  and  any remeasurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe depreciation charges of the right-of-use asset and the interest expenses on the lease liability directly attributable to the construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset and subsequently recognised in the profit  and  loss  account through depreciation/impairments or write-off, mainly in the case of exploration assets.\n\nIn the oil and gas activities, the operator of an unincorporated joint operation which enters into a lease contract as the sole signatory  recognises  on  the  balance  sheet:  (i)  the  entire lease  liability  if,  based  on  the  contractual  provisions  and any other relevant facts and circumstances, it has primary responsibility for the liability towards the third-party supplier;\n\nand (ii) the entire right-of-use asset, unless, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the contract, there is a sublease with the followers.\n\nThe  followers'  share  of  the  right-of-use  asset,  recognised by  the  operator,  will  be  recovered  according  to  the  joint operation's contractual arrangements by billing the project costs  attributable  to  the  followers  and  collecting  the related cash calls. Costs recovered from the followers are recognised  as  'Other  income  and  revenues'  in  the  profit and loss account and as net cash provided by operating activities in the statement of cash flows.\n\nDifferently, if a lease contract is signed by all the partners, Eni recognises its share of the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet based on its working interest. If Eni does not have primary responsibility for the lease liability and, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the contract, there is not a sublease, it does not recognise any right-ofuse asset and lease liability related to the lease contract.\n\nWhen lease contracts are entered into by companies other than  subsidiaries  that  act  as  operators  on  behalf  of  the other  participating  companies  (the  so-called  operating companies), consistent with the provision to recover from the followers the costs related to the oil and gas activities, the  participating  companies  recognise  their  share  of  the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities based on their working interest, defined according to the expected use, to the extent that it is reliably determinable, of the underlying assets.\n\n## Significant  accounting  estimates  and  judgments:  lease transactions\n\nWith  reference  to  lease  contracts,  management  makes significant estimates and judgments  related to: (i) determining  the  lease  term,  making  assumptions  about the  exercise  of  extension  and/or  termination  options;  (ii) determining  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing  rate;  (iii) identifying  and,  where  appropriate,  separating  non-lease components from lease components, where an observable stand-alone price is not readily available, taking into account also  the  analysis  performed  with  external  experts;  (iv) recognising lease contracts, for which the underlying assets are  used  in  oil  and  gas  activities  (mainly  drilling  rigs  and FPSOs), entered into as operator within an unincorporated joint  operation,  considering  if  the  operator  has  primary responsibility for the liability towards the third-party supplier and the relationships with the followers; (v) identifying the variable  lease  payments  and  the  related  characteristics in order to include them in the measurement of the lease liability.",

An asset is classified as intangible when management is able to distinguish it clearly from goodwill. Intangible assets are initially recognized at cost as determined by the criteria used for tangible assets and they are never revalued for financial reporting purposes.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a systematic basis over their useful life; the amount to be amortised and the recoverability of the carrying amount are determined in accordance with the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\nGoodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives are  not  amortised.  For  the  recoverability  of  the  carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of non-financial assets'. Costs of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognised on the balance sheet if the Company expects to recover those costs. The intangible asset arising from those costs is amortised on a systematic basis, that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, and is tested for impairment.\n\nCosts of technological development activities are capitalised when: (i)  the  cost  attributable  to  the  development  activity can  be  measured  reliably;  (ii)  there  is  the  intention  and the  availability  of  financial  and  technical  resources  to make the asset available for use or sale; and (iii) it can be demonstrated that the asset is able to generate probable future economic benefits.\n\nThe carrying amount of intangible assets is derecognised on  disposal  or  when  no  future  economic  benefits  are expected from its use or disposal; any arising gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nNon-financial assets (tangible assets, intangible assets and right-of-use  assets)  are  tested  for  impairment  whenever events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the carrying amounts for those assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability assessment is performed for each cash generating  unit  (hereinafter  also  CGU)  represented  by  the smallest  identifiable  group  of  assets  that  generate  cash inflows  that  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash  inflows from other assets or group of assets.\n\nCGUs may include corporate assets which do not generate\n\ncash inflows independently of other assets or group of assets, allocable  on  a  reasonable  and  consistent  basis.  Corporate assets  not  attributable  to  a  single  CGU  are  allocated  to  a group  of  CGUs.  Goodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  at  least annually, and whenever there is any indication of impairment, at the lowest level within the entity at which it is monitored for internal  management  purposes.  Right-of-use  assets,  which generally do not generate cash inflows independently of other assets or groups of assets, are allocated to the CGU to which they  belong;  the  right-of-use  assets  which  cannot  be  fully attributed to a CGU are considered as corporate assets. The recoverability of the carrying amount of common facilities within the E&P operating segment is assessed by considering the set of recoverable amounts of the CGUs benefiting from the common facility.\n\nThe  recoverability  of  a  CGU  is  assessed  by  comparing  its carrying  amount  with  the  recoverable  amount,  which  is  the higher of the CGU's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of the CGU and, if significant  and  reliably  measurable,  the  cash  flows  expected to  be  obtained  from  its  disposal  at  the  end  of  its  useful  life, after deducting the costs of disposal. The expected cash flows are determined on the basis of reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the CGU, giving greater weight to external evidence. The value in use of CGUs which include material right-of-use assets is calculated, normally, by ignoring lease payments included  in  the  measurement  of  the  lease  liabilities.  With reference to commodity prices, management uses the price scenario  adopted  for  economic  and  financial  projections and for the evaluation of investments over their entire life. In particular, for the cash flows associated with oil, natural gas  and  petroleum  products  prices  (and  prices  derived from  them),  the  price  scenario  is  approved  by  the  Board of  Directors  (see  'Significant  accounting  estimates  and judgments used to take into account the impacts of climaterelated risks').\n\nFor  impairment  test  purposes,  cash  outflows  expected to  be  incurred  to  guarantee  compliance  with  laws  and regulations regarding CO 2 emissions (e.g. Emission Trading Scheme) or on a voluntary basis (e.g. cash outflows related to forestry certificates acquired or produced consistent with the Company's decarbonization strategy - hereinafter also forestry) are taken into account.\n\nIn particular, in estimating value in use, the cash outflows for forestry projects 20 are included, consistent with the targets of the decarbonization strategy, within the expected operating cash outflows; in this regard, considering that the forestry",

        "page_content": "projects  can  be  developed  in  countries  where  Eni  does not  carry  out  operating  activities  and  given  the  difficulty  to allocate such cash outflows, on a reasonable and consistent basis, to CGUs of the relevant operating segment, the related discounted cash outflows are treated as a reduction of the headroom of the E&P operating segment.\n\nFor the determination of value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects a current market assessment of the time value of money and of the risks specific to the asset that are not reflected in the estimated future cash flows.  In  particular,  the  discount  rate  used  is  the  Weighted Average  Cost  of  Capital  (WACC)  adjusted  for  the  specific country  risk  of  the  CGU.  These  adjustments  are  measured considering  information  from  external  parties.  WACC  differs considering the risk associated with each operating segment/ business where the asset operates. In particular, for the assets belonging to the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP) operating segment,  the  Chemical  business,  the  Power  business  and Retail  &  Renewables  business,  the  riskiness  is  determined on the basis of a sample of comparable companies. For the E&P  operating  segment  and  R&M  business,  the  riskiness  is determined, on a residual basis, as the difference between the risk of Eni as a whole and the risk of other operating segments/ businesses. Value in use is calculated net of the tax effect as this method results in values similar to those resulting from discounting  pre-tax  cash  flows  at  a  pre-tax  discount  rate derived, through an iteration process, from a post-tax valuation. When  the  carrying  amount  of  the  CGU,  including  goodwill allocated thereto, determined  taking  into  account  any impairment loss of the non-current assets belonging to the CGU, exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess is recognised as an impairment loss. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill; any remaining excess is allocated to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of  the  carrying  amount  of  each  asset  in  the  CGU,  up  to  the related recoverable amount.\n\nWhen an impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, a reversal of the impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account. The impairment reversal shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period 21 .\n\n## GRANTS RELATED TO ASSETS\n\nGovernment  grants  related  to  assets  are  recognized  by deducting them in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets when there is reasonable assurance that the\n\nCompany will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received.\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\nInventories, including compulsory stock, are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale, or, with reference to inventories of crude oil and petroleum products already  included  in  binding  sale  contracts,  the  contractual selling  price.  Inventories  which  are  principally  acquired  with the  purpose  of  selling  in  the  near  future  and  generating  a profit  from  fluctuations  in  price  are  measured  at  fair  value less costs to sell and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account. Materials and other supplies held for use in production are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.\n\nThe  cost  of  inventories  of  hydrocarbons  (crude  oil, condensates and natural gas) and petroleum products is determined by applying the weighted average cost method on a three-month basis, or on a different time period (e.g. monthly), when it is justified by the use and the turnover of inventories  of  crude  oil  and  petroleum  products;  the  cost of inventories of the Chemical business is determined by applying the weighted average cost on an annual basis.\n\nWhen  take-or-pay  clauses  are  included  in  long-term  gas purchase  contracts,  pre-paid  gas  volumes  that  are  not withdrawn to fulfill minimum annual take obligations are measured using the pricing formulas contractually defined. They  are  recognised  within  'Other  assets'  as  \"Deferred costs', as a contra to 'Trade and other payables' or, after settlement,  to  'Cash  and  cash  equivalents'. The  allocated deferred costs are charged to the profit and loss account: (i)  when  natural  gas  is  actually  withdrawn  -  the  related cost  is  included  in  the  determination  of  the  weighted average cost of  inventories;  and  (ii)  for  the  portion  which is not recoverable, when it is not possible to withdraw the previously  pre-paid  gas  within  the  contractually  defined deadlines.  Furthermore,  the  allocated  deferred  costs  are tested for economic recoverability by comparing the related carrying amount and their net realisable value, determined adopting the same criteria described for inventories.\n\nSignificant accounting estimates and judgments: impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe  recoverability  of  non-financial  assets  is  assessed",

Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain and complex matters such as future commodity prices, future discount  rates,  future  development  costs  and  production costs, the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses, production profiles and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions also with reference to the decarbonization process and the effects of changes in regulatory requirements. The definition of CGUs and the identification of their appropriate grouping for the purpose of testing for impairment the carrying amount of  goodwill,  corporate  assets  as  well  as  common  facilities within  the  E&P  operating  segment,  require  judgment  by management. In particular, CGUs are identified considering, inter alia, how management monitors the entity's operations (such  as  by  business  lines)  or  how  management  makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations.\n\nSimilar  remarks  are  valid  for  assessing  the  physical recoverability  of  assets  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet (deferred  costs  -  see  also  the  accounting  policy  for 'Inventories') related to natural gas volumes not withdrawn under  long-term  supply  contracts  with  take-or-pay  clauses. The expected future cash flows used for impairment analyses are based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, prices and costs, considering available information at the date of review and are discounted using a rate which considers the risks specific to the asset.\n\nFor oil and natural gas properties, the expected future cash flows are estimated based on proved and probable reserves, including, among other elements, production taxes and the costs to be incurred for the reserves yet to be developed. In limited cases (e.g. for mineral interests acquired from third parties as part of a business combination) the expected cash flows may take into account also the risk-adjusted possible reserves, if they are considered to determine the consideration transferred. The estimate of the future rates of production is based on assumptions related to future commodity prices, operating costs, lifting and development costs, field decline rates, market demand and other factors.\n\nMore  details  on  the  main  assumptions  underlying  the\n\ndetermination  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  tangible, intangible  and  right-of-use  assets  are  set  out  in  note  15 - Impairment review of tangible and intangible assets and right-of-use assets.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nFinancial  assets  are  classified,  on  the  basis  of  both contractual  cash  flow  characteristics  and  the  entity's business  model  for  managing  them,  in  the  following categories:  (i)  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised cost;  (ii)  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through other  comprehensive  income  (hereinafter  also  OCI);  (iii) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (hereinafter also FVTPL).\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  a  financial  asset  is  measured  at  its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction  costs  that  are  directly  attributable;  at  initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing  component  are  measured  at  their  transaction price.\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets whose contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (the so-called hold to collect business model). For financial assets measured at  amortised  cost,  interest  income  determined  using  the effective  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange  differences  and any  impairment  losses 22 (see  the  accounting  policy  for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nConversely,  financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments are  measured  at  fair  value  through  OCI  (hereinafter  also FVTOCI) if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows  and  selling  financial  assets  (the  so-called  hold  to collect and sell business model). In these cases: (i) interest income determined using the effective interest rate, foreign exchange differences and any impairment losses (see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account;  (ii)  changes  in fair value of the instruments are recognised in equity, within other comprehensive income. The accumulated changes in fair value, recognised in the equity reserve related to other comprehensive income, is reclassified to the profit and loss",

        "page_content": "account when the financial asset is derecognised. Currently the Group does not have any financial assets measured at fair value through OCI.\n\nA  financial  asset  represented  by  a  debt  instrument  that is  neither  measured  at  amortised  cost  nor  at  FVTOCI,  is measured  at  FVTPL;  financial  assets  held  for  trading  fall into this category. Interest income on assets held for trading contributes to the fair value measurement of the instrument and  is  recognised  in  'Finance  income  (expense)',  within 'Net  finance  income  (expense)  from  financial  assets  held for trading'.\n\nWhen the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned, the transaction is accounted for on the settlement date.\n\n## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, as well as financial assets originally due, generally, up to three months, readily convertible to known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nThe expected credit loss model is adopted for the impairment of  financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments,  but  are  not measured at FVTPL 23 .\n\nIn  particular,  the  expected  credit  losses  are  generally measured  by  multiplying: (i) the exposure to the counterparty's  credit  risk  net  of  any  collateral  held  and other credit enhancements (Exposure At Default, EAD); (ii) the probability that the default of the counterparty occurs (Probability of Default, PD); and (iii) the percentage estimate of the exposure that will not be recovered in case of default (Loss Given Default, LGD), considering the past experiences and the range of recovery tools that can be activated (e.g. extrajudicial and/or legal proceedings, etc.).\n\nWith  reference  to  trade  and  other  receivables,  Probabilities of Default of counterparties are determined by adopting the internal credit ratings already used for credit worthiness and are periodically reviewed using, inter alia, backtesting analyses; for  government  entities  (e.g.  National  Oil  Companies), the  Probability  of  Default,  represented  essentially  by  the probability of a delayed payment, is determined by using, as input data, the country risk premium adopted to determine WACC for the impairment review of non-financial assets.\n\nFor customers without internal credit ratings, the expected credit  losses  are  measured  by  using  a  provision  matrix, defined  by  grouping,  where  appropriate,  receivables  into adequate clusters to which apply expected loss rates defined on  the  basis  of  their  historical  credit  loss  experiences, adjusted, where appropriate, to take into account forwardlooking  information  on  credit  risk  of  the  counterparty  or clusters of counterparties 24 . Considering the characteristics of  the  reference  markets,  financial  assets  with  more  than 180  days  past  due  or,  in  any  case,  with  counterparties undergoing  litigation,  restructuring  or  renegotiation,  are considered to be in default. Counterparties are considered undergoing litigation when judicial/legal proceedings aimed to recover a receivable have been activated or are going to  be  activated.  Impairment  losses  of  trade  and  other receivables are recognised in the profit and loss account, net of any impairment reversal, within the line item of the profit and loss account 'Net (impairment losses) reversals of trade and other receivables'.\n\nThe  financing  receivables  held  for  operating  purposes, granted  to  associates  and  joint  ventures,  for  which settlement  is  neither  planned  nor  likely  to  occur  in  the foreseeable future and which in substance form part of the entity's  net  investment  in  these  investees,  are  tested  for impairment, first, on the basis of the expected credit loss model and, then, together with the carrying amount of the investment  in  the  associate/joint  venture,  in  accordance with the criteria indicated in the accounting policy for 'The equity  method  of  accounting'.  In  applying  the  expected credit loss model, any adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interest that arise from applying the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting' are not taken into account.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgments: impairment of financial assets\n\nMeasuring impairment losses of financial  assets  requires management evaluation of complex and highly uncertain elements such as, for example, Probabilities of Default of counterparties,  the  assessment  of  any  collateral  or  other credit  enhancements,  the  expected  exposure  that  will  not be recovered in case of default, as well as the definition of customers' clusters to be adopted.\n\nFurther  details  on  the  main  assumptions  underlying  the measurement of expected credit losses of financial assets are provided in note 8 - Trade and other receivables.\n\n(23) The expected credit loss model is also adopted for issued financial guarantee contracts not measured at FVTPL. Expected credit losses recognised on issued financial guarantees are not material.\n\n(24) For credit exposures arising from intragroup transactions, the recovery rate is normally assumed equal to 100% taking into account, inter alia, the Group central treasury function which supports both financial and capital needs of subsidiaries.",

In limited circumstances, an investment in  equity  instruments  can  be  measured  at  cost  if  it  is  an appropriate estimate of fair value.\n\n## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nAt initial recognition, financial liabilities, other than derivative financial  instruments,  are  measured  at  their  fair  value, minus transaction costs that are directly attributable, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe sustainability-linked bonds, i.e. financial liabilities where the interest rate is periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the borrower's performance relative to certain sustainability targets  (the  so-called  ESG  metrics),  are  measured  at amortised cost.\n\nGenerally, changes in the interest rate result in an update of the effective interest rate to be used for the recognition of interest expense.\n\n## Significant judgments: financial liabilities\n\nThe  Group's  companies  can  negotiate  with  suppliers  an extension  of  payment  terms,  without  the  involvement  of a financial institution. In such cases, management judges whether or not payables towards suppliers have to be reclassified as financial liabilities from trade/investing activity payables.  In  order  to  make  such  judgment,  management considers if the payment terms differ from the ones that are customary in the industry, any additional security is provided as part of the arrangement as well as any other facts and circumstances.  The  classification  as  a  financial  liability determines:  (i)  upon  reclassification/initial  recognition  of the  liability,  a  non-monetary  change  in  financial  liabilities, with no impacts on the statement of cash flows; (ii) upon the settlement of the liability, the classification of the payment within net cash used in financing activities.\n\nWith  reference  to  sustainability-linked  bonds,  management assesses  whether  the  non-compliance  with  an  ESG  metric could  adversely  impact  operations  and,  therefore,  revenue generation and creditworthiness of the Company.\n\n## DERIVATIVE  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS  AND  HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\nDerivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives  (see  below)  that  are  separated  from  the  host\n\ncontract,  are  assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  their  fair value.  With  reference  to  the  defined  risk  management objectives  and  strategy,  the  qualifying  criteria  for  hedge accounting  requires:  (i)  the  existence  of  an  economic relationship  between  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging instrument  in  order  to  offset  the  related  value  changes and the effects of counterparty credit risk do not dominate the  economic  relationship  between  the  hedged  item and  the  hedging  instrument;  and  (ii)  the  definition  of  the relationship  between  the  quantity  of  the  hedged  item and the quantity  of  the  hedging  instrument  (the  so-called hedge ratio) consistent with the entity's risk management objectives, under a defined risk management strategy; the hedge ratio is adjusted, where appropriate, after taking into account any adequate rebalancing. A hedging relationship is discontinued prospectively, in its entirety or a part of it, when it no longer meets the risk management objectives on the basis of which it qualified for hedge accounting, it ceases\n\nto meet the other qualifying criteria or after rebalancing it. When derivatives hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of the hedged items (fair value hedge, e.g. hedging of the variability  in  the  fair  value  of  fixed  interest  rate  assets/ liabilities),  the  derivatives  are  measured  at  fair  value through profit and loss. Consistently, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect, in the profit and loss account, the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable  to  the  hedged  risk;  this  applies  even  if  the hedged item should be otherwise measured.\n\nWhen derivatives hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows of the hedged items (cash flow hedge, e.g. hedging the variability in the cash flows of assets/liabilities as a result of the fluctuations of exchange rate), the effective changes in the fair value of the derivatives are initially recognised in the equity reserve related to other comprehensive income and then reclassified to the profit and loss account in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects the profit and loss account.\n\nIf  a  hedged  forecast  transaction  subsequently  results  in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability,  the  accumulated changes in fair value of hedging derivatives, recognised in equity, are included directly in the carrying amount of the hedged non-financial asset/liability (commonly referred to as a 'basis adjustment').\n\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, including any ineffective portion of changes in fair value of hedging derivatives, are recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account.  In  particular, the  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  non-hedging  derivatives on  interest  rates  and  exchange  rates  are  recognised  in the  profit  and  loss  account  line  item  'Finance  income (expense)'; conversely, the changes in the fair value of nonhedging derivatives on commodities are recognised in the profit and loss account line item 'Other operating (expense)",

Derivatives embedded in financial assets are not accounted for separately; in such circumstances, the entire hybrid instrument is classified depending on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial instrument and the business model for managing it (see the accounting policy for  'Financial  assets').  Derivatives  embedded  in  financial liabilities  and/or  non-financial  assets  are  separated  if:  (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; (ii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and (iii) the entire hybrid contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nEni  assesses  the  existence  of  embedded  derivatives  to be  separated  when  it  becomes  party  to  the  contract  and, afterwards, when a change in the terms of the contract that modifies its cash flows occurs.\n\nContracts  to  buy  or  sell  commodities  entered  into  and continued  to  be  held  for  the  purpose  of  their  receipt  or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale  or  usage  requirements  are  recognised  on  an  accrual basis  (the  so-called  normal  sale  and  normal  purchase exemption or own use exemption).\n\n## OFFSETTING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are set off on the balance sheet if the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off and intends to settle on a net basis (or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously).\n\n## DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nTransferred  financial  assets  are  derecognised  when  the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the financial assets expire or are transferred to another party. Financial liabilities  are  derecognised when they are extinguished, or when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\nA provision is a liability  of  uncertain  timing  or  amount  on the  balance  sheet  date.  Provisions  are  recognised  when: (i)  there is a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) the amount of the obligation can  be  reliably  estimated.  The  amount  recognised  as  a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation or to transfer it to third parties on  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  amount  recognised  for\n\nonerous contracts is the lower of the cost necessary to fulfill the obligations, net of expected economic benefits deriving from  the  contracts,  and  any  compensation  or  penalties arising  from  failure  to  fulfill  these  obligations.  Where  the effect of the time value is material, and the payment date of the obligations can be reasonably estimated, provisions to  be  accrued  are  the  present  value  of  the  expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation at a discount rate  that  reflects  the  Company's  average  borrowing  rate taking into account the risks associated with the obligation. The  change  in  provisions  due  to  the  passage  of  time  is recognised within 'Finance income (expense)'.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognised only when the Company has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in the affected parties that it will carry out the restructuring.\n\nProvisions are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes  in  the  estimates  of  costs,  timing  and  discount rates.  Changes  in  provisions  are  recognised  in  the  same profit and loss account line item where the original provision was charged.\n\nContingent  liabilities  are:  (i)  possible  obligations  arising from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company; or (ii)  present obligations arising from past events, whose amount cannot be reliably measured or whose settlement will probably not result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in  the  financial  statements  but  are  disclosed.  Contingent assets, that are possible assets arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not  wholly  within  the  control  of  the  Company,  are  not recognised in financial statements unless the realisation of economic benefits is virtually certain. Contingent assets are disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed periodically to ensure that developments  are  appropriately  reflected  in  the  financial statements.\n\n## DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION LIABILITIES\n\nLiabilities for decommissioning and restoration costs are recognized, together with a corresponding amount as part of  the  related  property,  plant  and  equipment,  when  the conditions  indicated  in  the  accounting  policy  'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities And Contingent Assets' are met.\n\nConsidering the long-time span between the recognition of the  obligation  and  its  settlement,  the  amount  recognised is the present value of the future expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. Any change due to the unwinding of discount on provisions is recognised within 'Finance income (expense)'.",

The effects of any changes in the estimate of the liability are recognised generally as an adjustment to the carrying amount  of  the  related  property,  plant  and  equipment; however,  if  the  resulting  decrease  in  the  liability  exceeds the  carrying  amount  of  the  related  asset,  the  excess  is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAnalogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects related to operating activities carried out by the Company.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES\n\nEnvironmental  liabilities  are  recognised  when  the  Group has  a  present  obligation,  legal  or  constructive,  relating to  environmental  clean-up  and  remediation  of  soil  and groundwater in areas owned or under concession where the Group performed in the past industrial  operations  that  were progressively divested, shut down, dismantled or restructured. Liabilities  for  environmental  costs  are  recognised  when  a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. The liability is measured on the basis of on the costs expected to be incurred in relation to the existing situation at the  balance  sheet  date,  considering  virtually  certain  future developments in technology and legislation that are known.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgments: decommissioning and restoration liabilities, environmental liabilities and other provisions\n\nThe  Group  holds  provisions  for  dismantling  and  removing items  of  property,  plant  and  equipment,  and  restoring  land or seabed at the end of the oil and gas production activity. Estimating  obligations  to  dismantle,  remove  and  restore items of property, plant and equipment is complex. It requires management to make estimates and judgments with respect to removal obligations that will come to term many years into the future and contracts and regulations are often unclear as to what constitutes removal. In addition, the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly  known  as  asset  removal  technologies  and  costs constantly evolve in the countries where Eni operates, as do political, environmental, safety and public expectations.\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the provision and the timing of future cash outflows, as well as any related update, are based on complex managerial judgments.\n\nDecommissioning  and  restoration  provisions,  recognised in the financial statements, include, essentially, the present value of the expected costs for decommissioning oil and natural gas facilities at the end of the economic lives of fields,  well-plugging,  abandonment  and  site  restoration of  the  Exploration  &  Production  operating  segment.  Any decommissioning  and  restoration  provisions  associated with  the  other  operating  segments'  assets,  given  their indeterminate  settlement  dates,  also  considering  the strategy to reconvert plants in order to produce low carbon products,  are  recognised  when  it  is  possible  to  make  a reliable estimate of the discounted abandonment costs. In this regard, Eni performs periodic reviews for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a decommissioning and restoration provision.\n\nEni is subject to numerous EU, national, regional and local environmental laws and regulations concerning its oil and gas operations, production and other activities. They include legislations  that  implement  international  conventions  or protocols.  Environmental  liabilities  are  recognised  when it becomes probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and such obligation can be reliably estimated 25 .\n\nThe reliable determinability is verified on the basis of the available  information  such  as,  for  example,  the  approval or  filing  of  the  environmental  projects  to  the  relevant administrative authorities or the making of a commitment to the relevant administrative authorities, where supported by adequate estimates.\n\nManagement,  considering  the  actions  already  taken, insurance  policies  obtained  to  cover  environmental  risks and  provisions  already  recognised,  does  not  expect  any material  adverse  effect  on  Eni's  consolidated  results  of operations and financial position as a result of such laws and  regulations.  However,  there  can  be  no  assurance that  there  will  not  be  a  material  adverse  impact  on  Eni's consolidated  results  of  operations  and  financial  position due to: (i) the possibility of an unknown contamination; (ii) the results of the ongoing surveys and other possible effects of statements required by applicable laws; (iii) the possible effects  of  future  environmental  legislations  and  rules;  (iv) the effects of possible technological changes relating to future remediation; and (v) the possibility of litigation and the  difficulty  of  determining  Eni's  liability,  if  any,  against other potentially responsible parties with respect to such litigations and the possible reimbursements.\n\n(25) With reference to the environmental liabilities assumed, the expected operating costs to be incurred for managing groundwater treatment plants are not included in the estimates of environmental liabilities because it is not possible to reliably define a time horizon within which the operations of the plant will be terminated. In this regard, Eni performs periodic reviews for any changes in facts and circumstances, including changes in regulatory framework and technology, that might require the recognition of the environmental liability.",

        "page_content": "In  addition  to  environmental  and  decommissioning  and restoration  liabilities,  Eni  recognises  provisions  primarily related to legal and trade proceedings. These provisions are estimated on the basis of complex managerial judgments related to the amounts to be recognised and the timing of future cash outflows. After the initial recognition, provisions are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nEmployee  benefits  are  considerations  given  by  the  Group in exchange for service rendered by employees or for the termination of employment.\n\nPost-employment benefit plans, including informal arrangements, are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans depending on the economic substance of the plan as derived from its principal terms and  conditions.  Under  defined  contribution  plans,  the Company's obligation, which consists in making payments to the State or to a trust or a fund, is determined on the basis of contributions due.\n\nThe  liabilities  related  to  defined  benefit  plans,  net  of  any plan  assets,  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  actuarial assumptions and charged on an accrual basis during the employment  period  required  to  obtain  the  benefits.  Net interest includes the return on plan assets and the interest cost. Net interest is measured by applying to the liability, net of any plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liability; net interest of defined benefit plans is recognised in 'Finance income (expense)'.\n\nRemeasurements  of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability, comprising  actuarial  gains  and  losses,  resulting  from changes in the actuarial assumptions used or from changes arising  from  experience  adjustments,  and  the  return  on plan  assets  excluding  amounts  included  in  net  interest, are  recognised  within  the  statement  of  comprehensive income. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, recognised  within  other  comprehensive  income,  are  not reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account.\n\nObligations for long-term benefits are determined by adopting actuarial assumptions. The effects of remeasurements are taken to profit and loss account in their entirety.\n\nThe liabilities for termination benefits are recognised at the earlier  of  the  following  dates:  (a)  when  the  entity  can  no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that involves the  payment  of  termination  benefits.  Such  liabilities  are measured in accordance with the nature of the employee benefit.  Liabilities  for  termination  benefits  are  determined applying  the  requirements:  (i)  for  short-term  employee\n\nbenefits,  if  the  termination  benefits  are  expected  to  be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the termination benefits are recognised; or (ii) for long-term benefits if the termination benefits are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period.\n\n## SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nThe line item 'Payroll and related costs' includes the cost of the share-based incentive plan, consistent with its actual remunerative nature. The cost of the share-based incentive plan is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments  granted  and  the  estimate  of  the  number  of shares  that  eventually  vest;  the  cost  is  recognised  on  an accrual basis pro rata temporis over the vesting period, that is the period between the grant date and the settlement date. The fair value of the shares underlying the incentive plan is measured at the grant date, taking into account the estimate  of  achievement  of  market  conditions  (e.g.  Total Shareholder  Return),  and  is  not  adjusted  in  subsequent periods;  when  the  achievement  is  linked  also  to  nonmarket conditions, the number of shares expected to vest is adjusted during the vesting period to reflect the updated estimate of these conditions. If, at the end of the vesting period, the incentive plan does not vest because of failure to  satisfy  the  performance conditions, the portion of cost related to market conditions is not reversed to the profit and loss account\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgments: employee benefits and share-based payments\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  are  evaluated  with  reference  to uncertain  events  and  based  upon  actuarial  assumptions including,  among  others,  discount  rates,  expected  rates of  salary  increases,  mortality  rates,  estimated  retirement dates and medical cost trends. The significant assumptions used to account for defined benefit plans are determined as follows: (i) discount and inflation rates are based on the market  yields  on  high  quality  corporate  bonds  (or,  in  the absence of a deep market of these bonds, on the market yields on government bonds) and on the expected inflation rates  in  the  reference  currency  area;  (ii)  the  future  salary levels of the individual employees are determined including an  estimate  of  future  changes  attributed  to  general price  levels  (consistent  with  inflation  rate  assumptions), productivity,  seniority  and  promotion;  (iii)  healthcare  cost trend assumptions reflect an estimate of the actual future changes  in  the  cost  of  the  healthcare  related  benefits provided to the plan participants and are based on past and  current  healthcare  cost  trends,  including  healthcare",

Similar  to  the  approach  followed  for  the  fair  value measurement of financial instruments, the fair value of the shares underlying the incentive plans is measured by using complex  valuation  techniques  and  identifying,  through structured judgments, the assumptions to be adopted.\n\n## EQUITY INSTRUMENTS\n\n## TREASURY SHARES\n\nTreasury shares, including shares held to meet the future requirements  of  the  share-based  incentive  plans,  are recognised as deductions from equity at cost. Any gain or loss resulting from subsequent sales is recognised in equity.\n\n## HYBRID BONDS\n\nThe perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds are classified in the financial statements as equity instruments considering that the issuer has the unconditional right to defer, until the date of its own liquidation, the repayment of the principal amount and the payment of accrued interest 26 . Therefore, the issuer recognises the cash received from the bondholders, net of costs incurred in issuing the hybrid bonds, as an increase in Eni owners' equity; differently, the repayments of the principal amount  and  the  payments  of  accrued  interest  (upon  the arising  of  the  related  contractual  payment  obligation)  are accounted for as a decrease in Eni owners' equity.\n\n## REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nRevenue  from  contracts  with  customers  is  recognised on the basis of the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract with the customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations,  that  are  promises  in  a  contract  to  transfer goods and/or services to a customer; (iii) determining the transaction  price;  (iv)  allocating  the  transaction  price  to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each good or service; and (v) recognising revenue when (or as) a performance obligation\n\nis  satisfied,  that  is  when  a  promised  good  or  service  is transferred  to  a  customer.  A  promised  good  or  service  is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of it. Control can be transferred over time or at a point in time. With reference to the most important products sold by Eni, revenue is generally recognised for:\n\n- } crude oil, upon shipment;\n- } natural gas and electricity, upon delivery to the customer;\n- } petroleum products sold to retail distribution networks, upon delivery to the service stations, whereas all other sales  of  petroleum  products  are  recognised  upon shipment;\n- } chemical products and other products, upon shipment. Revenue from crude oil and natural gas production from properties in which Eni has an interest together with other producers  is  recognised  on  the  basis  of  the  quantities actually lifted and sold (sales method); costs are recognised on the basis of the quantities actually sold.\n\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for  transferring  promised  goods  and/or  services  to  a customer,  excluding  amounts  collected  on  behalf  of  third parties. In determining the transaction price, the promised amount of consideration is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. The promised amount of consideration is not adjusted for the effect of the significant financing component if, at contract inception, it is expected that the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. If the consideration promised  in  a  contract  includes  a  variable  amount,  the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods  and/or  services  to  a  customer;  in  particular,  the amount  of  consideration  can  vary  because  of  discounts, refunds, incentives, price concessions, performance bonuses,  penalties  or  if  the  price  is  contingent  on  the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events.\n\nIf, in a contract, the Company grants a customer the option to  acquire  additional  goods  or  services  for  free  or  at  a discount (e.g. sales incentives, customer award points, etc.), this option gives rise to a separate performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into that contract. When goods or services are exchanged for  goods  or  services  which  are  of  a  similar  nature  and value, the exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates revenue.",

        "page_content": "## Significant accounting estimates and judgments: revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue  from  sales  of  electricity  and  gas  to  retail customers includes the amount accrued for electricity and gas supplied between the date of the last invoiced meter reading (actual or estimated) of volumes consumed and the end of the year. These estimates consider information provided by the grid managers about the volumes allocated among the customers of the secondary distribution network, about  the  actual  and  estimated  volumes  consumed  by customers,  as  well  as  internal  estimates  about  volumes consumed  by  customers.  Therefore,  revenue  is  accrued as a result of a complex estimate based on the volumes distributed and allocated, communicated by third parties, likely to be adjusted, according to applicable regulations, within the fifth year following the one in which they are accrued, as well as on estimates about volumes consumed by  customers.  Considering  the  contractual  obligations on  the  supply  delivery  points,  revenue  from  sales  of electricity and gas to retail customers includes costs for transportation  and  dispatching  and  in  these  cases  the gross amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled is recognised.\n\n## COSTS\n\nCosts are recognised when the related goods and services are sold or consumed during the year, when they are allocated on a systematic basis or when their future economic benefits cannot  be  identified.  Costs  associated  with  emission quotas, incurred to meet the compliance requirements (e.g. Emission Trading Scheme) and determined on the basis of market prices, are recognised in relation to the amounts of the carbon dioxide emissions that exceed free allowances. Costs related to the purchase of the emission rights that exceed the amount necessary to meet regulatory obligations are  recognised  as  intangible  assets.  Revenue  related  to emission quotas is recognised when they are sold. Emission rights held for trading are recognised within inventories. The costs  incurred  on  a  voluntary  basis  for  the  acquisition  or production of forestry certificates, also taking into account the absence of an active market, are recognised in the profit and loss account when incurred.\n\nThe  costs  for  the  acquisition  of  new  knowledge  or discoveries, the study of products or alternative processes, new techniques or models, the planning and construction of  prototypes  or,  in  any  case,  costs  incurred  for  other scientific research activities or technological development, which cannot be capitalised (see also the accounting policy for 'Intangible assets'), are included in the profit and loss account when they are incurred.\n\n## EXCHANGE DIFFERENCES\n\nRevenues and costs associated with transactions in foreign currencies  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  by applying the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign currencies  are  translated  into  the  functional  currency  at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date and any resulting  exchange  differences  are  included  in  the  profit and loss account within 'Finance income (expense)' or, if designated as hedging instruments for the foreign currency risk, in the same line item in which the economic effects of the hedged item are recognised. Non-monetary assets and liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  measured  at cost, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition. Non-monetary  items  measured  at  fair  value,  recoverable amount or net realisable value are retranslated using the exchange rate at the date when the value is determined.\n\n## DIVIDENDS\n\nDividends are recognised when the right to receive payment of the dividend is established.\n\nDividends  and  interim  dividends  to  owners  are  shown as  changes in equity when the dividends are declared by, respectively,  the  shareholders'  meeting  and  the  Board  of Directors.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nCurrent  income  taxes  are  determined  on  the  basis  of estimated  taxable  profit.  Current  income  tax  assets  and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to  (recovered  from)  the  taxation  authorities,  using  the  tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognised  for temporary differences arising between  the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax bases, based on tax rates and tax laws that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled,  based  on  tax  rates  and  tax  laws  that  have  been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  when  their recoverability is considered probable, i.e. when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the same year as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference. Similarly,  deferred  tax  assets  for  the  carry-forward  of unused tax credits and unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that their recoverability is probable. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed, at least, on an annual basis.",

Conversely, if the company concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the company reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the (current and/or deferred) income taxes to be recognised in the financial statements.\n\nRelating to the taxable temporary differences associated with  investments  in  subsidiaries  and  associates,  and interests  in  joint  arrangements,  the  related  deferred  tax liabilities are not recognised if the investor is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented within non-current assets and liabilities and are offset at a single entity level if related to offsettable taxes. The balance of the offset, if positive, is recognised in  the  line  item  'Deferred  tax  assets'  and,  if  negative,  in the  line  item  'Deferred  tax  liabilities'.  When  the  results of  transactions  are  recognised  in  other  comprehensive income or directly in equity, the related current and deferred taxes are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates and judgments: income taxes\n\nThe computation of income taxes involves the interpretation  of  applicable  tax  laws  and  regulations  in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Although Eni aims to  maintain  a  relationship  with  the  taxation  authorities characterised  by  transparency,  dialogue  and  cooperation (e.g. by not using aggressive tax planning and by using, if available, procedures intended to eliminate or reduce tax litigations), there can be no assurance that there will not be a tax litigation with the taxation authorities where the legislation could be open to more than one interpretation. The resolution of tax disputes, through negotiations with relevant  taxation  authorities  or  through  litigation,  could take several years to complete. The estimate of liabilities related  to  uncertain  tax  treatments  requires  complex judgments  by  management.  After  the  initial  recognition, these liabilities are periodically reviewed for any changes in facts and circumstances.\n\nManagement makes complex judgments regarding mainly the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, related both to deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, which requires estimates and evaluations about the amount and the timing of future taxable profits.\n\n## ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nNon-current  assets  and  current  and  non-current  assets included within disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. When there is a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale, regardless of whether a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary will be retained after the sale.\n\nNon-current  assets  held  for  sale,  current  and  non-current assets  included  within  disposal  groups  that  have  been classified  as  held  for  sale  and  the  liabilities  directly associated with them are recognised on the balance sheet separately from other assets and liabilities.\n\nImmediately  before  the  initial  classification  of  a  noncurrent asset and/or a disposal group as held for sale, the non-current  asset  and/or  the  assets  and  liabilities  in  the disposal group are measured in accordance with applicable IFRSs.  Subsequently,  non-current  assets  held  for  sale  are not depreciated or amortised and they are measured at the lower of the fair value less costs to sell and their carrying amount. If an equity-accounted investment, or a portion of that investment meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, it is no longer accounted for using the equity method and it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount at the date the equity method is discontinued, and its fair value less costs to sell. Any retained portion of the equity-accounted investment that has not been classified as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the portion that is classified as held for sale takes place.\n\nAny  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  the  noncurrent assets and the fair value less costs to sell is taken to the profit and loss account as an impairment loss; any subsequent  reversal  is  recognised  up  to  the  cumulative impairment  losses,  including  those  recognised  prior  to qualification  of  the  asset  as  held  for  sale.  Non-current assets classified as held for sale and disposal groups are considered a discontinued operation if they, alternatively: (i) represent a separate major line of business or geographical area  of  operations;  (ii)  are  part  of  a  disposal  program  of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or (iii) are a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a  view  to  resale.  The  results  of  discontinued  operations, as  well  as  any  gain  or  loss  recognised  on  the  disposal, are indicated in a separate line item of the profit and loss account, net of the related tax effects; the economic figures of  discontinued  operations  are  indicated  also  for  prior periods presented in the financial statements.",

Fair value measurement is based on the market conditions existing at the measurement date and on the assumptions of  market  participants  (market-based  measurement).  A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of  a  principal  market,  in  the  most  advantageous  market to  which  the  entity  has  access,  independently  from  the entity's intention to sell the asset or transfer the liability to be measured.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. Highest and best use is determined from the perspective of market participants, even if the entity intends a different use; an entity's current use of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset.\n\nThe fair value of a liability, both financial and non-financial, or of the Company's own equity instrument, in the absence of  a  quoted  price,  is  measured  from  the  perspective  of a  market  participant  that  holds  the  identical  item  as  an asset at the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments takes into account the counterparty's credit risk for a financial asset (Credit Valuation Adjustment, CVA) and the Company's own credit risk for a financial liability (Debit Valuation  Adjustment,  DVA).  In  the  absence  of  available market quotation, fair value is measured by using valuation techniques  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances, maximising  the  use  of  relevant  observable  inputs  and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\n## Significant  accounting  estimates  and  judgments:  fair value\n\nFair  value  measurement,  although  based  on  the  best available  information  and  on  the  use  of  appropriate valuation  techniques,  is  inherently  uncertain,  requires  the use of professional judgment and could result in expected values other than the actual ones.\n\n## 2  PRIMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nAssets and liabilities on the balance sheet are classified as current and non-current. Items in the profit and loss account are presented by nature.\n\nThe statement of comprehensive income (loss) shows net profit  integrated  with  income  and  expenses  that  are  not recognised directly in the profit and loss account according to IFRSs.\n\nThe  statement  of  changes  in  equity  includes  the  total comprehensive income (loss) for the year, transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and other changes in equity. The statement of cash flows is presented using the indirect method, whereby net profit (loss) is adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions.\n\n## 3  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nStarting from 2021, the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7,  IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2' (hereinafter  the  amendments) are effective. The amendments provide practical expedients and temporary exceptions from the application of some IFRS requirements related to financial instruments measured at amortised cost and/or  hedging  relationships  modified  as  a  consequence of  the  interest  rate  benchmark  reform.  This  reform,  still ongoing, provides for the replacement of some benchmark interest rates, e.g. LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), with alternative risk-free rates.\n\nWith reference to the Eni Group, an internal working group has  been  set  up  to  monitor  the  regulatory  and  market developments,  as  well  as  to  support  the  assessment  of the  impacts  arising  from  the  reform,  the  measurement of  the  exposures  to  benchmark  rates  to  be  replaced,  the identification  of  the  changes  to  be  implemented  (e.g. renegotiation of loans with counterparties, implementation of fallback clauses, updating of information systems, etc.) and the transition to alternative risk-free rates.\n\nAs December 31, 2021, the Group holds, principally, financial instruments indexed to USD LIBOR benchmark rates, affected by the reform, which will be replaced by June 30, 2023 with SOFR  (Secured  Overnight  Financing  Rate).  Such  financial instruments are essentially represented by bonds relating to  the  Euro  Medium  Term  Notes  program  for  an  amount",

Derecognized receivables in 2021 related to the segments Global Gas & LNG Portfolio for \u20ac893 million, Refining & Marketing and Chemical segment for \u20ac770 million and Plenitude & Power segment for \u20ac396 million.\n\nReceivables from joint ventures in exploration and production activities included amounts due by partners in unincorporated joint  operations  in  Nigeria  of  \u20ac681  million  (\u20ac1,015  million  at December 31, 2020). Those receivables were in respect to the share of development costs attributable to the joint operators in oil projects operated by Eni, where the Company bears upfront all the costs of the initiative and charges these costs back to the partners through the cash call mechanism. At the balance sheet date, the overdue amount relating to net receivables due to Eni by the Nigerian state oil company NNPC was \u20ac474 million  (\u20ac605  million  at  December  31,  2020).  Approximately 50% of this amount related to past reporting years and was covered  by  a  'Repayment  Agreement',  whereby  Eni  is  to  be reimbursed through the sale of the entitlement attributable to NNPC in certain rig-less petroleum initiatives with low mineral risk, with a completion of the reimbursement plan expected within the next two years based on Eni's Brent price scenario. The overdue receivable is stated net of a discount factor equal to 8%, calculated based on the risk of the underlying mineral initiative. The other 50% related to net receivables accrued for the operations of 2021. A significant progress in the repayment was noted in the final part of the year.\n\nA  cash  call  exposure  towards  a  privately  held  Nigerian oil  company  amounted  to  \u20ac195  million  (\u20ac134  million  at\n\nDecember 31,  2020)  which  were  past  due  at  the  reporting date. The amounts were stated net of a provision based on the loss given default (LGD) defined by Eni for international oil companies in a default state and on the basis of specific factors. During the 2021, the partner suspended the payments of the cash calls, making a claim against the amounts billed. Arbitration procedures have been started for the resolution of the dispute.\n\nReceivables from other counterparties comprised: (i) the  recoverable  amount  of  \u20ac538  million  (\u20ac376  million  at December 31,  2020)  of  overdue  trade  receivables  owed  to Eni by the state-owned oil company of Venezuela, PDVSA, in relation to equity volumes of natural gas supplied by the joint venture  Card\u00f3n  IV,  equally  participated  by  Eni  and  Repsol. Those trade receivables were divested by the joint venture to the two shareholders. The receivables were stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts estimated on the basis of average recovery percentages obtained by creditors in the context of sovereign defaults, adjusted to reflect the strategic value of the Oil & Gas sector, and also applied for assessing the recoverability of the carrying amount of the investment and the long-term interest in the initiative, as described in note  17  -  Other  financial  assets.  Risks  associated  with  the complex financial outlook of the country and the deteriorated operating  environment  were  taken  into  account  in  the estimation of the expected loss by assuming a deferral in the timing of collection of future revenues and overdue credit amounts which resulted in an expected credit loss rate of about  53%.  The  tightening  of  the  US  sanction  framework against Venezuela has prevented the implementation of the mechanism of credit offsetting through in-kind refunds with assignments to Eni of oil products of PDVSA. Therefore, the amount of the receivable increased compared to the end of 2020; (ii) amounts to be received from customers following the  triggering  of  the  take-or-pay  clause  of  long-term  gas supply contracts for \u20ac325 million at December 31, 2020 were collected during 2021.\n\nTrade and other receivables stated in euro and U.S. dollars amounted to \u20ac12,275 million and \u20ac5,222 million, respectively.",

The  gradual  recovery  of  worldwide\n\neconomies from the fallout caused by COVID-19 crisis and the improvement in the oil scenario have lessened the debt burden of many state oil companies, with the exception of Venezuela due to specific factors relating to the sanctioning framework. On the other hand, the significant increase in the prices of natural gas and electricity significantly increased the exposures towards large industrial customers, requiring a revision in the credit loss rate upwards to incorporate an increased economic risk. With regard to customers of the Plenitude  business  line,  the  recoverability  assessments incorporate the most updated information relating to the performance in credit collection and the ageing of overdue amounts.",

These cash  flows  were  discounted  by  using  the  post-tax  WACC of  the  retail  business  adjusted  considering  the  country risks of operation equal to an average of 4.9%. There are no  reasonable  assumptions  of  changes  in  the  discount rate, growth rate, profitability or volumes that would lead to zeroing the headroom amounting to about \u20ac5 billion of the value in use of the CGU Retail with respect to its book value, including the allocated goodwill.\n\nIn  the  renewable  business  of  Plenitude,  the  CGUs  have been identified at a significant project level, in some cases grouped at company level for projects/plants characterized by  relevant  synergies.  Cash  flows  included  both  those relating  to  existing  assets  (acquired  or  build  internally) and those associated with the repowering process in the case of acquired assets. For the acquisitions of 2021, the impairment was assessed by updating the valuation model used for the acquisition which confirmed the recoverability of the goodwill allocated to the complex of the CGUs.\n\nGoodwill of the E-mobility business of Plenitude recognized in  connection  with  the  acquisition  in  2021  of  the  entire share capital of Be Power SpA, which through the subsidiary Be Charge is the second Italian operator in the segment of charging infrastructures for electric mobility (\u20ac728 million), was  assessed  by  updating  the  valuation  model  of  the operation.\n\n## 15  IMPAIRMENT REVIEW OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS\n\nThe  impairment  test  assumptions  of  the  Plenitude  &  Power\n\noperating segment are disclosed in note 14 - Intangible assets. The recoverability test of carrying amounts of Oil & Gas cash genenerating units (CGUs) is the most important of the critical accounting estimates in the preparation of Eni's consolidated financial statements. This owes to the relative weight of the invested capital in the Oil & Gas sector with respect to the total consolidated assets and to the complexity of thee estimation process of the values-in-use (VIUs) of Oil & Gas CGUs.\n\nFuture  expected  cash  flows  associated  with  the  use  of  Oil &  Gas  assets  are  based  on  management's  judgment  and subjective  evaluation  about  highly  uncertain  matters  like future, long-term hydrocarbons prices, assets' useful lives, projections  of  future  operating  and  capital  expenditures, the  volumes  of  reserves  that  will  ultimately  be  recovered and  costs  of  decommissioning  Oil  &  Gas  assets  at  the end  of  their  useful  lives.  Among  all  these  variables,  future hydrocarbons prices are the main value driver and because\n\nwe are in a commodity business, they tend to be very volatile and unpredictable due both to the number of driving forces underlying  long-term  trends  in  demands  and  supplies  of hydrocarbons, and to the trend of financial markets.\n\nForecasts of hydrocarbons prices adopted by Eni's management for the purpose of evaluating both Oil  &  Gas assets recoverability and of making final investment decisions are estimated on the basis of management's view of a number of fundamental trends, namely the expected evolution of the global energy mix in the next twenty-to-thirty years in line with the decarbonization goals of countries conference last year, the pace of the energy transition, the enduring impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology developments, longterm trends in demand and supplies of hydrocarbons, global macroeconomic and demographic growth, the evolution of technologies and climate policies, together with the evolution in consumers' and investors' preferences.\n\nIn the short-term, Eni's hydrocarbons forecasts also consider market forward prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as projections made by investment banks and other market observatories.\n\nEni  recognizes  and  fully  endorses  the  transition  of  the economy  towards  a  low  carbon  development  model  and the goals of the Paris COP21 agreements and based on this has  designed  a  strategy  to  achieve  the  decarbonization  of the Company's products and industrial processes targeting net  zero  emissions  in  Scope  1+2+3  by  2050.  Consistently with this long-term path which is factoring possible trends in  markets,  technologies  and  a  gradual  evolution  in  the Company's products, management is assuming a long-term price of the Brent crude oil benchmark of 62 $/barrel in 2020 USD until the year 2035 and then a declining trend to 46 $/ barrel in 2050 due to the expected phase-out of crude oil from the global energy mix in view of achieving the goals of the Paris agreement. In the year 2022-2023, management is  projecting  nominal  prices  of  80  $  and  75  $/barrel, respectively,  considering  a  strong  macroeconomic  cycle, financial discipline and consequent limitation of investments by listed oil companies and production issues in countries of the OPEC+ alliance. The corresponding pricing assumptions in the 2020 financial statements were 55 $ and 60 $/barrel. Regarding  natural  gas  future  prices,  while  in  the  short-toconsiderably  due  to  tight  supplies  at  21.2  $  and  14.4  $/ statements the corresponding projections were 4.7 $ and 4.9 $/\n\nmedium  term  the  benchmark  price  for  spot  sales  at  the Euroepan  continental  hub  'TTF'  is  forecast  to  strengthen mmBTU in 2022 and 2023, respectively (in the 2020 financial mmBTU), in the long-term management expects a decline due to the assumption of increasing competition from renewable energies and consumption efficiency for a TTF price forecast of 8.5 $/mmBTU in real currency 2020 in the period 2025-2045 and  a  further  decline  to  6.2  $/mmBTU  in  2050.

The cost of equity considers a market risk premium measured on the basis of the longterm returns of the S&P 500 and an additional premium which was estimated by management to discount the operational risks of the countries of activity and the risks of the energy transition.  As  a  result  of  these  assumptions,  our  cost  of equity is estimated at about 10%, counterbalancing a decline in yields of risk-free assets, which are incorporated both in the cost of equity and in cost of the financial debt. Overall, our risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (adjusted WACC) was about 7% in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, management has recognized reversals at previously impaired Oil & Gas CGUs driven by strengthened hydrocarbons prices, particularly gas prices. The main amounts regarded gas  fields  in  Italy  and  fields  in  Congo,  Libya,  USA,  Algeria, Turkmenistan,  Nigeria  and  East  Timor.  The  post-tax,  riskadjusted WACC that were used in the impairment review ranged\n\nbetween 10.7% and 6.5%. In the case of a reversal higher than \u20ac100 million, a risk-adjusted post-tax WACC of 6.8% was used, which redetermines to about 18% pre-tax.\n\nThe VIU of the whole portfolio of Oil & Gas CGUs estimated under management's pricing and other operating assumptions shows a headroom greater than 90% of the underlying book values, also discounting the expected expenses associated with the purchase of carbon credits as part of the Company's strategy to decarbonize its products/processes through the participation to forestry conservation projects, which belong to the REDD+ framework defined by the United Nations. The calculation included all the assets of consolidated companies, joint ventures and associates excluding V\u00e5r Energi AS and an asset under arbitration procedure.\n\nConsidering the level of judgment in the estimation process of the VIUs ofOil & Gas assets, management has prepared a stresstest  analysis  utilizing  alternative  decarbonization  scenario  as adopted by the IEA in its SDS WEO '21 and net zero emissions 2050 (NZE 2050) scenarios. The sensitivity tests to the IEA SDS and  NZE  2050  scenario  consider  energy  commodity  pricing assumptions different from those adopted by the management and  the  utilization  of  a  cost  for  carbon  emissions  across  all geographic  areas  where  Eni  operates  its  oil  &  gas  activities based on the prices reported in the following table:\n\n|                           | Value in use of the O&G CGUs Headroom vs. Carrying amounts   | Value in use of the O&G CGUs Headroom vs. Carrying amounts   | Assumption at 2050 in real terms USD 2020 European  Cost of   | Assumption at 2050 in real terms USD 2020 European  Cost of   | Assumption at 2050 in real terms USD 2020 European  Cost of           |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                           | Tax-deductible CO 2  charges                                 | Non tax-deductible CO 2  charges                             | Brent price                                                   | gas price                                                     | CO 2                                                                  |\n| Eni's scenario            | ~90%                                                         | -                                                            | 46 $/bbl                                                      | 6.2 $/mmBTU                                                   | CO 2  costs projections in the EU/ETS + projections of forestry costs |\n| IEA SDS WEO 2021 scenario | 76%                                                          | 75%                                                          | 50 $/bbl                                                      | 4.5 $/mmBTU                                                   | 200-95 per tonne of  CO 2 *                                           |\n| IEA NZE 2050 scenario     | 35%                                                          | 32%                                                          | 24 $/bbl                                                      | 3.6 $/mmBTU                                                   | 250-55 per tonne of  CO 2 *                                           |\n\n- (*) Prices relating to advanced/emerging economies.\n\nIn relation to the NZE 2050 scenario, for which possible value recovery actions are not considered, such as rescheduling/ cancellation of planned development activities, contractual renegotiations, effect on  costs  or  actions  aimed  at accelerating the pay-back period, a headroom is determined, that is, the excess of the total value-in-use compared to the corresponding book value of the E&P CGU, consistent and in excess of more than 30% compared to the book value.\n\nThe 2021 valuation of the recoverability of the assets also resulted in the write-down of the residual book value of the refineries  and  the  joint  operations  in  Italy  and  Europe  for an amount of \u20ac1,179 million (including the stay-in-business\n\ninvestments of the CGUs previously impaired). The driver of this  loss  is  the  significant  decline  in  margins,  compressed by the worsening of crack spreads for the products and the increase in the cost of gas-indexed utilities, and the reduced profitability  prospects  of  Eni's  CGUs  due  to  structural weaknesses in the European refining sector (suboptimal size of  the  plants  and  competitive  pressure  from  more  efficient refiners) and the projections of limited recovery in the demand for fuels also due to competition from electric mobility. In addition,  operating  costs  are  penalized  by  the  increase  in charges for the purchase of emission certificates under the European Emission Trading System scheme.",

The loss was estimated by management on the\n\nbasis of the best information available on the market and on the preliminary results of 2021 announced; (ii) Abu Dhabi Oil  Refining Co (TAKREER) for \u20ac362 million relating to the loss  of  the  year  mainly  due  to  the  recognition  of  writedowns of plants due to lower profitability prospects and decommissioning provisions due to the closure of some production lines.\n\nShare of losses of equity-accounted investments included a loss of \u20ac78 million accounted at the joint venture Card\u00f3n IV SA (Eni's interest 50%) which is operating the Perla gas field in Venezuela, affected by the slowdown in the gas supplies to the buyer PDVSA due to a deteriorated operating environment and credit losses. The residual value of \u20ac51 million of the investment in the PetroJun\u00edn project was canceled due to the lack of profitability prospects of the project.\n\nDeduction  for  dividends  related  for  \u20ac561  million  to  V\u00e5r Energi AS.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The bondholders can exercise their conversion rights at certain expiry dates and/or in the presence of certain events, while the bonds will be cash-settled. Accordingly, to hedge its exposure, Eni purchased cash-settled call options relating to Eni shares that will be settled on a net cash basis. The bond conversion price is equal \u20ac17.62 and includes a 35% premium with respect to the Eni's share reference price at the date of issuance. The convertible bond is measured at amortized cost. The conversion option, embedded in the financial instrument issued, and the call option on Eni's shares acquired are valued at fair value with effects recognized through profit and loss. The bond expires within the next 12 months.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Euro  Medium  Term  Notes  program,  during 2021  Eni  issued  a  sustainability-linked  bond  for  a  nominal amount of \u20ac1 billion linked to the achievement of the following sustainability targets: (i) Net Carbon Footprint upstream (GHG emission Scope 1 and 2) equal to or lower than 7.4 million tons of CO 2 equivalent by 2024; (ii) renewable energy installed capacity equal to or greater than 5 GW by 2025.

The provision also includes the estimate of the costs for social projects to be incurred following the commitments between Eni SpA and the Basilicata region in relation to the oil  development  program  in  the  Val  d'Agri  concession  area (\u20ac134 million). The unwinding of discount recognized through profit  and  loss  for  \u20ac153  million  was  determined  based  on discount rates ranging from -0.4% to 3.8% (from -0.2% to 3.7% at  December  31,  2020).  Main  expenditures  associated  with decommissioning operations are expected to be incurred over a fifty-year period.\n\nProvisions  for  environmental  risks  included  the  estimated\n\ncosts for environmental clean-up and remediation of soil and groundwater in areas owned or under concession where the Group performed in the past industrial operations that were progressively divested, shut down, dismantled or restructured. The provision was accrued because at the balance sheet date there is a legal or constructive obligation for Eni to carry out environmental  clean-up  and  remediation  and  the  expected costs can be estimated reliably. The provision included the expected  charges  associated  with  strict  liability  related  to obligations of cleaning up and remediating polluted areas that met the parameters set by the law at the time when the pollution occurred but presently are no more in compliance with current environmental laws and regulations, or because Eni assumed the liability borne by other operators when the Company  acquired  or  otherwise  took  over  site  operations. Those  environmental  provisions  are  recognized  when  an environmental project is approved by or filed with the relevant administrative  authorities  or  a  constructive  obligation  has arisen whereby the Company commits itself to performing certain cleaning-up and restoration projects and a reliable cost estimation is available.

Carry-forward  tax  losses  were  \u20ac16,260  million  and  \u20ac11,688 million at Italian subsidiaries  and  foreign  subsidiaries, respectively. Deferred tax assets gross of accumulated writedowns recognized on these losses amounted to \u20ac3,914 million and \u20ac3,460 million, respectively.\n\nItalian  taxation  law  allows  the  carry-forward  of  tax  losses indefinitely.  Foreign  taxation  laws  generally  allow  the  carry-\n\nforward of tax losses over a period longer than five years, and in many cases, indefinitely. A tax rate of 24% was applied to tax losses of Italian subsidiaries to determine the portion of the carry-forwards tax losses. The corresponding average rate for foreign subsidiaries was 29.6%.\n\nAccumulated  write-downs  of  deferred  tax  assets  related  to Italian companies for \u20ac6,609 million and non-Italian companies for \u20ac1,995 million.\n\nTaxes are also described in note 33 -

At December 31, 2021, the fair value of these contracts amounted to \u20ac1 million.\n\nEni is exposed to the market risk, which is the risk that changes in  prices  of  energy  commodities,  exchange  rates  and  interest rates  could  reduce  the  expected  cash  flows  or  the  fair  value of  the  assets.  Eni  enters  into  financial  and  commodities derivatives  traded  on  organized  markets  (like  MTF  and  OTF) and  into  commodities  derivatives  traded  over  the  counter (swaps,  forward,  contracts  for  differences  and  options  on commodities) to reduce this risk in relation to the underlying commodities,  currencies  or  interest  rates  and,  to  a  limited extent, in compliance with internal authorization thresholds, with speculative  purposes  to  profit  from  expected  market  trends. Derivatives fair values were estimated based on market quotations provided  by  primary  info-provider  or,  alternatively,  appropriate valuation techniques generally adopted in the marketplace.\n\nFair  values  of  non-hedging  derivatives  related  to  derivatives that  did  not  meet  the  formal  criteria  to  be  designated  as hedges under IFRS.\n\nFair  values  of  trading  derivatives  comprised  forward  sale contracts of natural gas for physical delivery which were not entitled to the own use exemption, as well as derivatives for proprietary trading activities.\n\nFair values of cash flow hedge derivatives essentially related to commodity hedges were entered into by the Global Gas &  LNG  Portfolio  segment.  These  derivatives  were  entered into to hedge variability in future cash flows associated with highly probable future trade transactions of gas or electricity or  on  already  contracted  trades  due  to  different  indexation\n\nmechanisms of supply costs versus selling prices. A similar scheme  applies  to  exchange  rate  hedging  derivatives.  The existence of a relationship between the hedged item and the hedging derivative is checked at inception to verify eligibility for hedge accounting by observing the offset in changes of the fair values at both the underlying commodity and the derivative. The hedging relationship is also stress-tested against the level of credit risk of the counterparty in the derivative transaction. The hedge ratio is defined consistently with the Company's risk management  objectives,  under  a  defined  risk  management strategy.  The  hedging  relationship  is  discontinued  when  it ceases to meet the qualifying criteria and the risk management objectives on the basis of which hedge accounting has initially\n\nbeen applied.\n\nThe  effects  of  the  measurement  at  fair  value  of  cash  flow hedge  derivatives  are  given  in  note  26  -  Equity.  Information on hedged risks and hedging policies is disclosed in note 28 Guarantees, commitments and risks - Risk factors.\n\nIn 2021, the exposure to the exchange rate risk deriving from securities denominated in U.S. dollars included in the strategic liquidity portfolio amounting to \u20ac2,109 million was hedged by using,  in  a  fair  value  hedge  relationship,  negative  exchange differences for \u20ac153 million resulting on a portion of bonds denominated in U.S. dollars amounting to \u20ac2,083 million.\n\nOptions  embedded  in  convertible  bonds  at  December  31, 2020, related to equity-linked cash settled. More information is disclosed in note 19 - Finance debts.\n\nThe  offsetting  of  financial  derivatives  related  to  Eni  Global Energy Markets.\n\nDuring 2021, there were no transfers between the different hierarchy levels of fair value.\n\nHedging derivative instruments are disclosed below:\n\nDecember 31, 2021\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\n| (\u20ac million)                  | Nominal  amount of the  hedging instrument   | Change in fair value (effective  hedge)   | Change in fair value (ineffective  hedge)   | Nominal amount of the  hedging instrument   | Change in fair value (effective  hedge)   | Change in fair value (ineffective  hedge)   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Cash flow hedge derivatives  |                                              |                                           |                                             |                                             |                                           |                                             |\n| Derivatives on commodity     |                                              |                                           |                                             |                                             |                                           |                                             |\n| - Over the counter           | (461)                                        | (2,016)                                   | (46)                                        | 821                                         | (438)                                     |                                             |\n| - Future                     | (364)                                        | 534                                       | (5)                                         | 541                                         | 158                                       | (1)                                         |\n|                              | (825)                                        | (1,482)                                   | (51)                                        | 1,362                                       | (280)                                     | (1)                                         |\n| Derivatives on interest rate |                                              |                                           |                                             |                                             |                                           |                                             |\n| - Interest rate swap         | 84                                           | 3                                         |                                             |                                             |                                           |                                             |\n|                              | 84                                           | 3                                         |                                             |                                             |                                           |                                             |\n|                              | (741)                                        | (1,479)                                   | (51)                                        | 1,362                                       | (280)                                     | (1)                                         |",

At December 31, 2021, the underlying commitment issued on behalf of joint ventures and associates covered by such guarantees was \u20ac1,816 million (\u20ac1,898 million at December 31, 2020).\n\nGuarantees issued on behalf of third parties related for \u20ac157 million (\u20ac145 million at December 31, 2020) to the share of the guarantee attributable to the State oil Company of Mozambique ENH, which was assumed by Eni in favor of the consortium financing the construction of the Coral project FLNG vessel. At December 31, 2021, the underlying commitment issued on behalf of third parties covered by such guarantees was \u20ac124 million (\u20ac87 million at December 31, 2020).\n\nAs  provided  by  the  contract  that  regulates  the  petroleum activities in Area 4 offshore Mozambique, Eni SpA in its capacity as parent company of the operator has provided concurrently with the approval of the development plan of the reserves which are located exclusively within the concession area, an irrevocable and unconditional parent company guarantee in respect of any possible claims or any contractual breaches in connection with the petroleum activities to be carried out in the contractual area, including those activities in charge of the special purpose entities like Coral FLNG SA, to the benefit of the Government of Mozambique and third parties. The obligations of the guarantor towards the Government of Mozambique are unlimited (nonquantifiable commitments), whereas they provide a maximum liability  of  \u20ac1,324  million  in  respect  of  third-parties  claims. This  guarantee  will  be  effective  until  the  completion  of  any decommissioning activity related to both the development plan of Coral as well as any development plan to be executed within Area 4 (particularly the Mamba project). This parent company guarantee issued by Eni covering 100% of the aforementioned obligations was taken over by the other concessionaires (Kogas, Galp and ENH) and by ExxonMobil and CNPC shareholders of the joint venture Mozambique Rovuma Venture SpA, in proportion to their respective participating interest in Area 4.",

        "page_content": "Commitments related to: (i) parent company guarantees that were issued in connection with certain contractual commitments for  hydrocarbon  exploration  and  production  activities  and quantified,  based  on  the  capital  expenditures  to  be  incurred, to be \u20ac70,039 million (\u20ac64,294 million at December 31, 2020). The increase of \u20ac5,745 million was essentially determined by exchange rate differences; (ii) a parent company guarantee of \u20ac3,532 million (\u20ac3,260 million at December 31, 2020) given on behalf  of  Eni  Abu  Dhabi  Refining  &  Trading  BV  following  the Share Purchase Agreement to acquire from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) a 20% equity interest in ADNOC Refining and  the  set-up  of  ADNOC  Global  Trading  Ltd  dedicated  to marketing petroleum products. The parent company guarantee still outstanding has been issued to guarantee the obligations set  out  in  the  Shareholders  Agreements  and  will  remain  in force as long as the investment is maintained; (iii) during 2021, the commitment of \u20ac1,672 mllion as of December 31, 2020, assumed by Eni USA Gas Marketing Llc towards Angola LNG Supply Service Llc  for  the  purchase  of  volumes  of  re-gasified gas at the Pascagoula plant (United States) over a twenty-year period (until 2031) was ended definitively; (iv) a commitment of \u20ac385 million for the sale to Snam Rete Gas SpA of 49.9% of the investments held in Trans Tunisian Pipeline Company SpA and Transmediterranean Pipeline Co Ltd, companies that manage the international gas pipelines that connect Algeria to Italy; (v) a commitment of \u20ac262 million for the purchase of 20% of the project relating to Dogger Bank (C) wind farm in the North Sea; (vi) commitments of the Plenitude business line for the purchase of renewable energy projects in Spain and Greece for \u20ac250 million; (vii) the memorandum of intent signed with the Basilicata Region, whereby Eni has agreed to invest \u20ac106 million (\u20ac108 million at December 31, 2020) in the future, also on account of Shell Italia E&P SpA, in connection with Eni's development plan of oilfields in Val d'Agri. The commitment has been included in the off-balance sheet contractual commitments in the following paragraph 'Liquidity risk'; (viii) a commitment for \u20ac99 million of EniPower SpA for the purchase of two new gas turbines.\n\nRisks relate to potential risks associated with: (i) contractual assurances  given  to  acquirers  of  certain  investments  and businesses of Eni for \u20ac246 million (\u20ac230 million at December 31, 2020); (ii) assets of third parties under the custody of Eni for \u20ac688 million (\u20ac370 million at December 31, 2020).\n\n## OTHER COMMITMENTS AND RISKS\n\nA parent company guarantee was issued on behalf of Card\u00f3n IV SA (Eni's interest 50%), a joint venture operating the Perla gas field located in Venezuela, for the supply to PDVSA GAS of the volumes of gas produced by the field until the end of the concession agreement (2036). In case of failure on part of the operator to deliver the contractual gas volumes out of production, the claim under the guarantee will be determined by  applying  the  local  legislation.  Eni's  share  (50%)  of  the contractual volumes of gas to be delivered to PDVSA GAS\n\namounted to a total of around \u20ac11 billion. Notwithstanding this amount does not properly represent the guarantee exposure, nonetheless such amount represents the maximum financial exposure at risk for Eni. A similar guarantee was issued by PDVSA  on  behalf  of  Eni  for  the  fulfillment  of  the  purchase commitments of the gas volumes by PDVSA GAS.\n\nOther commitments include the agreements entered into for forestry initiatives, implemented within the low carbon strategy defined by the Company, concerning the commitments for the purchase, until 2038, of carbon credits produced and certified according to international standards by subjects specialized in forest conservation programs.\n\nIn  the  final  months  of  2021,  the  Saipem  investment,  jointly controlled by Eni (31.2%) and the Italian agency CDP, experienced a  significant  deterioration  in  the  industrial  performance  as  a consequence  of  incurred  large  contract  works  losses  and assets impairment charges, which materially eroded net equity and  negatively  affected  solvency  and  indebtdeness  ratios. The worsening of the results compared to expectations was communicated to the market at the beginning of 2022. A new management team was appointed in March 2022 to prepare an  industrial  plan  to  restore  profitability,  boost  the  cash generation and reduce net borrowings. On those basis, the new management team is expected to design a financial and equity restructuring of the venture, which will entail a capital increase of \u20ac2 billion by the end of the year to which Eni will contribute in proportion to its interest (approximately \u20ac0.61 billion).\n\nOn February 5, 2021, EniServizi SpA (EniServizi) signed on behalf of Eni SpA (Eni) an addendum to the lease contract of a property to be built signed between Eni and the management company of the real estate investment fund owner of the new complex under construction in San Donato Milanese (the Property), including the postponement of the delivery date of the property from July 28, 2020 to December 31, 2021. Since this new delivery date has not been met either, starting from January 1, 2022 Eni would have the right to apply penalties to the Property. In this context, the Property complained that the delays would not be entirely attributable to itself, at least for the construction of the building complex (not also for the public works), as the works were slowed down by several factors: (i) effects of the pandemic crisis; (ii) alleged defects found in relation to the preparatory works for the sale of the area; (iii) alleged design defects. Also on the basis of these complaints, with communications dated November  and  December  2021,  the  Property  expressed  its intention to charge EniServizi and/or Eni at least part of the requests that its contractor formulated towards the Property, equal to approximately \u20ac117 million at the balance sheet date. In this regard, confirming the complete impartiality and neutrality of Eni and EniServizi with respect to the contractual relationships between the Property and its contractor (confirmed in several communications), the Company reaffirms the following:\n\n- } the delays relating to points i) and ii) have already been object of a settlement in the aforementioned agreement of",

At the moment, therefore, it is not known what could be the object, the reasons or the probative allegations of a possible legal action brought by the counterparty.\n\nEni  is  liable  for  certain  non-quantifiable  risks  related  to contractual  guarantees  given  to  acquirers  of  certain  Eni assets,  including  businesses  and  investments,  against certain contingent liabilities deriving from tax, social security contributions,  environmental  issues  and  other  matters applicable to periods during which such assets were operated by Eni. Eni believes such matters will not have a material adverse effect on Eni's results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## RISK FACTORS\n\nThe  following  is  the  description  of  financial  risks  and  their management and control. With reference to the issues related to credit risk, the parameters adopted for the determination of  expected  losses  and,  in  particular,  the  estimates  of  the probability of default and the loss given default have been updated to take into account the impacts of COVID-19 and its related effects on the economic context.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  retains  liquidity reserves that management deems enough to meet the financial obligations  due  in  the  next  eighteen  months.  No  significant effects were reported on hedging transactions connected to the impacts of COVID-19 on the economic context.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nFinancial risks are managed in respect of the guidelines issued by the Board of Directors of Eni SpA in its role of directing and  setting  the  risk  limits,  targeting  to  align  and  centrally coordinate  Group  companies'  policies  on  financial  risks ('Guidelines on financial risks management and control'). The 'Guidelines' define for each financial risk the key components of the management and control process, such as the target of the risk management, the valuation methodology, the structure of limits, the relationship model and the hedging and mitigation instruments.\n\n## MARKET RISK\n\nMarket risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the Group's financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The Company actively manages market risk\n\nin accordance with a set of policies and guidelines that provide a  centralized  model  of  handling  finance,  treasury  and  risk management transactions based on the Company's departments of operational finance: the parent company's (Eni SpA) finance department, Eni Finance International SA and Banque Eni SA, which is subject to certain bank regulatory restrictions preventing the Group's exposure to concentrations of credit risk, and Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA that are in charge to execute certain activities relating to commodity derivatives. In particular, Eni Corporate finance department and Eni  Finance  International  SA  manage  subsidiaries'  financing requirements in and outside Italy, respectively, covering funding requirements  and  using  available  surpluses.  All  transactions concerning currencies and derivative contracts on interest rates and currencies different from commodities of Eni are managed by Eni Corporate finance department, while Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA execute the negotiation of commodity derivatives over the market. Eni SpA, Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA (also through the  subsidiary  Eni  Trading  &  Shipping  Inc)  perform  trading activities in financial derivatives on external trading venues, such as European and non-European regulated markets, Multilateral Trading  Facility  (MTF),  Organized  Trading  Facility  (OTF),  or similar and brokerage platforms (i.e. SEF), and over the counter on  a  bilateral  basis  with  external  counterparties.  Other  legal entities  belonging to Eni that require financial derivatives enter into these transactions through Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA, Eni Global Energy Markets SpA and Eni SpA based on the relevant asset class expertise. Eni uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) in order to minimize exposure to market risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates relating to those transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency (the euro) and interest rates, as well as to optimize exposure to commodity prices fluctuations taking into account the currency in which commodities are quoted. Eni monitors every activity in derivatives classified as risk-reducing directly or indirectly related to covered industrial assets, so as to effectively optimize the risk profile to which Eni is exposed or could be exposed. If the result of the monitoring shows those derivatives should not be considered as risk reducing, these derivatives are reclassified in proprietary trading. As proprietary trading is considered separately from the other activities in specific portfolios of Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA, their exposure is subject to specific controls, both in terms of Value at Risk (VaR) and stop loss and in terms of nominal gross value. For Eni, the gross nominal  value  of  proprietary  trading  activities  is  compared with the limits set by the relevant international standards. The framework defined by Eni's policies and guidelines provides that the valuation and control of market risk is performed on the basis of  maximum tolerable levels of risk exposure defined in terms of limits of stop loss, which expresses the maximum tolerable amount of losses associated with a certain portfolio of assets over a pre-defined time horizon; limits of revision strategy, which",

        "page_content": "consist in the triggering of a revision process of the strategy in the event of exceeding the level of profit and loss given and VaR, which measures the maximum potential loss of the portfolio, given  a  certain  confidence  level  and  holding  period,  assuming adverse changes in market variables and taking into account the correlation among the different positions held in the portfolio. Eni's finance department defines the maximum tolerable levels of risk exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in terms of VaR, pooling Group companies' risk positions maximizing, when possible, the benefits of the netting activity. Eni's calculation and valuation techniques for interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks are in accordance with banking standards, as established by the Basel Committee for bank activities surveillance. Tolerable levels of risk are based on a conservative approach, considering the industrial nature of the Company. Eni's guidelines prescribe that Eni Group companies minimize such kinds of market risks by transferring risk exposure to  the  parent  company  finance  department.  Eni's  guidelines define rules to manage the commodity risk aiming at optimizing core activities and pursuing preset targets of stabilizing industrial and commercial margins. The maximum tolerable level of risk exposure is defined in terms of VaR, limits of revision strategy, stop loss and volumes in connection with exposure deriving from commercial activities, as well as exposure deriving from proprietary trading, exclusively managed by Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA  and  Eni  Global  Energy  Markets  SpA.  Internal  mandates to manage the commodity risk provide for a mechanism of allocation of the Group maximum tolerable risk level to each business unit. In this framework, Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA, in addition to managing risk exposure associated with their own commercial activity and proprietary trading, pool the requests for negotiating commodity derivatives and execute them in the marketplace.\n\nAccording  to  the  targets  of  financial  structure  included  in  the financial plan approved by the Board of Directors, Eni decided to retain a cash reserve to face any extraordinary requirement. Eni's finance  department,  with  the  aim  of  optimizing  the  efficiency and ensuring maximum protection of capital, manages such reserve and its immediate liquidity within the limits assigned. The management of strategic cash is part of the asset management pursued through transactions on own risk in view of optimizing financial returns, while respecting  authorized  risk  levels, safeguarding the Company's assets and retaining quick access to liquidity. The four different market risks, whose management and control have been summarized above, are described below.\n\n## MARKET RISK - EXCHANGE RATE\n\nExchange rate risk derives from the fact that Eni's operations are conducted in currencies other than euro (mainly U.S. dollar). Revenues  and  expenses  denominated  in  foreign  currencies may  be  significantly  affected  by  exchange  rate  fluctuations due to conversion differences on single transactions arising from the time lag existing between execution and definition of\n\nrelevant contractual terms (economic risk) and conversion of foreign  currency-denominated  trade  and  financing  payables and receivables (transactional risk). Exchange rate fluctuations affect  the  Group's  reported  results  and  net  equity  as  financial statements  of  subsidiaries  denominated  in  currencies  other than  euro  are  translated  from  their  functional  currency  into euro.  Generally,  an  appreciation  of  U.S.  dollar  versus  euro has a positive impact on Eni's results of operations, and vice versa.  Eni's  foreign  exchange  risk  management  policy  is  to minimize transactional exposures arising from foreign currency movements and to optimize exposures arising from commodity risk.  Eni  does  not  undertake  any  hedging  activity  for  risks deriving from the translation of foreign currency denominated profits  or  assets  and  liabilities  of  subsidiaries,  which  prepare financial  statements in a currency other than euro, except for\n\nsingle transactions to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Effective  management  of  exchange  rate  risk  is  performed\n\nwithin Eni's finance departments, which pool Group companies' positions,  hedging  the  Group  net  exposure  by  using  certain derivatives, such as currency swaps, forwards and options. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on market prices provided  by  specialized  info-providers.  The  VaR  techniques are based on variance/covariance simulation models and are used to monitor the risk exposure arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period within a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period.\n\n## MARKET RISK - INTEREST RATE\n\nChanges  in  interest  rates  affect  the  market  value  of  financial assets  and  liabilities  of  the  Company  and  the  level  of  finance charges.\n\nEni's interest rate risk management policy is to minimize risk with  the  aim  to  achieve  financial  structure  objectives  defined and  approved  in  management's  'Finance  plan'.  The  Group's central departments pool borrowing requirements of the Group companies in order to manage net positions and fund portfolio developments  consistent  with  management  plan,  thereby maintaining  a  level  of  risk  exposure  within  prescribed  limits. Eni enters into interest rate derivative transactions, in particular interest rate swaps, to effectively manage the balance between fixed and floating rate debt. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on market prices provided from specialized sources. VaR deriving from interest rate exposure is measured daily based on a variance/covariance model, with a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period.\n\n## MARKET RISK - COMMODITY\n\nPrice  risk  of  commodities  is  identified  as  the  possibility  that fluctuations in the price of materials and basic products produce significant  changes  in  Eni's  operating  margins,  determining an impact on the economic result such as to compromise the targets  defined  in  the  four-year  plan  and  in  the  budget.  The commodity price risk arises in connection with the following",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nexposures:  (i)  strategic  exposure:  exposures  directly  identified by the Board of Directors as a result of strategic investment decisions or outside the planning horizon of risk management. These exposures include, for example, exposures associated with  the  program  for  the  production  of  Oil  &  Gas  reserves, long-term gas supply contracts for the portion not balanced by sales contracts (already stipulated or expected), the margin deriving from the chemical transformation process, the refining margin and long-term storage functional to the logistic-industrial activities;  (ii)  commercial  exposure:  concerns  the  exposures related to components underlying the contractual arrangements of industrial and commercial (contracted exposure) activities normally related to the time horizon of the four-year plan and budget, components not yet under contract but which will be with  reasonable  certainty  (commitment  exposure)  and  the relevant activities of risk management. Commercial exposures are  characterized  by  a  systematic  risk  management  activity conducted based on risk/return assumptions by implementing one  or  more  strategies  and  subjected  to  specific  risk  limits (VaR, revision strategy limits and stop loss). In particular, the commercial exposures include exposures subjected to assetbacked hedging activities, arising from the flexibility/optionality of assets; (iii) proprietary trading exposure: transactions carried out autonomously for speculative purposes in the short term and normally not aimed at delivery with the intention of exploiting favorable price movements, spreads and/or volatility implemented autonomously and carried out regardless of the exposures of the commercial portfolio or physical and contractual assets. They are usually carried out in the short term, not necessarily aimed at the delivery and carried out by using financial or similar instruments in accordance with specific limits of authorized risk (VaR, stop loss). Strategic risk is not subject to systematic activity of management/coverage that is eventually carried out only in case of specific market or business conditions. Because of the extraordinary nature, hedging activities related to strategic risks are delegated to the top management, previously authorized by the Board of Directors. With prior authorization from the Board of Directors, the exposures related to strategic risk can be used in combination with other commercial exposures in order to exploit opportunities for natural compensation between the risks (natural  hedge)  and  consequently  reduce  the  use  of  financial derivatives (by activating logics of internal market). With regard to exposures of a commercial nature, Eni's risk management target is to optimize the 'core' activities and preserve the economic/ financial results. Eni manages the commodity risk through the trading units (Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA) and the exposure to commodity prices through\n\nthe  Group's  finance  departments by using financial derivatives traded  on  the  regulated  markets  MTF,  OTF  and  financial derivatives traded over the counter (swaps, forward, contracts for differences and options on commodities) with the underlying commodities  being  crude  oil,  gas,  refined  products,  power  or emission certificates. Such financial derivatives are valued at fair value based on market prices provided from specialized sources or, absent market prices, based on estimates provided by brokers or suitable valuation techniques. VaR deriving from commodity exposure is measured daily based on a historical simulation technique,  with  a  95%  confidence  level  and  a  one-day  holding period.\n\n## MARKET RISK - STRATEGIC LIQUIDITY\n\nMarket risk  deriving  from  liquidity  management  is  identified  as the  possibility  that  changes  in  prices  of  financial  instruments (bonds, money market instruments and mutual funds) affect the value of these instruments in case of sale or when they are valued  at  fair  value  in  the  financial  statements.  The  setting  up and maintenance of the liquidity reserve are mainly aimed to guarantee a proper financial flexibility. Liquidity should allow Eni to  fund  any  extraordinary  need  (such  as  difficulty  in  access  to credit, exogenous shock, macroeconomic environment, as well as merger and acquisitions) and must be dimensioned to provide a coverage of short-term debts and of medium and long-term finance debts due within a time horizon of 24 months. In order to manage the investment activity of the strategic liquidity, Eni defined a specific investment policy with aims and constraints in terms of financial activities and operational boundaries, as well as governance guidelines regulating management and control systems. In particular, strategic liquidity management is regulated in terms of VaR (measured based on a parametrical methodology with a one-day holding period and a 99% confidence level), stop loss and other operating limits in terms of concentration, issuing entity, business segment, country of emission, duration, ratings and type of investing instruments in portfolio, aimed to minimize market and liquidity risks. Financial leverage or short selling is not allowed. Activities in terms of strategic liquidity management started in the second half of the year 2013 (Euro portfolio) and throughout the course of the year 2017 (U.S. dollar portfolio). In 2021, the Strategic liquidity investment portfolio has maintained an average credit rating of A-/BBB+, in line with the year 2020. The following tables show amounts in terms of VaR, recorded in 2021 (compared with 2020), relating to interest rate and exchange rate  risks  in  the  first  section  and  commodity  risk  (aggregated by type of exposure). Regarding the management of strategic liquidity, the table reports the sensitivity to changes in interest rate.",

Eni defined credit risk management policies consistent with the nature and characteristics of the counterparties of commercial and financial transactions regarding the centralized finance model.\n\nThe Company adopted a model to quantify and control the credit risk based on the evaluation of the expected loss which represents the probability of default and the capacity to recover credits in default that is estimated through the so-called Loss Given Default. In  the  credit  risk  management  and  control  model,  credit exposures are distinguished by commercial nature, in relation to sales contracts on commodities related to Eni's businesses, and by financial nature, in relation to the financial instruments used by Eni, such as deposits, derivatives and securities.\n\n## CREDIT RISK FOR COMMERCIAL EXPOSURES\n\nCredit risk arising from commercial counterparties is managed by the business units and by the specialized corporate finance and dedicated administration departments and is operated based on formal procedures for the assessment of commercial counterparties,  the  monitoring  of  credit  exposures,  credit recovery  activities  and  disputes.  At  a  corporate  level,  the general  guidelines  and  methodologies  for  quantifying  and controlling customer risk are defined, in particular the riskiness of commercial counterparties is assessed through an internal rating model that combines different default factors deriving from  economic  variables,  financial  indicators,  payment experiences  and  information  from  specialized  primary  info providers. The probability of default related to State Entities or their closely related counterparties (e.g. National Oil Company),",

Finally, for retail positions without  specific  ratings,  risk  is  determined  by  distinguishing customers in homogeneous risk clusters based on historical series of data relating to payments, periodically updated.\n\n## CREDIT RISK FOR FINANCIAL EXPOSURES\n\nWith regard to credit risk arising from financial counterparties deriving from current and strategic use of liquidity, derivative contracts  and  transactions  with  underlying  financial  assets valued  at  fair  value,  Eni  has  established  internal  policies providing exposure control and concentration through maximum credit risk limits corresponding to different classes of financial counterparties defined by the Company's Board of Directors and based on ratings provided for by primary credit rating agencies. Credit risk arising from financial counterparties is  managed  by  the  Eni's  operating  finance  departments,  Eni Global Energy Markets SpA (EGEM), Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA (ETB) and Eni Trading & Shipping Inc (ETS Inc) specifically for commodity derivatives transactions, as well as by companies and  business  areas  limitedly  to  physical  transactions  with financial counterparties, consistently with the Group centralized finance  model.  Eligible  financial  counterparties  are  closely monitored  by  each  counterpart  and  by  group  of  belonging to check exposures against the limits assigned daily and the expected loss analysis and the concentration periodically.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the Group may not be available, or the Group is unable to sell its assets in the marketplace in order to meet short-term finance requirements  and  to  settle  obligations.  Such  a  situation would negatively affect Group results, as it would result in the Company  incurring  higher  borrowing  expenses  to  meet  its obligations or under the worst of conditions the inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\n\nEni's  risk  management  targets  include  the  maintaining  of an  adequate  level  of  liquidity  readily  available  to  deal  with external shocks (drastic changes in the scenario, restrictions on access to capital markets, etc.) or to ensure an adequate level  of  operational  flexibility  for  the  development  programs of the Company. The strategic liquidity reserve is employed in short-term marketable financial assets, favoring investments\n\nwith very low risk profile. At present, the Group believes to have access to sufficient funding to meet the current foreseeable borrowing requirements due to available cash on hand financial assets and lines of credit and the access to a wide range of funding opportunities which can be activated at competitive costs through the credit system and capital markets.\n\nDue  to  the  increased  volatility  of  commodity  markets  and the related higher financial commitment linked to the margin of  commodity  derivatives,  Eni  has  further  strengthened  its financial flexibility through the activation of new financing lines. Eni has in place a program for the issuance of Euro Medium Term Notes up to \u20ac20 billion, of which about \u20ac16.4 billion were drawn as of December 31, 2021 (\u20ac14.1 billion drawn by  Eni  SpA).  The  Group  has  credit  ratings  of  A-  outlook Stable and A-2, respectively, for long and short-term debt, assigned by Standard & Poor's; Baa1 outlook stable and P-2,  respectively,  for  long  and  short-term  debt,  assigned by Moody's; A- outlook stable and F1, respectively for long and short-term debt, assigned by Fitch. Eni's credit rating is linked, in addition to the Company's industrial fundamentals and trends in the trading environment, to the sovereign credit rating  of  Italy.  Based  on  the  methodologies  used  by  the credit rating agencies, a downgrade of Italy's credit rating may trigger a potential knock-on effect on the credit rating of Italian issuers such as Eni. During 2021, S&P revised Eni's outlook from negative to stable.\n\nIn May 2021, Eni placed two euro-denominated perpetual\n\nsubordinated hybrid bond issues for an aggregate nominal amount of \u20ac2 billion, in addition to those already issued in October 2020 for an aggregate nominal amount of \u20ac3 billion. These are perpetual instruments with an early repayment option in favor of the issuer and classified under IFRS as equity  instruments.  The  rating  agencies  assigned  to  the bonds the following ratings Baa3 / BBB / BBB (Moody's / S&P / Fitch) and an 'equity credit' of 50%.\n\nAs part of the Euro Medium Term Notes program, in 2021, Eni issued a sustainability-linked bond for a nominal amount of \u20ac1 billion linked to the achievement of sustainability targets concerning Net Carbon Footprint Upstream (Scope 1 and 2) and renewable energy installed capacity.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  Eni  maintained  short-term uncommitted unused borrowing facilities of \u20ac6,207 million. Total committed credit lines amounted to \u20ac5,114 million (of which \u20ac5,000 million pertaining to Eni SpA) of which \u20ac2,835 million unused. These facilities bore interest rates and fees for unused facilities that reflected prevailing market conditions.",

These obligations will require cash  settlements  in  future  reporting  periods.  These  liabilities are  valued  based  on  the  net  cost  for  the  company  to  fulfill  the contract, which consists of the lowest amount between the costs for the fulfillment of the contractual obligation and the contractual compensation/penalty in the event of non-performance.\n\nThe Company's main contractual obligations at the balance sheet  date  comprise  take-or-pay  clauses  contained  in  the Company's gas supply contracts or shipping arrangements, whereby  the  Company  obligations  consist  of  off-taking minimum  quantities  of  product  or  service  or,  in  case  of\n\nfailure, paying the corresponding cash amount that entitles the Company the right to collect the product or the service in future years. The amounts due were calculated on the basis of the assumptions for the gas prices and services included in the four-year industrial plan approved by the Company's management  and  for  subsequent  years  on  the  basis  of management's long-term assumptions.\n\nThe table below summarizes the Group principal contractual obligations for the main existing contractual obligations as of the balance sheet date, shown on an undiscounted basis. Amounts expected to be paid in 2022 for decommissioning Oil & Gas assets and for environmental clean-up and remediation are based on management's estimates and do not represent financial obligations at the closing date.\n\nMaturity year\n\n| (\u20ac million)                         | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027 and  thereafter   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------------------------|---------|\n| Decommissioning liabilities (a)     | 370    | 298    | 448    | 377    | 436    | 10,594                 | 12,523  |\n| Environmental liabilities           | 376    | 346    | 297    | 245    | 178    | 706                    | 2,148   |\n| Purchase obligations (b)            | 28,862 | 20,394 | 17,062 | 13,873 | 11,157 | 67,751                 | 159,099 |\n| - Gas                               |        |        |        |        |        |                        |         |\n| Take-or-pay contracts               | 25,874 | 19,547 | 16,344 | 13,483 | 10,934 | 67,377                 | 153,559 |\n| Ship-or-pay contracts               | 866    | 487    | 443    | 379    | 217    | 351                    | 2,743   |\n| - Other purchase obligations        | 2,122  | 360    | 275    | 11     | 6      | 23                     | 2,797   |\n| Other obligations                   | 2      |        |        |        |        | 104                    | 106     |\n| - Memorandum of intent - Val d'Agri | 2      |        |        |        |        | 104                    | 106     |\n| Total (c)                           | 29,610 | 21,038 | 17,807 | 14,495 | 11,771 | 79,155                 | 173,876 |\n\n- (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms.\n- (c) Total future payments for contractual commiments includes obligations of companies held for sale for \u20ac67 million.\n\n## CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS\n\nIn  the  next  four  years,  Eni  expects  capital  investments and capital expenditures of \u20ac28.1 billion.

Based on information available to date, taking into account the existing risk provisions disclosed in note 21 - Provisions and that in some instances it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of contingency losses, Eni believes that the foregoing will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn  addition  to  proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of business referred to above, Eni is party to other proceedings, and a description of the most significant proceedings currently pending is provided in the following paragraphs. Generally, and unless otherwise indicated, these legal proceedings have not been provisioned because Eni believes a negative outcome to be unlikely or because the amount of the provision cannot be estimated reliably.\n\n## 1. Environment, health and safety\n\n## 1.1 Criminal proceedings in the matters of environment, health and safety\n\n- i) Eni  Rewind  SpA  (company  incorporating  EniChem Agricoltura  SpA  -  Agricoltura  SpA  in  liquidation  EniChem  Augusta  Industriale  Srl  -  Fosfotec  Srl)  Proceeding about the industrial site of Crotone. In 2010 a criminal proceeding started before the Public Prosecutor of  Crotone  relating  to  allegations  of  environmental disaster, poisoning of substances used in the food chain and omitted clean-up due to the activity at a landfill site which  was  taken  over  by  Eni  in  1991.  Subsequently to Eni's takeover, any activity for waste conferral was stopped. The defendants are certain managers of Eni Group companies, that have managed the landfill since 1991. The Municipality of Crotone is acting as plaintiff. In March 2019, the public prosecutor requested the acquittal of all defendants. The proceeding is ongoing. Although the public prosecutor requested the acquittal of all the defendants, on January 17, 2020, the Court asked the Public Prosecutor to amend the charges in order to clarify the modalities and timing of each alleged conduct. At the preliminary hearing of July 1, 2020, the Court acquitted all the defendants, some for not having committed the alleged crime and others for expiration of the statute of limitations. The Company therefore decided to appeal the decision to obtain an acquittal on the merits also in relation to the positions of the former managers of the Eni Group acquitted due to expiration of the statute of limitations. The decision on the appeal is pending.\n\nEni  Rewind  SpA  -  Crotone  omitted  clean-up. In April  2017,  a  new  criminal  case  was  opened  by  the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\niv)\n\nPublic  Prosecutor  of  Crotone  relating  to  reclamation activities  at  the  Crotone  site.  Meanwhile,  in  the  first half of 2018, the new clean-up project presented by the Company was deemed feasible by the Italian Ministry for the Environment. Pending the decision of the Public Prosecutor, a defense brief was filed to summarize the activity carried out by the subsidiary Eni Rewind SpA (former Syndial SpA) in terms of reclamation, pointing to  willingness  of  executing  a  decisive  plan  of  action, and to obtain the dismissal of the criminal proceedings. On  March  3 rd ,  2020,  the  Ministerial  Decree  approving the  POB  Phase  2  was  issued.  The  Public  Prosecutor has  submitted  a  filing  request  and  the  judge  for  the preliminary investigations has set a chamber hearing. By a court order of January 10, 2022, new investigations have been requested, assigning a four-month term to the Public Prosecutor for their conduct.\n\n## iii) Eni Rewind SpA and Versalis SpA - Porto Torres dock.\n\nIn 2012, following a request of the Public Prosecutor of Sassari, an Italian court ordered presentation of evidence relating to the functioning of the hydraulic barrier of Porto Torres site (ran by Eni Rewind SpA) and its capacity to avoid the dispersion of contamination released by the site into the nearby sea. Eni Rewind and Versalis were notified that its chief executive officers and certain other managers were being investigated. The Public Prosecutor of the Municipality of Sassari requested that these individuals stand trial. The plaintiffs, the Ministry for Environment and the Sardinia Region claimed environmental damage in an amount of \u20ac1.5 billion. Other parties referred to the judge's equitable assessment. At a hearing in July 2016, the court acquitted all defendants of Eni Rewind and Versalis with respect to the crimes of environmental disaster. Three Eni Rewind managers were found guilty of environmental disaster relating to the period limited to August 2010-January 2011 and sentenced to one-year prison, with a suspended sentence. Eni Rewind filed an appeal against this decision.\n\nThe trial before the Second Instance Court of Cagliari ended on December 14, 2021 with the confirmation of first-degree sentence, also in relation to the civil rulings. The merits of the sentence are yet to be made public for the purposes of the related appeal.\n\n- Eni  Rewind  SpA  -  The  illegal  landfill  in  Minciaredda area, Porto Torres site. The Court of Sassari, on request of the Public Prosecutor, seized the Minciaredda landfill area, near the western border of the Porto Torres site (Minciaredda area). All the indicted have been served a notice of investigation for alleged crimes of carrying out illegal waste disposal and environmental disaster.

The court determined that Eni Rewind can be sued for civil liability and resolved that all defendants and the Eni subsidiary be put on trial before the Court of Sassari.\n\nUpon  start  of  the  trial,  the  Italian  Ministry  for  Energy Transition (MITE) was allowed to enter the judgment as plaintiff and the Court declared invalid the indictment decree against Eni Rewind as entity liable pursuant to Legislative  Decree  no.  231/01,  returning  the  case  to the judge of the preliminary hearing, who subsequently issued  the  decree  setting  a  new  preliminary  hearing scheduled for March 31, 2022. The hearing against the defendants is in progress.\n\n## v) Eni Rewind SpA - The Phosphate deposit at Porto Torres\n\nsite. In 2015, the Court of Sassari, accepting a request of the Public Prosecutor of Sassari, seized - as a preventive measure  -  the  area  of  'Palte  Fosfatiche'  (phosphates deposit) located on the territory of Porto Torres site, in relation  to  alleged  crimes  of  environmental  disaster, carrying out of unauthorized disposal of hazardous wastes and other environmental crimes. Eni Rewind SpA is being investigated pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01. In November 2019, a request for referral to trial was served on the Eni subsidiary. The preliminary hearing was held on September 9, 2020. At the outcome of the preliminary hearing,  during  which  the  municipality  of  Porto  Torres filed  a  civil  action,  the  Judge  pronounced  against  all  the defendants a sentence of no place to proceed due to the statute of limitation in relation to the crimes of unauthorized management of landfills and disposal of hazardous wastes as well as against Eni Rewind SpA in relation to the liability pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01. The Judge also ordered the indictment of the defendants before the Court of Sassari, at the hearing on May 28, 2021, limited to the alleged crime of environmental disaster.\n\nUpon start of the trial, the MITE was allowed to enter the judgment as plaintiff. The Court, accepting the defense's objections, declared the indictment invalid and returned the case to the judge of the preliminary hearing. A hearing before the judge is pending.\n\n## vi) Eni Rewind SpA - Proceeding relating to the asbestos\n\n- at the Ravenna site. A criminal proceeding is pending before the Tribunal of Ravenna relating to the crimes of  culpable  manslaughter,  injuries  and  environmental disaster,  which  have  been  allegedly  committed  by former Eni Rewind employees at the site of Ravenna. The site was acquired by Eni Rewind following a number of  corporate  mergers  and  acquisitions.  The  alleged crimes date back to 1991. In the proceeding there are\n\nvii)\n\n75 alleged victims. The plaintiffs include relatives of the alleged victims, various local administrations, and other institutional  bodies,  including  local  trade  unions.  Eni Rewind asserted the statute of limitations as a defense to  the  instance  of  environmental  disaster  for  certain instances of diseases and deaths. The court at Ravenna decided that all defendants would stand trial and held that the statute of limitations only applied with reference to certain instances of crime of culpable injury. Eni Rewind reached some settlements. In November 2016, the Judge acquitted  the  defendants  in  all  the  contested  cases except for one, an asbestos case, for which a conviction was handed down. The defendants, the Prosecutor and the plaintiffs appealed the decision; the second instance judge ordered a complex inquiry. Eni's defenders recused a member of the expert panel who conducted the inquiry, and  the  Second  Instance  Court  rejected  the  request for recusal with an order subsequently canceled by the Third Instance Court. On the referral, at the request of Eni's  lawyers,  the  Court  of  Appeals  of  Bologna,  given the different composition of the judging panel, ordered the renewal of the appeal trial and, consequently, the subsequent revocation of the order with which it had initially ordered the inquiry. On May 25, 2020 the Court acquitted  the  defendants  and  the  persons  sued  for damages in relation to 74 cases of mesothelioma, lung cancer, pleural plaques and asbestosis, took note of the res judicata with regards to the acquittal for the disaster complaint while confirming the conviction for one case of asbestosis. The Court also declared inadmissible the appeal of several claimants. The Company filed an appeal with the Third Instance Court against the conviction for asbestosis; some claimants challenged the acquittal for the other pathologies.\n\nOn  November  24,  2021,  the  Third  Instance  Court:  (i) annulled, without postponement, the contested sentence against a defendant for extinction of the crime; (ii) annulled without  referral  to  the  criminal  effects  the  sentence contested for the crime of negligent injury in relation to the case of asbestosis because it fell under statute of limitations, rejecting the appeals of Eni's lawyers for civil purposes;  (iii)  rejected  the  appeals  of  the  civil  parties. Therefore,  the  criminal  proceeding  is  closed  but  any subsequent litigation for civil liability may be initiated.\n\n- Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA  -  Alleged  environmental  disaster. A  criminal proceeding  is  pending  in  relation  to  crimes  allegedly committed  by  the  managers  of  the  Raffineria  di  Gela SpA and EniMed SpA relating to environmental disaster, unauthorized  waste  disposal  and  unauthorized  spill of  industrial  wastewater.

This criminal proceeding initially regarded soil pollution allegedly caused by spills from 14 tanks of the refinery storage, which had not been provided with double bottoms, and pollution of the sea water near the coastal area adjacent to the site due to the failure of the barrier system implemented as part of the clean-up activities conducted at the site. At the closing of the preliminary investigation, the Public Prosecutor of Gela merged into this proceeding the other investigations related to the pollution that occurred at the other sites of the Gela refinery as well as hydrocarbon spills at facilities of EniMed. The proceeding is ongoing.\n\nVal d'Agri. In March 2016, the Public Prosecutors of Potenza  started  a  criminal  investigation  into  alleged illegal  handling  of  waste  material  produced  at  the Viggiano  oil  center  (COVA),  part  of  the  Eni  operated Val d'Agri oil complex. After a two-year investigation, the  Prosecutors  ordered  the  house  arrest  of  5  Eni employees and the seizure of certain plants functional to  the  production  activity  of  the  Val  d'Agri  complex which,  consequently,  was  shut  down.  From  the commencement  of  the  investigation,  Eni  has  carried out several technical and environmental surveys, with the  support  of  independent  experts  of  international standing,  who  found  a  full  compliance  of  the  plant and  the  industrial  process  with  the  requirements  of the  applicable  laws,  as  well  as  with  best  available technologies  and  international  best  practices.  The Company  implemented  certain  corrective  measures to upgrade plants which were intended to address the claims made by the Public Prosecutor about an alleged operation of blending which would have occurred during normal plant functioning. Those corrective measures were favorably reviewed by the Public Prosecutor. The Company restarted the plant in August 2016. In relation to the criminal proceeding, the Public Prosecutor's Office requested the indictment of all the defendants for alleged illegal trafficking of waste, violation of the prohibition of mixing waste, unauthorized management of waste and other violations, and the Company for administrative offenses pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01. The trial started in November 2017. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearings, the Court of Potenza, on March 10, 2021, acquitted all the defendants in relation to the allegation of false statements in an administrative deed, while in relation to the alleged administrative offenses, the Court found that there was no need to proceed due to the statute of limitations. Finally, in relation to the alleged  crime  of  illegal  trafficking  of  waste,  the  Court acquitted two former employees of the Southern District for  not  having  committed  the  crime,  convicted  six former officials of the same District with suspension of\n\nix)\n\nx)\n\nthe sentence and sentenced Eni pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01 to pay a fine of \u20ac700,000, with the contextual  confiscation  of  a  sum  of  \u20ac  44,248,071 deemed to constitute the unfair profit obtained from the crime, from which Eni will deduct the amount incurred for the plant upgrade carried out in 2016.\n\nFollowing  the  filing  of  the  merits  of  the  sentence  by the  Court,  an  appeal  was  promptly  filed  against  all  the condemnations and the setting of the appeal judgment is pending.\n\n- Eni SpA - Health investigation related to the COVA center. Beside  the  criminal  proceeding  for  illegal trafficking  of  waste,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Potenza started another investigation in relation to alleged health violations. The Public Prosecutor requested the formal opening of an investigation with respect to nine people in relation to alleged violations of the rules providing for the preparation of a Risk Assessment Document of the working conditions at the Val d'Agri Oil Center (COVA). In March 2017, following the request of the consultant of the Prosecutor, the Labor Inspectorate of Potenza issued a fine against the employers of the COVA for omitted and incomplete  assessment  of  the  chemical  risks  for  the COVA  center.  In  October  2017,  the  Prosecutor's  Office changed the criminal allegations to disaster, murder and negligent personal injury, also alleging breaches of health and safety regulations. The proceeding is ongoing.\n\nProceeding Val d'Agri - Tank spill. In February 2017, the Italian police department of Potenza found a stream of water contaminated by hydrocarbon traces of unknown origin,  flowing  inside  a  small  shaft  located  outside the COVA. Eni carried out activities at the COVA aimed at  determining  the  origin  of  the  contamination  and identified  the  cause  in  a  failure  of  a  tank  (the  'D'  tank) outside of the COVA, that presented a risk of extension of  the  contamination  in  the  downstream  area  of  the plant.  In  executing  these  activities,  Eni  performed  all the communications provided for by Legislative Decree no. 152/06 and started certain emergency safe-keeping operations at the areas subject to potential contamination outside the COVA. Furthermore, the characterization plan of the areas inside and outside the COVA was approved by the relevant authorities, to which the Risk Analysis document was subsequently submitted. Following this event, a criminal investigation was initiated in order to ascertain whether there had been illegal environmental disaster  by  the  former  COVA  officers,  the  Operation Managers in charge since 2011 and the HSE Manager in charge at the time of the accident, and also against Eni in relation to the same offense pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01 and of some public officials belonging",

The  Company has paid damages of an immaterial amount almost to all the landlords of areas close to the COVA, which were affected  by  a  spillover.  Discussions  are  ongoing  with other  claimants.  The  likely  disbursements  relating  to these transactions have been provisioned. In February 2018, Eni contested the reports presented in October and in December 2017 by the Italian Fire Department stating that it does not consider itself obliged to carry out the integration required, considering that the data acquired in the area affected by the event indicate, according to Eni's assessments, that the loss was promptly and efficiently controlled and there were no situations of serious danger to  human  health  and  the  environment.  In  April  2019, precautionary measures were ordered against three Eni employees at the COVA which, following an appeal, were canceled by the Third Instance Court. In September 2019, the Public Prosecutor requested one of those employees to be put on trial with expedited proceeding, accepted by the Judge for preliminary investigations. The judgment was suspended in order to allow the continuation of the environmental clean-up and reclamation of the site. As part of the concomitant procedure against the remaining employees and Eni as the legal entity being held liable pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  no.  231/01,  the  Public Prosecutor, after issuing a notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations, made a request for indictment. At the outcome of the preliminary hearing, with reference to the imputation to Eni pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01, the judge of the preliminary issued a sentence not to prosecute the Company for the events up to 2015 because the fact was not envisaged by the law as a crime to claim a legal entity liable for. With reference to the events subsequent to 2015, the judge acknowledged the nullity of the request for indictment, thus returning the documents to the Public Prosecutor. Finally, the judge of the preliminary hearing approved to put on trial two Eni employees before the Court of Potenza, establishing the hearing on June 27, 2022, with the allegation of unnamed disaster, rejecting the request of the Public Prosecutor for qualifying the alleged crime as a new type of legal offence (environmental disaster).\n\n- xi) Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA  -  Waste  management  of  the  landfill  Camastra. In June 2018, the Public Prosecutor of Palermo (Sicily) notified Eni's subsidiaries Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA of a criminal proceeding relating to allegations of unlawful disposal of industrial waste  resulting  from  the  reclaiming  activities  of  soil,\n\nwhich were discharged at a landfill owned by a third party. The Prosecutor charged the then chief executive officers of the two subsidiaries, and the legal entities have been charged with the liability pursuant to Legislative Decree no.  231/01.  The  alleged  wrongdoing  related  to  the willful falsification of the waste certification for purpose of  discharging  at  the  landfill.  The  charges  against  the CEO of the Refinery of Gela SpA and the company itself were dismissed, while a request to put on trial the CEO of EniMed SpA and the company was approved. The proceeding is in progress before the Court of Agrigento, to which the proceeding has been transferred due to territorial jurisdiction.\n\n- xii) Versalis SpA - Preventive seizure at the Priolo Gargallo plant. In February 2019, the Court of Syracuse at the request of the Public Prosecutor of Siracusa ordered the seizure of the Priolo/Gargallo plant as part of an ongoing investigation  concerning  the  offenses  of  dangerous disposal of materials and environmental pollution, by the former plant manager of Versalis, pursuant to Legislative Decree  no.  231/01.  The  Public  Prosecutor's  thesis, according to the consultants, is that the seized plants have points of emissions that do not comply with the Best Available Techniques (BAT), therefore resulting in violation of the applicable legislation. Versalis has already implemented certain plant upgrades designed to comply with measures requested by the Public Prosecutor and its consultants. Based on this, an appeal was filed against the measure of precautionary seizure of the plant, which determined the revocation of the seizure of the plants on March 26, 2019. In March 2021, a notice of conclusion of  the  preliminary  investigations  was  notified,  with  the formulation by the Public Prosecutor of the allegations already previously stated.\n- xiii) Eni SpA - Fatal accident Ancona offshore platform. On March 5, 2019, a fatal accident occurred at the Barbara F platform in the offshore of Ancona. During the unloading phase of a tank from the platform to a supply vessel, there was a sudden failure of a part of the structure on which a crane was installed, causing the death of an Eni employee who was inside the control cabin of the crane and injuries to two other workers. The Public Prosecutor of Ancona initially opened an investigation against unknown persons and ordered further technical appraisals relating to the crane. As part of the technical assessment of the incident,  the  Public  Prosecutor  resolved  to  put  under investigation two Eni employees who were in charge of safety standards at the involved facility. Also the Company has been put under investigation as entity liable pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01, and two employees of the contractor company that owned the boat. In May 2021",

Following complaints made by  former  contractors,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Gela ordered  an  inspection  and  seizure  of  the  area  called Isola  32  within  the  refinery  of  Gela,  where  old  and  new monitored landfills are located. The proceeding concerns criminal allegations of environmental pollution, omitted clean-up,  negligent  personal  injury  and  illegal  waste management, as part of the execution of clean-up of soil and groundwater as well as decommissioning activities in the area currently managed by Eni Rewind SpA, also on behalf of the companies Raffineria di Gela SpA, ISAF SpA  (in  liquidation)  and  Versalis  SpA  with  respect  to the  efficiency  and  efficacy  of  the  barrier  system.  The Public  Prosecutor  acquired  documents  and  evidence at  the  Syndial office in Gela and at the refinery of Gela, which,  during  the  period  January  1,  2017-March  20, 2019,  managed  the  facilities  involved  in  cleaning  up the groundwater area (TAF Syndial, site TAF-TAS and pumping  wells  and  hydraulic  barrier).  Subsequently  a decree was issued for the seizure of 11 piezometers of the hydraulic barrier system with contextual guarantee notice, issued by the Public Prosecutor of Gela against nine employees of the Gela Refinery and four employees of Syndial SpA.\n\nUpon conclusion of unrepeatable technical investigations and  analyses  both  on  the  piezometers  placed  under seizure, and on the TAF and TAS plants, on October 11, 2021, a preventive seizure order was notified by the judge of the preliminary investigations of Gela, at the request of  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office,  with  reference  to  the plants used for the remediation of the site's underground water (groundwater extraction wells and TAF treatment) managed today by Eni Rewind as well as the plant areas intended  for  the  implementation  of  the  groundwater remediation project. A judicial administrator was appointed to manage those facilities. Eni companies are collaborating with the Judge to continue the remediation activities and to provide a clear picture of the correctness of their actions.\n\n- xv) Eni Rewind  SpA  and  Versalis  SpA  -  Mantua. Environmental  crime  investigation. In August  and September  2020,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Mantua notified the conclusion of the preliminary investigations relating to several criminal proceedings. Several employees  of  the  Eni's  subsidiaries  Versalis  SpA  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nxvi)\n\nEni Rewind SpA as well as of the third-party company Edison  SpA  were  notified  of  being  under  investigation. Furthermore, the above-mentioned entities were being investigated  for  administrative  offences  pursuant  to Legislative Decree no. 231/01. The Public Prosecutor is alleging,  with  respect  to  some  specific  areas  related  to the Mantua industrial hub, the crimes of unauthorized waste management, environmental damage and pollution, omitted  communication  of  environmental contamination and omitted clean-up. Following the filing of defense briefs, the case has been dismissed against some individuals and archived. The Public Prosecutor's Office  then  requested  the  indictment  of  the  remaining defendants. During the Preliminary Hearing, the MITE, the  Province  of  Mantua,  the  Municipality  of  Mantua and Mincio Regional Park were allowed in the trial as plaintiffs, while the companies Eni Rewind, Versalis and Edison were sued as civil parties. The preliminary hearing is in progress.\n\n- Versalis  SpA  -  Brindisi  plant  factory  flares  and  odor. On May 18, 2018 the manager of the Versalis plant in Brindisi and two other employees were summoned in order to provide information regarding two episodes that occurred in April 2018 which led to the activation of the plant torches. The company cooperated with the judicial authorities to provide information and exclude that such events had a negative impact on air quality. Moreover, the Company is reviewing available data and carrying out upgrading to minimize any detrimental effect, even if  only  visual,  of  the  flaring  phenomenon  through  the construction of a new ground torch facility. At the end of May 2020, in conjunction with a scheduled shutdown of  the  plant,  anomalous  concentrations  of  benzene and  toluene  were  detected;  on  that  basis,  the  mayor of Brindisi ordered the plant shutdown. The order was issued without any technical check on the real correlation between the peaks detected in the air and the activities in progress at the plant. After a close discussion with the authorities in charge, the order was revoked. The Public Prosecutor of Brindisi acquired information and documents, also produced by the Company, related to the aforementioned order to verify, also from a criminal point  of  view,  any  connection  or  responsibilities.  The proceeding subsequently started a proceeding against unknown persons.\n\nThe  Company  has  provided  all  the  competent  local Authorities,  including  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office, with all the information and data useful for the correct reconstruction of the facts. Subsequently, in the context of  the  criminal  proceedings,  the  two  pro-tempore directors  of  the  plant  and  the  Operations  manager for the crimes referred to the disposal of hazardous",

In the period in which Eni was in charge of the Civitavecchia storage hub (2008-2018), pending the approval of a characterization plan of the environmental status of the site, the Company, in coordination with public authorities, adopted measures to preserve the safety of the groundwaters and to pursue the clean-up process of the site until its disposal.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor of Civitavecchia issued a notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations, contesting, among others, the former manager of the Eni fuel storage hub of Civitavecchia, the alleged crime of environmental pollution in relation to the mismanagement of the hydraulic barrier  placed  over  the  site  aimed  at  putting  under emergency safety the contaminated groundwater, as part of the clean-up process in progress. This circumstance would have been reported by officials of a local authority (ARPA), to whom technical feedback has been provided several times over the years. Eni is under investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01. The prosecutor made a request for indictment. At the preliminary hearing a procedural defect was detected, and the documents were again sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office.\n\nFollowing the renewed preliminary hearing of February 10, 2022, the judge ordered the indictment of the people involved, setting the hearing for June 26, 2023 and declared the nullity of the request for indictment for legal persons, due to lack of notification committal for trial, thus returning the documents to the Public Prosecutor for its renewal.\n\n- xviii) Eni SpA R&M Refinery of Livorno - Criminal proceedings for accidents at work. On October 20, 2020, a notice was served at the Livorno refinery for Eni as entity subjected to preliminary investigations in the context of a criminal proceeding pending before the Public Prosecutor's Office of Livorno, in relation to an accident at work occurred in summer of 2019 at an electrical substation of the Refinery and as consequence two employees were injured. The allegation  is  of  aggravated  personal  injury  while  the Company is accused of being the entity liable pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01.\n\nThe Judicial Police, delegated by the Public Prosecutor's Office, has made requests for documentary presentation in order to acquire useful elements for assessing whether the company has adopted a suitable 231 model with the related procedures and management and organization systems to prevent the alleged crime.\n\nThe  Company  collected  and  promptly  provided  the required documentation. In September 2021, the Public Prosecutor's Office issued a notice of conclusion of the\n\npreliminary investigations. Subsequently, the summons to  trial  was  notified  with  the  first  hearing  set  for September 8, 2022.\n\n## 1.2  Civil and administrative proceedings in the matters of environment, health and safety\n\ni)\n\n- Eni  Rewind  SpA  -  Versalis  SpA  -  Eni  SpA  (R&M)  Augusta Harbor. The Italian Ministry for the Environment with various administrative acts required companies that were operating plants in the petrochemical site of Priolo to perform safety and environmental remediation works in the Augusta harbor. Companies involved include Eni subsidiaries  Versalis,  Eni  Rewind  and  Eni's  Refining  & Marketing  Division.  Pollution  has  been  detected  in  this area primarily due to a high mercury concentration that is allegedly attributed to the industrial activity of the Priolo petrochemical  site.  The  above-mentioned  companies contested these administrative actions, objecting in  particular  to  the  nature  of  the  remediation  works decided  and  the  methods  whereby  information  on  the pollutants concentration has been gathered. A number of administrative proceedings started on this matter were subsequently merged before the Regional Administrative Court. In October 2012, the Court ruled in favor of Eni's subsidiaries  against  the  Ministry's  requirements  for the removal of the pollutants and the construction of a physical barrier. In September 2017, the Ministry served all the companies involved with a formal notice for the start  of  remediation  and  environmental  restoration  of the Augusta harbor within 90 days, basing its request on an alleged ascertainment of liability on the basis of the 2012 provision of Regional Administrative Court. In June 2019, the Italian Ministry for the Environment set up a permanent technical committee to review the matter of the clean-up and reclamation of the Augusta harbor. The report, recalling the warning of 2017, confirmed the thesis of the parties on the responsibility of the companies colocated for the contamination of the Rada and affirmed a breach of the aforementioned warning by the companies, also  communicated  to  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office.  In agreement  with  all  the  other  companies  involved,  this report and other parallel internal technical investigations were challenged for defensive purposes. Eni's subsidiaries proposed  to  the  Italian Environmental  Ministry to start  a  collaboration  with  other  interested  parties  to find  remediation  measures  based  on  new  available environmental  data  collected  by  independent  agencies, without prejudice to the need for the parties to correctly identify the legal entity responsible for the contamination detected.  In  the  meantime,  the  Company  requested, in  full  compliance  with  applicable  environmental  laws, to  establish  a  roadmap  for  identifying  the  companies",

In January 2021, the Company, having received communication of the calling of a second environmental review  of  the  same  subject  to  the  first  scheduled  for February 10, 2021, requested also to take part to this second review and to be able to view the technical documents subject  to  discussion.  However,  in  February  2021,  the General Directorate for Environmental Remediation of the Ministry deemed the request unacceptable.\n\nFollowing a decision-making conference, in April 2021, the  Ministry  decided  that  it  could  intervene  in  the procedure  aimed  at  identifying  any  reclamation  and clean-up activities to be carried out in the harbor which costs are to be charged to the companies operating in the area, on the basis of questionable assumptions, such as the alleged non-compliance of those companies with the formal notice of September 7, 2017 which had ordered those companies to commence reclamation and clean-up activities. The company filed an appeal and urged the Free Consortium of Syracuse (LCCS) to start the process of identifying the responsible for the pollution. Interlocutions are underway with the Ministry and the LCCS to solicit a response to this request.\n\n- ii) Eni  SpA  -  Eni  Rewind  SpA  (former  Syndial  SpA)  Raffineria di Gela SpA - Claim for preventive technical inquiry. In  February  2012,  Eni's  subsidiaries  Raffineria  di Gela SpA and Eni Rewind SpA and the parent company Eni SpA (involved in this matter through the operations of the Refining & Marketing Division) were notified of a claim issued by the parents of children with birth defects in the Municipality of Gela between 1992 and 2007. The claim called for an inquiry aimed at determining any causality between  the  birth  defects  suffered  by  these  children and any environmental pollution caused by the Gela site, quantifying the alleged damages suffered and eventually identifying the terms and conditions to settle the claim. The  same  issue  was  the  subject  of  previous  criminal\n\nproceedings, of which one closed without determining any illegal behavior on the part of Eni or its subsidiaries, while a further criminal proceeding is still pending. In December 2015, the three companies involved were sued in relation to a total of 30 cases of compensation for damages in civil proceedings. In May 2018, the Court issued a first instance judgment concerning one case. The Judge rejected the claim  for  damages,  acknowledging  the  arguments  of the defendant companies in relation to the absence of evidence concerning the existence of a causal link between the  birth  defects  and  the  alleged  industrial  pollution. The  judgment  has  been  appealed  by  the  claimants. In  June  2021  the  Civil  Court  of  Gela  issued  a  second judgment rejecting the claim for compensation, recognizing the validity of the arguments of the defendant companies regarding the lack of evidence on the existence of a cause between the pathology and the alleged industrial pollution. The counterparties filed an appeal and a hearing was set for March 17, 2022, then postponed to April 20, 2022.\n\n- iii) Environmental  claim  relating  to  the  Municipality  of Cengio. Since 2008 a brought by the Italian Ministry for the  Environment  and  the  Delegated  Commissioner  for Environmental Emergency in the territory of the Municipality of Cengio is pending at first instance before the Court of Genoa. Those parties summoned Eni Rewind before a Civil Court and demanded that Eni's subsidiary compensate for the environmental damage relating to the site of Cengio. The request for environmental damage amounted to \u20ac250 million plus an additional amount for health damage to be quantified  during  the  proceeding.  The  plaintiffs  accused Eni Rewind of negligence in performing the clean-up and remediation of the site.\n\nBetween  2014  and  2021,  Eni  and  the  Ministry  of  the Environment tried to settle the proceeding, without however reaching a definitive agreement. The Judge restarted the proceeding  with  the  filing,  on  December  30,  2021  of  the definitive  technical  review  from  an  appointed  consultant. This review is particularly positive for Eni Rewind as it highlights  the  story  of  the  contamination,  setting  the baseline  at  1989/1990  (date  of  Enimont  transfer)  and considering there was no subsequent deterioration. The appraisal,  among  other  things,  highlights  the  Ministry's negligence towards the settlement proposals advanced by Eni and which would have brought benefits to the territory. At the hearing of February 24, 2022, following a request for filing of documentation received by the plaintiff, the judge ordered the admission of part of the documentation and withheld the case for decision, allowing the parties 60 days for the filing of final briefs and 20 days for the reply notes. Meanwhile, on July 3 rd , 2020, the EU infringement procedure on area A1 (initiated voluntarily by the Company and at the request of the Ministry of the Environment) was concluded",

        "page_content": "and the Company was able to remedy the initial failure to make the clean-up plan of the industrial site of Cengio undergo a full environmental appraisal. The Company's position on the adequacy of the environmental intervention measures adopted was therefore further strengthened. In March 2021, the Inspection Commission also issued a  test  certificate  for  the  works  carried  out  on  the  soils, thereby further strengthening the restorative suitability of the measures carried out by the Company.\n\nOn August 10, 2021, the Company filed an extraordinary appeal to the President of the Republic to eliminate the part in which the Company was requested to start a new remediation procedure in order to rebuild, in the light of an alleged contamination, the model and the consequent interventions aimed at its containment/ elimination, as well as against the opinion of ISPRA-ARPA Liguria on the health risk analysis for a portion of the site of Cengio.\n\n- iv) Val d'Agri - Eni/Vibac. In September 2019 a claim was brought in the Court of Potenza against Eni. The plaintiffs are  80  people,  living  in  different  municipalities  of  the Val d'Agri area, who are complaining of economic, noneconomic,  biological  and  moral  damages,  all  deriving from the presence of Eni's oil facilities in the territory. In particular, the claim refers to certain events which allegedly caused damage to the local community and the territory (such as a 2017 spill, flaring events since 2014, smelly and noisy emissions). The Judge has been asked to ascertain Eni's  responsibility  for  causing  emissions  of  polluting substances into the atmosphere. The plaintiffs have also requested that Eni be ordered to interrupt any polluting activity and be allowed to resume industrial activities on condition  that  all  the  necessary  remediation  measures be implemented to eliminate all of the alleged dangerous situations. Finally, they are asking that Eni compensate all direct and indirect property damages, current and future, to an extent that will be quantified in the course of the case. At the end of the trial phase, the Judge submitted to the parties the proposal for an extra-judicial settlement, fixing a deadline to present further proposals on the matter.\n\nThe parties did not adhere to the conciliatory proposal. During the last hearing on February 19, 2021, the Judge set the hearing for the clarification of the conclusions on June 30, 2023.\n\n- v) Eni  SpA  -  Climate  change. In  2017  and  2018,  local government authorities and a fishing association brought in the courts of the State of California seven proceedings against  Eni  subsidiary  Eni  Oil  &  Gas  Inc.  and  other companies. These proceedings claim compensation for the damages attributable to the increase in sea level and temperature, as well as to hydrogeological instability. The cases have been transferred, by request of the defendants,\n\nfrom  the  State  Courts  to  the  Federal  Courts.  A  specific request has been filed, highlighting the lack of jurisdiction of the State Courts.\n\nIn 2019, the Federal Court referred the cases to the State Courts. The defendants then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the order for postponement. All  proceedings  were  suspended  pending  the  appeal before  the  Ninth  Circuit  Court.  On  May  26,  2020  the proceedings resumed in the State Courts. On July 9, 2020, Eni Oil & Gas Inc., together with other defendants, signed a petition for rehearing 'en blanc' to request a review of the postponement decision by the competent 9 th Circuit Court. The dispute was suspended until a decision is made on the petition for rehearing. The Court rejected the petition for rehearing en banc but, at the request of the defendants, granted a suspension of the proceedings for 120 days (until January 2021) to allow the defendants to present a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States in order to obtain the revision of the rejection. The petition was then presented in January 2021. The Supreme Court, accepting the petition, ordered Ninth Circuit Court to reconsider the question of jurisdiction by evaluating all the legal arguments in favor of federal jurisdiction.\n\nIn June 2021, defendants filed a motion ('Consent Motion') in the Ninth Circuit Court setting out arguments in favor of federal jurisdiction in addition to the initial defenses.\n\nIn early July 2021, Consent Motion was rejected. Pending the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court -which is expected within one year and which, as indicated by the Supreme Court,  will  in  any  case  have  to  take  into  consideration all the potential legal bases of federal jurisdiction -the proceedings remain suspended.\n\n- vi) Eni  Rewind/Province  of  Vicenza  -  Clean-up  process for Trissino site. On May 7, 2019 the Province of Vicenza issued  a  warning,  imposing  on  certain  individuals  and companies  as  MITENI  SpA  in  bankruptcy,  Mitsubishi and ICI the obligation to clean-up the Trissino site where MITENI  carried  out  its  industrial  activity.  Based  on  the analysis  carried  out  by  administrative  parties,  significant concentrations of substances considered highly toxic and carcinogenic  were  allegedly  discovered  in  groundwater and in surface water at this site. The analysis carried out by the Province of Vicenza with the direct involvement of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 reported the presence of these substances in the blood of about 53,000 people in the area. The action of health analysis and monitoring by the institutions is expected to increase. The Province warned some individuals, including a former employee who served between 1988 and 1996 as CEO of a company that was subsequently acquired by Eni Rewind.\n\nIn  an  initial  phase  of  the  administrative  procedure, there  were  no  references  to  former  company  Enichem",

However, Eni Rewind was called into question as the 'successor' of Enichem in several appeals before the Regional Administrative Court as the majority shareholder of MITENI. In February 2020, the Province extended the proceeding also to Eni Rewind, which filed a counterclaim for having its position taken out of the procedure.\n\nHowever, on October 5, 2020 the Province summoned Eni Rewind to take part in the remediation interventions on the site, including participation in technical meetings and at the conferences that would be convened by the public entities in relation to the site remediation activities.\n\nEni Rewind appealed to a Regional Administrative Court against  the  Province  claims  and  orders.  Eni  Rewind is participating  in  these  meetings,  carrying  out  the environmental interventions and has made itself available to  carry  out -as  part  of  the  project  approved  by  the territorial administrations in charge -further anti-pollution interventions on a voluntary basis and without giving any acquiescence with respect to the liability charges for the pollution by chemical agents. A provision for risks has been accrued for the execution of these interventions.\n\n## 2. Proceedings concerning criminal/administrative corporate responsibility\n\n- i) Block  OPL  245  -  Nigeria. A  first-degree  judgment  of acquittal was issued by a tribunal in Milan in March 2021 in a criminal case pending against certain of Eni's employees and  the  Company  itself  as  entity  liable  as  per  Italian Legislative  Decree  no.  231/01  for  alleged  international corruption in connection with the acquisition in 2011 of the OPL 245 exploration block in Nigeria. The case dates back to July 2014, when the Public Prosecutor of Milan served  Eni  with  a  notice  of  investigation  pursuant  to Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/01. The proceeding was commenced  following  a  claim  filed  by  NGO  ReCommon relating to alleged corruptive practices which, according to the Public Prosecutor, allegedly involved the Resolution Agreement  made  on  April  29,  2011  relating  to  the  socalled Oil Prospecting License of the offshore oilfield that was  discovered  in  OPL  245.  Eni  fully  cooperated  with the  Public  Prosecutor  and  promptly  filed  the  requested documentation. Furthermore, Eni voluntarily reported the matter to the US Department of Justice ('DoJ') and the US SEC. In July 2014, Eni's Board of Statutory Auditors jointly with the Eni Watch Structure resolved to engage an independent, US-based law firm, expert in anticorruption, to conduct a forensic, independent review of the matter, upon informing the Judicial Authorities. After reviewing the matter, the US lawyers concluded that they detected no evidence of\n\nwrongdoing by Eni in relation to the 2011 transaction with the Nigerian government for the acquisition of the OPL 245 license. In September 2014, the Public Prosecutor notified Eni of a restraining order issued by a British judge who ordered the seizure of a bank account not pertaining to Eni domiciled at a British bank following a request from the Public Prosecutor. Since the act had also been notified to some individuals, including the CEO of Eni and the former Chief Development, Operation & Technology Officer of Eni and the former CEO of Eni, it was assumed that the same had been registered in the register of suspects at the Milan Prosecutor's  office.  During  a  hearing  before  a  court  in London in September 2014, Eni and its current executive officers stated their non-involvement in the matter regarding the seized bank account. Following the hearing, the Court reaffirmed  the  seizure.  In  December  2016,  the  Public Prosecutor  of  Milan  notified  Eni  of  the  conclusion  of  the preliminary investigation and requested Eni's CEO, the Chief Development,  Operations  and  Technological  Officer  and the Executive Vice President for international negotiations to stand trial, as well as Eni's former CEO and Eni SpA, pursuant  to  Italian  Legislative  Decree  no.  231/01.  Upon the notification to Eni of the conclusion of the preliminary investigation by the Public Prosecutor, the independent USbased law firm was requested to assess whether the new documentation  made  available  from  Italian  prosecutors could modify the conclusions of the prior review. The US law firm was also provided with the documentation filed in the Nigerian proceeding mentioned below. The independent US law firm concluded that the reappraisal of the matter in light of the new documentation available did not alter the outcome of the prior review. In September 2019, the DoJ notified Eni that based on the information it currently possessed, the DoJ was closing its investigation of Eni in connection with OPL 245 without the filing of any charges. In December 2017, the Judge for preliminary investigation ordered  the  indictment  of  all  the  parties  mentioned above, and other parties under investigation by the Public Prosecutor, before the Court of Milan. The request of the Federal  Government  of  Nigeria  (FGN)  for  admission  as a civil claimant in the proceedings was granted in July 2018. The first instance trial of the Milan Prosecutor's OPL 245 charges began before the Court of Milan on June 20, 2018. Following the discussion of the parties, in response to the Milan Prosecutor's request of conviction of all the individuals and companies involved, at the hearing of March 17, 2021 the judge fully acquitted all the defendants, on the ground that there was no case.\n\nIn June 2021, the Second Instance Court of Milan also acquitted on the same grounds certain third party defendant unrelated to Eni  who had opted for a shortened procedure and  had  been  convicted  in  the  first  acquittal.  This  latter decision has become final.",

        "page_content": "On July 29, 2021 the Public Prosecutor of Milan and the plaintiff, Government of Nigeria, filed an appeal against the first-degree  sentence  of  March  17,  2021.  The  hearing  is scheduled July 19, 2022.\n\nIn January 2017, Eni's subsidiary Nigerian Agip Exploration Ltd ('NAE') became aware of an Interim Order of Attachment ('Order') issued by the Nigerian Federal High Court upon request from the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), attaching OPL 245 temporarily pending a proceeding in Nigeria relating to alleged corruption and money laundering. In March 2017, the Nigerian Court revoked the Order accepting the recourse filed by NAE and its partner. Subsequently Eni became aware of the filing of the objections formulated by the EFCC and made a copy available to the US lawyers in charge of the aforementioned independent verification.  The  latter  have  concluded  that  these  further analyses confirm the conclusions of the previous ones, on the basis of which no evidence of unlawful conduct by Eni emerged in relation to the acquisition of the OPL 245 license from the Nigerian government.\n\nIn November 2018, Eni SpA and its subsidiaries NAE, NAOC and AENR (as well as some companies of the Shell Group) were notified of the intention of the Federal Government of Nigeria 'FGN' to bring a civil claim before an English court to obtain compensation for damages allegedly deriving from the transaction that resulted in assignment of the OPL 245 to NAE and Shell subsidiary SNEPCO. On April 15, 2019 the Nigerian subsidiaries NAE, NAOC and AENR received formal notification of the commencement of the proceeding, while similar  notification  was  received  by  Eni  SpA  on  May  16, 2019. In the introductory deeds of the proceeding, the claim is set at $1,092 million or at any other amount that will be established during the proceedings. The FGN has based its assessment on an estimated fair value of the asset of $3.5 billion. Eni's interest in the asset is 50%. As the FGN is also acting as claimant in the Italian proceeding before the Court of Milan, this claim appears to duplicate the claims made before the Milan Court against Eni employees. On May 22, 2020, the Judge accepted the argument presented by Eni and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case, because the same case was pending before an Italian tribunal. The Judge also denied the FGN permission to appeal against the decision. Similarly, the Appeal Court rejected the FGN's claim to appeal the latter decision of the Judge, thus making it definitive.\n\nOn January 20, 2020, NAE was notified of the beginning of a new criminal case before the Federal High Court in Abuja. The proceeding, mainly focused on the accusations against Nigerian persons (including the Minister of Justice in office in 2011, at the time of the disputed facts), involves NAE and SNEPCO as co-holders of the OPL 245 license. These Nigerian persons were accused in 2011 of illicit corruption, which NAE and SNEPCO allegedly unlawfully facilitated.\n\nii)\n\nThe beginning of the trial, originally scheduled for the end of March 2020, was postponed as a result of the closure of judicial offices in Nigeria due to the COVID-19 emergency and resumed at the beginning of 2021.\n\nCongo. In March 2017, the Italian Finance Police served Eni with an information request in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure in connection with an investigative file opened by the Public Prosecutor of Milan against unknown persons. The request related in particular to the agreements signed by Eni Congo SA with the Ministry for Hydrocarbons of the Republic of Congo in 2013, 2014 and  2015  in  relation  to  exploration,  development  and production activities concerning certain permits held by Eni Congo SA for Congolese projects and Eni's relationships with  Congolese  companies  that  hold  stakes  in  those projects. In July 2017, the Italian Financial Police, on behalf of the Public Prosecutor of Milan, served Eni with another information request and a notice of investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/01 for alleged international corruption.  The  request  expressly  stated  that  it  was based in part on the March 2017 information request and concerned the relationship of Eni and its subsidiaries with certain third-party companies from 2012 to the present. Eni produced all of the documentation requested in March and July 2017 and voluntarily disclosed this matter to the relevant US authorities (SEC and DoJ). In January 2018, the Public Prosecutor's Office requested a six-month extension of the deadline for conducting its preliminary investigation into this matter, from January 31, 2018 until July 30, 2018. Subsequently in July 2018, the Public Prosecutor requested a second extension until February 28, 2019. In April 2018, the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Milan  served  Eni  SpA  with  a further request for documentation and notified a former Eni employee, who was the then Chief Development, Operation & Technology Officer, of a search order stating that he and another Eni employee had been placed under investigation. In October 2018, the Public Prosecutor ordered the seizure of an e-mail account of another Eni manager who was formerly the general director of Eni in Congo during the period 2010-2013. In December 2018 and subsequently in May, September and December 2019, Eni was notified by the Public Prosecutor of Milan of a request for documents in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure, concerning  certain  economic  transactions  between  Eni Group companies and certain third-party companies. All the required documentation has been produced to the Judge. In September 2019, the Company was informed that the Company's CEO was served with a search decree and an investigation decree in connection with an alleged violation of article 2629 bis of the Italian Civil Code which penalizes directors of listed companies, who fail to communicate conflicts  of  interest.

The claims are based on the allegations that the wife of the Company's CEO retained a shareholding of the above-mentioned holding company during part of the period of time under investigation. The Board of Directors of Eni SpA has never been involved in any resolution concerning the suppliers under investigation. Subsequently, on June 15, 2020, the company was informed that an extension of the investigations relating to these allegations was requested until December 21, 2020.\n\nIn April 2018, the Board of Statutory Auditors, the Watch Structure and the Control and Risk Committee of Eni jointly appointed  an  independent  law  firm  and  a  professional consulting company, knowledgeable in the matter of anticorruption, to carry out a forensic review of facts relating to Eni's work in Congo. Such review did not find any factual evidence  as  to  the  involvement  of  Eni,  nor  of  any  Eni employees and key managers, in the alleged crimes.\n\nIn  November  2019,  following  the  notification  of  further investigative documents, the Board of Statutory Auditors, the  Watch  Structure  of  Eni  and  the  Control  and  Risk Committee  asked  the  professional  consultants,  which had been engaged in 2018, also to review the conclusions reached, in the light of the documentation made available following the decree notified to the CEO in September 2019. The second report of the consultants, which was delivered in  July  2020,  integrates  the  findings  achieved  in  the  first report,  particularly  indicating  that:  (i)  it  is  probable  that the CEO's wife retained a shareholding in the Petroserve Group for a few years, at least, starting from 2009 until 2012; (ii) there is an absence of evidence to contradict the statements made by the CEO as to his lack of knowledge of his wife's interests in the ownership of Petroserve Group, and; (iii) there is an absence of evidence that the activity of the abovementioned people was carried out in the interest of Eni.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, Eni was notified of a decree, setting a hearing due to the filing by the Public Prosecutor of Milan requesting  a  restrictive  measure  pursuant  to  Legislative Decree no. 231/01, relating to some oilfields in Congo. In particular,  the  Judge  requested  Eni  to  be  banned  from exploiting Djambala II, Foukanda II, Mwafi II, Kitina II, Marine VI Bis, Loango, Zatchi oilfields for 2 years and subordinately the  appointment  of  a  judicial  commissioner  to  manage those oilfields.\n\nIn the decree setting the hearing for September 21, 2020, the  judge  for  preliminary  investigations  stated  that  the public prosecutor's injunction request was time-barred by a five-year statute of limitations. The claim had expired on July 14, 2020, since the Public Prosecutor alleged that the conduct in question was committed only until July 14, 2015.\n\nHowever, this five-year limitation period had been suspended until September 16, 2020 due to recent legislation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The Judge also stated that a claim was  pending  before  the  Constitutional  Court  about  the constitutional legitimacy of the aforementioned COVID-19 legislation,  with  particular  reference  to  the  principle  of non-retroactivity  of  an  unfavorable  rule.  Therefore,  the hearing  first  set  for  September  21,  2020  was  postponed initially to December 10, 2020 pending the resolution of the Constitutional Court case and then, once the Constitutional Court  declared  the  COVID-19  rule  valid,  to  February  17, 2021, in order to await the entry of the opinion explaining the Constitutional Court's reasoning.\n\nOn  March  15,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Eni  SpA approved  a  settlement  with  the  Public  Prosecutor amounting to a \u20ac11.8 million fine. At the hearing on March 25, 2021 the Judge for Preliminary Investigations approved the settlement and the Prosecutor also revoked the request for restrictive measures for Eni SpA.\n\n## 3. Other proceedings concerning criminal matters\n\n## i) Eni SpA (R&M) - Criminal proceedings on fuel excise tax . A\n\ncriminal proceeding is currently pending, relating to alleged evasion of excise taxes in the context of retail sales in the fuel market. In particular, the claim states that the quantity of oil products marketed by Eni was larger than the quantity subjected to the excise tax. This proceeding (no. 7320/2014 RGNR) concerns the combination of distinct investigations: (i)  a  first  proceeding,  opened  by  the  Public  Prosecutor's Office of Frosinone involved a company (Turrizziani Petroli) purchaser of Eni's fuel. This investigation was subsequently extended  to  Eni.  The  Company  fully  cooperated  and provided all data and information concerning the excise tax obligations for the quantities of fuel coming from the storage sites of Gaeta, Naples and Livorno. Such proceeding referred to quantities of oil products sold by Eni, allegedly larger than the quantity subjected to the excise tax; (ii) a second  proceeding  concerning  an  investigation  by  the Public Prosecutor's Office of Prato, commenced in regard to the deposit of Calenzano and relates to abduction of fuel through manipulation of the fuel dispensers, subsequently extended  also  to  the  Refinery  of  Stagno  (Livorno);  (iii)  a third proceeding, opened by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Rome, concerns alleged missing payment of excise tax on the surplus of the unloading products, as the quantity of such products was larger than he quantity reported in the supporting fiscal documents. This proceeding represents a development of the first proceeding mentioned above and substantially concerns similar facts presenting, however, some differences with regard to the nature of the alleged crimes  and  the  responsibility.  The  Public  Prosecutor's Office  of  Rome  has  alleged  the  existence  of  a  criminal",

Eni is cooperating with the Prosecutor in order to defend the correctness of its operation. In September 2014, a  search was conducted at the office of the former chief of the R&M Division in Rome. The reasons for the search are the same as the above-mentioned proceeding as the ongoing investigations also relate to a period of time when the  officer  was  in  charge  at  Eni's  R&M  Division.  In  March 2015, the Prosecutor of Rome ordered a search at all the storage sites of Eni's network in Italy as part of the same proceeding. The search was intended to verify the existence of fraudulent practices aimed at tampering with measuring systems functional to the tax compliance of excise duties in relation to fuel handling at the storage sites. In September 2015, the Public Prosecutor of Rome requested a one-off technical appraisal aimed to verify the compliance of the software installed at certain metric heads previously seized with those lodged by the manufacturer at the Ministry for Economic  Development.  The  technical  appraisal  verified the compliance of the software tested. The proceeding was then extended to a large number of employees and former employees of the Company. Eni has continued to provide full cooperation to the authorities.\n\nDuring  2018,  as  part  of  the  proceeding  no.  7320/2014, the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Rome  notified  the  conclusion  of the  preliminary  investigations  in  relation  to  the  criminal proceeding  concerning  the  Calenzano,  Pomezia,  Naples, Gaeta  and  Ortona  storage  sites  and  the  Livorno  and Sannazzaro  refineries.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  the investigations, as far as Eni is concerned, the proceeding involves  former  managers  and  directors  of  the  logistic sites  and  refineries  indicated  above  concerning  alleged aggravated and continuous non-payment of excise duties, alteration and removal of seals, use and possession of false measures  and  weights  instruments.  In  addition,  for  the Calenzano site, three employees and their manager of the\n\nstorage site were accused of alleged procedural fraud. In  September  2018,  Eni  received,  as  injured  party,  the notification of the schedule of hearing issued by the Court of Rome, in relation to criminal association and other minor claims, against numerous persons under investigation -including over forty Eni employees -subject of a separated proceeding (no. 22066/17 RGNR), for which, in May 2017, the Public Prosecutor's Office had requested the dismissal. At the end of the hearing in December 2018, the Judge accepted  the  request  for  dismissal  for  several  persons under  investigation,  including  13  Eni  employees.  The Judge also initially rejected the request of indictment for criminal association relating to 28 Eni employees (including the  former  managers  of  the  R&M  Division).  Following the preliminary hearing, a sentence not to prosecute was achieved in December 2019 for all the defendants.\n\nDuring 2019, also in relation to tax pending, a definition was reached, and Eni made the payments for the higher excise duties and other taxes for which it was not possible to reconstruct the related justification.\n\nFor the main proceedings (no. 7320/2014 RGNR), in 2019 a detailed preliminary hearing was held before the Judge of  the  preliminary  hearing  of  Rome  who,  following  the outcome of the discussions, ordered the indictment for all the defendants.\n\nSince 2020, the first instance judgment is pending before the  Monocratic  Court  of  Rome  for  offenses  relating  to excise  duties,  forgery,  and  procedural  fraud.  The  trial  is underway with witnesses and technical consultants.\n\n## ii) Eni SpA - Public Prosecutor of Milan - Criminal proceeding\n\nno.  12333/2017. In  February  2018,  Eni  was  notified  of a search and seizure decree in relation to allegations of associative crime aimed at slander and at reporting false information  to  a  Public  Prosecutor.  In  the  decree,  the Prosecutor of Milan included, among the other persons under investigation, a former external lawyer and a former Eni manager, at the time of the facts holding a strategic position with the Company. According to the decree, the association  was  allegedly  aimed  at  interfering  with  the judicial activity in certain criminal proceedings involving, among others, Eni and some of its directors and managers. Eni's Control and Risks Committee, having consulted the Board of Statutory Auditors, and together with the Watch Structure,  agreed  to  engage  an  auditing  firm  to  perform an internal audit of relevant facts and circumstances and records  and  documentation  relating  to  the  matter  with respect to the events of the aforementioned proceeding, including  a  forensic  review.  The  final  report,  submitted to the Control and Risk Committee, the Watch Structure and  the  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors  on  September  12, 2018, concluded that following the review carried out with respect to the allegations made by the Public Prosecutor of Milan, there was not sufficient factual evidence to prove the involvement of the aforementioned former manager of Eni in the alleged crimes. On April 19, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed two external consultants, a criminal lawyer  and  a  civil  lawyer  to  provide  independent  legal advice in relation to the facts under investigation. Their report,  dated  November  22,  2018,  did  not  find  facts  that could suggest any involvement of any Eni employees in the crimes alleged by the Public Prosecutor. On June 4, 2018, Consob, the Italian markets regulator, requested to be informed about the above-mentioned proceeding. The request was addressed to the Company and to its Board of Statutory Auditors.\n\nSpecifically,  Consob  asked  about  the  outcome  of  the forensic review and to be updated about any other audit action taken in relation to the matter by the Company and",

The Board of Statutory Auditors was also requested to report about the findings of the additional audit program agreed with an external auditor regarding the matter and to keep Consob updated about  any  further  initiatives  adopted.  The  Company answered the request on June 11, 2018. Subsequently, the Company  finalized its response by sending further  documentation  including  the  final  report  of  the independent third party and the reports of the consultants of the Board of Directors. The Board of Statutory Auditors has periodically updated Consob on the initiatives taken as part of the Board's monitoring responsibilities with several communications, the last of which was on July 25, 2020. On June 13, 2018, Eni was notified of a request from the Prosecutor's Office to transmit certain documentation in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure. The request targeted evidence and documents relating to the internal audit performed by the Company and any possible external review concerning certain tasks that had been assigned to the former external lawyer with respect to Eni. This lawyer appears to be under investigation as part of this proceeding. The reports of the independent third party and of the consultant of the Board of Directors\n\nwere also sent to the Public Prosecutor.\n\nIn  May  and  June  2019,  in  the  context  of  the  same proceeding, the Court of Milan notified Eni and three of its subsidiaries (ETS SpA, Versalis SpA, Ecofuel SpA) of various requests for documentation in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure. At the same time, on May 23, 2019, Eni was served a notice that the Company was being  investigated  for  administrative  offences  pursuant to  Legislative  Decree  no.  231/01,  with  reference  to  the crime  sanctioned  by  the  Italian  Penal  Code  concerning 'inducement  not  to  make  statements  or  to  make  false statements to the judicial authority'.\n\nThe object of the aforementioned requests particularly concerned  the  relations  with  two  business  partners, access  to  Eni  offices  of  certain  third  parties,  also  on behalf of one of the above-mentioned business partners, the mailbox of some employees and former employees, the  documentation  concerning  the  relations  (and  the interruption of those relations) with the former external lawyer investigated in the proceeding, the internal audit reports and the reports of the Company's bodies that dealt with  assessing  these  relationships.  Following  internal audits, on June 21, 2019, the Company sued for fraud a former employee at its subsidiary ETS, who was fired on May 28, 2019, and also filed a complaint before the Judicial Authority to ascertain possible complicity in fraud of other third parties. On August 14, 2019, the Italian tax police sent a new request for information to Eni, concerning the economic relations between Eni Group companies and an external professional.\n\nIn November 2019, Eni received a notice of extension of the  preliminary  investigations.  The  notice  also  covered the investigations of the alleged breach by Eni of certain provisions of Legislative Decree no. 231/01 until May 2020. Furthermore,  certain  former  Eni  employees  have  been charged with various criminal allegations. Those employees were  a  former  manager  of  Eni's  legal  department,  the former  Chief  Upstream  Officer  of  Eni  and  an  employee that was fired in 2013. A number of third parties have also been indicted, among them, two former legal consultants of  Eni.  On  January  23,  2020,  a  search  decree  and  an indictment were notified to the Company's Chief Services & Stakeholder Relations Officer, the Senior Vice President for Security and a manager of the legal department. Following the  requests  for  review  of  the  aforementioned  decree, the  material  deposited  by  the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office was made available to the Company, which requested its examination by the same consultants appointed in 2018 to  examine  the  documentation.  Subsequently,  in  June, July and September 2020, Eni was notified by the Public Prosecutor of Milan of several requests for documentation concerning,  in  particular:  the  results  of  the  inquiries carried out by the internal audit department following an anonymous report relating to a hospitality event in 2017; some  clarifications  regarding  an  invoice  issued  by  an external  law  firm;  the  internal  audit  report  on  relations with a commercial third party; work commitments of the Chief Services & Stakeholder Relations Officer relating to certain dates of 2014 and 2016; and the documentation concerning the dismissal of a former Eni employee. All the required documentation has been produced over time to the Judicial Authority.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company was informed that Eni's CEO was notified about his right to participate, through its technical consultant, in the scheduled technical review of the content of a telephone device seized from a former Eni employee.\n\nIn relation to what was previously requested by the Judicial Authorities  in  July  2020  and  to  supplement  the  already produced information, in the period January-March 2021 all the additional documentation concerning an ongoing dispute with a commercial counterpart was delivered over time.\n\nOn  December  10,  2021,  a  notice  of  conclusion  of  the preliminary investigations was  sent against twelve individuals  and  five  companies.  A  former  Eni  executive fired in 2013 and a former external Eni lawyer are accused of  having  slandered  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Human Capital Director & Procurement Coordination of Eni. The Chief Executive Officer, the Human Capital Director & Procurement Coordination, the Senior Vice President for Security and Eni SpA itself, however, do not appear in the request for indictment.\n\nThe Eni subsidiary, ETS, has been charged as entity liable",

ETS has already been placed in voluntary liquidation with a resolution of Eni's Board of Directors of July 2020 which became effective on January 1 st , 2021.\n\n## 4. Tax proceedings\n\n- i) Dispute for omitted payment of a property tax for some oil offshore platforms located in territorial waters. Tax disputes are pending with some Italian local authorities regarding whether Oil & Gas offshore platforms located within territorial boundaries should be subject to a property tax in the period 2016-2019. In 2016 the tax regulatory framework changed due to enactment of Law no. 208/2015, which excluded from the scope of the property tax the value of plants instrumental to specific production processes. In addition, the Finance Department recognized that offshore platforms  met  the  requirements  for  classification  as instrumental plants and consequently are excluded from the scope of the property tax (resolution no. 3 of June 1 st , 2016). Based on this interpretation, Eni did not pay any property tax for the years 2016-2019. However, the ruling of the Department of Finance is not binding for local authorities with taxing powers as recognized by the Third Instance Court and some of these have issued assessment notices for 2016-2019. The Company filed an appeal against these notices. Although Eni believes that oil platforms located in the territorial sea should be excluded from the tax base of the property tax on the base of the interpretation of the law in the light of the resolution of the Department of Finance, having assessed the risks of losing in pending disputes, the  Company  accrued  a  risk  provision,  the  amount  of which excludes fines since Eni's conduct was based on the administrative resolution, as well as taking into account the reduction of the tax base excluding the 'plant component' as provided by the law. The proceeding is still ongoing. Law  Decree  124/19  (enacted  with  Law  157/19)  has established, starting from 2020, that marine platforms are subject to a new property tax that will replace and supersede any other ordinary local property tax eventually levied on these plants up to 2019. This rule has therefore sanctioned, starting from 2020, the existence of the tax requirement for these plants.\n\n## 5. Settled proceedings\n\n- i) Eni  Rewind  SpA  and  Versalis  SpA  -  Porto  Torres -  Prosecuting  body:  Public  Prosecutor  of  Sassari. Proceedings initiated in 2011 by the Public Prosecutor of\n\nSassari for alleged environmental disaster and poisoning of\n\nii)\n\nwater and substances destined for food against the former plant  manager  of  Eni  Rewind  SpA  in  Porto  Torres,  and subsequently against Eni Rewind itself and Versalis SpA as alleged civil parties. The proceeding ended with a sentence of no place to proceed due to a statute of limitations, which has become final.\n\n- Eni Rewind SpA - Summon for alleged environmental damage  caused  by  DDT  pollution  in  Lake  Maggiore. In  May  2003,  the  Italian  Ministry  for  the  Environment claimed  compensation  from  Eni  Rewind  for  alleged environmental damage caused by the activity at the Pieve Vergonte plant in the years 1990 through 1996. In July 2008, the District Court of Turin ordered Eni Rewind to pay environmental  damages  amounting  to  \u20ac1,833.5  million, plus  interests  accrued  from  the  filing  of  the  decision.  Eni and its subsidiary deemed the amount of the environmental damage to be absolutely groundless as the sentence lacked sufficient elements to support such a material amount of the liability from the volume of pollutants ascertained by the Italian Environmental Ministry. During the proceedings the technical appraisal requested by the Court validated the activities of the technical discussions carried out by the Company and concluded that: (i) no further measure for environmental restoration is required; (ii) there was no significant  and  measurable  impact  on  the  environment of  the  ecosystem,  therefore  no  restoration  or  damage compensation should be claimed; the only impact seen concerned  fishing  activity,  with  an  estimated  damage  of \u20ac7  million  which  could  be  already  restored  through  the measures proposed by Eni Rewind, and; (iii) the necessity and  convenience  of  dredging  should  be  excluded,  both from the legal and scientific point of view, while confirming technical  and  scientific  correctness  of  the  Eni  Rewind's approach based on the monitoring of the process of natural recovery, which is estimated to require 20 years.\n\nIn March 2017, the Second Instance Court: (i) excluded the application of compensation for monetary equivalent, and (ii) annulled the monetary compensation of \u20ac1.8 billion requesting Eni Rewind to perform the already approved clean-up  project  of  the  polluted  areas,  which  comprise groundwater, as well as compensatory remediation works. The value of these compensatory works required by the Court, in case of Eni Rewind's failure or misperformance, is estimated at \u20ac9.5 million. The clean-up project filed by Eni Rewind was ratified by the authorities and is currently being executed. Expenditures expected to be incurred have been provisioned in the environmental provision; (iii) rejected all other claims filed by the Ministry (including compensation for non-material damage).\n\nIn  April  2018,  the  Ministry  for  the  Environment  filed  an appeal to the Third Instance Court. Following this appeal, the Company appeared in Court.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWith sentence no. 18811 filed on July 2 nd , 2021, the Third Instance  Court  definitively  ruled  on  the  dispute  regarding environmental  damage  and  the  site  of  Pieve  Vergonte, rejecting  the  appeal  presented  by  the  Ministry  of  the Environment, confirming the reasons of the Second Instance Court. In particular, the Court confirmed the validity of the defensive positions presented by the Company in terms of restoration, also by implementing natural solutions, and inkind compensation for environmental damage.\n\n## Assets under concession arrangements\n\nEni  operates  under  concession  arrangements  mainly  in the Exploration & Production segment and the Refining & Marketing  business  line.  In  the  Exploration  &  Production segment, contractual clauses governing mineral concessions, licenses and exploration permits regulate the access of Eni to hydrocarbon reserves. Such clauses can differ in each country. In particular, mineral concessions, licenses and permits are granted by the legal owners and, generally, entered into with government entities, State oil companies  and,  in  some  legal  contexts,  private  owners. Pursuant  to  the  assignment  of  mineral  concessions,  Eni sustains all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration  and  development  activities  and  it  is  entitled to  the  productions  realized.  In  respect  of  the  mining concessions received, Eni pays royalties in accordance with the tax legislation in force in the country and is required to pay the income taxes deriving from the exploitation of the  concession.  In  production  sharing  agreement  and service contracts, realized productions are defined based on  contractual  agreements  with  State  oil  companies, which hold the concessions. Such contractual agreements regulate the recovery of costs incurred for the exploration, development  and  operating  activities  (Cost  Oil)  and  give entitlement to the own portion of the realized productions (Profit Oil). In the Refining & Marketing business line, several service stations and other auxiliary assets of the distribution service  are  located  in  the  motorway  areas  and  they  are granted by the motorway concession operators following a public tender for the sub-concession of the supplying of oil products distribution service and other auxiliary services. In  exchange  for  the  granting  of  the  services  described above, Eni provides to the motorway companies fixed and variable royalties based on quantities sold. At the end of the concession period, all non-removable assets are transferred to the grantor of the concession for no consideration.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nIn the future, Eni will sustain significant expenses in relation to compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and for reclaiming, safety and remediation works of areas previously used for industrial production and dismantled sites. In particular, regarding the environmental risk,  management  does  not  currently  expect  any  material adverse effect upon Eni's Consolidated Financial Statements, taking  account  of  ongoing  remediation  actions,  existing insurance  policies  and  the  environmental  risk  provision accrued in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, management believes that it is possible that Eni may incur material losses and liabilities in future years in connection with  environmental  matters  due  to:  (i)  the  possibility  of as yet unknown contamination; (ii) the results of ongoing surveys and other possible effects of statements required by Legislative Decree no. 152/2006; (iii) new developments in environmental regulation (i.e. Law no. 68/2015 on crimes against the environment and European Directive 2015/2193 on medium combustion plants); (iv) the effect of possible technological changes relating to future remediation; and (v) the  possibility  of  litigation  and  the  difficulty  of  determining Eni's liability, if any, as against other potentially responsible parties  with  respect  to  such  litigation  and  the  possible insurance recoveries.\n\n## Emission trading\n\nFrom  2021,  the  fourth  phase  of  the  European  Union Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (EU-ETS)  came  in  force.  The award of free emission allowances is performed based on emission  benchmarks  defined  at  European  level  specific to  each  industrial  segment,  except  for  the  electric  power generation sector that is not eligible for allocations for no consideration.  This  regulatory  scheme  implies  for  Eni's plants subject to emission trading a lower assignment of emission permits compared to the emissions recorded in the relevant year and, consequently, the necessity of covering the amounts in excess by purchasing the relevant emission allowances on the open market. In 2021, the emissions of carbon dioxide from Eni's plants were higher than the free allowances  assigned  to  Eni.  Against  emissions  of  carbon dioxide  amounting  to  approximately  17.74  million  tonnes, Eni was awarded free emission allowances of 5.34 million tonnes,  determining  a  deficit  of  12.40  million  tonnes.  This deficit was entirely covered through the purchase of emission allowances in the open market.",

The  average  number  of  senior\n\nmanagers included managers employed in foreign countries, whose position is comparable to a senior manager's status.\n\n## LONG-TERM MONETARY INCENTIVE PLAN FOR THE MANAGERS OF ENI\n\nOn  April  13,  2017  and  on  May  13,  2020,  the  Shareholders Meeting approved the Long-Term Monetary Incentive Plan 20172019 and 2020-2022 and empowered the Board of Directors to execute the Plan by authorizing it to dispose up to a maximum of 11 million of treasury shares in service of the plan 2017-2019 and 20 million in service of the plan 2020-2022.\n\nThe Long-Term Monetary Incentive plans provide for three annual awards (2017, 2018 and 2019 and 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively) and are intended for the Chief Executive Officer of Eni and for the managers of Eni and its subsidiaries who qualify as 'senior managers deemed critical for the business', selected among those who are in charge of tasks directly linked to the Group results or of strategic clout to the business. The Plans provide the granting of Eni shares for no\n\nconsideration to eligible managers after a three-year vesting period under the condition that they would remain in office until vesting. Considering that these incentives fall within the  category  of  employee  compensation,  in  accordance with IFRS, the cost of the plans is determined based on the fair value of the financial instruments awarded to the beneficiaries and the number of shares that are granted at the end of the vesting period; the cost is accruing along the vesting period.\n\nWith reference to the 2017-2019 Plan, the number of shares that will be granted at the end of the vesting period will depend: (i) for 50%, on the market condition in terms of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Eni share compared to the TSR of the FTSE Mib index of the Italian Stock Exchange",

With reference to the 2020-2022 Plan, the number of shares that  will  be  granted  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period  will depend: (i) for 25% on a market objective measured as the difference  between  the  Total  Shareholder  Return  (TSR) of Eni Shares and the TSR of the FTSE Mib Index of Italian Stock Exchange on a three-year period, adjusted with Eni's correlation index, compared with similar differences for each company of the Eni's group of competitors (Peer Group); (ii) for 20% on a relative parameter represented by an industrial objective measured in terms of annual unit value ($/boe) of the Net Present Value of Proven Reserves (NPV) compared with the analogous value of each company in the Peer Group, with a final outcome equal to the average annual results over the three-year period; (iii) for 20% on an absolute parameter represented by an economic-financial objective measured as the Organic Free Cash Flow accumulated in the three-year reference period, compared to the equivalent accumulated value  provided  for  in  the  first  three  years  of  the  Strategic Plan  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  the  year  of award and kept unchanged during the performance period. The verification of CFC targets is conducted net of external variables,  using  a  gap-analysis  approach  approved  by  the Remuneration Committee, in order to assess the effective corporate  performance  deriving  from  the  management action;  (iv)  for  the  remaining  35%  on  an  environmental sustainability and energy transition objective in a three-year period consisting of three absolute objectives as follows: (a) for 15% to a decarbonisation objective measured in terms of Upstream Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO 2 eq. equity emissions (tCO 2 eq./kboe) at the end of the three-year period compared with the same value expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors in the year of award and kept unchanged during the performance period; (b) for 10% on an energy transition objective measured in megawatts (MW)  of  installed  capacity  of  power  generation  from renewable sources, at the end of the three-year performance period, compared with the same value expected in the third year of the Strategic Plan approved by the Board of Directors\n\n## COMPENSATION OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL\n\nCompensation, including contributions and collateral expenses,  of  personnel  holding  key  positions  in  planning, directing and controlling the Eni Group subsidiaries, including\n\nin the year of award and kept unchanged in the performance period; (c) for 10% on a circular economy objective measured in terms of progress of three important projects at the end of  the  three-year  performance  period,  compared  with  the progress  expected  in  the  third  year  of  the  Strategic  Plan approved by the Board of Directors in the year of award and kept unchanged during the performance period.\n\nDepending on the performance of the parameters mentioned\n\nabove, the number of shares that will vest after three years may  range  between  0%  and  180%  of  the  initial  award. Furthermore, 50% of the shares that will eventually vest is subject to a lock-up clause of one year after the vesting date. The  number  of  shares  awarded  at  the  grant  date  was:  (i) 2,365,581 shares in 2021, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac8.15 per share; (ii) 2,922,749 shares in 2020, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac4.67 per share; (iii) 1,759,273 shares in 2019, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac9.88 per share. The estimation of the fair value was calculated by adopting\n\nspecific valuation techniques regarding the different performance parameters provided by the plan (the stochastic method for the component related to the TSR  and the BlackScholes model for the component related to the NPV of the reserves, for the 2017-2019 Plan; the stochastic method for the 2020-2022 Plan), taking into account the fair value of the Eni share at the grant date (between \u20ac11.642 and \u20ac12.164 depending on the grant date in relation to the 2021 award; between  \u20ac5.885  and  \u20ac8.303  depending  on  the  grant  date in relation to the 2020 award; \u20ac13.714 per share in 2019), reduced  by  dividends  expected  along  the  vesting  period (between 7.1% and 7.4% of the share price at vesting date in 2021; 7.1% and 10.0% of the share price at vesting date in 2020; 6.1% of the share price at vesting date in 2019), considering  the  volatility  of  the  stock  (between  44%  and 45% in relation to the 2021 award; 41% and 44% in relation to the 2020 award; 19% for attribution 2019), the forecasts for the performance parameters, as well as the lower value attributable to the shares considering the lock-up period at the end of the vesting period.\n\nIn  2021,  the  costs  related  to  the  Long-Term  Monetary Incentive Plan, recognized as a component of the payroll cost, amounted to \u20ac16 million (\u20ac7 million in 2020; \u20ac9 million in 2019) with a contra-entry to equity reserves.\n\nexecutive and non-executive officers, general managers and managers with strategic responsibilities in office during the year consisted of the following:",

These amounts do not include any allocation of  interest  expenses  or  general  corporate  overheads  and, therefore, are not necessarily indicative of the contributions to consolidated net earnings of Eni. Related income taxes are calculated by applying the local income tax rates to the pre-tax  income  from  production  activities.  Eni  is  party  to\n\ncertain Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs), whereby a portion of Eni's share of oil and gas production is withheld and sold by its joint venture partners which are state owned entities, with proceeds being remitted to the state to fulfil Eni's PSA related tax liabilities. Revenue and income taxes include  such  taxes  owed  by  Eni  but  paid  by  state-owned entities out of Eni's share of oil and gas production. Results of  operations  from  oil  and  gas  producing  activities  by geographical area consist of the following:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                             | Italy   | Rest of  Europe   | North  Africa   | Egypt   | Sub -

        "page_content": "## PROVED RESERVES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS\n\nEni's  criteria  concerning  evaluation  and  classification  of proved  developed  and  undeveloped  reserves  comply  with Regulation  S-X  4-10  of  the  U.S.  Securities  and  Exchange Commission  and  have  been  disclosed  in  accordance  with FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas (Topic 932).\n\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas,  which,  by  analysis  of  geoscience  and  engineering data,  can  be  estimated  with  reasonable  certainty  to  be economically  producible,  from  a  given  date  forward,  from known reservoirs,  and  under  existing  economic  conditions, operating  methods,  and  government  regulations,  prior  to the  time  at  which  contracts  providing  the  right  to  operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain,  regardless  of  whether  deterministic  or  probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the  hydrocarbons  must  have  commenced  or  the  operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within  a  reasonable  time.  Existing  economic  conditions include  prices  and  costs  at  which  economic  producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n\nIn 2021, the average price for the marker Brent crude oil was $69  per  barrel.  Net  proved  reserves  exclude  interests  and royalties owned by others.\n\nProved  reserves  are  classified  as  either  developed  or undeveloped.\n\nDeveloped  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  reserves  that  can  be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well.\n\nUndeveloped  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  reserves  of  any category  that  are  expected  to  be  recovered  from  new wells  on  undrilled  acreage,  or  from  existing  wells  where  a relatively  major  expenditure  is  required  for  recompletion. Eni has its proved reserves audited on a rotational basis by independent  oil  engineering  companies 35 .  The  description of  qualifications  of  the  person  primarily  responsible  of  the reserves audit is included in the third-party audit report 36 . In the preparation of their reports, independent evaluators rely,  without  independent  verification,  upon  data  furnished\n\nby Eni with respect to property interest, production, current costs of operation and development, sale agreements, prices and other factual information and data that were accepted as  represented  by  the  independent  evaluators.  These data,  equally  used  by  Eni  in  its  internal  process,  include logs,  directional  surveys,  core  and  PVT  (Pressure  Volume Temperature)  analysis,  maps,  oil/gas/water  production/ injection data of wells, reservoir studies and technical analysis relevant to field performance, long-term development plans, future capital and operating costs.\n\nIn  order  to  calculate  the  economic  value  of  Eni  equity reserves, actual prices applicable to hydrocarbon sales, price adjustments required by applicable contractual arrangements, and other pertinent information are provided. In 2021, Ryder Scott  Company,  DeGolyer  and  MacNaughton  and  Societ\u00e9 Generale de Surveillance provided an independent evaluation of about 27% of Eni's total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 37 , confirming, as in previous years, the reasonableness of Eni's internal evaluations.\n\nIn the three-year period from 2019 to 2021, 93% 38 of Eni's total proved reserves were subject to independent evaluation. As of December 31, 2021, the principal properties which did not undergo  an  independent  evaluation  in  the  last  three  years were Belayim in Egypt and the fields of Area 1 in Mexico.\n\nEni operates under production sharing agreements in several of the foreign jurisdictions where it has oil and gas exploration and production activities. Reserves of oil and natural gas to which Eni is entitled under PSA arrangements are shown in accordance with Eni's economic interest in the volumes of oil and natural gas estimated to be recoverable in future years. Such reserves include estimated quantities allocated to Eni for recovery of costs, income taxes owed by Eni but settled by its joint venture partners (which are state-owned entities) out of Eni's share of production and Eni's net equity share after cost recovery. Proved oil and gas reserves associated with PSAs represented 58%, 57% and 57% of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively, on an oil-equivalent basis. Similar effects as PSAs apply to service contracts; proved reserves associated with such contracts represented 3%, 4%, and 3% of total proved reserves on an oil-equivalent basis as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nOil and gas reserves quantities include: (i) oil and natural gas quantities  in  excess  of  cost  recovery  which  the  company has  an  obligation  to  purchase  under  certain  PSAs  with governments  or  authorities,  whereby  the  company  serves",

The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and evaluation. The results of drilling, testing and production after the date of the estimate may  require  substantial  upward  or  downward  revisions.  In addition, changes in oil and natural gas prices have an effect on the quantities of Eni's proved reserves since estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs relevant to the date when such estimates are made. Consequently, the evaluation of reserves could also significantly differ from actual oil and natural gas volumes that will be produced.\n\nconsolidated  subsidiaries  amounted  to  775  mmbbl  of  liquids and  4,152  BCF  of  natural  gas.  Changes  in  Eni's  2021  proved undeveloped reserves were as follows:\n\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020   | 2,005   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Transfer to proved developed reserves                 | (232)   |\n| Extensions and discoveries                            | 62      |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                       | 174     |\n| Improved recovery                                     | 11      |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2021   | 2,020   |\n\nIn  2021,  total  proved  undeveloped  reserves  increased  by 15  mmboe  (proved  undeveloped  reserves  of  consolidated companies  decreased  by  168  mmboe,  while  those  of  joint ventures and associates increased by 183 mmboe).\n\n## Main changes derived from:\n\n- (i) proved undeveloped reserves matured to proved developed reserves amounted to -232 mmboe, and were driven by progress in development activities, production start-ups and project revisions. The main reclassifications to  proved  developed  reserves  related  to  the  fields  of Merakes in Indonesia (55 mmboe), LNG project in Nigeria (45  mmboe),  Mizton  in  Mexico  (23  mmboe),  Snorre  in Norvay  (13  mmboe),  Karachaganak  in  Kazakhstan  (11 mmboe) e Zubair in Iraq (8 mmboe);\n- (ii)  new discoveries and extensions of 62 mmboe, of which 19 mmbbl of oil and 230 BCF of natural gas. The increase in oil reserves of 19 mmbbl was driven by the FIDs made for the New Gas Consortium in Angola (6 mmbbl), Cuica\n- e Ndungu in Block 15/06 in Angola (5 mmbbl) and Berkine North project in Algeria (5 mmbbl). The increase of 230 BCF of natural gas was due to the New Gas Consortium in Angola;\n- (iii) revisions  of  previous  estimates  were  positive  for  174 mmboe, of which 9 mmbbl of oil and 882 BCF of natural gas.  Positive  revisions  of  334  mmBOE  mainly  refer  to increased  entitlements  in  area  D  in  Libya  (74  mmboe) and Val d'Agri in Italy (23 mmboe), as well as the progress of  development  activities  at  Zohr  in  Egypt  (58  mmboe) and  the  finalization  of  gas  commercial  agreements  in Nigeria  (30  mmboe).  Negative  revisions  of  160  mmboe mainly refer to the price effect relating to Zubair in Iraq (-56  mmboe),  Area  1  in  Mexico  (-13  mmboe),  Coral  in Mozambique (-13 mmboe), Belayim in Egypt (-13 mmboe) and the price effect on Merakes in Indonesia (-11 mmboe);\n- (iv) improved recoveries of 12 mmboe mainly referred to the Oooguruk field in United States.",

Positive  revisions  of  100  mmbbl reported in Kazakhstan were driven by higher entitlements and progress in development activities. In the rest of Asia, positive revisions  of  114  mmbbl  were  due  to  higher  entitlements  in Iraq (74 mmbbl) and progress at a few projects, among which the  most  important  was  the  Umm  Shaif/Nasr  concession  in the  United  Arab  Emirates.  In  the  Sub-Saharan  Africa  positive revisions of 10 mmbbl were due to higher entitlements in Nigeria (14 mmbbl), Angola (8 mmbbl ) and Ghana (3 mmbbl), partly offset by negative revisions due to the debooking of the Loango and Zatchi fields  reserves  in  Congo  (-18  mmbbl).  In  America, positive revisions of 16 mmbbl were due to higher entitlements",

Estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves at  the  end  of  the  year.  Neither  the  effects  of  price  and  cost escalations  nor  expected  future  changes  in  technology  and operating practices have been considered.\n\nThe  standardized  measure  is  calculated  as  the  excess  of future cash inflows from proved reserves less future costs of producing and developing the reserves, future income taxes and a yearly 10% discount factor.\n\nFuture  production  costs  include  the  estimated  expenditures related to the production of proved reserves plus any production taxes without consideration of future inflation. Future\n\ndevelopment  costs  include  the  estimated  costs  of  drilling development wells and installation of production facilities, plus the net costs associated with dismantlement and abandonment of wells and facilities, under the assumption that year-end costs continue  without  considering  future  inflation.  Future  income taxes  were  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  tax  laws  of  the countries in which Eni operates.\n\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated in accordance with the requirements of FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas (Topic 932). The standardized measure does not purport to reflect realizable values or fair market value of Eni's proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, hydrocarbon resources other than proved reserves, anticipated changes in future prices and costs and a discount factor

REGIME\n\nThe  Legislative  Decree  of  29  November  2018,  No.  241, enforcing the EU Directive rules in the matter of tax avoidance practices, modified the definition of a State or territory with a privileged tax regime pursuant to art. 47-bis of the D.P.R. December 22, 1986, No. 917. Following the aforementioned amendments and the amendments to art. 167 of the D.P.R. December 22, 1986, No. 917, the provisions regarding foreign subsidiaries, CFC, are applied if the non-resident controlled entities  jointly  present  the  following  conditions:  a)  they  are\n\nsubject  to  an  effective  taxation  of  less  than  half  to  which they would have been subject if they were resident in Italy; b) more than one third of the proceeds fall into one or more of  the  following  categories:  interests,  royalties,  dividends, financial leasing income, income from insurance and banking activities, income and sale from intra-group services with low or zero added economic value.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Eni controls 5 companies that benefit  from  a  privileged  tax  regime.  These  5  companies are subject to taxation in Italy because they are included in Eni's tax return. No subsidiary that benefits from a privileged tax regime has issued financial instruments. All the financial statements for 2021 are subject to external audit.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25cf We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;\n- \u25cf We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;\n- \u25cf We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- \u25cf We evaluated the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u25cf We obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.",
