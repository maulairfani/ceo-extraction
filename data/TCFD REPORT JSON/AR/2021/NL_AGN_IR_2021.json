Looking back and reflecting on an eventful 12 months, I am pleased with the progress we have made together in difficult circumstances.\n\nIn 2021, my first full year as Chief Executive Officer of Aegon, our focus remained on creating value for our different stakeholder groups. To our shareholders and wider investor community, in particular, I am pleased to report clear headway with executing our new strategy. We have been working to build a more enduring, high-performance company, with a focus on three core markets, three growth markets, and one global asset manager. To realize our goals, we have been fully engaged in implementing a rigorous company-wide transformation program aimed at strengthening our operating performance.\n\nMore than two-thirds of our planned performance improvement initiatives have already been executed, and our focus on expense savings puts us on track to realize a significant reduction in addressable 1 expenses by 2023. Furthermore, the growth initiatives being implemented are delivering positive results across our activities in our core and growth markets.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to invest in the expansion of our distribution network, while simultaneously improving the digital experience for our customers, advisers, and employers. This supported solid growth in our US Life business, together with record-high asset balances in our Dutch mortgage and defined contribution businesses. Meanwhile, net deposits for our UK platform turned positive. I can also point to the track record of our asset management business, which enjoyed a tenth consecutive year of positive third-party net deposits. There is still work to be done, though, including the need to attract more customers, for example to our US Workplace Solutions business.\n\nOn the back of our performance improvement initiatives, we have achieved an increase in our operating result, aided by increased fees from higher equity markets and positive contributions from business growth./uni00A0These drivers were only partly offset by an adverse claims experience in the United States mainly due to COVID-19. We have also maintained a strong balance sheet by actively managing both our risks and our capital position.\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, we will continue the rigorous execution of our performance improvement plan, building on what we have achieved so far. We are actively managing our risks and capital",

The actions we have taken to improve our performance and improve our risk profile provide us with confidence in our ability to deliver on our 2023 financial targets.\n\n## Aegon's responsibility to society\n\nOur strategic objectives go beyond operational and financial performance. I understand the important role our company plays within wider society, and I acknowledge the increasing importance of sustainability for Aegon and its stakeholders.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to advance our approach to sustainability and responsible investing by further embedding these topics as central pillars within our strategy. We have established a Global Sustainability Board, supported by our Global Corporate Sustainability Team, to realize this goal and intensify our focus on company-wide sustainability targets.\n\nSustainability is a broad topic, of course, and dialogues with our stakeholders indicate two areas that should be at the forefront of our thinking in the coming years: climate change and inclusion and diversity. In November 2021, we decided to transition our general account investment portfolio to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To ensure progress toward this 2050 commitment, Aegon has set a clear medium-term target for 2025. Alongside this commitment, we are actively strengthening our inclusion and diversity efforts to help position us as a welcoming employer for underrepresented talent. I have been personally involved in exploring ways to further build inclusion and diversity into our talent pipelines, and in 2022 Aegon will appoint a Global Head of Inclusion & Diversity to address this important issue.\n\n## Moving closer to our customers and business partners\n\nIn 2021, we continued to expand and evolve our offerings to customers across our core and growth markets, with a focus on building close, personal connections. Many recent and ongoing initiatives have been prompted by the need to help people navigate the deep financial and personal impact of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, I believe the steps we are taking to support our customers now will have positive benefits for our company and its stakeholders for many years to come.\n\nSimilarly, we are building closer relationships with our business partners and suppliers around the world to support our efforts to deliver value to our stakeholders. It is especially important that our partners share our values, and over the course of 2021, we continued to integrate specific sustainability criteria and requirements into our supplier selection, development, and ordering processes, as we work to develop a more sustainable supply chain.\n\n## Employee engagement top of mind\n\nIn a year of tremendous change, the recent period has been particularly transformative for Aegon's workforce. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to closely monitor employee wellbeing and engagement amid the disruption taking place all around us. Based on feedback from our employees, we have introduced local initiatives and adapted our ways of working to help people cope with the dual pressures of work and COVID-19.\n\nAn unfortunate consequence of our transformation journey is that we have had to say goodbye to valued Aegon colleagues. I extend my respect and concern for those who are no longer employed at Aegon, and thank them for their invaluable contribution over the years. I realize that this has also been a difficult process for all members of our community, and I would like to thank those colleagues continuing with Aegon, too, for their resilience and their continued efforts during this journey.\n\n## Looking ahead with purpose\n\nOver the past few months, we have taken time as a company to carefully consider our purpose, and reflect on what makes Aegon relevant to its customers, local communities, and wider society. This has been a valuable exercise: as people generally live longer and embark on non-linear life journeys, their financial behaviors and needs are changing. Aegon is adapting accordingly. We champion the opportunities offered by a longer, multi-stage life, and seek to support individuals, families, and employers as they move through the resulting changes.\n\nThis responsibility is at the heart of Aegon's redefined purpose of Helping people live their best lives , which describes our focus on positive longevity, and how we seek to be a force for good for our customers and other stakeholders throughout their lifetimes. Renewing our purpose provides a common thread that will guide our vision and strategy. This process has also inspired Aegon's new employee behaviors, We tune in, We step up, We are a force for good . These core behaviors will ensure our entire organization continues to work in unison to create value for our stakeholders. As I look ahead, our solidarity and togetherness will remain vitally important as we navigate new challenges in an increasingly uncertain world. Indeed, the weeks preceding the publication of this Integrated Annual Report saw the escalation of the aggression against Ukraine and its citizens. On behalf of Aegon, I want to express our support to everyone affected by this shocking and saddening situation, and to add our voice to international demands for an immediate cessation of violence.\n\nThank you to all our stakeholders for your continued contributions and commitment; I look forward to continuing our journey together in 2022 and beyond.\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands, March 16, 2022\n\n## Lard Friese\n\nCEO of Aegon\n\n<!-- image -->",

We keep a close eye on developments across these different areas, and we seek to understand their impact on our business and our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese insights support our day-to-day decision-making as well as our long-term business planning. They also help in shaping Aegon's purpose and vision.\n\nThe global economy recovered strongly in 2021 on the back of continued fiscal and monetary stimulus. The steady roll-out of vaccination programs allowed the world's major economies to scale back COVID-19 restrictions during large parts of the year. The economic rebound, which was strongest in the early months of 2021 before slowing in the second half of the year, has boosted employment and wage growth. Improved consumer confidence has, in turn, supported demand for financial services, including various types of long-term savings and life insurance products.\n\nDespite the ongoing pandemic, financial markets performed well in 2021, regaining positive momentum following the volatility seen during 2020. Prices for equities and real assets increased throughout the year on the back of the global economic recovery. Interest rates remained at relatively low levels, rising nonetheless from the historical lows witnessed in 2020.\n\nRising inflation has become an important concern for financial services providers, as consumer prices increased at their fastest pace in decades in the final months of 2021. Increasing demand, in combination with supply chain disruptions, led to surges in the price of energy, raw materials, and other goods. Higher inflation and volatile economic growth later in 2021 created uncertainties that influence consumer behavior, including the risk of reduced purchasing power of households, and weaker demand for investment products in the years ahead.\n\nDespite current inflationary pressures, interest rates have remained low as central banks have only gradually begun scaling back pandemic-era stimuli. Aegon's medium-term view is that interest rates will slowly increase while remaining at low levels. Although there is a risk of increasing inflation, we expect to see a normalizing inflation rate, well managed by central banks, and modest economic growth. Persistently low nominal interest rates present challenges for insurers given that they make saving fundamentally less attractive, and they represent a headwind to our businesses, particularly in the United States and Europe.",

January 2021 saw the United Kingdom formally exit the European Union, and provisions for the activities of financial services firms within the 'Trade and Cooperation Agreement' between the regions are still being negotiated. Meanwhile, the shift in global economic power to developing regions is a long-term 'megatrend' that affects multinational companies like Aegon in different ways. On the one hand, we see opportunities to further expand our business in growth markets such as China and Brazil. However, the increasing geopolitical influence of Asia has also created political and regulatory uncertainty, and ongoing tensions between the United States and China are a concern, given our extensive interests in these markets.\n\nIncreasing regulatory scrutiny and complexity continues to shape our operating environment. At Aegon, we keep a close eye on specific insurance industry requirements, but also on broader developments with respect to sustainability, data management, and privacy, as well as consumer protection and fiduciary duties. While compliance is our absolute priority, our Government and Policy Affairs team proactively monitors potential developments regarding these areas. Aegon is also actively involved in helping to shape future regulations, either directly or as an active member of various industry associations.\n\nSustainability is increasingly top of mind for the global business community, and our stakeholders expect us to manage our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards, beyond legal and regulatory requirements. November 2021 saw heightened private sector involvement in the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26). The increasing expectations of governments and society are elevating the sustainability agenda, and sustainability has the potential to be a key value driver as companies align with these requirements. Net inflows into US sustainable funds rose by 35% to nearly USD 70 billion in 2021, according to Morningstar 1) .

The key findings from/uni00A0the exercise help inform Aegon's strategic and planning activities, watch lists, and management discussions and actions.\n\nThe BES is a critical, cross-functional exercise that combines the materiality assessment with emerging risk identification. It looks beyond impact alone to assess the potential of topics to influence ongoing value creation, as shown by the materiality matrix below. While the BES highlights opportunities for our business, we are also mindful of potential challenges ahead. Indeed, the exercise is a key component of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework and provides input for our wider reporting activities as described in this Integrated Annual Report,\n\nbusiness\n\nour\n\non\n\nImpact\n\nas well as for the annual Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA). For more information on Aegon's risk management approach, please see the dedicated risk management section on page 73 of this report and the risk factors for Aegon N.V. on page 326.\n\nThe 2021 BES drew out a number of relevant insights, and our materiality matrix has been adjusted to reflect this. The topics 'Rise of inflation' and 'Sustainability and ESG-integration' both moved into the top-right quadrant of the matrix, signifying them as material topics that are both high impact and high likelihood to materialize during the next three years. This means they are significant for our business and our stakeholders, with the potential to have an impact over our business planning horizon. We have also dedicated space to the discussion of these and other selected material topics in 'Opportunities and challenges' on page 11.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLikelihood to materialize over three-year planning horizon\n\n|                                  |                                                          |                                                  | Focus area:                                      | Focus area:                                   | Focus area:                                            |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Atrocities between  major powers | New pension crisis  and expropriation  of pension assets | Rapidly increasing  personal  indebtedness       | Hunt for yield                                   | Cybersecurity                                 | Geopolitical tensions  and regulatory  regionalization |\n| New (digital)  distribution      | Relaxed investment discipline                            | Decentralized ledger  technologies (DLT)         | Rise of inflation                                | Post-pandemic  recovery and  future pandemics | Competition  for talent                                |\n| Ecosystems and  open finance     | Relaxed  underwriting  standards                         | Increasing customer  expectations                | Technological  advancements                      | Sustainability and ESG integration            | Increased reporting  and regulations                   |\n| Community  engagement            | Fracture  of social network                              | Continued  urbanization                          | Social unrest  and respect for  human rights     | Disinformation and  conspiracy theories       | Inclusion  and diversity                               |\n| Deteriorating  mental health     | Educational  progress                                    | Regulation  of Big Tech/level  playing field(s)  | Higher life  expectancy and  falling birth rates | Intergenerational  wealth gap                 | Employee  engagement                                   |\n| Religious illiberality           | New asset classes                                        | Increasing  interconnectedness  of supply chains | Rise of Asia                                     | Climate change                                | Cross-industry competition                             |",

        "page_content": "## Opportunities and challenges\n\nWe have selected the important topics for discussion that we believe are significant for our short-term planning horizon. Below, we look at how these issues may affect our business, the opportunities and challenges they present for our business and our stakeholders, and the actions we are taking to leverage or mitigate these developments.\n\n## The hunt for yield and the rise of inflation\n\nIn the current low-interest-rate environment, companies and investors seek ways to generate higher financial returns by investing in riskier asset classes, which increases the risk of asset bubbles and debt crises forming. Aegon is exposed to potential economic and financial market shocks. In addition, inflation expectations are increasing, with Aegon exposed to expense and claims cost increases, and their potential impacts, through guarantees for policyholders.\n\n## What Aegon is doing\n\nWe closely monitor financial and wider economic developments to understand our exposure to potential shocks in the markets where we invest, and we work proactively to mitigate related risks. In the United States, we have expanded our dynamic hedging program to the full legacy variable annuities portfolio to better protect us from equity and interest rate risks. To address the uncertainty around the rise in inflation, we have implemented an inflation hedge covering liabilities with conditional indexation rights in the Netherlands. In the United States, the inflation risk within long-term care claims derives primarily from wage inflation, which we mitigate by offering customers downgrades of the maximum daily benefit as an alternative to premium rate increases. In addition, our expense savings program helps to mitigate the impact of rising inflation.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nThe increasing digitalization of the financial services landscape has intensified the financial and reputational risk presented by cybersecurity threats. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the rise in remote working, have further escalated these threats, with the FBI reporting a 300% increase in cybercrimes in the United/uni00A0States since the start of the pandemic 1 . As our business becomes more technology driven and our digital reliance increases, we become a greater target for cybercriminals, and more vulnerable to threats such as ransomware attacks.\n\n- 1 https://aegon.me/cybercrime-pandemic\n\n## What Aegon is doing\n\nWe continue to take steps to strengthen our cybersecurity governance, infrastructure, and ability to respond to cyberattacks, for example by further developing our dedicated IT security team, and strengthening controls. The security program aims at analyzing and remediating known vulnerabilities, as well as conducting ongoing exercises to prepare for and respond effectively to cyberattacks. Aegon's Risk department also periodically assesses known potential cyber risk factors, together with the first line functions such as the Security Operations Center, with known trends or material incidents reported to Aegon's Management and Supervisory Boards as necessary. Aegon also has dedicated teams, processes, and procedures in place that are intended to mitigate potential cyberattacks.\n\n## Sustainability and ESG-integration\n\nSustainability is increasingly a key value driver for companies like Aegon. Businesses that shape their sustainability journeys along consistent, company-wide approaches, covering the entire sustainability landscape while paying specific attention to areas where they can have a significant positive impact, enjoy opportunities to attract new customers, and receive access to capital at preferential terms. In contrast, businesses that fail to meet their stakeholders' expectations with regard to sustainability are at risk of damaging their reputations and market positions.\n\n## What Aegon is doing\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, we took significant steps to strengthen our sustainability approach. We established a Global Sustainability Board, which is supported by our Global Corporate Sustainability Team. Furthermore, in November 2021, we committed to transitioning our general account investment portfolio to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The commitment includes an immediate target to reduce the carbon intensity of our corporate fixed income and listed equity general account assets by 25% by 2025. Our focus remains on strengthening our governance and enhancing the quality of our reporting processes and infrastructure, to ensure that we are ready for limited assurance for external non-financial reporting over 2023. Furthermore, we are improving our engagement on sustainabilityrelated topics both internally and externally.",

        "page_content": "## Competition for talent and technological advancements\n\nIn today's increasingly technology-driven financial services industry, there is a growing demand for - and shortage of - digital and analytical talent. To remain successful as a business, we require a reliable long-term pipeline of these specific talents, and we must prioritize attracting and retaining hard-to-find employees and upskilling our existing workforce. Equally, we must continue to further improve our IT systems, by developing our cloud infrastructure, data lakes, and data analytics capabilities, and by resolving issues with our legacy systems.\n\n## What Aegon is doing\n\nAegon has dedicated IT talent acquisition programs in place around the world, which are overseen by our local and global human resources teams and discussed in various forums, including Aegon's Management Board. As part of this approach, we direct attention and resources to topics such as employee compensation, personal development, and our employer value proposition.\n\nAegon also recognizes the need to attract new and diverse talents with the broader skills and capabilities required to deliver our purpose and transformation agenda. Our Talent Acquisition teams actively source underrepresented candidates and partner with organizations to encourage interest from diverse groups. In 2021, Aegon Asset Management also launched its Inclusive Hiring Guide for recruiting managers, and now works with talent acquisition agencies to ensure a diverse selection of candidates for open positions.\n\n## Other topics\n\nAegon's additional identified focus areas relate to the postpandemic recovery period and future pandemics, as well as geopolitical tensions, regulatory regionalization, and increased reporting and regulation. This last focus area concerns insurance-specific requirements but also broader developments, for instance with respect to sustainability, ESG, privacy, data management, and fiduciary rules. Aegon actively monitors developments in these focus areas and takes management actions where necessary.",

        "page_content": "## Looking to the longer term\n\nAs well as our immediate operating environment, we examine the longer-term horizon to identify trends and developments with the potential to significantly influence our business and our stakeholders in the years ahead. We have identified the key trends we believe will provide the greatest opportunities or challenges for our business in the medium to long term. These themes serve as the foundation for our purpose and long-term vision, in turn shaping our company strategy.\n\n## Higher life expectancy and falling birth rates\n\nAs people live longer and birth rates decline, these long-term demographic shifts taking place in Aegon's core and growth markets have significant repercussions for its customers and other stakeholders. They are also critical for our longer-term value proposition, and therefore for our product development strategy and wider business planning. We capture opportunities to deliver retirement solutions and other products and services linked to longevity at scale, as well as other solutions associated with higher life expectancies and shrinking workingage populations. The question of how to manage the impact of longer lifespans on individuals and society is directly linked to Aegon's purpose and vision.\n\n## Changing customer expectations\n\nIncreasingly, our customers are embarking on non-linear life journeys rather than the traditional path to retirement, a trend that raises questions for our long-term business model and that we directly address through our company purpose of Helping people live their best lives . The rapid digitalization of financial services and the rise of artificial intelligence provide opportunities to strengthen our direct relationships with customers by using digital tools such as portals, platforms, and so-called 'robo-advice'. With our new business strategy, we seek to harness these trends by continuing to invest in our customer engagement and experience.\n\n## Meeting the needs of a diverse society\n\nWe see a growing long-term need for retirement solutions that cater to less affluent individuals, as well as for other financial products and services that can meet the increasingly disparate needs of different segments of society. In our longterm planning, we consider ways to expand our reach, for example by broadening our distribution and continuing to provide fairly priced financial products and advice. In addition to adapting our products and services, we are working to further embed inclusion and diversity within our employer value proposition to make it easier for underrepresented talent to work and thrive at Aegon.\n\n## Sustainability, competition for talent, and technological advancements\n\nIn keeping with our short-term outlook, we expect sustainability, competition for talent, and technological advancements to continue to shape our strategy over the longer-term horizon. As we move toward a net-zero society, it is important that our approach to issues such as climate change and inclusion and diversity positions us in line with, or ahead of, our peers. The long-term success of our business also depends on attracting diverse talent and seizing opportunities created by technological advancement and innovation.",

Our purpose shapes how we engage with and create value for our customers and wider stakeholder base. In turn, this provides the foundation for our vision and strategy, as well as for our business planning and decision-making.\n\n## Living and working in the age of longevity\n\nPensions and other financial services providers have traditionally based their customer propositions on a three-stage view of life. Broadly speaking, this involves individuals partaking in education up to the ages of 20 to 25, followed by a career of around 40 years and a short retirement of about 15-20 years. However, in recent decades, demographic, technological, and health trends have brought an end to the concept of the three-stage life. People everywhere are living longer, and many children born today can expect to live to 100 in developed countries. The World Bank forecasts the proportion of the global population aged 65 and over to nearly double from 9% in 2020 to 16% in 2050 (see Figure 'Population aged 65 or above' on page 15).\n\nWhile the possibility of a 100-year life is a leap forward for humankind, it also presents a number of economic, social, and health challenges. As lifespans generally increase around the world, there is a need to rethink conventional, linear approaches to both work and life. An education gained before the age of 25 is unlikely to sustain an individual through a career spanning multiple decades. Meanwhile, supporting older people through a retirement of potentially 30 or more years is increasingly unsustainable from a societal perspective. According to the World Bank, the global age-dependency ratio (a metric used to measure the size of the working-age demographic relative to the total population) fell from a modernday high of 77.1% in 1967 to 54.1% in 2020. This changing demographic landscape is putting increasing strain on state retirement systems.\n\nHowever, longevity creates an extensive agenda for governments that goes beyond retirement with considerations, including education, vitality, the environment, and a range of broader social concerns. In particular, corresponding with the rapid increase in life expectancy, there is a growing awareness that our environment can no longer sustain our rampant consumption of resources.",

        "page_content": "## A positive view on aging\n\nThe growth in life expectancies and the shift away from the traditional, linear life journey have long been top of mind within the pensions and financial services industry. However, the topic has too often been framed in a negative context. At Aegon, we believe an aging society can also be a healthy and productive society, and we view longevity as an opportunity for individuals and companies to rethink how they exist within society. Nearly half of all Fortune 500 CEOs are over the age of 60, while the elected leaders of more than 60 nations are in their seventies. The long-held association of aging with frailty and long periods of inactivity is being replaced by the expectation that the years after 60 can be the most rewarding.\n\nIndividuals are also taking advantage of their longer lifespans by finding new ways to have a positive impact on society and the environment. Similarly, Aegon sees longevity and sustainability as two sides of the same coin, as both issues create an extensive agenda for governments, businesses, and individuals. To champion the possibilities offered by a longer life and help improve quality of life and wellbeing for everyone, we need an approach founded on ESG factors that creates lasting value. Indeed, our recent engagements with our stakeholders have revealed two key strategic priorities: climate change, and inclusion and diversity. These topics are shaping our sustainability agenda.\n\n## Ensuring positive longevity\n\nAt Aegon, we can realize our purpose by helping our different stakeholder groups capture the opportunities offered by a longer, non-linear life journey. The advice, products, and services we provide help people accumulate and use their wealth throughout the different stages of life, take control of their finances, and adapt confidently to changing circumstances. We support our customers as they move jobs, start a family, take sabbaticals, save for the future, or buy a home. At the same time, we help them balance their financial priorities with other crucial assets, such as their health, social networks, and personal development.\n\nThe shift to a multi-stage life also has consequences for Aegon's workforce, creating the possibility of an improved trade-off between work and leisure, career and family, and finances and health. As a responsible employer, we want to be at the forefront of this change, providing broad career opportunities, dynamic support for learning and development, and a purpose-led, inclusive culture that supports vitality.\n\nMore widely, we commit to helping society adapt to far-reaching demographic changes through our expertise, investment strategies, ESG commitments, and community investment programs. We also remain committed to investing responsibly. As an asset manager, we can make a difference by integrating longevity into our sustainability approach, and actively investing in companies that equip society to support longer lifespans.\n\n## Life expectancy at birth 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Population aged 65 and above 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN 1 For the world population (male plus female), measured in years.

        "page_content": "Aegon has strong foundations in advanced retirement and global asset management solutions, as well as in under-penetrated growth markets. Aegon is well positioned to benefit from favorable structural trends in its key markets, where demographic realities and low interest rates are requiring customers to save more. We also operate with an increasing presence in large growth markets such as China and Brazil.\n\nOur base of 31.7/uni00A0million customers provides a strong foundation for further growth. We have the global reach to deliver our propositions to our customers, who will increasingly benefit from more sophisticated and tailored digital services and advice. Our global, integrated asset management business is key to our continued success, offering the opportunity to grow our share of the overall assets under management over time.\n\n## Focusing our business portfolio\n\nWe are creating a more focused business portfolio to deliver success for us and our stakeholders as we move toward our vision. A central element of this approach is the reallocation of capital from our Financial Assets to our Strategic Assets in our three core markets, as well as our three growth markets, and Aegon Asset Management. We want to be seen as leading with contemporary propositions and outstanding, digitally enabled, customer service. The organization of Aegon's core and growth markets is explained in the next column.\n\nIn parallel, we own several businesses that are sub-scale or active in niche or small markets. These are managed with tight capital and with a bias to exit. For Transamerica Life Bermuda, for example, our focus is on products that are less interest-rate sensitive, as well as on actively managing the policies that are in force while reducing expenses. We have closed our traditional distribution channels in India in favor of our digital commerce partnerships, and we are exiting other sub-scale positions and ventures globally. In 2020, we reached an agreement with Vienna Insurance Group AG Wiener Versicherung Gruppe to sell our businesses in Central & Eastern Europe. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.\n\n## Our portfolio\n\nAegon has narrowed its strategic focus to three core markets, three growth markets, and one global asset manager.\n\n## Core markets\n\nWe have three core markets - the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom - where we possess leading positions that we want to grow. Within our core markets, we distinguish between Strategic Assets and Financial Assets.\n\nStrategic Assets are businesses with a greater potential for an attractive return on capital, and where Aegon is well-positioned for growth. In these businesses, Aegon will invest in profitable growth by expanding its customer base and increasing its margins. These businesses are:\n\n- \u00b7 United States: Individual Solutions (certain life insurance products, investment products, and mutual funds), and Workplace Solutions (middle-market retirement plans and voluntary employee benefits);\n- \u00b7 The Netherlands: Workplace Solutions, mortgage origination, and banking;\n- \u00b7 United Kingdom: Workplace and Retail platform business and protection.\n\nFinancial Assets are blocks of business that are capital intensive with relatively low returns on capital employed. New sales for these blocks are limited and focused on products with higher returns and a moderate risk profile. We aim to maximize the value of these businesses through disciplined risk management and capital management actions. These businesses are:\n\n- \u00b7 United States: Fixed and Variable Annuities with interestrate-sensitive riders, and stand-alone long-term care;\n- \u00b7 The Netherlands: term life, individual deferred annuities, and defined benefit group pensions.\n\n## Growth markets\n\nAegon focuses on three attractive growth markets - China, Brazil, and Spain & Portugal - that we will continue to access through our successful partnerships. Together with our partners, we will develop these businesses and capture the growth potential they provide while leveraging our global expertise and capabilities.\n\n## Aegon Asset Management\n\nAegon Asset Management (AAM) is an active global investment business with approximately EUR 410 billion assets under management. Leveraging our global brand and a global operating platform, AAM is active in our core and growth markets as well as in France, Germany, Hungary, and Japan.",

Our Workplace Solutions division is well positioned for growth in volume and earnings, and we will invest in growth with an enhanced focus on small and mid-sized employers. The Individual Solutions division will invest in selected individual life, accumulation, and investment products and leverage our strong distribution capabilities in this large market.\n\nIn the Netherlands, we plan to expand our capabilities in new-style, defined contribution pensions, and in mortgage origination, to support our growth ambitions. We are further expanding our position in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) and retail markets with our digital-only bank Knab.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where we are market leader in workplace solutions and financial advice platforms, we aim to sharpen our competitive edge and improve the digital experience for customers, advisors, and employers.\n\nWe regard our global asset manager as an important contributor to realizing our strategy and we aim to advance its growth. We are moving toward a global new-technology platform to drive expenses down and make Aegon Asset Management more scalable and client focused.\n\nIn Aegon's growth markets, we will continue to expand our businesses by making the most of the generous scale and untapped potential of these regions. Our strong local partnerships are key to this ambition. In Spain & Portugal, for instance, we have expanded our bancassurance partnership with Banco Santander following its acquisition of Banco Popular in 2020. We will invest further in China and Brazil, and generate growing volumes and earnings by expanding distribution and entering new pension markets.\n\n## Leveraging our capabilities\n\nOne of our most important resources is the deep knowledge and expertise of our employees around the world. We have a clearly defined workforce strategy and culture, through which we aim to preserve and develop our human and intellectual capital. Strong leadership is at the heart of this approach. In line with our new strategy, regular talent reviews now take place with every Aegon leader to ensure their competencies and skillsets directly support their assignment in their respective business unit. More widely, we are stepping up our efforts to develop our people, hire new talent where appropriate, and invest in execution capabilities and skills. Intensifying the organizational rhythm in this way allows Aegon to shift to a high-performance culture.\n\nOur expertise and capabilities travel across our markets, as what works for one region or customer group can also work well in another. A key focus of our strategy is therefore to leverage business synergies across our company and our different markets. For example, the link between our Strategic Assets and our global asset manager is strong. Likewise, our asset management teams strive to deliver strong investment returns, to support the sound and effective management of the large back books of our Financial Assets. Clear strategies and decisive actions will make these connections even stronger and more powerful in the years ahead.\n\nIn addition, we are speeding up decision-making and installing clear accountabilities, moving to a concept of 'accountability within a clear framework'. Within this new model, the Group outlines strategy, allocates capital, defines risk appetite, sets targets, and drives strategy implementation. In addition, we/uni00A0centrally determine functional mandates, set policies and frameworks, and provide shareholder services. Our business units/uni00A0develop local strategies and operating plans within the company's strategic framework and ensure their implementation.\n\nWin with leading investment solutions\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Maintaining a strong balance sheet\n\nWe make sure to maintain a strong balance sheet, so that we can focus our time and energy on increasing our return on capital and the return of capital to shareholders. We have a clear capital management policy in place that informs our capital deployment decisions. The capital deployment of the company is driven by the Cash Capital at Holding and is supported by reliable remittances from the units. To strengthen our balance sheet, reduce our risk profile, and make Aegon more resilient, we are reducing our gross financial leverage.\n\nIn 2021, Aegon continued to pursue a range of actions to strengthen its capital position and reduce the volatility of the company's solvency ratios. To further reduce our risk exposure, we launched a lump-sum buy-out program for certain variable annuities policies, and we are implementing a rate increase program for long-term care policies. Furthermore, we have expanded the hedging of our legacy variable annuity block, which will allow us to more actively consider a broader range of options for this block of business. We have also reinsured an additional part of the longevity exposure in the Dutch Life insurance portfolio and a portfolio of universal life secondary guarantee policies in the US Life business, with both actions further improving the risk profile of the company.\n\nDividends are typically expected to grow in line with sustainable free cash flows. Additional capital deployment decisions will consider our deleveraging target, as well as planned management actions to improve and de-risk the company. Aegon seeks to return surplus cash flows to its shareholders over time, unless we invest it in value-creating opportunities, which are subject to strict financial and non-financial criteria.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress on Aegon's operational improvement plan\n\nIn 2020, we began taking concrete steps to transform the company to improve our long-term performance and ensure we continue to create value for our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. We have developed a rigorous and granular company-wide operational improvement plan that comprises more than 1,200 specific initiatives. The aim of the plan is to improve Aegon's operating performance by reducing costs, expanding margins, and growing profitably. A total of 844 initiatives were executed between the launch of the operational improvement plan in 2020 and the end of 2021, of which 649 were related to expense savings.\n\nOur expense savings program aims to reduce addressable expenses by EUR 400/uni00A0million by 2023 compared with 2019. We have delivered on our ambition to achieve half of our expense reduction target by end-2021, by delivering addressable expense savings of EUR 244/uni00A0million compared with the 2019 base year. Meanwhile, we continue to fund growth initiatives to strengthen key areas of our business, for example by improving customer service, enhancing user experiences, and developing new products. As part of this approach, we continue to make strategic investments in our/uni00A0digital systems and customer portals.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability\n\nAt Aegon, we have further embedded sustainability as a/uni00A0central pillar within our company strategy. Guided by our/uni00A0purpose, we aim to create long-term value for our stakeholders through the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in our strategy.\n\nOur overarching objective through our sustainability approach is to contribute to society at large and play our part in addressing the planet's greatest challenges.\n\nFrom January 1, 2021, our newly formed Global Corporate Sustainability Team has been mandated to strengthen our focus on company-wide sustainability targets, reflecting Aegon's shift from a federated model to a principle of 'accountability within a/uni00A0clear framework'. We have set three priorities to achieve this:\n\n- 1.  Streamlining company-wide governance;\n- 2.  Identifying thematic priorities based on stakeholder engagement; and\n- 3.  Enhancing our sustainability reporting.\n\n## Streamlining company-wide governance\n\nIn 2021, we established our Global Sustainability Board (GSB) to enhance governance and oversight of our sustainability approach. The GSB's core function is to steer and strengthen the sustainability agenda across our country units, and it will be supported by our local sustainability boards. Key actions put forward by the agenda include formulating sustainability-focused commitments, key performance indicators (KPIs), and targets.\n\nThe GSB also provides advice and recommendations on specific topics such as inclusion and diversity and responsible investment, as well as on products, processes, initiatives, and communications relating to sustainability. The GSB plays an advisory role to the Management Board, with the Supervisory Board's Nomination and Governance Committee having ultimate oversight.\n\n## Identifying thematic priorities\n\nStakeholders, including investors and representative bodies, are increasingly engaging with Aegon on sustainability-related themes. These dialogues have highlighted climate change and inclusion and diversity as particularly critical issues that will guide our sustainability agenda in the years to come. We continue to monitor best practices for broader sustainability issues and act accordingly, as further described in our 'Sharing value with our stakeholders' section (see page 26). In 2021, Aegon became a signatory of the UN Global Compact. We aim to embed its principles into our strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations, as well as through collaborative projects. As a signatory, we remain firmly committed to supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with a focus on the goals that are most relevant to our business and strategy, and to which we can make a significant contribution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aegon commits to a net-zero investment portfolio\n\nCoinciding with the 'COP26' conference in Glasgow in November 2021, Aegon announced its company-wide commitment to transitioning its general account investment portfolio to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. In this context, we joined the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a UN-convened group of institutional investors committed to decarbonization.\n\nTo ensure progress toward our 2050 commitment, by 2025, we aim to reduce by 25% the weighted average carbon intensity of our corporate fixed income and listed equity general account assets. This will be followed by additional targets at five-year intervals, in line with Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance requirements.\n\nAegon will engage with carbon-intensive investee companies to drive real-world reductions in emissions. We will update our company-wide responsible investment exclusion criteria regularly to reflect the latest scientific findings on climate change, with the most recent update coming into effect on January 1, 2022.\n\nOur company-wide commitments are supported by the additional actions and commitments that our country units have made in our local markets. For instance, Aegon the Netherlands has included their separate accounts in their commitment to halve the emissions of their investments by 2030 and Aegon UK has committed to net-zero emissions across its default pension funds. Furthermore, Aegon Asset Management has joined the Net zero Asset Managers initiative, a group of international asset managers committed to supporting investing aligned with the goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nAs an insurance company, Aegon can support the transition to/uni00A0a climate-resilient economy and a net-zero world using both sides of its balance sheet. We finance the upside through our responsible investment framework, while mitigating the downside by integrating ESG into our risk management processes, and the savings and protection solutions we provide. The influence, both positive and negative, we can have as an investor is particularly significant, and we have committed to transitioning our general account investment portfolio to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 (see page 20).\n\nAegon does not operate energy- or resource-intensive processes as part of its direct business operations. Our operational activities (gas consumption, electricity consumption, and air travel) have been carbon-neutral since 2019, which has been achieved by substituting our energy consumption with renewable sources and offsetting our remaining carbon emissions. In developing regions where we have a sizeable operational presence, we specifically support carbon offset projects that reflect our own footprint and align with our priority United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as our purpose of Helping people live their best lives . In 2021, this included a Voluntary Emission Reduction project in China focused on diverting atmospheric methane emissions from agriculture to local communities as an alternative source of energy to coal, along with providing employment opportunities in supporting the associated infrastructure.\n\nIn line with the net-zero commitment announced in November 2021, Aegon has set a supporting greenhouse gas emission reduction target to reduce the carbon footprint of its operational activities by 25% by 2025 against a 2019 baseline. The target includes the consumption of natural gas and electricity. In 2021, the carbon footprint of Aegon's operational activities reduced by 54% compared with 2019. While some of these reductions can be traced to our initiatives to stimulate hybrid working -/uni00A0for instance reductions in leased space across the US in 2021 there has also been a temporary benefit from fewer employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 climate performance indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of corporate fixed income and listed equity: 490 metric tons CO 2 e/EURm revenue 1\n- \u00b7 No change in WACI against 2019\n- \u00b7 Operational carbon footprint: 24,024 metric tons CO 2 e 2\n- \u00b7 Reduction of operational carbon footprint against 2019: 54%\n- \u00b7 Green electricity purchased: 99%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the office due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we expect to reverse over time. Through implementing our hybrid working policy and other initiatives, we will work toward achieving our target. Aegon will also look toward expanding the scope of measurement of our GHG emissions and explore setting further targets against these in the future.\n\nFinally, Aegon worked with Ortec Finance to perform an extensive and systematic climate risk assessment for the general and separate account assets of all business units within Aegon. The analysis investigated three plausible climate pathways (orderly, disorderly and failed transitions) to explore potential future climate policies, interventions, and consequences of the world failing to mitigate climate change.\n\n## Recent steps on our journey to becoming a more inclusive and diverse organization\n\n## June 2020\n\nPublic statement on Transamerica's commitment to racial equity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dec 2021 / 2022\n\nIncreasing the impact and maturity of our I&D ambition by developing an I&D Strategy aligned to our key sustainability priorities and our new Talent Management Strategy\n\n## Nov 2020\n\nI&D strengthened in Brand and Marketing Pledge\n\n## Dec 2020\n\nI&D strengthened in Vendor Code of Conduct\n\n## June 2021\n\nOur Global CEO Pledge: G20 Alliance for Empowerment and Progression of Women's Economic Representation - Aegon named as Advocate in the G20 Empower Best Practices Playbook\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 For details on the methodology used, please see our TCFD disclosure (Methodology) on page 378.\n- 2 For details on the methodology used, please see footnote 1, Society: Operational footprint on page 392.\n\n## Mid 2020\n\nAegon Asset Management and Aegon UK sign up to the Race at Work Charter",

        "page_content": "Modelling results indicate resilience of the Aegon general account portfolio allocation to key systemic climate risk drivers across all modelled climate scenarios. High allocation of fixed income assets is the key driver that limits the cumulative climaterelated impact on returns over a 40-year horizon. Continuing to monitor developments in climate science, policy, technology, regulation, and consumer sentiment will remain critical for understanding and adapting to the future.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nOur inclusion and diversity approach is designed to ensure our policies and actions permeate all areas and levels of the company. Together with the company's leadership, Aegon's employees and other stakeholders share accountability for building an inclusive and diverse organization. In 2021, we held Strategic People Discussions centered on ensuring inclusion and diversity within our talent pipeline, with a focus on underrepresented and young talents. These conversations have created opportunities for aspiring leaders to participate in mentorship programs,, stretch assignments, group development programs, and conversations with Management Board members to raise their profiles.\n\nAlongside diversity and equality, improving openness and inclusion is a priority across Aegon. We have updated how we measure these elements in Aegon's Global Employee Survey to enable more targeted interventions and track our progress. The 2021 survey included additional questions exploring whether people feel comfortable speaking up and being their authentic selves, along with openness about learning from mistakes.\n\nIn 2022, Aegon will appoint a Global Head of Inclusion & Diversity to support the development of our inclusion and diversity strategy across the following three pillars:\n\n- 1.  Workplace - moving from awareness of unconscious bias to helping people adopt conscious inclusion.\n- 2.  Workforce - leveraging diversity data to understand the current context, deliver impactful interventions, and track progress.\n- 3.  Marketplace - assessing our current level of maturity on inclusion and diversity - including how we compare with relevant peers - and determining our level of ambition and how to achieve it.\n\nFurthermore, Aegon's new Diversity Policy is intended to address the legal requirements of the 'Diversity at the Top Act', effective from January 1, 2022, to improve the designed gender balance in listed and large Dutch-owned companies. We will also continue to include a non-financial performance indicator for Management Board members regarding gender diversity in all senior management positions (see 'Performance in 2021' on page 33).\n\nA further example of Aegon's approach to inclusion and diversity from one of our core markets is provided in the long-term value creation section, on page 28.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Inclusion and diversity performance indicators\n\nAt Aegon, we view inclusion and diversity as integral qualities in a robust, futureproof business. Along with providing a welcoming and supportive environment for people from different ethnicities and backgrounds, we strive to maintain a healthy level of gender diversity at/uni00A0all levels of our organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor 2022, we set a target of a minimum of 36% female representation among senior management. In 2021, the/uni00A0proportion of female representation among senior management increased to/uni00A034%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Including diverse voices in our transformation\n\nAt Aegon, we believe ideas are central to our transformation and we value different perspectives. Every initiative introduced at Aegon originally began as someone's idea, and it is crucial we have a continuous stream of such ideas to fuel our ongoing improvement and growth.\n\nIn July 2021, Transamerica's Heads of Transformation hosted an ideation session for members of our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). The session resulted in 34 new ideas generated by 23 ERG members, covering topics ranging from diversifying our intern population to improving efficiency through increased cross-training. Six ideas from the session are in the process of being taken forward and are now at varying stages of implementation.\n\n## Enhancing our sustainability reporting\n\nThe development of sustainability-related legislation and regulation has advanced significantly in recent years, both in terms of volume and pace. This has had a bearing on corporate reporting and disclosure requirements. In the European Union, we have witnessed the accelerated development of sustainable-financerelated legislation and regulation following the 2018 launch the European Commission's action plan on sustainable finance. This trend can only be expected to continue in years to come.",

We are developing a Target Operating Model, whereby sustainability reporting is integrated into our company-wide finance reporting function, leveraging its existing processes and best practices. This includes ensuring Aegon is ready for limited assurance for external non-financial reporting over 2023, given the European Commission's incoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\n\n## Responsible investment at Aegon\n\nAt Aegon, we recognize our responsibility to ensure our investments do not negatively affect society or the planet. We apply this ethos to our own general account investments and use our influence to encourage similar standards in the investment decisions of our customers. By taking an active approach to responsible investment, we seek to minimize risks to our business and explore ways to serve the interests of our customers and society at large.\n\nAegon's Responsible Investment Policy recognizes a broad range of recurring sustainability and ESG topics, from climate change to corporate governance. In November 2021, we took an important step forward in our commitment to transitioning our general account investment portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 (see page 20).\n\n## Key responsible investment activities in 2021\n\nIn 2021, we continued to introduce new responsible investment solutions across our different investment platforms. In the fixed/uni00A0income space, Aegon Asset Management and Aegon UK partnered with the Global Ethical Finance Initiative to launch the/uni00A0Aegon Global Sustainable Sovereign Bond Fund. The launch coincided with COP26 in November 2021. In the equities space, Aegon Asset Management launched the Sustainable US Large Cap Equities strategy. The launch was accompanied by new multi-asset and real asset solutions that included the Sustainable/uni00A0Diversified Growth Fund, and the Sustainable Real/uni00A0Estate Securities Fund, respectively.\n\n## Asset manager: Our solutions\n\nAegon Asset Management (AAM) has a Responsible Investment Framework that reflects the key elements of our/uni00A0Responsible Investment Policy, as well as similar policies put forward by AAM's clients. The framework is structured as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 ESG integration - Material ESG factors are fundamental to our investment decision-making across all AAM portfolios. By integrating ESG considerations into traditional financial analysis, the AAM research team arrives at an independent view of an issuer's fundamentals.\n- \u00b7 Active ownership - Aegon actively engages with investee companies to help improve their ESG profile and/uni00A0address sustainability issues. We also exercise our shareholder voting rights to support our engagement efforts and enhance long-term value creation for all/uni00A0stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Solutions - AAM provides a range of responsible investment solutions to pursue ESG objectives alongside financial returns, based on four categories:\n- 1.  Exclusion-based strategies (Utilize negative screening to avoid certain sectors, companies or practices based on specific criteria);\n- 2.  Best-in-class strategies (Seek to outperform by emphasizing positive screening of issuers with better or improving ESG practices);\n- 3.  Sustainability-themed strategies (Focus on issuers aligned with sustainability themes in an effort to generate competitive returns over the long term);\n- 4.  Impact investments (Pursue financial returns alongside measurable positive social and/or environmental impact).\n\nFurther information about Aegon Asset Management's activities can be found in the dedicated Responsible Investment Report published by AAM.\n\n## Example: Active engagement with investee companies\n\nCompany\n\nHealthcare company\n\nObjectives\n\nCalling on a globally important player to fight the COVID-19 pandemic to assure its products are available worldwide with equitable pricing.\n\nHow we engaged\n\nWe challenged the company on the topic, sending an engagement letter, followed by phone calls and emails.\n\nOutcome\n\nThe company announced an advanced vaccine purchase agreement with COVAX for low- and lower-middle-income countries.\n\nVoting\n\nWe supported the shareholder proposal requesting a 'Report on Access to COVID-19 Products'. The report provides shareholders with additional information about access to the COVID-19 vaccine produced by the healthcare company. It provides information about the effect of the company's decisions and how the related risks are managed.",

As underpinned by our purpose and our resulting sustainability approach, we see our business as inherently beneficial to society and people's lives. We believe the value we create is widely shared. However, we also recognize that some decisions we make may result in the erosion of value for certain stakeholders. The active identification and management of potentially negative consequences is, therefore, an integral part of our decision-making.\n\nTo meet the expectations of our stakeholders, we commit to being a good corporate citizen with a strong ESG foundation. Fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce and addressing climate change have been identified as specific strategic sustainability priorities for our business in the coming years. Meanwhile, our broader sustainability agenda also encompasses investing and paying taxes in a responsible way, safeguarding data privacy and information security, respecting human rights, and upholding sustainable procurement principles, among other actions.\n\nWe define our stakeholders as any individual or organization currently or potentially affected by our activities, or with the potential to influence the environment in which we operate. In the following pages, we describe our efforts in 2021 to share value with each of our five main stakeholder groups.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nDelivering long-term value to Aegon's 31.7/uni00A0million customers is central to our purpose of Helping people live their best lives and provides the foundation for our strategy. As people live longer, our customers are under increasing pressure to save more for their own retirement. Low interest rates make this requirement even more challenging.\n\nThere is a growing need for the investment, protection, and retirement solutions that Aegon can provide, and we are constantly looking to enhance our customer propositions with value-adding products and services. At the same time, we seek to enrich our customers' lives by improving our levels of customer service, including through digital tools and platforms, and by developing direct, close, personal connections.\n\nAs well as supporting our existing customers, we are extending our reach to underserved groups and regions with a low financial services penetration, by expanding access to our products and\n\noffering solutions that cater to specific user needs. For/uni00A0example, World Financial Group is uniquely positioned to serve small business owners in the US market, many of whom are firstor second-generation immigrants who may require financial advice in their native language.\n\n## Enhancing our propositions\n\nIn 2021, Aegon continued to expand its offering across its key markets to be able to cater to customers' evolving needs even more closely. In the United States, Transamerica Individual Solutions rolled out its accelerated underwriting process to additional products, and extended flexible criteria for non-medical underwriting. Transamerica Workplace Solutions launched a health savings account and rejuvenated its Group Life and Disability proposition, focused on critical illness and accident products.\n\nIn the Netherlands, we enhanced our customer propositions in important areas, for example by introducing a new 'green' mortgage to help people pay for sustainable home improvements. We also added new features to our banking services, which included Apple Pay, a refunded VAT savings proposition, and attractively priced insurance coverages.\n\n## Improving customer service\n\nTo enhance customer experience and satisfaction, we took steps to enhance and further professionalize our customer interactions, by digitalizing and simplifying customer journeys. Our focus during 2021 was on introducing more opportunities for human connection in the interactions that truly matter to our customers and that require empathy or personalized advice. At the same time, we continued to introduce 24/7 self-service options to allow customers to complete simple requests by themselves.\n\nAegon's digital channels are an important means of communicating with households and individuals. In 2021, we continued to strengthen our customer portals across our different business units, including our Employee Benefits business in the United States. The focus was on improving customers' ability to file claims, receive status updates for requests, and check the terms and conditions of their policies. We also took steps to streamline our billing and disbursement processes.\n\nIn our Transamerica Workplace Solutions business, we developed a digital onboarding functionality for advisors, improved a 'Connect Desk' for small and middle-market customers, and introduced digital disbursements to significantly accelerate our handling time. We also introduced Transamerica 401Kares, through which our Managed Advice service is offered to selected customers as a free trial, allowing them to review their pension savings and make important investment decisions.",

This important acquisition, in turn, supports our strong company-wide focus on customer centricity\n\n## Strengthening engagement and trust\n\nAcross Aegon, we are focused on finding new ways to engage with our customers and build close, personal connections centered on trust.\n\nIn March 2021, Aegon UK partnered with the Initiative for Financial Wellbeing and Edinburgh University to launch the Financial Wellbeing Index, which helps advisors and employee benefits consultants provide personalized, needs-based advice to end-customers. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, Knab, Aegon's digital banking platform, continued to support local entrepreneurs through Knab Bieb, an extensive online library for topics related to finance and entrepreneurship.\n\nCustomer satisfaction in each of our core markets, measured in benchmarked Net Promoter Score (SM) (NPS\u00ae), should be in line with or above the average of our industry peers.\n\nIn 2021, our efforts were rewarded by solid NPS outcomes. Our US business, Transamerica, performed in line with the market average while Aegon UK was above the average. Aegon the Netherlands was slightly below the market average, though its score is steadily improving over time. For further details of Aegon's NPS outcomes, please see page 382 of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees\n\nAegon is continuously adapting to our evolving operating environment. It is important we guide and support our employees through the resulting changes to our business.\n\nThe communication of our new vision and strategy at the end of 2020 clearly articulated the need for transformation and the demands that this would put on our workforce as we work to improve our performance and create greater value for our customers and shareholders. Since then, our employees have been engaged in defining a rigorous and granular operational improvement plan comprising more than 1,200 initiatives across Aegon. At the same time, we have continued to adapt to new ways of working in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, we introduced a new hybrid working model to help our people achieve a healthy and productive balance between officebased and remote working.\n\n## People at the heart of our transformation journey\n\nKey to our transformation is building an organizational rhythm that empowers employees to deliver positive results. This means clearly communicating our priorities to employees, ensuring they understand the need to change, and giving them the tools and skills to do so. We also depend on our leaders to role-model the behavior required by our transformation program.\n\nTo this end, throughout 2021, Aegon's business units each conducted weekly meetings for colleagues responsible for executing initiatives linked to the operational improvement plan. The meetings provided an opportunity to report on their progress and ask for help. To help foster a high-performance culture, Aegon's Management Board offered support through regular recognition calls with initiative owners to discuss what they contributed and how. Regarding the means of contribution, we continued to focus on the three priorities set by our Management Board in 2020: clarity, discipline, and external focus.",

        "page_content": "We also provided new tools and programs to help our people deliver results. A comprehensive program management tool was introduced in the context of Aegon's transformation to encourage initiative owners to think through business cases and milestones carefully and manage progress based on KPIs. We also launched Ability 2 Execute (A2E), an employee-focused capability-building program delivered through virtual training sessions and online learning. The program aims to drive engagement with our transformation journey, build a common language, and equip our people with core implementation capabilities and skills (See figure on page 29).\n\n## Supporting engagement and wellbeing\n\nWe monitor the wellbeing and engagement of our employees closely, particularly given the twin pressures of the transformation process and the ongoing pandemic. In 2021, our business units continued to introduce local activities aimed at helping employees deal with work pressure, contributing to our improved employee wellbeing score of 65% in the third quarter of 2021. With this result, as measured by our Global Employee Survey, we improved on our score of 61% at the start of the year, though we remain below our benchmark 1 of 68%. Our engagement score fell back to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2021, having peaked in 2020 following our initial response to the pandemic.\n\n## Introducing our hybrid working model\n\nAt Aegon, we have developed a Future Ways of Working plan that draws on the learnings from our employee surveys and reflects the growing shift toward flexible and remote working. One focal point is our new hybrid working model, adopted in 2021 across most of our business units. The approach is based on globally agreed principles - hybrid working, office utilization and location, and employee benefits - that are translated locally.\n\nWe have embraced hybrid working as we believe it helps our people to have a full professional life. A healthy balance between working in and out of the office helps us to stay tuned in and perform at our best. Our managers have a key role in making the hybrid model work by building teams where people speak up, self-organize and support each other's well-being. We will continue to get together regularly, because it strengthens collaboration, innovation and networking. To ensure we get things done regardless of work setting, we ensure we have the technology and tools in place to help bridge gaps in time or place, so everyone feels included. Creating opportunities for our employees to reach a preferred working solution also reinforces our purpose of Helping people live their best lives .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthening inclusion and diversity with Black Professionals Scotland\n\nInclusion and diversity is a strategic sustainability priority that will guide Aegon's sustainability agenda in the years ahead. We aim to establish Aegon as a leading employer that is home to a diverse and highly skilled workforce through interesting and forward-looking work, futurefocused training opportunities, and strong inclusion and diversity policies.\n\nOur local partnerships directly support our inclusion and diversity approach. In early 2021, Aegon Asset Management (AAM) in the United Kingdom partnered with Black Professionals Scotland (BPS) to further expand recruitment and engagement to untapped talent. BPS exists to empower Scotland-based black ethnic minority professionals, school leavers, and recent university graduates. Members are given skills and information to support them in their careers. Alongside helping ethnic minority professionals with their development, BPS supports organizations in realizing their inclusion and diversity ambitions.\n\nAAM now advertises all UK vacancies with BPS, and we have onboarded our first BPS recruit into the Portfolio Risk team in Edinburgh. In October 2021, AAM and BPS team members also took part in events together to celebrate Black History Month in the United Kingdom. Our budding partnership with BPS underlines AAM's commitment to inclusion and valuing diverse perspectives in the workplace, in line with our ambition to harness the potential of different talents and become more representative of the communities we serve.",

We design our procurement processes to deliver excellent value for money for our business functions while also contributing to a sustainable global supply chain.\n\nWe are steadily integrating best-practice ESG criteria and requirements into our supplier selection, development, and ordering processes. We aim to develop a procurement approach that prioritizes vendors who go beyond the minimum standards by respecting and sharing our values and upholding these along the supply chain. We work closely with our suppliers and, in doing so, encourage them to make positive changes to their operations and products for the benefit of the environment and wider society.\n\n## Vendor Code of Conduct\n\nMinimum requirements for conducting business with Aegon apply to all procurement activities conducted by wholly or majority-owned companies in which Aegon has management control. These requirements are set out in our global Vendor Code of Conduct. In cases where we have an equity interest but no management control, the partnering company is expected to use its influence to apply the spirit of the code.\n\nOur partners and suppliers are required to recognize and build processes to comply with applicable laws and ethical business practices in jurisdictions where they operate or conduct business. This includes taking steps to communicate the Vendor Code of Conduct within their own organizations, and, in particular, to employees or sub-contractors working directly with Aegon. More widely, we expect our suppliers to align with Aegon's ethics, values, and standards. This includes adhering to Aegon's Statement on Human Rights and avoiding complicity in the abuse or violation of internationally proclaimed human rights standards. Furthermore, we ask our suppliers to acknowledge and minimize their environmental impact wherever possible, and to provide fair compensation for any ecological damage they cause.\n\nThe close attention we pay to diversity also extends to the diversity of our supplier portfolio. In the United Kingdom, for example, we are a member of Social Enterprise UK, a community interest company encouraging businesses to spend a total of GBP 1 billion with social enterprises. Aegon UK far exceeded its 2021 target of GBP 100,000, eventually reaching GBP 150,000. Meanwhile, Transamerica also took steps to improve supplier diversity in 2021. Most notably, its new Supplier Diversity Program is designed to increase the number of diverse suppliers in our portfolio, and in 2021 we added two new diverse suppliers in the contingent labor category.",

In 2021, our Transamerica business took steps to expand and mature its Contingent Workforce Program, a practice through which we oversee our relationships with non-permanent external resources. In 2021, we also significantly expanded our use of the SAP Fieldglass vendor management system (VMS) in the United States and the Netherlands, to connect us with top external talent and source contingent workers more efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe VMS includes built-in financial and security controls and is supported by a Contingent Labor Tenure Policy that allows us to better manage this significant area of expenditure. The VMS is integrated internally with our key finance systems and processes, data and analytics, risk, identity, and real estate systems. This provides clear visibility of the costs associated with attracting and employing external talent, while helping to maintain high standards for workers performance throughout Aegon.\n\n## Risk management and due diligence\n\nAegon's procurement function applies a company-wide framework within which all elements of third-party risk are identified and verified against our standards of reliability and integrity. A risk-based approach is applied to managing our supply base through a globally standardized segmentation methodology that considers the inherent risk of each vendor relationship, as well as the impact of that relationship on Aegon's operations.\n\nThrough our risk management approach, we mitigate potential risks resulting from our engagements with third parties to an acceptable level. In 2021, we continued the roll-out of the SAP Ariba vendor lifecycle management platform to improve our vendor due diligence processes and prevent the duplication of efforts to validate suppliers between different business units. All suppliers seeking qualification for Aegon's Supplier Register must meet general requirements regarding their ethical and professional suitability, as well as specific business, financial, technical, and organizational criteria.\n\n## Third-party risk assessment programs\n\nAegon works with external experts to adopt market-wide standards for risk assessment that strengthen and simplify the evaluation processes and reduce the risk evaluation requirements for Aegon and its vendors. 2021 was our second year working with sustainability rating company EcoVadis to evaluate the ESG risks involved in our partnerships with our top 250 vendors by spend (representing 80% of Aegon's total procurement spend). We now have valid EcoVadis scorecards for 81 of our top vendor accounts, covering 59% of the spend of these relationships. We also expanded a program supported by Aegon's technology partner, Rapid Ratings, to standardize our financial assessments of vendors around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investors\n\nIn 2021, Aegon made further progress on realizing its strategic priorities and financial targets. This enabled us to accelerate the increase in dividend payments, in keeping with the ambitions we presented at our 2020 Capital Markets Day. This puts us on a more linear path to achieving our aim of paying around 25 eurocents dividend per common share over 2023 to equity investors.\n\nIn 2021, Aegon increased its interim dividend by 2 eurocents to 8 eurocents per common share, and proposed to increase the final dividend by 3 eurocents to 9 eurocents per common share. As such, we deliver a total of EUR 348/uni00A0million in dividends to shareholders over 2021.\n\nAt the end of 2021, Aegon had a gross financial leverage position of EUR 5.9 billion. This delivered EUR 220/uni00A0million value in the form of interest payments to bondholders.",

The wider European insurance industry performed less well, with the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance Index ending the year up by 15%. We believe the relative overperformance was supported by favorable market movements, progress made on our operational improvement plan, and management actions to improve our risk profile. Our total shareholder return for the year amounted to a gain of 41% (this measure considers payment of dividends as well as share price performance).\n\n## Safeguarding long-term value\n\nWe are taking steps to further strengthen our balance sheet. This allows for attractive and sustainable capital deployment decisions, which generate value for our investors over the longer term. We are committed to reducing our gross financial leverage to between EUR 5.0 billion and EUR 5.5 billion until 2023 to further strengthen our balance sheet. Capital deployment decisions are driven by Cash Capital at Holding, taking into account our deleveraging target and the planned management actions to further improve the risk profile of our company, and are supported by reliable and sustainable remittances from our country units.\n\nCash Capital at Holding is used to achieve the financial leverage target over time and to pay interest to bondholders. At Aegon, we seek to distribute surplus cash flows (defined as the amount of cash available from the remittances from country units after subtracting the holding funding and operating expenses) to shareholders over time, unless we invest it in value-creating opportunities. We expect to pay dividends to shareholders in line with growth in sustainable free cash flow, barring unforeseen circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Society\n\nAs a provider of pensions and other retirement solutions, Aegon has a responsibility to help people plan effectively for old age and to enjoy longer, more active retirements. Financial security and education, as well as wellbeing and longevity, are at the heart of our business and go hand in hand with our purpose of Helping people live their best lives .\n\nHowever, the value we create for society goes beyond individuals. In 2021, the EUR 62 billion we paid in claims, benefits, and retirement plan withdrawals to our customers helped support national economies and relieve pressure on social support\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting COVID-19 relief efforts in India\n\nIn 2021, the Aegon community came together to support relief efforts amid the unprecedented surge of COVID-19 cases across India and in recognition of the many Aegon employees who live and work in the country.\n\nDonations totaling EUR 300,000 were made to worthwhile causes. The Aegon Transamerica Foundation contributed to Direct Relief, an international humanitarian aid organization that provides oxygen concentrators, medication, personal protection equipment, and financial resources to frontline healthcare providers in India.\n\nA further contribution was made on behalf of Aegon to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), which is working tirelessly to tackle the impact of the pandemic on India's children and their families, and boost access to critical oxygen therapy and accurate testing. With these swift and coordinated actions, we helped deliver essential relief and support that saved lives.\n\nsystems. Furthermore, our research partnerships and programs create awareness and insights into longevity and retirement that benefit society. We also support our local communities through donations and volunteering, and by paying fair taxes in the different locations where we operate.\n\n## Adapting to the modern retirement landscape\n\nLonger lifespans are putting traditional, state-managed retirement systems under strain and shifting responsibility from governments and employers to individuals. By pursuing research, advocacy, and visibility around financial planning, retirement, health, and insurance, we aim to increase recognition of this critical social issue within global policymaking agendas.",

This includes participating in relevant international projects, such as an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working group on the future of work, and the Living, Learning, and Earning Longer initiative led by the World Economic Forum (WEF), to examine the benefits of an age-inclusive workforce. Our research efforts are channeled through dedicated institutes operating on the ground in our local markets. These include the Transamerica Institute in the United States and the Instituto de Longevidade MAG in Brazil.\n\nAegon also advocates for people to have access to insurance and financial services as well as opportunities for flexible employment in old age, and for governments to provide for their citizens in an era of increasing longevity. Meanwhile, we maintain a visible presence in the communities that benefit from our services through initiatives such as a 'Silver Starters' learning program for entrepreneurs aged 50 and over.\n\n## Investing in our communities\n\nOur country units support local causes that align with our purpose and ambitions, including by way of investments that seek to serve and strengthen the communities in which we operate. At the same time, through donations and volunteering, we aim to drive engagement between employees and their local communities and promote our purpose and ESG approach to all stakeholders.\n\nIn 2021, Aegon supported approximately 469 charities and good causes. Our donations amounted to EUR 9.4/uni00A0million, a 1.3% increase compared with 2020. Much of this investment was driven by our Charitable Donations Standards, which require country units to allocate at least 50% of their annual donations to causes that directly support financial security and personal wellbeing.\n\nAs was the case in 2020, we prioritized helping our most vulnerable communities navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences, with/uni00A0a specific focus on people who needed help handling their finances. Despite ongoing constraints due to the pandemic, Aegon employees recorded 6,806 volunteer hours in 2021 (equivalent to EUR 0.3/uni00A0million, based on volunteers' average salaries). Many initiatives took place online, and our 'Volunteer Friday' program in the Netherlands was held virtually for the first time.\n\n## Responsible tax\n\nWe make a valuable economic and social contribution to the communities in which we operate through our own tax payments as well as the collection and payment of third-party taxes. We seek to pay 'fair taxes', namely by paying the right amounts of tax in the right places. Published online, our Global Tax Policy outlines our approach to responsible tax, which seeks to align the long-term interests of our customers, employees, business partners, investors, and wider society. In 2021, we also began publishing a Global Tax Report to provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to tax and our tax contributions on a country-by-country basis.",

        "page_content": "## Performance in 2021\n\nFinancial markets saw equity markets generally finding higher levels at the end of the year than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest rates increased considerably in the United States compared with the low levels seen during 2020, whereas credit spreads remained relatively stable over the year.\n\nThese developments contributed positively to Aegon's financial results. However, excess mortality mainly induced by the pandemic continued to have a negative impact on our earnings in the United/uni00A0States. Overall, we maintained strong capital ratios for our/uni00A0main businesses above their respective operating levels. Aegon made steady progress against the medium-term targets announced in December 2020. Both free cash flows and expense savings exceeded targets, and we made continued progress against our medium-term deleveraging goal. We are also ahead of/uni00A0schedule with respect to our free cash flow target and above target with regard to the planned expense savings that were delivered during the year.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nAegon's operating result amounted to EUR 1,906/uni00A0million in 2021, an increase of 11% compared with 2020. All business units showed improved performance, driven by positive contributions from business growth, as well as expense savings and favorable equity markets. These drivers were only partly offset by a more adverse mortality result in the United States than in 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our net result amounted to EUR 1,701/uni00A0million in 2021, versus EUR 55/uni00A0million in 2020. This increase was supported by the higher operating result and a gain on non-operating items, compared with a loss in nonoperating items in 2020. In addition, a reduction in non-recurring Other charges contributed to the increase in the net result.\n\nIn 2021, we further strengthened our balance sheet, reduced our risk exposure to financial markets, and improved the company's risk profile. Aegon redeemed USD 250/uni00A0million in floating rate perpetual capital securities in September 2021, lowering the company's financial leverage to EUR 5.9 billion at year end. In our US variable annuity business, we completed a successful lump-sum buy-out program and expanded our dynamic hedging program to release capital and increase the predictability of capital generation. In addition, we executed plans to reduce our economic interest rate exposure in the United States and reduced the targeted interest rate risk exposure by approximately 70%. We have also seen a steady flow of regulatory approvals in our long-term care rate increase program, and we have reinsured additional longevity risk in the Netherlands as well as reducing the risk of volatility in mortality claims in the United States.\n\nThe capital positions of each of Aegon's main business units ended the year above the units' respective operating levels, while the Group Solvency II ratio increased by 15 percentage points\n\nto 211%. Actively managing Aegon's risks and capital position has increased the predictability of remittances. Free cash flows increased from EUR 530/uni00A0million in 2020 to EUR 729/uni00A0million in 2021, partly supported by the distribution of excess capital from several units. Based on the steady progress made against Aegon's strategic priorities and financial targets, a final dividend for 2021 of 9 eurocents per common share will be proposed, bringing the total dividend for the year to 17 eurocents per share.\n\nIn 2022, we aim to make further progress on delivering on our strategic objectives and toward realizing our 2023 financial targets. The performance improvement plan will be rigorously executed, and we remain on track to reach our 2023 target of EUR 400 million in expense savings, building on the EUR 244 million achieved so far. The actions taken to improve our performance will support the delivery of around EUR 1.2 billion operating capital generation in 2022, barring unforeseen circumstances. The current geopolitical situation creates uncertainty and has implications for financial markets and the global economy. However, we believe that we have the right strategy to deal with these conditions and will continue to actively manage our risks and capital position. Please refer to the Capital and liquidity management section for sensitivities of our capital position to certain parameters, including lower equity markets, lower interest rates and US credit defaults. For 2022, we expect free cash flow of between EUR 550 million and EUR 600 million. We also expect a more linear growth in our dividend in 2022 compared with the muted near-term growth outlook that was previously provided and continue to target a dividend of around 25 eurocents per share over 2023.\n\nFurther information on our performance in 2021 can be found in the Results of Operations section on page 96.\n\n## Financial targets 2021-2023\n\n| Reduce leverage                     | EUR 5.0-5.5 billion Gross financial leverage target            |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Implement expense  savings          | EUR 400 million Lower addressable expenses  vs. 2019           |\n| Increase free  cash flows           | EUR 1.4-1.6 billion Cumulative free cash flows over  2021-2023 |\n| Distribute capital  to shareholders | Around EUR 0.25  dividend per share over  2023                 |",

        "page_content": "## Non-financial performance\n\nIn December 2020, Aegon launched its new business strategy, which touches on a broad range of non-financial elements and includes a commitment to integrate a strengthened vision on sustainability. In 2021, we made good progress against our ambitions by establishing new sustainability governance, preparing for migration of sustainability reporting to our finance department, and selecting two priority themes, which are climate change and inclusion and diversity.\n\nOur new strategy has led to a review of our key non-financial performance metrics, to ensure a more balanced approach to our stakeholders and that our priority themes are addressed. This has led to the retirement of three customer-related KPIs: number of customers, percentage of customers with two or more products, and proportion of digitally connected customers. In their place, Aegon has introduced two new KPIs that align directly with the priority themes. With regard to climate change, we have introduced a weighted average carbon intensity metric for our corporate fixed income and listed equity. For inclusion and diversity, the percentage of women in senior management is now included as a KPI.\n\nWith these changes, we have taken an important step toward our sustainability ambitions, though we recognize that there is still work to be done. As our strategy evolves and our approach to sustainability matures, we will proactively review our nonfinancial KPIs to ensure we continue to monitor and showcase the most relevant metrics to our stakeholders. The rationale for our four non-financial KPIs is detailed below.\n\n- 1.  Aegon wants to be there for its customers. This means providing solutions that create long-term value and developing products and services that fully meet their needs and expectations at every stage of their lives. Customer satisfaction in each of our core markets, which is measured by benchmarked Net Promoter Score (SM) , should be in line with or above the average of those of our industry peers.\n- \u00b7 Our US business, Transamerica, performed in line with the market average while Aegon UK was above average. Aegon the Netherlands performed slightly below the market average, though its score has been steadily improving over time.\n- 2.  For us to deliver on our promises to all our stakeholders, it is important that our employees are fully engaged and motivated to contribute to this task.\n- \u00b7 The employee engagement score in 2021 was 68, a/uni00A0decrease of 4 points. This decline reflects the challenge of maintaining engagement during a time when the company is undergoing significant change, including challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n- 3.  At Aegon, we value a diverse workforce, because we believe including different perspectives is critical for richer debates and innovation.\n- \u00b7 The proportion of female representation among our senior management increased by 2%-points to 34% in 2021.\n- 4.  Aegon seeks to ensure the reduction of the weighted average carbon intensity of the company's investment portfolio is aligned to its net-zero ambitions, for the benefit of wider society.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, the weighted average carbon intensity of our own investment portfolio stayed flat compared with 2019. We/uni00A0remain on track to meet our target for a 25% reduction in the carbon intensity of our corporate fixed income and listed equity investments by 2025.\n\nTo further embed the above non-financial KPIs in our operations, the KPIs were reflected in the remuneration targets set at both a company-wide and individual level in 2021. The remuneration targets for our Executive Board members are required to be comprised of at least 50% non-financial performance indicators, of which ESG has been a mandatory performance indicator category since 2020. In 2021, the performance indicators for Aegon's Executive Board members included the further integration of ESG into the company strategy and the increased presence of women in senior management.\n\n## Non-financial targets\n\n| Customers   | \u00b7 Customer satisfaction in each of our core  markets (measured by NPS) in line with or  above the average of those of our peers                                                     |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees   | \u00b7  A 70% employee engagement score for  2022, measured through our Global  Employee Survey \u00b7 Minimum level of 36% of female  representation amongst our senior  management for 2022 |\n| Society     | \u00b7 At least 25% reduction in weighted  average carbon intensity of our corporate  fixed income and listed equity investments  by 2025                                                |",

The added value of the Board lies in the diverse skills and talents of each of our different members. On this note, I very much welcome the recent appointment of Jack McGarry to the Supervisory Board, who brings a/uni00A0wealth of experience from/uni00A0the US insurance industry.\n\nThroughout the year, the Supervisory Board remained in close consultation with the Executive Board about the measures taken to support Aegon's long-term value creation strategy and transformation. I see clear signs of progress. Multiple expense savings initiatives have been implemented, putting the company on track to realize significant cost reductions by 2023. Adjustments to the company's portfolio, such as divestments, were also regularly discussed with Aegon's leadership in the context of the strategy implementation.\n\nThere is a/uni00A0cultural side to our transformation journey, of course. In 2021, our leaders and employees spent time examining our culture, values, and behaviors to better understand 'who' Aegon is and the value we create as an organization. This exercise will help us to meet the changing needs and expectations of our customers and other stakeholders in the years ahead. Again,/uni00A0the Supervisory Board is pleased to have been closely involved in this process.\n\n## Confidence in our leadership\n\nWe fully support Aegon's leaders as they execute the steps needed to adapt to a changing operating environment and deliver on the company's ambitions. Indeed, we have full confidence in those recently joining Aegon's leadership team. At Transamerica, Will Fuller has been appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chris Ashe has been appointed as Chief Financial Officer. The company has also appointed Allegra van H\u00f6vell-Patrizi as CEO of Aegon the Netherlands, and Elisabetta Caldera as its new Chief Human Resources Officer. Furthermore, Aegon has recently appointed Astrid J\u00e4kel as Chief Risk Officer and Deborah Waters as Chief Technology Officer, with both taking up their duties in early 2022.\n\nA further development taking place at Aegon involves the current efforts to increase the company's focus on sustainability, which are being led by the recently established Global Corporate",

        "page_content": "Sustainability Team. The strengthened sustainability agenda recognizes the far-reaching impact of Aegon's operations and investment activities, and the company's desire to help shape a thriving and sustainable future society.\n\nAccordingly, the Supervisory Board has strengthened its oversight of Aegon's policies and performance regarding sustainability. I am pleased that we are dedicating particular attention to climate change, and inclusion and diversity, as these have been highlighted as priority issues by our stakeholders.\n\n## Navigating new challenges\n\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have significant repercussions for Aegon's stakeholders around the world. As in 2020, the company was at hand to help Aegon's customers and partners navigate the pandemic, including by introducing new, personalized customer propositions and donating time and resources to local communities. Similarly, the Supervisory Board is supportive of the escalation of efforts to help Aegon colleagues manage the stresses of the pandemic, including by offering people more flexibility in their working arrangements.\n\nWe also keep track of changes in the wider business environment with the potential to impact Aegon going forward. The financial services industry is steadily becoming more technology- and data-driven. This, in turn, creates new complexities in areas such as cybersecurity and data privacy, and we are pleased to see Aegon addressing these developments head on through dedicated IT teams and processes. A further topic demanding close attention is the so-called 'war for talent', given the critical shortage of digital talent and professionals in other highly skilled fields.\n\nMeanwhile, the regulatory landscape is also shifting, as providers face stricter requirements regarding issues such as customer due diligence. Among other ongoing developments in this space, the Supervisory Board is closely monitoring Aegon's efforts to prepare for the forthcoming introduction of IFRS 17, a/uni00A0new\n\nreporting standard regarding the accounting of insurance liabilities, which takes effect from 2023.\n\nIn this fast-changing environment, the Supervisory Board welcomes the development of Aegon's newly defined purpose, as well as the accompanying communications and messaging. This is an important achievement that will help to guide the company's strategy in the years to come, as well as Aegon's vision to be a/uni00A0leader in investment, protection, and retirement solutions.\n\nWe appreciated the opportunity to be regularly involved in discussions that contributed to shaping the purpose. Our conversations with the Management Board during the year also touched on important HR topics, including the development of Aegon's new expected employee behaviors. Looking ahead, the devastating aggression conducted by the Russian government against Ukraine is a significant cause for concern, and we will be paying close attention to developments in our talks with the Executive Board./uni00A0\n\nThe Supervisory Board is satisfied that it fulfilled its responsibilities to Aegon and its stakeholders during 2021. A detailed report on the Supervisory Board and its activities during the year can be found on page 47 of this Integrated Annual Report.\n\n## Thank you to our stakeholders\n\nOn behalf of those on the Board, I would once again like to thank Aegon employees for their continued efforts as we work toward our renewed purpose of Helping people live their best lives . I would also like to thank all those who invest in Aegon for their continued trust and confidence.\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands, March 16, 2022\n\n## William L.

As a/uni00A0company established and listed in the Netherlands, Aegon must comply with Dutch law and is subject to the Dutch/uni00A0Corporate Governance Code.\n\nAegon is governed by three corporate bodies:\n\n- \u00b7 General Meeting of Shareholders\n- \u00b7 Supervisory Board\n- \u00b7 Executive Board\n\nAegon also has a/uni00A0Management Board. This works in unison with the Executive Board and helps to oversee operational issues and the implementation of Aegon's strategy. Aegon's corporate governance structure is the responsibility of both the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. Any substantive change to this structure is submitted to the General Meeting of Shareholders for discussion.\n\n## The shareholders Listing and shareholder base\n\nAegon's common shares are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. Aegon has institutional and retail shareholders around the world. More than three-quarters of shareholders are located in Aegon's three main markets, the Netherlands, United States, and the United Kingdom. Aegon's largest shareholder is Vereniging Aegon, a/uni00A0Dutch association with a/uni00A0special purpose to protect the broader interests of the Company and its stakeholders.\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nA General Meeting of Shareholders is held at least once a/uni00A0year and, if deemed necessary, the Supervisory or Executive Board of the Company may convene an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders. The main function of the General Meeting of Shareholders is to decide on matters such as the adoption of annual accounts, the approval of dividend payments and (re)appointments to the Supervisory Board and Executive Board of Aegon.\n\n## Convocation\n\nGeneral Meetings of Shareholders are convened by public notice at least 42 days before the meeting. The convocation states the time and location of the meeting, the record date, the agenda items, and the procedures for admittance to the meeting and representation at the meeting by means of a/uni00A0written proxy. Those shareholders who alone or jointly represent at least 1% of Aegon's issued capital or a/uni00A0block of shares worth at least EUR/uni00A0100/uni00A0million may request items be added to the agenda of a/uni00A0General Meeting of Shareholders. In accordance with Aegon's Articles of Association, such a/uni00A0request will be granted if it is received in writing at least 60 days before the meeting,\n\nand if there are no important interests of the Company that dictate otherwise.\n\n## Record date\n\nThe record date is used to determine shareholders' entitlements with regard to their participation and voting rights. In accordance with Dutch law, the record date is 28 days before the day of the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\n## Attendance\n\nEvery shareholder is entitled to attend the General Meeting to speak and vote, either in person or by proxy granted in writing. This includes proxies submitted electronically. All shareholders wishing to take part must provide proof of their identity and shareholding and must notify the Company ahead of time of their intention to attend the meeting. Aegon also solicits proxies from New York registry shareholders in line with common practice in the United States.\n\n## Voting at the General Meeting\n\nAt the General Meeting, each common share carries one vote. In the absence of a/uni00A0Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon casts one vote for every 40 common shares B it holds.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nAegon's Supervisory Board oversees the management of the Executive Board, in addition to the Company's business and corporate strategy. The Supervisory Board must take into account the interests of all Aegon stakeholders. The Supervisory Board operates according to the principles of collective responsibility and accountability.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, following nomination by the Supervisory Board itself. Aegon aims to ensure that the composition of the Company's Supervisory Board is in line with Aegon's diversity policy for the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and Management Board and is as such wellbalanced in terms of professional background, geography, gender and other relevant aspects of the diversity policy. A profile, which is published on aegon.com, has been established that outlines the required qualifications of its members. Supervisory Board members are appointed for a/uni00A0four-year term and may then be reappointed for another four-year period. Subsequently, a/uni00A0Supervisory Board member can be reappointed again for a/uni00A0period of two years, and then extended by two",

Supervisory Board members are no longer eligible for (re)appointment after reaching the age of 70, unless the Supervisory Board decides to make an exception. Remuneration of the Supervisory Board members is determined by the General Meeting of Shareholders. In 2021, no transactions were concluded between the Company and any of the Supervisory Board members. Furthermore, the Company did not provide loans or issue guarantees to any members of the Supervisory Board. At present, Aegon's Supervisory Board consists of eight members, all of whom qualify as independent in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board also oversees the activities of its committees. These committees are composed exclusively of Supervisory Board members and deal with specific issues related to Aegon's financial accounts, risk management, executive remuneration and appointments. These committees are the:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration Committee;/uni00A0and\n- \u00b7 Nomination and Governance Committee.\n\n## Executive Board\n\nAegon's Executive Board is charged with the overall management of the Company and is therefore responsible for developing and executing Aegon's strategy. Additionally, it is responsible for managing the Company's risk profile and overseeing any relevant sustainability issues. Each member has duties related to his or her specific area of expertise.\n\nAegon's Articles of Association determine that for certain decisions the Executive Board must seek prior approval from the Supervisory Board and/or the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders. In addition, the Supervisory Board may also subject other Executive Board decisions to its prior approval.\n\n## Composition of the Executive Board\n\nAegon's Executive Board consists of Lard Friese, who is Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Executive Board, and Matt Rider, who is Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\n\nThe number of Executive Board members and their terms of employment are determined by the Company's Supervisory Board. Executive Board members are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders for a/uni00A0four-year term, following nomination by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Executive Board have an engagement agreement with the Company rather than an employment contract. The Company's Remuneration Policy for the Executive Board limits exit arrangements to a/uni00A0maximum of one year of the fixed component of the salary./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, no transactions were concluded between the Company and either member of the Executive Board. Furthermore, the Company did not provide any loans to, or issue guarantees in favor of either of the members of the Executive Board.\n\n## Management Board\n\nAegon's Executive Board is assisted in its work by the Company's Management Board, which had 10 members, including the members of the Executive Board per December 31, 2021. Aegon's Management Board is composed of Lard Friese, Matt Rider, Elisabetta Caldera, Will Fuller, Mike Holliday-Williams, Allegra van H\u00f6vell-Patrizi, Marco Keim, Onno van Klinken, Bas NieuweWeme and Duncan Russell. At the time of publishing this 2021 Integrated Annual Report, the Management Board consisted of 12 members, including Astrid J\u00e4kel as Chief Risk Officer and Deborah Waters as Chief Technology Officer.\n\nAegon's Management Board works in unison with the Executive Board and helps oversee operational issues and the implementation of Aegon's strategy. Members are drawn from Aegon's business units and from Aegon's global functions. The members have both regional and global responsibilities. This ensures that Aegon is managed as an integrated international business. While the Executive Board is Aegon's sole statutory executive body, the Management Board provides vital support and expertise in pursuit of the Company's strategic objectives.\n\nIn the relationship between the Supervisory Board and the Management Board, the CEO shall be the first point of contact for the Supervisory Board and its Chairman. Further, the members of the Boards will act in accordance with the provisions provided therefore in the Management Board Charter, the Executive Board Charter, and the Supervisory Board Charter.\n\n## Capital, significant shareholders and exercise of/uni00A0control\n\nAs a/uni00A0publicly listed company, Aegon is required to provide the following detailed information regarding any structures or measures that may hinder or prevent a/uni00A0third party from acquiring the Company or exercising effective control over it.\n\n## The capital of the Company\n\nAegon has an authorized capital of EUR/uni00A01,080/uni00A0million, divided into 6/uni00A0billion common shares and 3/uni00A0billion common shares B, each with a/uni00A0nominal value of EUR/uni00A00.12. As of December 31, 2021, a/uni00A0total of 2,106,313,195 common shares and 568,839,440 common shares B had been issued.\n\nDepository receipts for Aegon shares are not issued with the Company's cooperation.\n\nAs per the Dutch act on conversion of bearer shares, all 16,040 bearer shares outstanding at December 2020 have been converted into registered shares held by the Company as per January 1, 2021.

There are no restrictions on the exercise of voting rights by holders of common shares.\n\nAll issued and outstanding shares B are held by Vereniging Aegon, the Company's largest shareholder. The nominal value of the common shares B is equal to the nominal value of a/uni00A0common share. This means that common shares B also carry one vote per share. However, the voting rights attached to common shares B are subject to restrictions as laid down in the Voting Rights Agreement, under which Vereniging Aegon may cast one vote for every 40 common shares B it holds in the absence of a/uni00A0Special Cause.\n\nThe financial rights attached to a/uni00A0common share B are onefortieth (1/40 th ) of the financial rights attached to a/uni00A0common share. The rights attached to the shares of both classes are otherwise identical. For the purpose of the issuance of shares, reduction of issued capital, the sale and transfer of common shares B or otherwise, the value or the price of a/uni00A0common share B is determined as one-fortieth (1/40 th ) of the value of a/uni00A0common share. For such purposes, no account is taken of the difference between common shares and common shares B in terms of the proportion between financial rights and voting rights.\n\n## Significant shareholdings\n\nOn December 31, 2021, Vereniging Aegon, Aegon's largest shareholder, held a/uni00A0total of 301,774,161 common shares and 538,250,640 common shares B.\n\nUnder the terms of the 1983 Merger Agreement, as amended in May 2013, Vereniging Aegon has the option to acquire additional common shares B. Vereniging Aegon may exercise its call option to keep or restore its total stake to 32.6% of the voting rights, irrespective of the circumstances that caused the total shareholding to be or become lower than 32.6%.\n\nDuring 2021, two transactions were concluded between Aegon/uni00A0N.V. and Vereniging Aegon. Execution of these transactions was done in compliance with all requirements of Best Practice 2.7.5 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\nOn December 15, 2021, Aegon/uni00A0N.V. repurchased 22,643,360 common shares B from Vereniging Aegon for the amount of EUR/uni00A02,285,621 based on 1/40 th of the Value Weight Average Price of the common shares of the five trading days preceding this transaction. The repurchase of common shares B was executed to align the aggregate holding of voting shares by Vereniging Aegon in Aegon/uni00A0N.V. with its special cause voting rights of 32.6%.\n\nOn June 3, 2021, Vereniging Aegon exercised its option rights to purchase in aggregate 1,983,360 common shares B at fair value (1/40 th of the market value of a/uni00A0common share in the capital of the Company at the time of issuance) to mitigate dilution caused by Aegon's issuance of shares on June 3, 2021 in connection with the Long Term Incentive Plans for senior management.\n\n## Special control rights\n\nAs a/uni00A0matter of Dutch corporate law, the common shares and the common shares B offer equal full voting rights, as they have equal nominal value (EUR/uni00A00.12). The Voting Rights Agreement entered into between Vereniging Aegon and Aegon provides that under normal circumstances, i.e. except in the event of a/uni00A0Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon is not allowed to exercise more votes than is proportionate to the financial rights represented by its shares. This means that in the absence of a/uni00A0Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon may cast one vote for every common share it holds and one vote only for every 40 common shares B it holds. In the event of a/uni00A0Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon may cast one vote for every common share and one vote for every common share B.\n\nA Special Cause may include:\n\n- \u00b7 The acquisition by a/uni00A0third party of an interest in Aegon/uni00A0N.V. amounting to 15% or more;\n- \u00b7 A tender offer for Aegon/uni00A0N.V. shares; or\n- \u00b7 A proposed business combination by any person or group of persons, whether acting individually or as a/uni00A0group, other than in a/uni00A0transaction approved by the Company's Executive and Supervisory Boards.\n\nIf Vereniging Aegon, acting at its sole discretion, determines that a/uni00A0Special Cause has arisen, it must notify the General Meeting of Shareholders. In this event, Vereniging Aegon retains full voting rights on its common shares B for a/uni00A0period limited to six months. Vereniging Aegon would, for that limited period, command 32.6% of the votes at a/uni00A0General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nBased on the Voting Rights Agreement, Vereniging Aegon has a/uni00A0right to, at its own discretion, take the decision to exercise its full voting rights on common shares B. Vereniging Aegon may exercise this right unilaterally and independent of Aegon/uni00A0N.V., and therefore also irrespective of any decisions of the Executive Board of Aegon/uni00A0N.V., including any decision whether or not to invoke a/uni00A0180 or 250 day response time under the Dutch Corporate Governance Code or Civil Code.\n\n## Issue and repurchase of shares\n\nNew shares may be issued up to the maximum of the Company's authorized capital, following a/uni00A0resolution adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders. Shares may also be issued following a/uni00A0resolution of the Executive Board, subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, providing, and to the extent that, the Board has been authorized to do so by the General Meeting of Shareholders.

Common shares B can only be transferred with the prior approval of Aegon's Supervisory Board.\n\nAegon has no knowledge of any agreement between shareholders that might restrict the transfer of shares or the voting rights pertaining to them.\n\n## Significant agreements and potential change of control\n\nAegon is not party to any significant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate as a/uni00A0result of a/uni00A0change of control following a/uni00A0public offer for the outstanding shares of the Company, other than those customary in financial markets (for example, financial arrangements, loans and joint venture agreements).\n\n## Share plan\n\nSenior executives at Aegon companies and some other employees are entitled to variable compensation of which part is/uni00A0granted in the form of shares. For further details, please see the Remuneration Report on page 55 and note 50 of the notes to Aegon's consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report.

These nominations are binding providing at least two candidates are nominated. The General Meeting of Shareholders may cancel the binding nature of these nominations with a/uni00A0majority of two-thirds of votes cast, representing at least one half of Aegon's issued capital. The General Meeting may, in addition, bring forward a/uni00A0resolution to appoint someone not nominated by the Supervisory Board. In order for the resolution to be adopted, the resolution requires a/uni00A0two-thirds majority of votes cast, representing at least one half of Aegon's issued capital.\n\nMembers of Aegon's Supervisory and Executive Boards may be suspended or dismissed by the General Meeting of Shareholders with a/uni00A0two-thirds majority of votes cast, representing at least one half of Aegon's issued capital,\n\nunless the suspension or dismissal has first been proposed by the Company's Supervisory Board in which case the suspension or dismissal can be resolved by the General Meeting of Shareholders with an absolute majority of votes and a/uni00A0limited quorum. A member of the Executive Board may also be suspended by the Supervisory Board, although the General Meeting of Shareholders has the power to annul this suspension.\n\n## Amending the Articles of Association\n\nThe General Meeting of Shareholders may, with an absolute majority of votes cast, pass a/uni00A0resolution to amend Aegon's Articles of Association or to dissolve the Company, in accordance with a/uni00A0proposal made by the Executive Board and approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nAs a/uni00A0company based in the Netherlands, Aegon adheres to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The version of the code applicable to the financial year 2021 is the version that came into force on January 1, 2017. Aegon endorses the Code and strongly supports its principles for sound and responsible corporate governance and long-term value creation. Aegon regards the Code as an effective means to help ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are duly represented and taken into account. It is the responsibility of both the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board to oversee Aegon's overall corporate governance structure.\n\nIn general, Aegon applies the best practice provisions set out in the Code. There is one best practice provision with which Aegon does not fully apply. In this case, Aegon adheres, as much as is possible, to the spirit of the Code.\n\n## Best Practice 4.3.3\n\nThe Dutch Corporate Governance Code recommends that the General Meeting of Shareholders may cancel the binding nature of nominations for appointments of members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board with an absolute majority of votes and a/uni00A0limited quorum.\n\n## Aegon's position on Best Practice 4.3.3\n\nAegon's Articles of Association provide for a/uni00A0larger majority and a/uni00A0higher quorum than those advocated by the Code. Given that the Company has no specific anti-takeover measures, the current system is deemed appropriate within the context of the 1983 Merger Agreement under which Aegon was formed. However, to mitigate any possible negative effects stemming from this, the Supervisory Board has decided that, in the absence of any hostile action, it will only make nominations for the appointment of members to the Executive and Supervisory Boards that are non-binding in nature.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nFor an extensive review of Aegon's compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, please refer to the Corporate Governance Statement on Aegon's corporate website.",

Regular Board meetings were preceded or followed by meetings attended only by members of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board held meetings without Executive Board or Management Board members present.\n\n## Highlights and activities\n\nKey topics discussed during the 2021 Supervisory Board meetings were Aegon's quarterly results and annual reporting, Aegon's strategy, the main business risks, IT, regulatory developments, acquisitions and divestments, human resources items, the approach to sustainability and responsible investments, and the ongoing COVID-19 developments.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly and actively discussed the long-term value creation strategy and transformation with the Executive Board and the Management Board, and closely monitored its execution, the risks involved in its execution, and any opportunities to further enhance the strategy.

Plans and projects were discussed during executive sessions and in regular meetings,\n\ntogether with the strategic focus for all operating segments. Focus areas included, amongst others, building and maintaining clear strategic focus, the improvement of the operational performance - including the further reduction of addressable expenses, building strength in Strategic Assets, realizing growth, reducing the risk profile and the further strengthening of the balance sheet. The Supervisory Board monitors the implementation of the strategy by discussing the progress, risks, opportunities, and achievements on a quarterly basis with the regional CEOs and the Executive Board. Also, the progress is reflected in the regular risk reports, the HR updates, and the financial reporting. The Supervisory Board was informed about the annual Global Employee Survey, which was conducted at the end of 2021. The Supervisory Board discussed the outcome of this survey in detail in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAcquisitions and divestments were regularly discussed in the context of the execution of the strategy. The Supervisory Board supports the active management of the business portfolio, including acquisitions, the sale of underperforming businesses, and the disposal of entities no longer consistent with Aegon's strategy. During the year, the Board discussed various M&A and balance sheet transactions, including but not limited to the completion of the divestment of Stonebridge, the UK-based provider of accident insurance products, developments in relation to the sale of the Central Eastern European business to Vienna Insurance Group AG, the sale of the US portfolio of fintech and insurtech companies, the wind down of the Irish corporate insurance entity, the reinsurance of part of the longevity risk in the Netherlands, and management actions to release capital and increase the predictability of capital generation from the US variable annuity business.",

Developments were regularly discussed during the Supervisory Board meetings. In 2021, and on the request of the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board received an educational session on developments in the sustainability landscape. Through its Nomination and Governance Committee, the Supervisory Board is advised and kept apprised of business and regulatory developments in this area. The Supervisory Board is supportive of Aegon's approach to sustainability, and sustainability topics will receive ongoing attention from the Supervisory Board. This includes, amongst others, overseeing the progress made on the sustainability agenda, discussing the further development of related non-financial controls, and overseeing the progress on the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance commitments.\n\n## Legal, compliance and regulatory affairs\n\nIn 2021, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee discussed compliance, regulatory and legal topics relating to the Americas, Europe, UK, Asia, and Asset Management with management, the General Counsel, the Global Head of Compliance and the Global Head of Operational and Model Risk.

        "page_content": "outside Aegon. Also, the Board took notice of the trending topics provided in the reports of the external auditor. These topics included, for example, reporting on non-financial information, the approach to sustainability, trends in the US Insurtech, climate related financial disclosures, risks for the insurance industry, and the impact of IFRS 17 transformation projects. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board and Executive Board members were included in all staff training, such as the Code of Conduct and Speak up awareness exercises.\n\n## Focus items for 2022\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board will, amongst others, focus on the further developments related to the Financial and Strategic Assets, and the management actions that support the long-term value creation. Given the fast-moving IT environment, in particular the areas of information security and cybersecurity, will receive additional attention this year. Furthermore, the Board will closely follow the developments related to the reporting of non-financial information, which includes sustainability reporting. Regulatory developments, risk, and compliance will receive appropriate attention. Through/uni00A0the Audit Committee, the Board will also closely follow the developments regarding the implementation of IFRS 17. Other items that will receive special attention in 2022 are cultural change and the wellbeing of employees.\n\n## Board review\n\nThe Supervisory Board undertakes an internal review of Board effectiveness on an annual basis. An external assessment takes place every three to four years. The 2021 (internal) assessment was based on a survey completed by Supervisory Board members and Management Board members, as well as interviews with all Supervisory Board members. The Board reviewed and assessed how the Board functions as a whole, the composition of the Board, the quality of information presented to the Board, the functioning of its Committees, and the interaction of the Board with the Executive and Management Board. The results of the assessment were discussed in February 2022, and the Supervisory Board will act on the observations and recommendations that were listed in the assessment report (e.g. organizing educational sessions in line with further education needs, addressing the identified focus areas of supervisors, and following up on further improvement of meeting materials).\n\nOutside the presence of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board reviewed the performance (results) of the individual members of the Executive Board and Management Board over the preceding calendar year in February 2022. In addition, the Executive Board evaluated its own functioning as a/uni00A0whole and that of the individual Executive Board members as well. The performance of the members of the Executive and Management Boards was also discussed regularly during the year. During these reviews, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board also identified areas for which Board members -/uni00A0or the Board as a/uni00A0whole - could require training or education.\n\n## Supervisory Board Committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has four Committees that report into the Supervisory Board meetings. Supervisory Board members receive all minutes of the Committee meetings, and the Board discusses the items reported by the Committees.\n\nThe four Committees are the:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 Nomination and Governance Committee; and\n- \u00b7 Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe Risk Committee is responsible for supervising the activities with respect to the Company's enterprise risk management framework and internal control systems. The Audit Committee primarily relies on oversight and advice from the Risk Committee for these topics, which is in line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\nThe Committee confirmed that all of its members qualified as independent according to Rule 10A-3 of the SEC. The Chair of the Audit Committee qualifies as a/uni00A0financial expert according to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States and the competence in accounting and auditing according to the Audit Committee Decree 2016 ('Besluit instelling auditcommissie'), section 2(3).\n\n## Role and responsibilities\n\nAs Aegon has both an Audit Committee and a/uni00A0Risk Committee, the risk management responsibilities outlined in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code are assigned to the Risk Committee. With regard to the oversight of the operation of the risk management framework and risk control systems, including supervising the enforcement of relevant legislation and regulations, the Audit Committee operates in close coordination with the Risk Committee. Certain Board members participate in both committees and a/uni00A0combined meeting of the Audit and Risk Committees is scheduled on an annual basis.\n\nThe main role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to assist and advise the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding:\n\n- \u00b7 The integrity of the consolidated quarterly, half-yearly and full-year financial statements and financial reporting processes;\n- \u00b7 Internal control systems and the effectiveness of the internal audit process; and\n- \u00b7 The performance of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the external audit process, including monitoring the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.",

The Company's risk management is an important topic for the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Risk Committee works closely with the Audit Committee. One/uni00A0combined meeting was held in December 2021. The combined meeting focused on the 2022 global risk plan, model validation, information security, cloud governance and controls, and system of governance.\n\nFor more information about the functioning of the Risk Committee, please see the Risk Committee Charter on aegon.com.\n\n## Committee meetings attendance\n\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Risk Officer attended all the Committee meetings. The Chief Financial Officer assumed the Management Board responsibilities for Risk Management (on an interim basis) as per June 15, supported by the Head of Operational & Model Risk management.

The Committee also reviewed the composition of the Management Board and was informed - and consulted on - the succession of multiple Management Board vacancies, and on certain/uni00A0appointments of key management.\n\nThe Committee was also kept apprised of major organizational changes, developments in employee engagement, and talent management. The Committee was thereby informed about the annual Global Employee Survey, which was conducted at the end of 2021.\n\nFurther to the activities mentioned above, the Nomination and Governance Committee discussed senior management team developments and governance matters and structures, also in relation to the material business units and functions.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee also reviewed the important outside board positions of the members of the Management and Supervisory Boards and discussed specific appointments to important outside board positions where applicable.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability and ESG were a regular agenda topic in Committee meetings. In 2021, the Committee was kept apprised of regulatory and business developments in this area and discussed at length the regulatory framework and reporting standards as being developed in both Europe and the US, and the impact thereof on Aegon. In consultation with the Committee, an ESG roadshow was held in December 2021 and January 2022, during which input was gathered by the Head of Sustainability and the Head of Investor Relations from stakeholders on Aegon's sustainability approach. As part of such ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, the feedback from shareholders, proxy advisors, and interest groups was discussed with the Committee.\n\nThe Committee discussed and supported Aegon's approach to sustainability, and in particular the commitment to join the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a/uni00A0UN-convened group\n\nof institutional investors committed to transitioning their portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Supervisory Board was advised by the Committee accordingly.\n\n## Diversity\n\nEnhancing diversity in the Executive, Management and Supervisory Boards is an important goal for Aegon. Selection and appointment are based on expertise, skills and relevant experience, and the Supervisory Board takes diversity into account with a/uni00A0view to achieving its aim of having a/uni00A0balanced Supervisory, Executive and Management Board composition.\n\nIn 2017, the Supervisory Board adopted a/uni00A0diversity policy for the Executive, Management and Supervisory Boards. The purpose of the diversity policy is to have a/uni00A0more balanced and diverse composition of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board, and the Management Board in terms of nationality, age, gender and educational, professional, and geographical background and experience of the individual members. The Committee strives to have at least 30% female and male representation in the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board, and the Management Board.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee discussed the New Act on Diversity aimed at improving gender diversity in (boards of) Dutch companies and will review the implementation thereof within Aegon.\n\nIn the current Supervisory Board composition, there are three female members out of eight members in total (meeting the requirement under Dutch law that at least one third of the Supervisory Board positions should be filled by women and at least one third by men). With the appointment of a/uni00A0new Chief Risk Officer as of March 1, 2022 and the appointment of the new Chief Technology Officer (as of February 7, 2022), there are four female members out of twelve Management Board members in total (- achieving the minimum female presentation that Aegon strives for in the Management Board).\n\nWhen identifying candidates for open positions in the Executive and Supervisory Boards, the Committee actively searches for female candidates. It also instructs external search firms to present female candidates. More information on diversity within the Board is available in the Supervisory Board Composition and Competency overview and in Chapter 7 (Diversity) of the Corporate Governance Statement - as published on aegon.com.\n\n## The Remuneration Committee\n\n## Role and responsibilities\n\nThe main role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are to advise the Supervisory Board and prepare decisions to be taken by the Supervisory Board. The Committee is designated to safeguard sound remuneration policies and practices within the Company by overseeing the development and execution of these policies and practices.

Noteboom and was approved by the Supervisory Board. In the first chapter, the Remuneration Committee presents an overview of the business and remuneration highlights in 2021 and a/uni00A0look ahead to 2022. This is followed by chapter two which contains a/uni00A0general introduction to remuneration at Aegon. The third chapter is the 2021 Supervisory Board Remuneration Report, which contains a/uni00A0summary of the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy that was applicable in 2021 and the Supervisory Board remuneration over the recent years. In chapter four, the 2021 Executive Board Remuneration Report provides a/uni00A0summary of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy that was applicable in 2021, the Executive Board remuneration over the recent years and the 2022 Executive Board performance indicators.\n\n## 1. Business and remuneration highlights\n\nThis chapter presents an overview of the business and remuneration highlights in 2021 and a/uni00A0look ahead to 2022.\n\n## 2021 Business highlights\n\nIn 2021, Aegon demonstrated solid progress against its strategic and financial objectives. The measures that Aegon has taken to improve its operational performance and reduce its risk profile, together with support from favorable markets, resulted in free cash flows of EUR 729 million for the full year 2021, well ahead of the previous guidance. The operating result for 2021 amounted to EUR 1,906 million, an increase of 11% compared with last year as a consequence of business growth, expense savings, and favorable equity markets, despite a more adverse mortality result in the United States, which was driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, Aegon has executed 844 out of approximately 1,200 performance improvement initiatives, split between 649 expense initiatives and 195 growth initiatives. The/uni00A0expense savings initiatives drove a EUR 244 million reduction in addressable expenses in 2021 compared with the base year 2019. Aegon's growth initiatives are aimed at improving customer service, enhancing user experience, and developing new products. These growth initiatives contributed EUR 115 million to the operating result in 2021. The increase of the market consistent value of new business from EUR 262 million in 2020 to EUR 538 million in 2021 was mainly driven by the Unites States due to increasing sales in Life and the decision to stop selling variable annuities with significant interest rate sensitive riders.\n\n| Business performance highlights                                 | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Free cash flows (in EUR/uni00A0million)                         | 729    | 530    |\n| Operating result (in EUR/uni00A0million)                        | 1,906  | 1,710  |\n| Addressable expenses (in EUR/uni00A0million)                    | 2,903  | 2,986  |\n| Market consistent value of new business (in EUR/uni00A0million) | 538    | 262    |\n\n## 2021 Remuneration highlights\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 3, 2021, shareholders were asked to cast an advisory vote on the Remuneration Report for the second time. The 2020 Remuneration Report was approved with 97.99% of the votes cast, which was a/uni00A0significant increase compared to 2019 (83.79%). Following feedback from several large shareholders regarding the 2019 report, the 2020 report included more information in the remuneration highlight section and more information was disclosed on the calculation of variable compensation for the Executive Board in chapter four. Aegon continued with shareholder engagement regarding the remuneration report and made a/uni00A0few updates to this report to make it more concise and easier to read.\n\nIn 2021 Aegon paid out EUR/uni00A0168/uni00A0million in variable compensation and 22 employees received EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million or more in total annual compensation (i.e. the sum of fixed compensation, variable compensation and pension contributions paid in 2021). These employees worked for Aegon's Corporate Center, Aegon Americas, Aegon UK and Aegon Asset Management.\n\nFor the period during which the individual served as Executive Board member in 2021, Mr./uni00A0Friese received EUR/uni00A01,485,000 in fixed compensation (2020: EUR/uni00A0931,071 for 7.5 months) and Mr./uni00A0Rider received EUR/uni00A0968,394 (2020: EUR/uni00A0940,950). For Mr./uni00A0Rider this included a/uni00A05% increase per June 2021. Mr./uni00A0Friese's fixed compensation level was not changed during 2021. For that same period, Mr./uni00A0Friese was allocated EUR/uni00A03.5/uni00A0million in total compensation (2020: EUR/uni00A02.0/uni00A0million for 7.5 months) and Mr./uni00A0Rider EUR/uni00A02.3/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A02.0/uni00A0million).",

        "page_content": "The 2021 CEO pay ratio was 28.0 (2020: 32.2, 2019: 32.8). This/uni00A0ratio was based on the EU-IFRS remuneration expenses for Mr./uni00A0Friese and for Aegon's employees in 2021, which have been audited. The annual expenses for Mr./uni00A0Friese's total compensation were EUR 2.9/uni00A0million (2020: EUR 3.5/uni00A0million). The average expenses for the employees' total compensation were EUR 105 thousand (2020: EUR 110 thousand), which were calculated by:\n\n- \u00b7 The total EU-IFRS remuneration expenses for all employees, which are the total employee expenses (see Note 14) minus the CEO remuneration expenses: EUR 1.897/uni00A0million EUR 2.9/uni00A0million = EUR 1.894/uni00A0million.\n- \u00b7 Divided by the number of employees in scope, which are the total number of employees minus employees in joint ventures and associates (as their expenses are not included in Note 14 given the partial consolidation for these businesses) and minus the CEO: 22,271 - 4,228 - 1 = 18,043 employees.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee took note that certain factors have influenced the CEO pay ratio. Last year, Mr. Friese's annualized annual remuneration expenses were higher because these included EUR 0.9 million for his sign-on arrangement, while these expenses were EUR 0.1 million in 2021. As a result of our company-wide transformation program, we have seen a combination of reductions, shifts and increases in our workforce. Because the CEO pay ratio is influenced by a constantly changing international employee population, with the majority of employees based outside the Netherlands, the Committee does not have a preferred ratio. Instead, all compensation within Aegon (including for the Executive Board members) should be in line with the relevant internal and external references for the relative weight of/uni00A0the position, its responsibilities and characteristics as well as the employee's qualifications, experience, and performance.\n\n## Looking ahead to 2022\n\nIn accordance with the Supervisory Board remuneration policy, the fees for the Supervisory Board members have been indexed with 5% per January 2022, in response to the economic developments in the last three years (2019-2021). The last change to these fees was in January 2019.\n\nIn accordance with the Executive Board remuneration policy, Mr./uni00A0Friese's fixed compensation has been increased by 5% per January 2022 from EUR/uni00A01,485,000 to EUR/uni00A01,559,250. The increase will keep Mr./uni00A0Friese aligned with internal and external compensation levels, economic developments (e.g. inflation) and changes to the compensation levels of other senior managers within Europe and in the Netherlands. There are no changes foreseen to the compensation package of Mr./uni00A0Rider in 2022.\n\nAegon will monitor the development of rules, regulations and guidance that could affect Aegon's remuneration policies. This includes the finalization of the European Committee's guidelines on the standardized presentation of the remuneration report.\n\n## 2. Remuneration at Aegon in general\n\nThis chapter contains a/uni00A0general introduction to Aegon's Global Remuneration Framework, Human Resources Strategy, Remuneration Principles, the concepts of total compensation and variable compensation, Risk Management in relation to remuneration and remuneration of Material Risk Takers.\n\n## Global Remuneration Framework\n\nAegon's Global Remuneration Framework (GRF) outlines the Aegon Group Human Resources Strategy, the Aegon Group Remuneration Principles and the Aegon Group Remuneration Guidelines, which apply to all Aegon employees, including the Executive Board members. The GRF has been designed in accordance with relevant rules, guidelines, and interpretations, such as the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Solvency II Legal Framework.\n\nAegon's remuneration policies are derived from the GRF, which includes the Executive Board Remuneration Policy and local business Remuneration Policies. These policies define specific terms and conditions for the employment of Aegon's employees across the various countries and local businesses. All steps in the remuneration process are governed by the GRF and its underlying policies. Staff from Human Resources, Risk Management and Compliance are involved in all steps of the process.\n\n## Human Resources Strategy\n\nIn order to support the Aegon Strategy and local business objectives, the Aegon Group Human Resources Strategy contains the following remuneration-related goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Attract, retain, motivate, and reward a/uni00A0highly qualified and diverse workforce;\n- \u00b7 Align the interests of executives, managers and all other employees with the business strategy and risk tolerance, the values and the long-term interests of Aegon;\n- \u00b7 Provide a/uni00A0well-balanced and performance-related compensation package to all employees, taking into account shareholder and other stakeholder interests, relevant regulations, the corporate responsibilities and Aegon's purpose, values and behaviors.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Principles\n\nBased on the Human Resources Strategy, Aegon has formulated the following Remuneration Principles, which are the foundation for all remuneration policies and practices within the Group. Aegon's remuneration is:\n\n- \u00b7 employee-oriented by fostering a/uni00A0sense of value and appreciation in each individual employee; promoting the short- and long-term interests and well-being of Aegon's employees through fair compensation and supporting the career development and mobility of employees;\n- \u00b7 performance-related by establishing a/uni00A0clear link between pay and performance by aligning objectives and target setting with performance evaluation and remuneration, reflecting individual as well as collective performance in line with Aegon's long-term interests;\n- \u00b7 fairness-driven by promoting fairness and consistency in Aegon's remuneration policies and practices, avoiding discrimination, and by providing total compensation packages in line with an appropriately established peer group at a/uni00A0country and/or functional level; and\n- \u00b7 risk-prudent (see Risk Management in relation to Remuneration below).\n\n## Risk Management in relation to Remuneration\n\nRemuneration, and specifically variable compensation, may have an impact on risk-taking behaviors of employees and, as such, may undermine effective risk management. The GRF therefore includes additional remuneration rules for Executive Board members, Material Risk Takers and Control Staff, as their roles and responsibilities require tailored risk mitigating measures and governance processes. These rules include mandatory ex-ante and ex-post risk assessments and related malus and claw-back provisions.\n\nBoth the Risk Management and Compliance functions are involved in the design and execution of Aegon's GRF and remuneration policies, such as reviewing proposed updates to the GRF and remuneration policies, reviewing the selection of Material Risk Takers and executing various risk mitigating measures during the compensation cycle (when the targets are set, before a/uni00A0variable compensation award is allocated, before and after deferred variable compensation is paid).\n\n## Remuneration of Material Risk Takers\n\nAegon selects Group Material Risk Takers for the Aegon/uni00A0N.V. legal entity (i.e. the holding company) based on the Solvency II selection criteria. These positions are defined as 'the administrative, management or supervisory body, persons who effectively run the undertaking or have other key functions and other categories of staff whose professional activities have a/uni00A0material impact on the undertaking's risk profile'.\n\nAdditionally, legal entities within the Group that are directly subject to the Capital Requirements Directive, Solvency Directive, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and/ or the Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive, select their own Local Material Risk in accordance with the applicable European Directive, its guidelines, and local regulatory requirements (where available).\n\nThe Group and Local Material Risk Takers are subsequently subject to remuneration rules outlined in the applicable European Directive, its guidelines and local regulatory requirements (where available), such as:\n\n- \u00b7 a minimum portion of variable compensation must be deferred and paid in non-cash instruments.\n- \u00b7 the employee's individual goals are subject to an ex-ante risk assessment when they are set, which may lead to adjustments thereof.\n- \u00b7 before variable compensation is allocated and before deferred variable compensation is paid out (vests), it is subject to an ex-ante and ex-post risk assessment respectively, which may result in a/uni00A0downward adjustment (malus).\n- \u00b7 once variable compensation is paid out / has vested, it may be subject to a/uni00A0claw-back provision.\n\n## Total compensation\n\nFollowing from the Remuneration Principles, Aegon aims to offer experienced and competent employees a/uni00A0total compensation level which is consistent with the market in which Aegon operates and competes for similar talent. Total compensation typically consists of fixed compensation, variable compensation (where in line with the local market practice), pension and other benefits. Market survey information from reputable sources is used to regularly assess the competitiveness of compensation levels and practices which Aegon offers its employees.\n\n## Variable compensation\n\nVariable compensation, if any, is capped at an appropriate level as a/uni00A0percentage of fixed compensation. For senior management, variable compensation is usually paid out in upfront cash and deferred Aegon shares and is subject to malus and claw-back provisions. In accordance with the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, Aegon offered its Corporate Center employees variable compensation up to 100% of fixed compensation in 2021 and continued to comply with the related requirement that least 75% of its employees within the entire Group were employed outside the Netherlands. Aegon also obtained shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of May 20, 2016, to offer variable compensation up to 200% of fixed compensation to selected senior employees outside Europe in positions that, based on local market practice, could receive variable compensation that exceeds 100% of fixed compensation./uni00A0Aegon's capital was not adversely impacted by the maximum variable compensation that could be paid out.",

        "page_content": "## 3. 2021 Supervisory Board Remuneration Report\n\nThe 2021 Supervisory Board Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the Dutch Civil Code/uni00A0(article art 2:135b) and the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The Remuneration Committee was led by the Committee's Chairman Ben J. Noteboom. This report was approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThis report contains a/uni00A0summary of the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy which applied to 2021 and the Supervisory Board remuneration over the recent years.\n\nAegon's Supervisory Board remuneration is subject to various rules and regulations, including the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Solvency II Legal Framework.\n\n## Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy in 2021\n\nAegon's Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy is aimed at ensuring fair compensation and protecting the independence of the Supervisory Board members. The Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy that has been applied in 2021 was adopted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020. This policy will be subject to annual reviews by the Supervisory Board. The policy remains in place until a/uni00A0new or revised policy has been adopted by the shareholders in accordance with the applicable requirements from the Dutch Civil Code. The Supervisory Board will submit a/uni00A0proposal to the shareholders to adopt a/uni00A0policy at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders at least every four years.\n\nThe policy contributes to Aegon's strategy, long-term interests, and sustainability through the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members in various ways:\n\n- \u00b7 The policy provides the Supervisory Board with the means to attract, motivate, and retain competent, diverse, and experienced Supervisory Board members for the long-term. This is essential for executing Aegon's strategy and safeguarding and promoting its long-term interests and sustainability.\n- \u00b7 Supervisory Board members receive fixed remuneration for their responsibilities which does not depend on the Aegon results in order to protect their independence when supervising the manner in which the Executive Board members implement the long-term value creation strategy. These responsibilities are part of the membership of the Supervisory Board and its Committees and the position of (Vice) Chairman of the Supervisory Board and/or its Committees. The certainty of the fixed compensation also allows Supervisory Board members in their supervisory role to focus on the long-term interest and sustainability of Aegon.\n- \u00b7 The Supervisory Board members receive fixed remuneration for their activities, such as attending Committee meetings and additional Supervisory Board meetings, in order to regularly discuss the Aegon strategy, the implementation of the strategy and the principal risks associated with it, while taking into account the broader long-term interests and sustainability of Aegon.\n\n- \u00b7 Supervisory Board members are only allowed to privately own Aegon/uni00A0N.V. Shares if this is a/uni00A0long-term investment, aligning their interests with Aegon's long-term interests.\n\nThe Supervisory Board took Aegon's identity, purpose, and values into account when developing the policy and its changes:\n\n- \u00b7 Aegon is an international financial services group based in the Netherlands, that provides life insurance, pensions, and asset management. The main operations are in the US, the Netherlands, and the UK, while there is also significant presence in Southern and Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The policy provides the Supervisory Board with the means to attract, motivate, and retain Supervisory Board members from various countries, predominantly based in the Netherlands and the US. As Aegon is based in the Netherlands, the policy considers the European Insurance peers as well as Dutch General Industry peers to be the relevant external reference for the Supervisory Board member's Remuneration. The policy is also influenced by the European and Dutch rules and regulations on (Executive) remuneration, which apply to Aegon as a/uni00A0result of its identity (i.e. being an Insurance firm in Europe and being a/uni00A0listed and financial company in the Netherlands).\n- \u00b7 In order to fulfill its company purpose, Aegon has a/uni00A0strategy to which this policy actively contributes (see above).\n- \u00b7 Aegon's company values aim to create a/uni00A0company that is fit for the future: one that meets customers' expectations, is right for a/uni00A0digitally-connected, data-driven world, and can adapt quickly to changing market conditions. These values are not explicitly reflected in the policy as a/uni00A0result of the fee-based remuneration structure. However, these values are strongly incorporated in the Supervisory Board Charter.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has not taken the compensation structures and levels at Aegon into account as the fee-based compensation structure for Supervisory Board members differs significantly from the Aegon compensation structures and levels.\n\nThe Supervisory Board members are entitled to the following fees (see also the table below):\n\n- \u00b7 A base fee for membership of the Supervisory Board. No separate attendance fees are paid to members for attendance at the regular Supervisory Board meetings;\n- \u00b7 An attendance fee for each extra Board meeting attended, be it in person or by video and/or telephone conference;\n- \u00b7 A committee fee for members on each of the Supervisory Board's Committees;\n- \u00b7 An attendance fee for each Committee meeting attended, be it in person or through video and/or telephone conference; and\n- \u00b7 An additional fee for attending meetings that require intercontinental, continental or US interstate travel between the Supervisory Board member's home location and the meeting location.",

Each quarter Aegon pays the fees that the Supervisory Board members earned during that period. Where required, Aegon pays the employer social security contributions in the home country of the Supervisory Board member. The employee social security contributions in the home country, if any, are paid by the Supervisory Board member. The Supervisory Board is allowed to annually index the fees for economic developments in the Netherlands, however the fees have not been indexed in 2021.\n\nThe Supervisory Board members do not receive any performance or equity-related compensation, and do not accrue pension rights with Aegon. These measures are designed to ensure the independence of Supervisory Board members and to strengthen the overall effectiveness of Aegon's corporate governance.\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly assesses the competitiveness of the Supervisory Board's remuneration structure and levels against peer companies with data provided by Willis Towers Watson. For this purpose, the Supervisory Board selected a/uni00A0primary set of peer group companies according to the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Industry: Insurance, with a/uni00A0preference for Life Insurance;\n- \u00b7 Size: Average Market Capitalization, Employees, Revenue and Total Assets;\n- \u00b7 Geographic scope: Preferably companies that operate globally; and\n- \u00b7 Location: Headquarters based in Europe, excluding UK (because the non-executive directors typically have different responsibilities compared to their continental European counterparts).\n\nBased on these criteria the current peer group consists of the following 16 European Insurance companies: Ageas, Assicurazioni Generali, CNP Assurances, Hannover Rueck, Helvetia, Mapfre, M\u00fcnchener RE, NN Group, Poste Italiane,\n\nSampo, Scor, Swiss Life, Swiss Re, Talanx, Vienna Insurance Group and Zurich Insurance Group. This peer group differs from the European peer group for the Executive Board as a/uni00A0result of excluding the UK companies. The peer group is reviewed each year and may be updated accordingly. The last update of this peer group was in 2022, when the peer group size was increased from 12 to 16 (creating a/uni00A0more balanced selection), Hannover Rueck, Helvetia, Poste Italiane, Sampo, Scor and Vienna Insurance Group were added, and Allianz and AXA were removed.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board selects a/uni00A0secondary peer group according to the following criteria, in order to monitor alignment with the General Industry in the Netherlands:\n\n- \u00b7 Industry: General Industry and listed on the AEX;\n- \u00b7 Size: Average Market Capitalization, Employees, Revenue and Total Assets;\n- \u00b7 Location: Headquarters based in the Netherlands.\n\nBased on these criteria, the current secondary peer group consists of the following 12 AEX companies: Akzo Nobel, Ahold Delhaize, ASML, DSM, ING Group, Heineken, KPN, NN Group, Philips, Randstad, Signify and Wolters Kluwer. This peer group is also reviewed each year and was last updated in 2022 (replacing ABN AMRO by Signify). This peer group is identical to the Dutch peer group for the Executive Board.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may recommend changes to the fee levels or structure of the Supervisory Board members, based on the results of a/uni00A0competitiveness review and economic developments in the Netherlands. Such recommendations would be discussed by the Supervisory Board, which can support, revise or reject them. The Supervisory Board is allowed to annually index the fees for economic developments in the Netherlands. For any other change to the level or structure of the fees, the shareholders will be asked to adopt the proposed changes at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.",

The Remuneration Committee was led by the Committee's Chairman Ben J. Noteboom. This report was approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThis report contains a/uni00A0summary of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy that applied to 2021, the Executive Board remuneration over the recent years and the 2022 Executive Board performance indicators.\n\n## Executive Board Remuneration Policy in 2021\n\nThe Supervisory Board has the overall responsibility for Aegon's Remuneration Policies, including the Executive Board Remuneration Policy. The Executive Board Remuneration Policy that has been applied in 2021 was adopted at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020. This policy is subject to annual reviews by the Supervisory Board. The policy remains in place until a/uni00A0new or revised policy has been adopted by the shareholders in accordance with the applicable requirements from the Dutch Civil Code. The Supervisory Board will submit a/uni00A0proposal to the shareholders to adopt a/uni00A0policy at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders at least every four years.",

        "page_content": "The current policy contributes to Aegon's strategy, long-term interests and sustainability through the remuneration of the Executive Board members in various ways:\n\n- \u00b7 The policy provides the Supervisory Board with the means to attract, motivate and retain competent and experienced Executive Board members for the long-term. This is essential for executing Aegon's strategy and safeguarding and promoting its long-term interests and sustainability.\n- \u00b7 The leading performance indicator categories for successful execution of Aegon's strategy are Capital, Growth and Strategy. To support the execution of Aegon's strategy, the policy makes these performance indicator categories mandatory for the Executive Board member.\n- \u00b7 Aegon strives to create long-term value for its stakeholders and the communities in which it operates. Due to the nature of Aegon's business, value created is often financial, but it may also be social, economic, or environmental. The policy directly aligns Executive Board member's personal long-term interests with those of Aegon and its shareholders by paying a/uni00A0significant part of the Executive Board members' variable compensation (two-thirds) in shares, which must be held for 5 years after completion of the performance period. The pay-out in these restricted shares is combined with prohibiting Executive Board members using personal hedging strategies or insurance, which could undermine this long-term alignment of interests. Additionally, Executive Board members are aligned with the long-term interest of Aegon, its shareholders and other stakeholders through the use of mandatory performance indicator categories of Earnings, Shareholders and Other Stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Aegon is committed to doing business responsibly and in a/uni00A0sustainable way. Variable compensation of Executive Board members can be adjusted downwards (i.e. malus) or clawed-back in cases where certain performance has not been achieved in a/uni00A0sustainable way. This includes but is not limited to: significant risk and compliance incidents, insufficient response to such incidents and/or insufficient evidence of embedding of good standards of practice, such as sound and responsible business practices and integrity of products and services delivered. Additionally, the policy makes the performance indicator category Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), mandatory for Executive Board members to support this approach to doing business.\n\nAegon's Executive Board remuneration is subject to various rules and regulations, including the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Dutch Civil Code, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Solvency II Legal Framework. The most prominent requirements thereof are:\n\n- \u00b7 The total variable compensation amount that is allocated to an Executive Board member for a/uni00A0performance year cannot exceed 100% of the fixed compensation level.\n- \u00b7 Variable compensation should be based on a/uni00A0mix of Aegon and personal performance, with at least 50% weight on non-financial performance.\n\n- \u00b7 A substantial portion of any variable compensation award should be paid in a/uni00A0non-cash instrument (e.g. Aegon shares) and should be deferred for at least 3 years. Additionally, awarded shares should be restricted for 5 years. With a/uni00A03-year vesting period, this requires an additional holding period of 2-years.\n- \u00b7 Aegon can claw-back any variable compensation which has been paid (cash and shares) in specific circumstances such as a/uni00A0material financial restatement or individual gross misconduct./uni00A0\n\nThese are also the main reasons why Aegon operates one Executive Board variable compensation plan per year, with a/uni00A0single variable compensation award which is subsequently split into cash and shares, rather than operating separate Short-Term Incentive (cash) and Long-Term Incentive (share) Plans.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may recommend policy changes to the Supervisory Board. In that case, the Remuneration Committee will conduct scenario analyses to determine the long-term effects on the level and structure of compensation granted to each Executive Board member, and reports their findings to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board can subsequently decide on referring the proposed policy changes to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders for adoption.\n\nThe policy contains a/uni00A0temporary derogation clause, with rules which are in accordance with the Dutch Civil Code. This means derogation is only allowed in exceptional circumstances to serve the long-term interest and sustainability of Aegon or to assure its viability, for a/uni00A0limited period of time, when it stays in line with the general spirit of the policy and when the details are disclosed in the next remuneration report. This clause was not used in 2021.\n\n## Total compensation\n\nTotal compensation for Executive Board members is defined in the Executive Board Remuneration Policy as a/uni00A0combination of fixed compensation, variable compensation, pension and other benefits. The Supervisory Board determines and regularly reviews the appropriate selection of remuneration elements and their (maximum) remuneration level for Executive Board members to ensure the structure remains competitive and provides proper and risk-based incentives in line with Aegon's risk appetite. The fixed and variable compensation elements and their levels are reviewed at least once a/uni00A0year. The pension arrangements and other benefits and their levels are reviewed at least every four years. In its review, the Supervisory Board takes the specific role, responsibilities, experience and expertise of Executive Board members into account as well as internal and external reference information:\n\n- \u00b7 The internal references are the compensation structure and levels of the members of the Management Board of Aegon/uni00A0N.V. and the annual compensation changes of the general employee population and senior managers within Europe and the Netherlands specifically.",

The last update of this peer group was in 2022, when Helvetia, Poste Italiane, Scor and Vienna Insurance Group were added, and Allianz, AXA, Prudential and RSA Insurance Group were removed. This peer group differs from the European peer group for the Supervisory Board, as the latter excludes UK companies where non-executive directors typically have different responsibilities compared to their continental European counterparts.\n\nThe Dutch peer group was selected by the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Industry: General Industry and listed on the AEX;\n- \u00b7 Size: Average Market Capitalization, Employees, Revenue and Total Assets;\n- \u00b7 Location: Headquarters based in the Netherlands.\n\nBased on these criteria, this peer group consists of the following 12 AEX companies:, Akzo Nobel, Ahold Delhaize, ASML, DSM, ING Group, Heineken, KPN, NN Group, Philips, Randstad, Signify and Wolters Kluwer. This peer group is also reviewed each year and was last updated in 2022 (replacing ABN AMRO by Signify).\n\nThe Supervisory Board will review both peer groups annually and will amend them as necessary, within the above-mentioned selection criteria, to ensure they continue to provide a/uni00A0reliable basis for comparison. Any change to the peer group will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may recommend changes to the compensation levels of the Executive Board members in accordance with Remuneration Policy, based on the results\n\nof this annual total compensation review and on discussions with the Executive Board members regarding their remuneration level and structure. Such recommendations would subsequently be discussed by the Supervisory Board, which can approve, revise or reject them.\n\nThe Supervisory Board discussed and approved the 2021 total compensation for the Executive Board, after taking the Remuneration Committee's review into consideration.\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation for the Executive Board members is paid in monthly instalments. The policy allows the fixed compensation to be paid in cash and in shares. All Executive Board members received their 2021 fixed compensation in cash.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may offer permanent or temporary gross monthly fixed allowances when the Supervisory Board considers this an appropriate alternative for other remuneration elements.\n\n## Variable compensation\n\nExecutive Board members are eligible for variable compensation with a/uni00A0target level of 80% of the fixed compensation level (excluding allowances, if applicable), with a/uni00A0threshold level of 50% and a/uni00A0maximum opportunity of 100% of fixed compensation level.\n\nThe variable compensation award is based on performance against a/uni00A0set of performance indicators, weights and target levels that have been set by the Supervisory Board at the start of the performance year. The performance indicators contribute to Aegon's strategy, long-term interests and sustainability, within Aegon's risk tolerance and should comply with the following rules:\n\n- \u00b7 It contains a/uni00A0mix of financial and non-financial performance indicators, with at least 50% weight allocated to the non-financial performance indicators in accordance with article 1:118.3 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act;\n- \u00b7 The maximum weight for unadjusted financial indicators is determined by the Global Remuneration Framework and is currently set at 50%./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 It contains a/uni00A0mix of Aegon and personal performance indicators, which can range in weight between 50-80% and 20-50% respectively, depending on the Aegon priorities of the/uni00A0performance year.\n- \u00b7 At least 20% of the indicators has a/uni00A0retrospective 3-year performance horizon, while the remainder has a/uni00A01-year performance horizon;\n- \u00b7 The indicators should cover/uni00A0the following mandatory performance indicator categories: Shareholders, Capital, Earnings, Growth, Stakeholders, ESG and Strategy.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee and the Executive Board members prepare a/uni00A0proposal for the performance indicators, weights and target levels. These are subsequently reviewed by Aegon's Risk",

        "page_content": "Management team (i.e. the first ex-ante risk assessment) before the Supervisory Board approves these, to ensure that:\n\n- \u00b7 The performance indicators and weights are in line with the policy;\n- \u00b7 The financial performance indicators are consistent with the risk tolerance statements;\n- \u00b7 The non-financial performance indicators are consistent with risk tolerance levels, regulatory requirements, reasonable stakeholder expectations and are supporting sound and responsible business practices and integrity of the products and services delivered./uni00A0\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sends the proposal and the ex-ante risk assessment to the Supervisory Board, which can approve, revise or reject the proposal. After approval, the Executive Board members are granted their conditional variable compensation awards for the plan year. This conditional award equals their at target variable compensation level, split between 33.33% upfront cash and 66.67% deferred Aegon shares. The grant price for the shares is equal to the volume weighted average price on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange for the period December 15 to January 15 at the start of the plan year.\n\nAfter the completion of the performance period, the Remuneration Committee prepares a/uni00A0recommendation for the allocation of a/uni00A0variable compensation award to each Executive Board member. This recommendation is based on the actual performance results compared to target levels and takes a/uni00A0second ex-ante risk assessment by the Risk Management team into account. This risk assessment looks into whether there are reasons for a/uni00A0downward adjustment of the intended variable compensation award (malus) which were not take into account yet, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant risk or compliance incident(s);\n- \u00b7 Insufficient response to risk incident(s), compliance incident(s), regulatory fine(s) and/or insufficient execution of risk mitigating measures in response to these incidents;\n- \u00b7 Breaches of laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 Insufficient evidence of embedding good standards of practice;\n- \u00b7 Significant deficiencies or material weaknesses relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n- \u00b7 Reputation damage due to risk events.\n\nIn this assessment possible risk mitigating behaviors are also taken into account, such as remaining within risk limits, risk reduction, risk avoidance, risk transfer and risk response by the Executive Board member./uni00A0\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sends its recommendation and the second ex-ante risk assessment to the Supervisory Board, which can approve, revise or reject the recommendation. This Supervisory Board decision includes validating that, when taken together, the results of the performance indicators represent\n\na/uni00A0fair reflection of the overall performance of the Executive Board member over the performance year.\n\nThe allocated variable compensation award is subsequently split between 33.33% upfront cash (i.e. paid in the year following the performance year) and 66.67% deferred shares. These shares are deferred for a/uni00A03-year period after allocation after which they cliff-vest. Before vesting, the Risk Management team executes an ex-post risk assessment which looks into whether there are reasons for a/uni00A0downward adjustment of the originally allocated variable compensation award (malus) which were not taken into account yet. This risk assessment takes the same criteria into consideration as the second ex-ante risk assessment. Based on this assessment, the Remuneration Committee subsequently prepares a/uni00A0recommendation how to pay-out the deferred portion (i.e. unchanged or adjusted downward). The Remuneration Committee sends its recommendation and the ex-post risk assessment to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board can approve, revise or reject the recommendation./uni00A0\n\n## Claw-back provision\n\nAegon's Supervisory Board can claw-back variable compensation that has already been paid to the Executive Board member in case of a/uni00A0material financial restatement or individual gross misconduct, after considering a/uni00A0risk assessment by Aegon's Risk Management team which looks into whether in hindsight the paid amount should have been lower or nil. Examples of misconduct are, but not limited to, a/uni00A0significant breach of laws and/ or regulations, use of violence, either verbally or physically, involvement with fraud, corruption or bribery, significant issues due to evident dereliction of duty and/or discrimination of any kind (for example age or gender).\n\n## Pension arrangements\n\nThe Executive Board members are entitled to pension contributions that equal 40% of their fixed compensation level, which consists of the following three parts:/uni00A0\n\n- \u00b7 Participation in Aegon's defined contribution pension plan for NL-based employees, for their eligible earnings up to EUR 110,111 (2021 threshold set by Dutch law).\n- \u00b7 Participation in Aegon's defined contribution pension plan for NL-based employees, for their fixed income above EUR 110,111.\n- \u00b7 An additional gross allowance for pension to make the sum of these three pension contributions equal to 40% of their fixed compensation level.\n\nThe Executive Board members receive pension contributions that are somewhat higher compared to NL-based employees of similar age (ca. 10-15% difference). This is done to achieve a/uni00A0competitive total compensation level. Please note the Supervisory Board will consider discontinuing the additional gross allowance for new Executive Board members, while ensuring their total compensation level stays competitive, and including this as a/uni00A0policy change in the next update of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy.",

Additionally, Mr./uni00A0Friese and Mr./uni00A0Rider voluntarily agreed to a/uni00A0minimum shareholding requirement of 100% of their fixed compensation level, once they have reached that level. For this purpose, both vested and unvested shares that have\n\nbeen allocated as compensation will be included in the count, with the unvested share allocations valued at what they would be worth after tax. For the vested share allocations, this tax has already been deducted and paid. After the allocation of the 2021 variable compensation award, Mr./uni00A0Friese will hold 87% of his fixed compensation in shares and Mr./uni00A0Rider 124%, based on the share price on March 1, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nAs an insurance group, Aegon manages risk for the benefit of its customers and other stakeholders. The Company is exposed to a/uni00A0range of underwriting, operational and financial risks. Aegon's risk management and internal control systems are designed to ensure that these risks are managed effectively and efficiently in a/uni00A0way that is aligned with the Company's strategy.\n\nFor Aegon, risk management involves:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding risks that the Company faces;\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a/uni00A0group-wide framework through which the risk-return trade-off associated with these risks can be assessed;\n- \u00b7 Maintaining risk tolerances and supporting policies to limit exposure to a/uni00A0particular risk or combination of risks; and\n- \u00b7 Monitoring risk exposures and actively maintaining oversight of the Company's overall risk and solvency positions.\n\nThis section provides a/uni00A0description of Aegon's risk management framework.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework\n\nAegon's ERM framework is designed and applied to identify risks that may affect Aegon and manage individual and aggregate risks within Aegon's set risk tolerances. The ERM framework covers the ERM components as identified by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The ERM framework applies to all of Aegon's businesses for which it has operational control.\n\n## Risk strategy, risk appetite statement and risk/uni00A0tolerances\n\nThe setting of the risk strategy starts with the principle that taking a/uni00A0risk should be based on serving a/uni00A0customer's need. The competence to manage the risk is assessed and Aegon's risk preferences are formulated, taking into account Aegon's risk capacity. The process results in a/uni00A0targeted risk profile, reflecting the risks Aegon wants to keep on the balance sheet, and the risks Aegon would like to avoid.\n\nAegon's risk appetite statement and risk tolerances are established to assist management in carrying out Aegon's strategy within the boundaries of the resources available to Aegon. Aegon's risk appetite statement is to:\n\n## Risk category Description\n\n## Appetite\n\n'Fulfil our promises towards our customers and other stakeholders by delivering sustainable and growing long-term free cash flow through strong resilience in solvency and liquidity, with a/uni00A0healthy balance in exposures, and by running a/uni00A0responsible business with effective controls.'\n\nFollowing from the risk appetite statement, risk tolerances are defined on:\n\n- \u00b7 Solvency, including Cash Capital at Holding and capital generation, to ensure that Aegon remains solvent even under adverse scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity, to ensure that Aegon remains liquid even under extreme scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Risk balance, to ensure a/uni00A0healthy balance of risk exposures that supports delivering on our capital generation and return on capital targets.\n- \u00b7 Responsible business with effective controls, which acknowledges an acceptable level of operational risk and stresses a/uni00A0low tolerance for (lack of) actions which could lead to material adverse risk events that result in breaking promises or not meeting reasonable expectations of customers, legal breaches or reputational damage.\n\nThe tolerances are further developed into measures, thresholds and indicators that have to be complied with to remain within the tolerances.\n\n## Risk universe\n\nAegon's risk universe is structured to reflect the type of risks to which the Company is exposed. The identified risk categories are financial risk (e.g. interest rate risk and credit risk), underwriting risk (e.g. longevity and policyholder behavior), and operational risk/uni00A0(e.g. fraud, business disruption and non-financial risks, including sustainability risks like climate change). Specific risk types are identified within these risk categories. These risks, internal or external, may affect the Company's operations, earnings, share price, value of its investments, or the sale of certain products and services. In the context of Aegon's risk strategy, a/uni00A0risk appetite is set for the three identified risk categories (see table below).\n\n| Underwriting   | The risk of incurring losses when actual experience deviates from Aegon's best  estimate assumptions on mortality, longevity, morbidity, policyholder behavior,  P&C claims and expenses used to price products and establish technical  provisions.   | Medium to high - Underwriting risk is Aegon's  core business and meets customer needs.                                                          |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial      | The risk of incurring financial losses due to movements in financial markets and  the market value of balance sheet items. Elements of financial risk are credit  risk, investment risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.                         | Low to medium - Accepted where it meets  customer needs and the risk return profile is  acceptable.                                             |\n| Operational    | The risk of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and  controls, people and systems or from external events, such as processing errors,  legal and compliance issues, natural or man-made disasters, and cybercrime.           | Low - Accepted as a/uni00A0necessary condition of  conducting business, but mitigated as much as  possible in an economically efficient manner. |",

        "page_content": "## Risk identification and risk assessment\n\nAegon has identified a/uni00A0risk universe that captures all known material risks to which the Company is exposed. To assess all risks, Aegon maintains a/uni00A0documented, consistent methodology for measuring risks. The risk metrics are embedded in Aegon's key reports and are used for decision making.\n\n## Risk response\n\nAegon distinguishes the following risk responses:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk acceptance when the exposure is within the set risk tolerance; and\n- \u00b7 Risk control, transfer or avoidance when the exposure exceeds the established risk tolerance or if cost-benefit analysis supports further actions.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nRisks are monitored regularly and reported internally on at least a/uni00A0quarterly basis. The impact of key financial, underwriting, and operational risk drivers on earnings and capital is shown in the quarterly risk dashboards for the various risk types, both separately and on an aggregate basis.\n\nRisk exposures are compared with the measures and indicators as defined by Aegon's risk tolerance statements. Reporting also includes compliance and incident reporting. Finally, the main risks derived from Aegon's strategy and day-to-day business are discussed, as well as forward looking points for attention. If necessary, mitigating actions are taken and documented.\n\n## Risk control\n\nA system of effective controls is required to mitigate the risks identified. In Aegon's ERM framework, risk control includes risk governance, risk policies, internal control framework, model validation, risk embedding, risk culture and compliance.\n\n## Most significant risks\n\nThe most significant risks Aegon faces in terms of exposures and required capital are:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial markets risks (particularly related to credit, equity, and interest rates);\n- \u00b7 Underwriting risk (particularly related to longevity and policyholder behavior); and\n- \u00b7 Operational risks (particularly related to reputation and continuity of operations).\n\n## Description of risk types Financial risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of economic loss due to the deterioration in the financial condition of counterparties, either through fair value losses on traded securities or through defaults on traded securities, loans, and mortgages. Having a/uni00A0well-diversified investment portfolio means that Aegon can accept credit spread risk to earn a/uni00A0liquidity premium on assets that match liabilities. The focus is on high-quality securities with low expected defaults because Aegon has a/uni00A0low appetite for default risk.\n\n## Equity market risk and other investment risks\n\nAegon runs the risk that the market value of its investments changes. Investment risk affects Aegon's direct investments in the general account, indirect investments for the account of policyholders and agreements where Aegon relies on counterparties, such as reinsurance and derivative counterparties. Aegon has a/uni00A0low preference for investments in equity securities via the general account. Equity investments generate an equity risk premium over the long run, but in combination with a/uni00A0high capital charge result in a/uni00A0relatively low return on capital. Aegon has experience and expertise in managing complex investment guarantees and leverages this capability by providing customers access to a/uni00A0range of investment strategies and guaranteed benefits.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nAegon is exposed to interest rates as both its assets and liabilities are sensitive to movements in long- and short-term interest rates, as well as to changes in the volatility of interest rates. Aegon accepts interest rate risk in order to meet customer needs. However, as no spread is earned on this interest rate risk, Aegon prefers to mitigate the risk to the extent possible.\n\n## Currency exchange rate risk\n\nAs an international company, Aegon conducts business in different currencies, and is therefore exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exposure exists primarily when policies are denominated in currencies other than the issuer's functional currency. Currency risk in the investment portfolios backing insurance and investment liabilities is managed using asset liability matching principles. Assets allocated to equity are held in local currencies to the extent shareholders' equity is required to satisfy regulatory and self-imposed capital requirements. Currency exchange rate fluctuations therefore affect the level of shareholders' equity as a/uni00A0result of converting local currencies into euro (EUR), the Group's reporting currency. The Company holds its capital base in various currencies in amounts that correspond to the book value of individual business units.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nAegon needs to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet shortterm cash demands, not only under normal conditions, but also in the event of a/uni00A0crisis. To that end, Aegon has put a/uni00A0strong liquidity management strategy in place. The Company considers extreme liquidity stress scenarios, including the possibility of prolonged 'frozen' capital markets, an immediate and permanent rise in interest rates, and policyholders withdrawing liabilities at the earliest conceivable date. In addition, the Company has liquidity stress planning in place.\n\nPlease refer to note 4 'Financial Risk' to Aegon's financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Underwriting risk\n\nUnderwriting risk relates to the products sold by Aegon's insurance entities and is the risk of incurring losses when actual experience deviates from Aegon's best estimate assumptions on mortality, morbidity, policyholder behavior, P&C claims and expenses. Aegon has a preference to selectively grow underwriting risk, but this must work hand-in-hand with a strong underwriting process. Aegon's earnings depend, to a significant degree, on the extent to which claims experience is consistent with assumptions used to price products and establish technical provisions. Changes in, among other things, morbidity, mortality, longevity trends and policyholder behavior may have a considerable impact on the Company's income. Assumptions used to price products and establish technical provisions are reviewed on a regular basis. Please refer to note 3 'Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies' to Aegon's consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nLike other companies, Aegon faces operational risk resulting from operational failures or external events, such as processing errors, inaccuracies in models used, negative behavior by personnel, non-compliance to laws and regulations, and natural or manmade disasters, including climate change. In addition, major programs or organizational transformations may also increase potential for operational risks. Aegon's systems and processes are designed to support complex products and transactions, and to help protect against such issues as system failures, business disruption, financial crime, and breaches of information security. Aegon monitors and analyses these risks, and retains flexibility to update and revise where necessary. Aegon's operational risk universe distinguishes eight risk types: business risk; legal, regulatory, conduct and compliance risks; tax risk; financial crime risk; processing risk; information technology and business disruption risk; people risk; and facility risk. These level 1 risk types are split out into more granular level 2 risk types. The more granular risk types include, amongst others, information security risk, conduct risk, fraud risk, Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) risk, and pandemic risk. The impact of COVID-19 on our risk management system is highlighted below.\n\n## Pandemic risk - COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 impacts the company through financial markets and underwriting developments (mortality rates), and also leads to operational risks. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, targeted control assessments were conducted across all regions to monitor the operational risk impact of the pandemic. The assessments showed that the controls continued to operate effectively. The assessments covered the impact on core business processes, the working from home environment and the related information security risk, service levels to customers, and the health of employees. In addition, ongoing attention is being directed at third party risk with the aim to monitor financial health, security and capacity aspects as well as to provide support where needed, to avoid negative knock-on effects for Aegon.\n\n## Business environment scan\n\nIn addition to the management of described risk types, Aegon performs a/uni00A0business environment scan. The aim is to identify emerging, fundamental/structural trends, risks and opportunities in our operating environment, which could have significant impact on value creation and Aegon's financial strength, competitive position, or reputation. It is a/uni00A0critical, cross functional exercise that looks beyond impact alone to assess the potential of topics to influence value creation. The scan is performed as a/uni00A0check/uni00A0on the ongoing appropriateness of the risk universe, to ensure completeness of Aegon's risk assessment as well as to provide input for ongoing strategy development.\n\nThe business environment scan is performed on a/uni00A0biennial basis, with annual updates for significant changes.\n\nTopic identification, mapping and selection are based on desk research, interviews with internal and external experts and management selection. Outcomes can be used for materiality reporting, as input for Aegon's strategy process and for possible follow-up in terms of further analysis, tracking or as a/uni00A0global project. For the 2021 outcomes of Aegon's business environment scan, please refer to on the dedicated section on page 10.\n\n## Risk governance framework\n\nAegon's risk management is based on clear, well-defined risk governance. The goals of risk governance are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Define roles and responsibilities, and risk reporting procedures for decision makers;\n- \u00b7 Institute a/uni00A0proper system of checks and balances;\n- \u00b7 Provide a/uni00A0consistent framework for managing risk in line with the targeted risk profile; and\n- \u00b7 Facilitate risk diversification.\n\n## Governance structure\n\nAegon's risk management framework is represented across all levels of the organization. This ensures a/uni00A0coherent and integrated approach to risk management throughout the Company. Similarly, Aegon has a/uni00A0comprehensive range of company-wide risk policies that detail specific operating guidelines and limits. These policies include legal, regulatory, and internally set requirements, and are designed to keep overall risk-specific exposures to a/uni00A0manageable level. Any breach of policy limits or warning levels triggers remedial action or heightened monitoring. Further risk policies may be developed at a/uni00A0local level to cover situations specific to particular regions or business units.\n\nAegon's risk management governance structure has four layers:\n\n- \u00b7 The Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board Risk Committee (SBRC);\n- \u00b7 The Executive Board and the Management Board;\n- \u00b7 The Group Risk & Capital Committee (GRCC) and its subcommittees; and\n- \u00b7 The Regional Risk & Capital Committees.",

        "page_content": "The SBRC reports to the Supervisory Board on topics related to the ERM framework and the internal control system. The formal responsibility regarding the effectiveness and design, operation, and appropriateness of the ERM and internal control system rests, however, with the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee works closely together with the SBRC with regard to the oversight of, and reports on, the effectiveness of the ERM framework and the risk control systems of the Company. The Audit Committee relies on the findings of the SBRC. The SBRC oversees Aegon's ERM framework, including risk governance and measures taken to ensure risk management is properly integrated into the Company's broader strategy.\n\nFor a/uni00A0description of the main roles and responsibilities of the SBRC see the section on the Risk Committee on page/uni00A051 of the/uni00A0Report of the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Executive Board and the Group's Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to inform the Supervisory Board of any risk that directly threatens the solvency, liquidity, or operations of the Company.\n\nAegon's Executive Board has overall responsibility for risk management. The Executive Board adopts the risk strategy, risk governance, risk tolerance and material changes in risk methodology and risk policies. The Group's CRO has a/uni00A0standing invitation to attend Executive Board meetings and a/uni00A0direct reporting line to the Supervisory Board to discuss ERM and related matters, and is a/uni00A0member of the Management Board.\n\nThe Management Board oversees a/uni00A0broad range of strategic and operational issues. While the Executive Board is Aegon's statutory executive body, the Management Board provides vital support and expertise in safeguarding Aegon's strategic goals. The Management Board discusses and sponsors ERM, in particular the risk strategy, risk governance, risk tolerance and the introduction of new risk policies.\n\nThe Executive Board and Management Board are supported by the/uni00A0Group Risk & Capital Committee (GRCC). The GRCC is Aegon's most senior risk committee. It is responsible for managing Aegon's balance sheet at the global level, and is in charge of risk oversight, risk monitoring and risk management related decisions on behalf of the Executive Board and in line with its charter. The GRCC ensures risk-taking is within Aegon's risk tolerances; that the capital position is adequate to support financial strength, credit rating objectives and regulatory requirements, and that capital is properly allocated. The GRCC informs the Executive Board about any identified (near) breaches of overall tolerance levels which threaten the risk balance, as well as any potential threats to the Company's solvency, liquidity, or operations.\n\nThe GRCC has three sub-committees: the ERM framework, Accounting and Actuarial Committee (ERMAAC), the Non-\n\nFinancial Risk Committee (NFRC) and the Model Validation Committee (MVC).\n\nThe purpose of the ERMAAC is to assist the GRCC, Executive Board and Management Board with financial risk framework setting and maintenance across all group-level balance sheet bases, including policies, standards, guidelines, methodologies, and assumptions.\n\nThe purpose of the NFRC is to assist the GRCC, Executive Board and Management Board with non-financial risk framework setting and maintenance, including policies, standards, guidelines and methodologies, and to act as formal discussion and exchange of information platform on matters of concern regarding nonfinancial risk management.\n\nThe MVC is responsible for approving all model validation reports across Aegon. This is an independent committee that reports into the GRCC and the Executive Board to provide information on model integrity and recommendations for further strengthening of models.\n\nAegon's regions have a risk, or risk and capital committee, and an audit committee established. The responsibilities and prerogatives of the committees are aligned with the Group-level committees and further set out in their respective charters, which are tailored to local circumstances.\n\nIn addition to the four layers described above, Aegon has an established company-wide risk function. It is the mission of the Risk Management function to ensure the continuity of the Company through safeguarding the value of existing business, protecting Aegon's balance sheet and reputation, and through supporting the creation of sustainable value for all stakeholders.\n\nIn general, the objective of the Risk Management function is to support the Executive Board, Management Board, Supervisory Board, and regional and business unit boards in ensuring that the Company reviews, assesses, understands, and manages its risk profile. Through oversight, the Risk Management function ensures the company-wide risk profile is managed in line with Aegon's risk tolerances, and stakeholder expectations are managed under both normal business conditions and adverse conditions caused by unforeseen negative events.\n\nThe following roles are important in order to realize the objective of the Risk Management function:\n\n- \u00b7 Advising on risk-related matters including risk tolerance, risk/uni00A0governance, risk methodology and risk policies;\n- \u00b7 Supporting and facilitating the development, incorporation, maintenance and embedding of the ERM framework and sound practices; and\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and challenging the implementation and effectiveness of ERM practices.",

        "page_content": "In the context of these roles, the Risk Management Function has the following responsibilities:\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework\n\n- \u00b7 The overarching ERM Framework supports Aegon's corporate strategy and enables management to effectively deal with uncertainty and the associate risk-return trade-offs.\n\n## Global Risk Appetite (GRA)\n\n- \u00b7 The GRA is linked to and supports Aegon's strategy and purpose and translates into risk tolerances and risk limits.\n\n## Risk Identification and Assessment\n\n- \u00b7 All material risks are captured and classified in Aegon's risk universe. An emerging risk process is in place to ensure that risk universe remains up-to-date and complete. Risk assessment includes risk measurement across valuation and reporting metrics and feeds into Aegon's risk strategy, including risk preferences and risk profile considerations.\n\n## Risk Governance\n\n- \u00b7 A risk governance framework is in place across all levels of the company, including formal committees, committee charters, memberships across relevant functions, and escalation procedures.\n\n## Policies and Standards\n\n- \u00b7 Risk policies and standards set out requirements, roles and responsibilities and processes to manage risks across the risk universe.\n\n## Risk Embedding\n\n- \u00b7 The ERM Framework is embedded in Aegon's key business areas. The Own Risk Self-Assessment (ORSA) unites the risk and capital management and the business planning processes across Aegon and aligns to its strategy. The risk strategy is aligned with the business strategy, the strategy execution is closely monitored, and risks are timely identified to help steer towards strong delivery in a/uni00A0safe and timely manner.\n\n## Risk Oversight\n\n- \u00b7 Major business (and risk) decisions are risk-based; properly risk informed and, where relevant, challenged by the Risk Management function to protect the balance sheet and proper customer conduct.\n\n## Risk Monitoring and Reporting\n\n- \u00b7 Risks across the risk universe are monitored and reported.\n- \u00b7 Risk culture is embedded across the company.\n- \u00b7 Awareness of employees, management, and leadership of relevant risks and how risks are managed.\n\nAegon's Group and business unit's risk management staff structure is fully integrated. Business unit CROs have either a/uni00A0direct reporting line to the Group CRO or one of the regional CROs that reports directly to the Group CRO.\n\n## Keeping ERM framework up-to-date and effective\n\nAegon continuously works on keeping its ERM framework up-todate, effective and fit-for-purpose. The annual risk development plan outlines priorities for the year and rationalizes activities that align with Aegon's strategy and vision. Policies, charters\n\nand other governance documents are regularly reviewed and updated where necessary. Also, activities such as the Business Environment Scan provide an internal and external perspective on the risk universe and will signal where updates are required. As an example, non-financial risk management, including sustainability, is of increasing importance, and climate risk has been incorporated more explicitly in our Operational Risk taxonomy and other business processes. In addition, internal processes like policy attestation verify compliance with policies. Non-compliance requires remediating action plans, which are actively monitored to ensure execution. Aegon conducts an internal System of Governance review on a/uni00A0regular basis, as required by Solvency II legislation. The review includes design and effectiveness assessment of Aegon's risk management system. Identified weaknesses and improvement areas following from such reviews are reported, discussed and acted on.\n\n## Internal control system\n\nAegon has developed an internal control system that serves to facilitate its compliance with applicable laws, regulations (e.g. Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Solvency II), and administrative processes, and the effectiveness and efficiency of operations with regard to its objectives, in addition to the availability and reliability of financial and non-financial information. The overall internal control system ensures appropriate control activities for key processes and the documentation and reporting of administrative and accounting information. A key element of the internal control system is to facilitate action planning and embed continuous improvement regarding the internal control environment throughout the organization. The internal control system is embedded through policies and frameworks such as ERM Framework, Model Validation Framework, Operational Risk Management (ORM) Framework, and Information Technology Framework. Aegon's internal control system is considered more encompassing in scope than the Integrated Framework issued by COSO on which criteria for the internal control system are based.\n\nIn relation to the Information Technology Framework, as some of our core processes and systems shift from legacy on-premises environment to the cloud, Aegon has established a/uni00A0strategy to manage cloud risk. This includes defining key elements of cloud governance, cloud security strategy, as well as integrating cloud control requirements into our IT Control Framework.\n\nIn 2021, risk management and internal control topics were discussed by the relevant management committees and bodies, including the Management Board, the Executive Board, the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board, and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. From analysis of internal and external audit reports and risk reviews, no material weaknesses were observed, and no significant changes or major improvements were made or planned to the risk management and internal control systems following from the review.",

        "page_content": "## Capital and liquidity management\n\n## Guiding principles\n\nThe management of capital and liquidity is of vital importance for Aegon, for its customers, investors in Aegon securities and for Aegon's other stakeholders. In line with its risk tolerance, the goal of Aegon's capital and liquidity management is to promote strong and stable capital adequacy levels for its businesses, in addition to maintaining adequate liquidity to ensure that the Company is able to meet its obligations.\n\nAegon follows a/uni00A0number of guiding principles in terms of capital and liquidity management:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting strong capital adequacy in Aegon's businesses and operating units;\n- \u00b7 Managing and allocating capital efficiently in support of the strategy and in line with its risk tolerance;\n- \u00b7 Maintaining an efficient capital structure, with an emphasis on optimizing Aegon's cost of capital;\n- \u00b7 Maintaining adequate liquidity in both the operating units and the Holding to ensure that the Company is able to meet its obligations by enforcing stringent liquidity risk policies; and\n- \u00b7 Maintaining continued access to international capital markets on competitive terms.\n\nAegon believes that the combination of these guiding principles strengthens the Company's ability to withstand adverse market conditions, enhances its financial flexibility, and serves both the short-term and the long-term interests of the Company, its customers and other stakeholders.\n\nThe management and monitoring of capital and liquidity is firmly embedded in Aegon's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.\n\n## Management of capital\n\nAegon's capital management framework is based on adequate capitalization of its operating units, Cash Capital at Holding and leverage.\n\n## Capital adequacy of Aegon's operating units\n\nAegon manages capital in its operating units at levels sufficient to absorb moderate shocks without impacting the remittances to the Group. These moderate shocks could be caused by various factors, including general economic conditions, financial markets risks, underwriting risks, changes in government regulations, legal and arbitration proceedings. To mitigate the impact of such factors on the ability of operating units to pay remittances to the Group, Aegon established an operating level of capital in each of the units: 150% Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) for Solvency II units and 400% Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Company Action Level (CAL) in the US. Aegon manages capital in the units to their respective operating levels over-the-cycle.\n\nAfter investments have been made in new business to generate organic growth, capital generated by Aegon's operating units is available for distribution to the holding company. In addition to an operating level, Aegon established a/uni00A0minimum dividend payment level of capital in each of the units: 135% SCR for Solvency II and 350% RBC CAL in the US. As long as the capital position of the unit is above this minimum dividend payment level, the unit is expected to pay remittances to the Group.\n\nWhen the operating unit's capital position approaches the minimum dividend payment level, capital management tools will be used to ensure that units will remain well capitalized. The frequent monitoring of actual and forecasted capitalization levels of its operating units is an important element in Aegon's capital framework in order to actively steer and manage towards maintaining adequate capitalization levels.\n\nThe regulatory capital requirement, minimum dividend payment level, operating level and actual capitalization for Aegon's main operating units at December 31, 2021, are included in the following table:\n\n| Capital requirements                          | Regulatory capital  requirement   | Minimum dividend  payment level   | Operating level   | Actual capitalization   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| US RBC ratio                                  | 100%                              | 350%                              | 400%              | 426%                    |\n| NL Life Solvency II ratio                     | 100%                              | 135%                              | 150%              | 186%                    |\n| Scottish Equitable Plc (UK) Solvency II ratio | 100%                              | 135%                              | 150%              | 167%                    |\n\nFor more details on the capital ratios and the movement thereof reference is made to note 43 'Capital management and solvency' to Aegon's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Improving risk-return profile\n\nAegon continues to take measures to improve its risk-return profile. In 2021, several actions were taken to strengthen the capital position and reduce the volatility of the local capital positions.",

        "page_content": "The Dutch life business reinsured an additional part of its longevity exposure with Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA). The reinsurance agreement provides protection against the longevity risk associated with EUR/uni00A07/uni00A0billion of pension liabilities. This transaction improves the risk profile of the Dutch Life business and releases capital at attractive terms.\n\nIn 2020 Aegon initiated a/uni00A0program to materially reduce economic interest rate risk in the US. Per the end of 2021, Aegon had almost fully executed its interest rate management plan, mainly by lengthening the duration of its asset portfolio and expanding its forward starting swap program. Furthermore, Aegon has taken actions to improve its risk-return profile by further hedging the legacy variable annuities block in the US and reducing its economic exposure to equity markets and interest rates through a/uni00A0lump-sum buy-out program, which allows Aegon to more actively consider a/uni00A0broad range of options for this block of business. As a/uni00A0result of these actions, at December 31, 2021, the targeted interest rate risk exposure has reduced by approximately 70% since inception of the program.\n\nTo reduce the risk of volatility in mortality claims on its statutory capital position in the US, Aegon entered into an agreement with Wilton Re in December 2021 to reinsure a/uni00A0portfolio of universal life secondary guarantee policies with approximately USD 1.4/uni00A0billion of statutory reserves.\n\nAegon has an active global reinsurance program designed to optimize the risk-return profile of other insurance risks. In addition, Aegon monitors the risk-return profile of new business written, withdrawing products that do not create value for all stakeholders including policyholders and shareholders.\n\n## Cash Capital at Holding and liquidity management\n\nLiquidity management is a/uni00A0fundamental building block of Aegon's overall financial planning and capital allocation processes. Liquidity is managed both centrally and at the operating unit level and is coordinated centrally at Aegon/uni00A0N.V..\n\nThe ability of the holding company to meet its cash obligations depends on the amount of liquid assets on its balance sheet and on the ability of the operating units to pay remittances to the holding company. In order to ensure the holding company's ability to fulfil its cash obligations, to maintain sufficient flexibility to provide capital and liquidity support to Aegon's operating units, and to provide stability in external dividends, the Company manages Cash Capital at Holding, including Aegon's centrally managed (unregulated) holding companies, to an operating range of EUR/uni00A00.5 to 1.5/uni00A0billion.\n\nThe main sources of liquidity in Cash Capital at Holding are remittances from operating units and divestitures. In addition, contingent internal and external liquidity programs are maintained to provide additional safeguards against extreme unexpected liquidity stresses.\n\nAegon uses the cash flows from its operating units to pay for holding expenses, including funding costs. The remaining free cash flow is available to execute the Company's strategy to strengthen the balance sheet through deleveraging, to make capital injections into units as required, to make acquisitions, to fund dividends on its shares, and to return capital to shareholders if possible, all subject to maintaining targeted Cash Capital at Holding. Aegon aims to pay out a/uni00A0sustainable dividend to enable equity investors to share in its performance.\n\nWhen determining whether to declare or propose a/uni00A0dividend, Aegon's Executive Board balances prudence with offering an attractive return to shareholders. This is particularly important during adverse economic and/or financial market conditions. Furthermore, Aegon's operating units are subject to local insurance regulations that could restrict remittances to be paid to the holding company. There is no requirement or assurance that Aegon will declare and pay any dividends.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, Aegon held a/uni00A0balance of EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion in Cash Capital at Holding, compared to EUR/uni00A01.1/uni00A0billion on December 31, 2020. Details on the movement are included in note 43/uni00A0'Capital management and solvency' to Aegon's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nThe Company's liquidity risk policy sets guidelines for its operating companies and the holding in order to achieve a/uni00A0prudent liquidity profile and to meet cash demands under extreme conditions. Aegon's liquidity is invested in accordance with the Company's internal risk management policies. Aegon believes that its working capital, backed by its external funding programs and facilities, is ample for the Company's present requirements.\n\nAegon maintains a/uni00A0liquidity policy that requires all business units to project and assess their sources and uses of liquidity over a/uni00A0two-year period under normal and severe business and market scenarios. This policy ensures that liquidity is measured and managed consistently across the Company, and that liquidity stress management plans are in place.\n\nAegon's operating units are engaged in life insurance and pensions business, which are long-term activities with relatively illiquid liabilities and generally matching assets. Liquidity consists of liquid assets held in investment portfolios, in addition to inflows generated by premium payments and customer deposits.\n\n## Leverage\n\nAegon uses leverage in order to lower the cost of capital that supports businesses in the Aegon Group, thereby contributing to a/uni00A0more effective and efficient use of capital. In managing the use of leverage throughout the Group, Aegon has implemented a/uni00A0Leverage Use Framework as part of its broader Enterprise Risk Management framework.",

        "page_content": "## Financial leverage\n\nAegon defines gross financial leverage as debt or debtlike funding issued for general corporate purposes and for capitalizing Aegon's business units. Gross financial leverage includes hybrid instruments, subordinated and senior debt. Aegon/uni00A0aims to reduce its gross financial leverage to a/uni00A0range of EUR/uni00A05.0 - 5.5/uni00A0billion by 2023. This reduction of leverage will strengthen the balance sheet, reduce Aegon's risk profile and make Aegon more resilient.\n\nThe following are metrics that Aegon assesses in managing leverage:\n\n- \u00b7 Gross financial leverage ratio;\n- \u00b7 Fixed charge coverage;\n- \u00b7 Various rating agency leverage metrics; and\n- \u00b7 Other metrics, including gross financial leverage divided by operating capital generation.\n\nAegon's gross financial leverage ratio is calculated by dividing gross financial leverage by total capitalization. Aegon's total capitalization consists of the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 Shareholders' equity, excluding revaluation reserves and cash flow hedge reserves, based on IFRS as adopted by the EU;\n- \u00b7 Non-controlling interests and shares related to Long Term Incentive Plans that have not yet vested; and\n- \u00b7 Gross (or total) financial leverage.\n\nAegon's fixed charge coverage is a/uni00A0measure of the Company's ability to service its financial leverage. It is calculated as the sum of operating result and interest expenses on financial leverage divided by interest payments on financial leverage. The fixed charge coverage includes the impact of interest rate hedging.\n\n## Operational leverage\n\nAlthough operational leverage is not considered part of Aegon's total capitalization, it is an important source of liquidity and funding. Operational leverage relates primarily\n\nto financing Aegon's mortgage portfolios through securitizations, warehouse facilities, covered bonds, and the/uni00A0use of a/uni00A0Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) facility.\n\n## Funding and back-up facilities\n\nThe majority of Aegon's financial leverage is issued by Aegon/uni00A0N.V., the parent company. A limited number of other Aegon companies have also issued debt securities, but for the most part these securities are guaranteed by Aegon/uni00A0N.V.\n\nAegon/uni00A0N.V. has regular access to international capital markets under a/uni00A0USD 6/uni00A0billion debt issuance program. Access to the capital market in the United States is made possible by a/uni00A0separate shelf registration.\n\nAegon also has access to domestic and international money markets through its EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0billion commercial paper programs. As at December 31, 2021, Aegon had no amounts outstanding under these commercial paper programs (2020: EUR/uni00A072/uni00A0million).\n\nTo support its commercial paper programs and need for Letters of Credit (LOCs), and to enhance its liquidity position, Aegon maintains backup credit and LOC facilities with international lenders. The Company's principal arrangements comprise a/uni00A0EUR/uni00A02/uni00A0billion syndicated revolving credit facility and an LOC facility of USD 2/uni00A0billion. The syndicated revolving credit facility matures in 2025. The LOC facility matures in 2026. In addition, Aegon also maintains various shorter-dated bilateral backup liquidity facilities in addition to committed and uncommitted LOC facilities.\n\n## Rating agency ratings\n\nAegon's objective is to maintain very strong financial strength ratings in its main operating units, and this plays an important role in determining the Company's overall capital management strategy. Aegon maintains strong financial strength ratings from several international rating agencies for its main operating units, and a/uni00A0strong credit rating for Aegon/uni00A0N.V.\n\n| December 31, 2021            | Aegon/uni00A0N.V.   | Aegon USA   | Aegon the/uni00A0Netherlands   | Aegon UK   |\n|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|------------|\n| S&P Global 1)                |                     |             |                                |            |\n| Financial strength           | -                   | A+          | A+                             | A+         |\n| Long-term issuer             | A-                  | -           | -                              | -          |\n| Senior debt                  | A-                  | -           | -                              | -          |\n| Subordinated debt            | BBB                 | -           | -                              | -          |\n| Moody's Investors Service 1) |                     |             |                                |            |\n| Financial strength           | -                   | A1          | -                              | -          |\n| Long-term issuer             | A3                  | -           | -                              | -          |\n| Senior debt                  | A3                  | -           | -                              | -          |\n| Subordinated debt            | Baa1                | -           | -                              | -          |\n| Commerical paper 2)          | P-2                 | -           | -                              | -          |\n| A.M.

        "page_content": "## Aegon Group Solvency Ratio\n\nThe Solvency II regulatory framework determines the regulatory capital requirements for EU-domiciled insurance and reinsurance entities. In Aegon's Non-EEA (European Economic Area) regions, (re)insurance entities domiciled in third-countries deemed either provisionally or fully equivalent (US life insurance entities, Bermuda, and Brazil), the capital requirement is based on local capital requirements. For more information about Solvency II and recent developments, please refer to section 'Regulation and supervision'.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the estimated Solvency II ratio of Aegon Group amounted to 211%, an increase of 15%-points since December 31, 2020. This was mainly due to the positive impact from operating capital generation, management actions including the longevity reinsurance for Aegon Levensverzekering N.V. (NL Life) in December 2021 and model and assumption changes - including an increased L AC-DT factor for NL Life. There was a/uni00A0partial offset from other one-time items, a/uni00A0slight negative impact from markets, external dividends and the impact of deleveraging.

The following table provides an overview of the sensitivities (downward and upward) to certain/uni00A0parameters and their estimated impact on the Solvency II ratio./uni00A0Please note that the sensitivities listed in the tables below represent sensitivities to Aegon's position at the balance sheet date. The sensitivities reflect single shocks - except for the US credit default shock which also includes assumed rating migration - where other elements remain unchanged. Real world market impacts (e.g. lower interest rates and declining\n\nequity markets) may happen simultaneously, which can lead to more severe combined impacts and may not be equal to the sum of the individual sensitivities presented in the table. The Solvency II ratio sensitivities assume deferred tax asset (DTA) admissibility./uni00A0Under certain adverse scenarios - in particular a/uni00A0severe equity market down shock - a/uni00A0loss of statutory surplus could lead to part of DTAs becoming inadmissible under the US RBC framework. While this would increase the sensitivity of the Solvency II ratio relative to the published sensitivities, the DTAs would still be recoverable over time.\n\n|                                    |           | Group   | Group   | Americas 1)   | Americas 1)   | NL Life   | NL Life   | SE Plc   | SE Plc   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|\n|                                    | Scenario  | 2021    | 2020    | 2021          | 2020          | 2021      | 2020      | 2021     | 2020     |\n| Equity markets                     | (25%)     | (8%)    | (11%)   | (24%)         | (29%)         | (2%)      | (5%)      | 2%       | (5%)     |\n| Equity markets                     | +25%      | 2%      | 7%      | 14%           | 20%           | (1%)      | 1%        | (3%)     | (1%)     |\n| Interest rates                     | -50bps    | (0%)    | 0%      | 1%            | (3%)          | 7%        | 9%        | (2%)     | (1%)     |\n| Interest rates                     | +50bps    | (1%)    | 1%      | 0%            | 4%            | (8%)      | (8%)      | 1%       | 1%       |\n| Curve steepening                   | +10bps    | (2%)    | n.a.    | n.a.          | n.a.          | (7%)      | n.a.      | n.a.     | n.a.     |\n| Govt spreads excl EIOPA  VA        | -50bps    | 0%      | 3%      | n.a.          | n.a.          | (3%)      | 3%        | 4%       | 5%       |\n| Govt spreads excl EIOPA  VA        | +50bps    | 0%      | (2%)    | n.a.          | n.a.          | 6%        | (2%)      | (4%)     | (5%)     |\n| Non-govt spreads excl  EIOPA VA 2) | -50bps    | (1%)    | 0%      | (3%)          | (1%)          | 11%       | 9%        | (9%)     | (10%)    |\n| Non-govt spreads excl  EIOPA VA 2) | +50bps    | (1%)    | 0%      | 4%            | 1%            | (11%)     | (10%)     | 1%       | 6%       |\n| US Credit Defaults 3)              | ~+200 bps | (17%)   | (18%)   | (38%)         | (38%)         | n.a.      | n.a.      | n.a.     | n.a.     |\n| UFR                                | -15bps    | (2%)    | (2%)    | n.a.          | n.a.          | (6%)      | (6%)      | n.a.     | n.a.     |\n| Longevity 4)                       | +5%       | (5%)    | (7%)    | (8%)          | (12%)         | (8%)      | (10%)     | (2%)     | (3%)     |\n| Mortgage spreads                   | -50bps    | 2%      | 2%      | n.a.          | n.a.          | 6%        | 6%        | n.a.     | n.a.     |\n| Mortgage spreads                   | +50bps    | (2%)    | (2%)    | n.a.          | n.a.          | (6%)      | (6%)      | n.a.     | n.a.     |\n| EIOPA VA                           | -5bps     | 0%      | 0%      | n.a.          | n.a.          | 1%        | (1%)      | n.a.     | n.a.     |\n| EIOPA VA                           | +5bps     | (0%)    | 0%      | n.a.          | n.a.          | (1%)      | 1%        | n.a.     | n.a.     |\n\n- 3 Additional 130 bps defaults for 1 year plus assumed rating migration.",

        "page_content": "## Equity Sensitivities\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of a fall in equity markets. This is mainly a consequence of indirect equity exposure in the Americas.\n\nIn the Americas, equity sensitivities are primarily driven by the variable annuity (VA) business, where base contract fees are charged as a percentage of underlying funds, many of which are equity based. While guaranteed benefits are fully hedged for equity risk, the indirect equity exposure associated with the base contract fees is not. The asymmetry between the impacts of up and down shocks is caused by reserve flooring in the variable annuity business. At market levels per year-end 2021, an equity down shock would result in reserves increasing. However, an equity up shock would not result in a similar release of reserves, as reserves are floored at the cash surrender value of the policies.\n\n## Interest Rates Sensitivities\n\nThe solvency ratio of the Group is not very sensitive to movements in interest rates given the asset liability management and hedging programs that are in place.\n\nIn the Americas, a decrease in interest rates leads to higher reserves for variable annuities and universal life products, which are offset by payoffs from interest rate hedging programs./uni00A0This offset from hedging has increased in 2021 due to the expansion of the dynamic hedge program to all variable annuity contracts.\n\nNL Life hedges interest rate exposure on an economic basis, which results in an over-hedged position on a Solvency II basis. This results in NL Life's solvency ratio being exposed to rising interest rates./uni00A0In addition, the curve steepening scenario was added in 2021 to show the impact of a steepening of the interest rate curve at the longer end, given that NL Life hedges on an economic basis.\n\nFor SE Plc, exposure/uni00A0to lower interest rates leads to higher required capital on mortality, expense and policyholder lapse risks which is partly offset by gains on the swaps held in the general account.\n\n## Spread Sensitivities\n\nThe non-government spread sensitivities include shocks on mortgages, corporates bonds and structured instruments. For NL Life the spread sensitivities reflect an internal model feature that mitigates volatility caused by the basis risk between the EIOPA VA reference portfolio and NL Life's own asset portfolio.\n\nOverall, the Group is exposed to the risk of widening credit spreads across non-government, government, and mortgage instruments, which result in lower asset valuations. The solvency ratio of the Americas is positively impacted by widening spreads, which results in a higher discount rate used for valuing employee\n\npension plan liabilities. For variable annuities, widening credit spreads also lead to lower liabilities, as - since the expansion of the dynamic hedge program in 2021 - an illiquidity premium is used in valuing the liabilities. There is a partial offset, again for variable annuities, from a lower value of separate account fixed income assets resulting in an addition to reserves reflecting a higher cost of guarantees.\n\nThe Group as a whole has little exposure to changes in government spreads. The exposure in the Americas is negligible, and there are offsetting risks in NL Life and SE Plc. The solvency ratio of NL Life is exposed to government spreads narrowing because the resulting increase of SCR outweighs the resulting lower Own Funds in terms of ratio impact. The solvency ratio of SE Plc is exposed to spread widening which would have a negative impact on the valuation of fixed income assets.\n\nExposure to government spread sensitivities is driven by NL Life and SE Plc. NL Life is exposed to spreads narrowing compared to spreads widening last year. This sign change is due to higher interest rates, the sale of sovereigns over the year, and the change in composition of the Solvency II ratio over the year (more Own Funds but materially lower SCR). SE Plc is exposed to spreads widening due to the reduction in the value of fixed income assets.\n\nGroup is exposed to mortgage spreads widening, due to exposure in NL Life, which has an adverse impact on the asset valuation. The Americas credit defaults sensitivity reflects the combined impact of credit defaults and adverse credit rating migrations on assets held in the general account portfolio.\n\n## Longevity Sensitivities\n\nAll main business units contribute to the Group risk that people will live longer than the expectations embedded in our provisions. The exposure has decreased since last year, driven by improved premium deficiency reserve sufficiency in the LTC business in the US, and additional longevity reinsurance that was implemented in NL Life.\n\n## Capital quality\n\nSolvency II distinguishes between basic Own Funds and ancillary Own Funds. Aegon's total Own Funds are comprised of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 basic Own Funds. Aegon does not currently have ancillary Own Funds. Tier 1 basic Own Funds are divided into unrestricted Tier 1 capital and restricted Tier 1 capital. The latter category contains Own Funds instruments subject to the restrictions of the Solvency II Delegated Regulation, which includes grandfathered Tier 1 Own Funds instruments. Based on agreements with its supervisory authorities, Aegon applies a/uni00A0fungibility and transferability restriction with respect to charitable trusts within the Americas. These restrictions, applied to Aegon's basic Own Funds, result in Aegon's Available Own Funds./uni00A0",

        "page_content": "## Regulation and supervision\n\nIndividually regulated Aegon companies are each subject to prudential supervision in their respective home countries and therefore are required to maintain a/uni00A0minimum solvency margin based on local requirements. In addition, the Group as a/uni00A0whole is subject to prudential requirements on a/uni00A0group basis, including capital, internal governance, risk management, reporting and disclosure requirements, pursuant to Solvency II and the Financial Conglomerates Directive.\n\n## Solvency II Introduction\n\nThe Solvency II framework imposes prudential requirements at group level as well as on the individual EU insurance companies in the Aegon Group. Insurance supervision is exercised by local supervisors on the individual insurance companies in the Aegon Group and, in addition, by the group supervisor at group level. The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) is Aegon's Solvency II group supervisor. Solvency II contains economic, risk-based capital requirements for insurance companies in all EU member states, as well as for groups with insurance and/or reinsurance activities in the EU. The Solvency II approach to prudential supervision can be described as a/uni00A0'total balance sheet-approach,' and takes material risks to which insurance companies are exposed into account, as well as the interaction between risks.\n\nThe Solvency II framework is structured along three pillars. Pillar 1 comprises quantitative requirements (including technical provisions, valuation of assets and liabilities, solvency requirements and own fund requirements). Pillar 2 requirements include governance and risk management requirements, and requirements for effective supervision. Pillar 3 consists of disclosure and supervisory reporting requirements. These three pillars should not only be considered in isolation, but also in terms of how they interact with one another. More complex risks, for instance, require a/uni00A0stronger risk management and governance structure or could lead to higher capital requirements.\n\n## Pillar 1\n\nSolvency II requires EU insurance companies to determine technical provisions at a/uni00A0value that corresponds with the present exit value of their insurance obligations towards policyholders and other beneficiaries of insurance and reinsurance contracts. The calculation of the technical provisions should be based on market consistent information where possible.\n\nThe value of the technical provisions is equal to the sum of a/uni00A0best estimate and a/uni00A0risk margin. The discount rate at which technical provisions are calculated and other parameters to determine the technical provisions may have an important effect on the amount of own funds (the excess of assets over liabilities) that insurance undertakings are required to maintain as well as volatility thereof. The Solvency II framework contains several\n\nmeasures - in particular the volatility adjustment and matching adjustment - that should help to reduce volatility of the Solvency II balance sheet.\n\nInsurers and reinsurers are required to hold eligible own funds in addition to the assets held to cover the technical provisions in order to ensure that they are able to meet their obligations over the next 12 months with a/uni00A0probability of at least 99.5% (i.e. the ability to withstand a/uni00A01-in-200-year event). The buffer that insurance companies are required to hold is the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). Insurance companies are allowed to: (a) use a/uni00A0standard formula to calculate their SCR; (b) use a/uni00A0self-developed internal model; for which the approval of the supervisory authorities is required); or (c) use a/uni00A0partial internal model (PIM); a/uni00A0combination of the standard formula and an internal model; also requires approval of the supervisory authorities. An internal model should better reflect the actual risk profile of the insurance company than the standard formula. Aegon, as a/uni00A0group, uses a/uni00A0PIM.\n\nIn addition to the SCR, insurance companies should also calculate a/uni00A0Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR). This represents a/uni00A0lower level of financial security than the SCR, below which the level of eligible own funds held by the insurance company is not allowed to drop. An irreparable breach of the MCR would lead to the withdrawal of an insurance company's license. Insurance companies are required to hold eligible own funds against the SCR and MCR. Own funds are divided into three tiers based on their quality. More details can be found in the Capital and Liquidity Management section.\n\n## Pillar 2\n\nUnder Pillar 2, insurance companies are required to set up and maintain an adequate and effective system of governance, which includes an appropriate internal organization, a/uni00A0risk governance system and an effective assessment of the risk and solvency position of the Company, including a/uni00A0prospective assessment of risks, through the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) process. In general, the system of governance should be proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the insurance company. A number of risks that insurance companies face can only be addressed through proper governance structures, rather than quantitative requirements. Management is ultimately responsible for the maintenance of an effective governance system. An example of such a/uni00A0risk, that has gained more prominence, is climate risk, which is addressed in the ORSA process.\n\nThe Supervisory Review Process (SRP), which is part of Pillar/uni00A02, allows supervisory authorities to supervise the ongoing compliance of undertakings with Solvency II requirements. Possible enforcement measures include: the imposition of capital",

        "page_content": "add-ons; the requirement to submit and execute a/uni00A0recovery plan; and ultimately, the revocation of an insurance license.\n\n## Pillar 3\n\nSolvency II includes detailed reporting and disclosure requirements. These requirements include non-public supervisory reporting on a/uni00A0regular basis through regular supervisory reports (RSR), complemented by detailed quantitative reporting templates (QRTs) reported on a/uni00A0quarterly basis, which contain detailed financial data and are partly public.\n\nIn addition, it is a/uni00A0requirement to publish a/uni00A0Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) on an annual basis.\n\n## Group supervision\n\nMany of the Solvency II requirements that apply to the individual insurance undertakings apply, with the necessary modifications, also at group level. These requirements include group solvency requirements, group reporting and disclosure requirements, and requirements regarding the system of governance, risk management and internal control framework at group level. Entities that are not subject to solo supervision under Solvency II (such as entities in other financial sectors, non-financial entities, and regulated and non-regulated entities in third countries) may be affected indirectly by the Solvency II group requirements. Entities in other financial sectors are, in most cases, taken into account in the group solvency calculation, applying the capital requirements of that specific financial sector and either by using the Deduction and Aggregation method or the Accounting Consolidation method, which is the default method under Solvency II.\n\nThe difference between these two methods primarily affects the extent to which diversification can be taken into account in the group capital requirements. Under the Accounting Consolidation method the group is essentially treated as one economic unit together with the Solvency II entities, whereas the Deduction and Aggregation method requires the group to aggregate entities, rather than to fully consolidate entities for the purpose of the group capital requirements. However, the level of diversification under the Accounting Consolidation method also depends on the type of entity.\n\nSubject to certain conditions, entities in other financial sectors may be included in accordance with the Accounting Consolidation method. In particular, this may be the case when the group supervisor is satisfied as to the level of integrated management and internal control regarding these entities. This applies for example to Aegon Bank in the Netherlands. Furthermore, DNB may require groups to deduct any participation from the own funds eligible for the Group Solvency ratio.\n\nAs explained in Note 43 'Capital management and solvency'/uni00A0to Aegon's consolidated financial statements, Aegon uses a/uni00A0combination of the two aggregation methods defined\n\nwithin the Solvency II framework to calculate the Group Solvency ratio.\n\nFor insurance entities domiciled outside the EEA for which provisional or full equivalence applies, such as the United States, Aegon uses the Deduction and Aggregation method, based on local regulatory requirements to translate these into the Group Solvency position. US insurance entities are included in Aegon's group solvency calculation in accordance with local US Risk-Based Capital (RBC) requirements. Aegon's current method is applied since July 1, 2017 and received approval from DNB. Details are included in Note 43 'Capital management and solvency' to Aegon's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAegon's UK insurance subsidiaries continue to be included in the Group Solvency II calculation in accordance with Solvency II standards, including Aegon's approved Partial Internal Model.\n\nSolvency II group supervision is exercised by a/uni00A0combination of the supervisory authorities of the local insurance entities and the group supervisor. An important role in the cooperation between the supervisory authorities in the context of group supervision is played by the college of supervisors, in which the local and group supervisors are represented. This college is chaired by the group supervisor.\n\nAt international level, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is developing a/uni00A0risk based global Insurance Capital Standard (ICS). The IAIS' ultimate goal, by a/uni00A0date yet to be determined, is a/uni00A0single ICS that includes a/uni00A0common methodology by which it achieves comparable outcomes across jurisdictions. Ongoing work is intended to lead to improved convergence over time on the key elements of the ICS towards this ultimate goal. According to the IAIS the key elements include valuation, capital resources and capital requirements. In 2019, the IAIS adopted ICS Version 2.0, which is being used during a/uni00A0five-year monitoring period for confidential reporting to group-wide supervisors and discussion in supervisory colleges, not as a/uni00A0formal capital requirement. From 2025 onwards, it is currently envisaged that local jurisdictions will formally enact the ICS, which is described as a/uni00A0minimum standard. In Europe, and consequently for Aegon, this may entail that ICS standards will be incorporated in the Solvency II framework.\n\n## Solvency II review\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the European Commission published its legislative proposal for amendments to the Solvency II Directive, following extensive preparatory work in previous years by the European Commission and EIOPA. The Solvency II Directive proposal will be supplemented by a/uni00A0legislative proposal to amend the Solvency II Delegated Regulation, which will be published in a/uni00A0later stage. The co-legislators at European level will assess the legislative proposals in order to arrive at final text, resulting in amendments to the Solvency II Directive and the Solvency II Delegated Regulation.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability and Solvency II\n\nIn March 2018, the European Commission adopted its Action Plan on Sustainable Finance. This action plan is part of broader efforts to connect finance with the European and global economy for the benefit of the planet and wider society. Specifically, the Action Plan aims to: (1) reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth, (2) manage financial risks stemming from climate change, resource depletion, environmental degradation and social issues; and (3) foster transparency and long-termism in financial and economic activity.\n\nOn August 1, 2022, amendments to Solvency II will enter into effect, integrating sustainability risks in the governance of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. The amendments relate to the inclusion of sustainability risk in the risk management areas, to be covered in the risk management system, in particular in relation to underwriting and reserving and investment risk management, as well as in the corresponding risk management policies. In addition, the identification of emerging risks and sustainability risks is included as part of the tasks of the risk management function, and as risks that form part of the calculation of the overall solvency needs and consequently of the ORSA process. Furthermore, sustainability risk is made explicitly part of the opinion of the actuarial function on the underwriting policy, made explicitly part of the remuneration policy (i.e. information how the remuneration policy takes into account the integration of sustainability risks in the risk management system). Lastly, the amendments relate to the integration of sustainability risk in the prudent person principle, as well as the integration of the potential long-term impact of investment strategy and decisions on sustainability factors (for example climate change).\n\nIn addition, the proposal to amend the Solvency II Directive, following the Solvency II 2020 review, includes an additional provision that will require insurers to identify and assess climate change risk as part of the assessment of their overall solvency needs, as well as a/uni00A0mandate to EIOPA to explore by 2023 a/uni00A0dedicated prudential treatment of exposures to assets and activities associated with environmental and social objectives and to regularly review the standard formula parameters pertaining to catastrophe risk.\n\nWe refer to/uni00A0the non-financial information section of this Integrated Annual Report for a/uni00A0description of the changes to the disclosure requirements, applicable to Aegon/uni00A0N.V., relating to non-financial information, including sustainability-related disclosures.\n\n## Financial conglomerate supervision\n\nSince 2009, Aegon has been subject to supplemental group supervision by DNB in accordance with the requirements of the EU's Financial Conglomerate Directive. This includes supplementary capital adequacy requirements for financial conglomerates and supplementary supervision on risk\n\nconcentrations and intra-group transactions in the financial conglomerate. Due to the introduction of the Solvency II group supervisory requirements - which include similar, and to a/uni00A0large extent overlapping - supplemental group supervision pursuant to the Financial Conglomerates Directive has become significantly less relevant.\n\n## Recovery and resolution and systemic risk G-SII designation, the Holistic Framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector, and ComFrame\n\nIn 2015, Aegon was designated by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a/uni00A0Global Systemically Important Insurer (G-SII), based on an assessment methodology developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). In 2019, in recognition of the fact that the Holistic Framework (see below) provides an enhanced approach to assessing and mitigating systemic risk in the global insurance sector, the FSB decided to suspend the identification of G-SIIs. In November 2022, the FSB is expected to review the need to either discontinue or re-establish an annual identification of G-SIIs.\n\nDue to its G-SII status, Aegon was subject to an additional layer of direct supervision at the group level. In accordance with these requirements, Aegon submitted a/uni00A0liquidity risk management plan, a/uni00A0systemic risk management plan, and an exante recovery plan to DNB and to the crisis management group (CMG) that was established. These requirements, which are included in the Holistic Framework, continue in practice. Aegon continues to update these plans on an annual basis. In addition, the Aegon Group's Resolution Authority (the Dutch Central Bank) is responsible for the development of Aegon's resolution plan.\n\nIn November 2019, the IAIS adopted the Holistic Framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector. Some of the provisions of the Holistic Framework are included in the IAIS Insurance Core Principles (that apply to all insurers), while others are included in ComFrame (the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups, or IAIGs).\n\nThe Holistic Framework consists of an enhanced set of supervisory policy measures and powers of intervention, an annual IAIS global monitoring exercise, and an assessment of consistent implementation of supervisory measures. ComFrame establishes supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the effective group-wide supervision of IAIGs. ComFrame is a/uni00A0comprehensive and outcome-focused framework that provides supervisory minimum requirements tailored to the international activities and sizes of IAIGs. ComFrame builds on the Insurance Core Principles that are applicable to the supervision of all insurers. The provisions of both ComFrame and the Insurance Core Principles must be implemented in local legislation in order to have a/uni00A0binding effect.",

        "page_content": "Regardless of what happens to G-SII or G-SII designation, Aegon would still be subject to ComFrame and ICS, to the extent these would be implemented in local legislation. In Europe, the relevant international standards are expected to be implemented in the Solvency II Framework through the Solvency II Review. The European Commission's proposal to amend the Solvency II Directive includes a/uni00A0number of macro-prudential tools. The legislative proposal to introduce a/uni00A0European Insurance Recovery & Resolution Directive (IRRD), which is discussed briefly below, is expected to include IAIGs based in the European Union.\n\n## Recovery and resolution Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers\n\nOn January 1, 2019, the Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers (R&R Act) came into force in the Netherlands, replacing the previously applicable intervention regime. The R&R Act has introduced a/uni00A0revised regulatory framework for recovery and resolution of Dutch insurance companies, and provides for a/uni00A0range of measures to be taken by these companies and the Dutch Central Bank, in order for these insurance companies to be prepared for recovery in circumstances where it no longer meets the required solvency requirements and for orderly resolution, in circumstances where it is failing or is likely to fail.\n\nThe R&R Act allows DNB to require a/uni00A0Dutch insurance company or a/uni00A0group in certain circumstances, to remove, ex-ante, impediments to effective resolution of a/uni00A0Dutch insurance undertaking, such as the revision of financing arrangements, the reduction of exposures, the transfer of assets, the termination or limitation of business activities, the prohibition of starting certain new business activities, changes to the legal or operational structure of the group, or the securing certain critical business lines.\n\nThe powers under the R&R Act may also extend to the level of the group and to entities, other than in insurance entities in the Netherlands, that are part of the group, such as Aegon/uni00A0N.V.. The powers include the transfer of the undertaking to a/uni00A0third party, the transfer to a/uni00A0bridge institution and the transfer of certain specific assets and/\n\nor liabilities. In addition, a/uni00A0bail-in tool was introduced, that allows for the write-off or conversion of rights of creditors, including policyholders and beneficiaries, while respecting the principle that they should not be worse off through resolution, including the application of the bail-in tool, than they would be in ordinary insolvency proceedings.\n\nAs part of the Solvency II review, the European Commission has recently proposed to introduce a/uni00A0recovery and resolution regime at European level, based on minimum harmonization, which means that local regimes should meet minimum standards, set at European level. It is expected that the R&R Act already meets these minimum standards to a/uni00A0significant extent.\n\n## Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive\n\nFurthermore, to parts of the Aegon Group, in particular Aegon Bank N.V., the framework of the EU Directive on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investments firms (the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive') is applicable. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive also contains provisions that, in certain specific circumstances, where both Aegon Bank N.V. and Aegon/uni00A0N.V. fail or are likely to fail, could be applied to mixed financial holding companies such as Aegon/uni00A0N.V., including the right of bail-in of creditors.\n\n## Intervention by the Dutch Minister of Finance\n\nLastly, under Part 6 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the Dutch Minister of Finance may intervene immediately, when the stability of the financial system is threatened by the situation of a/uni00A0financial institution, in which case legal or statutory provisions, applicable to the financial institution, might be superseded. The intervention measures available to the Minister of Finance, include in particular the right to expropriate assets of the financial institution, as well as securities and/or other financial instruments issued by or with the cooperation of the financial institution. The exercise of this power may significantly impact the rights of the owners or holders of these assets, securities and/or financial instruments.",

Effective detection and resolution of such conduct will help sustain our business and ensure long term value creation for all stakeholders.\n\nAegon has introduced Aegon Speak Up to demonstrate its commitment to staff and other stakeholders that it encourages escalation of any concerns regarding potential misconduct and will not tolerate reprisal for making a/uni00A0good faith report.\n\nAegon Speak Up provides a/uni00A0safe environment for anyone who wishes to raise a/uni00A0concern about suspected or observed misconduct that involves Aegon.\n\nFor this purpose, Aegon has contracted with an independent third party to host a/uni00A0secure reporting channel for employees and others to report potential misconduct. Reports can be submitted online or via toll-free telephone lines in all of the countries in which Aegon conducts business (24 hours a/uni00A0day, seven days a/uni00A0week). Reporters can choose to remain anonymous. If an issue is found upon investigation, appropriate management action is taken to resolve the issue and prevent it from happening again to the extent feasible.\n\nIt is important that reporters feel supported and protected by the company for bringing issues to the attention of management that may be harmful to the reputation and integrity of the Company, its employees, or other stakeholders. Aegon has established specific measures to provide support, and to address situations that present a/uni00A0risk of reprisal. Reporters who believe they have experienced retaliation are encouraged to immediately bring the issue to the attention of the Group Compliance Officer.",

Criteria established under 'Internal Control Integrated Framework', the Treadway Commission's Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO, 2013 framework), are used by Aegon's internal audit function to analyze and make recommendations to the Executive Board concerning the effectiveness of the Company's internal control framework. Based on risk assessments performed, the Executive Board, under the supervision of the Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee, is responsible for determining the overall internal audit work and for monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of Aegon/uni00A0N.V..\n\nIn addition, the Executive Board is responsible for Aegon's enterprise risk management under the supervision of the Supervisory Board and its Risk Committee. Through oversight and framework setting, Aegon's risk management function ensures that the Group-wide risk profile is managed in line with Aegon's risk tolerances, and stakeholder expectations are managed both under normal business conditions and adverse conditions caused by unforeseen events. The Executive Board is informed in a/uni00A0timely manner of risks to the Company's economic/statutory solvency, reputation, reliability of financial reporting or operations.\n\nThe risk management function develops and monitors compliance with risk policies and risk frameworks. The risk management function also advises on risk-related matters including risk tolerance, risk governance, risk methodology and risk policies; supports and facilitates the development, maintenance and embedding of the ERM framework and sound practices; and monitors and challenges the implementation and effectiveness of ERM practices. Finally, both the Compliance function/uni00A0and the Operational & Model Risk Management function play key roles in monitoring the Company's adherence to external rules and regulations and internal policies.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, Aegon's directors and management have adopted a/uni00A0going\n\nconcern basis on the reasonable assumption that the Company is and will be able to continue its normal course of business in the foreseeable future.\n\nRelevant facts, circumstances and risks relating to the consolidated financial position on December 31, 2021, were assessed in order to reach the going concern assumption. The main areas assessed were financial performance, capital adequacy, financial flexibility, liquidity, and access to capital markets, together with the factors and risks likely to affect Aegon's future development, performance, and financial position. Commentary on these areas is set out in the 'Capital and liquidity management', 'Risk management',/uni00A0'Results of operations' and/uni00A0'Business Overview' sections in this Annual Report. Management concluded that the going concern assumption is appropriate on the basis of the financial performance of the Company, its continued ability to access capital markets, adequate solvency ratios, and the level of leverage and Cash Capital at Holding.\n\nAegon's risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance for the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of Aegon's published financial statements. They cannot, however, provide absolute assurance that a/uni00A0misstatement of Aegon's financial statements can be prevented or detected.\n\nOn the basis of the above, Aegon's Executive Board states the following with respect to risks to the Company's financial reporting:\n\n- \u00b7 The report provides sufficient insights into any failings with regards to the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems;\n- \u00b7 Aegon's risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the Company's financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies;\n- \u00b7 Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a/uni00A0going concern basis; and\n- \u00b7 The report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of the Company's continuity for the period of twelve months after the preparation of the report.",

These/uni00A0are the topics that, Aegon believes, will have the most impact on its business in the years ahead, not only on our financial performance, but also its ability to continue creating long-term value for the societies in which Aegon operates. This report looks in detail at these topics, and at how Aegon, as a/uni00A0financial services company, is meeting the challenges and opportunities they represent for its business. Its material topics are also built into Aegon's annual strategy cycle.\n\nSignificant audiences: This report is intended first and foremost for investors. Aegon believes it is important that financial markets price in fully social, business and environmental risk. For/uni00A0this to happen, management must disclose these risks, and work to understand the connection between value creation and longer-term financial performance. Legislators are already moving in this direction, with the adoption of the EU Directive on Non-Financial Reporting and the publication of recommendations from the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures. Aegon is not only a/uni00A0financial services provider, it is also an investor. Consequently, this report also examines the efforts Aegon has made to embed social, environmental, and economic factors into its own investment decision-making.\n\nResponsibility: Aegon's Executive Board bears ultimate responsibility for this report and its contents. This/uni00A0is Aegon's ninth integrated report - but the fourth time Aegon published a/uni00A0combined integrated and Annual Report. Aegon supports the IIRC and GRI in their push for more complete and relevant corporate reporting. Disclosure is only part of the story. For Aegon, integrated reporting is also about understanding both the financial and non-financial factors affecting its business, and using that understanding to drive better, more integrated decision-making.\n\nThe Hague, the Netherlands, March 16, 2022\n\n## The Executive Board of Aegon/uni00A0N.V.\n\nLard Friese, CEO\n\nMatthew J.

The 2021 interim dividend amounted to EUR/uni00A00.08 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.002 per common share B. The interim dividend was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. The interim dividend was payable as of September 17, 2021. At the General Meeting of Shareholders currently scheduled for May 31, 2022, the Executive Board will, in line with its earlier announcement and barring unforeseen circumstances, propose a/uni00A0final dividend of EUR/uni00A00.09 per common share (at each shareholders option in cash or in stock), and EUR/uni00A00.00225 per common share B, which has financial rights attached to it of 1/40 th of a/uni00A0common share. This will bring the total dividend for 2021 to EUR 0.17 per common share and EUR 0.00425 per common share B. If the proposed dividend is approved by shareholders,/uni00A0this will be paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. The value of the stock dividend will be approximately equal to the cash dividend. Dividends in US/uni00A0dollars are calculated based on the foreign exchange reference rate (WM/Reuters closing spot exchange rate fixed at 5.00 pm Central European Summer Time ('CEST')) on the US-ex dividend day.\n\n|      | EUR per common share 1)   | EUR per common share 1)   | EUR per common share 1)   | USD per common share 1)   | USD per common share 1)   | USD per common share 1)   |\n|------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Year | Interim                   | Final                     | Total                     | Interim                   | Final                     | Total                     |\n| 2017 | 0.13                      | 0.14                      | 0.27                      | 0.15                      | 0.16                      | 0.32                      |\n| 2018 | 0.14                      | 0.15                      | 0.29                      | 0.16                      | 0.17                      | 0.33                      |\n| 2019 | 0.15                      | 0.00  2)                  | 0.15                      | 0.17                      | -                         | 0.17                      |\n| 2020 | 0.06                      | 0.06                      | 0.12                      | 0.07                      | 0.07                      | 0.14                      |\n| 2021 | 0.08                      | 0.09 3)                   | 0.17                      | 0.09                      |                           |                           |\n\n- 1 Paid at each shareholders' option in cash or in stock.\n- 2 Aegon forewent the 2019 final dividend of EUR 0.16 to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its risk profile.",

The reconciliation of this measure to the most comparable EU-IFRS measure is presented in note 5 'Segment information' of the consolidated financial statements. This non-EU-IFRS measure is calculated by consolidating on a/uni00A0proportionate basis the revenues and expenses of Aegon's joint ventures in Brazil, China, India, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain and Aegon's associates in France, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.\n\nThe information on the following tables also includes the non-EU-IFRS financial measure operating result after tax. This is the after-tax equivalent of operating result. The reconciliation of operating result to the most comparable EU-IFRS measure is presented in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements. Aegon believes that these non-EU-IFRS measures provides meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon's businesses, including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the businesses.\n\nAegon's senior management is compensated based in part on Aegon's results against targets using the non-EU-IFRS measures presented in this report. While many other insurers in Aegon's peer group present substantially similar non-EU-IFRS measures, the non-EU-IFRS measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the non-EU-IFRS measures presented by other insurers. There is no standardized meaning to these measures under EU-IFRS or any other recognized set of accounting standards and readers are cautioned to consider carefully the different ways in which Aegon and its peers present similar information before making a/uni00A0comparison. Aegon believes the non-EU-IFRS measures present within this report, when read together with Aegon's reported EU-IFRS financial statements, provide meaningful supplemental information for the investing public. This enables them to evaluate Aegon's businesses after eliminating the impact of current EU-IFRS accounting policies for financial instruments and insurance contracts, which embed a/uni00A0number of accounting policy alternatives that companies may select in presenting their results (as companies may use different local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAPs)), and this may make the comparability difficult between time periods.\n\nFor the discussion on our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019, including certain comparative discussion on our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, please refer to the section Results of operations on pages 128 to 150 in Aegon's 2020 Integrated Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## Results 2021 worldwide\n\nAegon's net result increased by EUR 1,646/uni00A0million compared with 2020 to EUR 1,701/uni00A0million in 2021. This was mainly driven by better results on non-operating items and by lower Other charges when compared with 2020. Non-operating items in 2021 benefited mainly from real estate and private equity revaluations. Other charges were lower in 2021, mainly since 2020 included more adverse impact from assumption updates in the United States. An increase in Operating result contributed to the higher net result as well. Adverse claims experience in the US was more than offset by increased fees from higher equity markets, the positive contribution from business growth, and lower expenses driven by expense savings initiatives.\n\n## Net result\n\nThe 2021 net result amounted to EUR 1,701 million and was driven by the operating result of EUR 1,906 million. Non-operating items amounted to a gain of EUR 930 million in 2021, whereas a loss of EUR 508 was recorded in 2020. The improvement in Non-operating items in 2021 resulted mostly from positive fair value items and increased realized gains on investments, while 2020 reflected the adverse economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Fair value items amounted to EUR 432 million in 2021 and were mainly driven by positive revaluations from real estate and private equity investments in the Americas. Realized gains on investments were EUR 448 million in 2021 and were primarily due to asset sales in the Americas, in part to fund investments in long-duration assets as part of the interest rate risk management plan. Net impairments - mainly related to the unsecured loan portfolio in the Netherlands - amounted to EUR 53 million in 2021. Other charges in 2021 amounted to EUR 780 million, compared with EUR 1,239 million in 2020. Other charges in 2021 were mainly driven by management actions to release capital and increase the predictability of capital generation from the US variable annuity business. The result before tax in 2021 amounted EUR 2,056 million. After the tax charge of EUR 355 million, the net result for 2021 amounted to EUR 1,701 million. The effective tax rate in 2021 was 17%, and reflects regular tax exempt income items and the use of tax credits./uni00A0\n\n## Operating result\n\nAegon's operating result increased by 11% compared with 2020 to EUR 1,906/uni00A0million in 2021. Adverse claims experience in the US was more than offset by increased fees from higher equity markets, the positive contribution from business growth and lower expenses driven by expense savings initiatives, leading to higher operating result in all other units, except International. This latter was driven by the reclassification of the 2021 result of Central & Eastern Europe from operating result to Other income following the announced divestment of the business.\n\n- \u00b7 The Americas' operating result in 2021 decreased by 1% compared with 2020 to EUR 788/uni00A0million as favorable morbidity experience in Long-Term Care and the impact of favorable market performance in Mutual Funds, Variable Annuities and Retirement Plans and lower expenses largely offset the impact of adverse mortality in the Life business and unfavorable currency movements./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Operating result from the Netherlands increased by 13% compared with 2020 to EUR 755/uni00A0million in 2021. The increase in the operating result reflects the benefits from expense savings, business growth and an improved investment margin in the Life segment.\n- \u00b7 In the United Kingdom, the operating result rose by 28% compared with 2020 to EUR 184/uni00A0million in 2021. The increase in operating result was mainly driven by higher fee revenues from the growth of the platform business and favorable equity markets, and provision releases along with lower expenses, which more than offset the impacts from the loss of earnings due to the sale of Stonebridge and the gradual run-off of the traditional product portfolio.\n- \u00b7 The operating result from International decreased by 12% compared with 2020 to EUR 145/uni00A0million in 2021. The decrease reflects the reclassification of the result of Aegon's businesses in Central & Eastern Europe from operating result to Other income, following the announced divestment of the business. Adjusted for this, International's operating results increased when compared with 2020, driven by higher results in Spain & Portugal, China and TLB. This reflects portfolio growth in Spain & Portugal and China, and favorable claims experience./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0operating result from Asset Management increased by 39% compared with 2020 to EUR 253/uni00A0million in 2021. This increase was mainly driven by higher management fees as a/uni00A0result of net deposits and favorable markets.\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0operating result for Holdings and other activities amounted to a/uni00A0loss of EUR 219/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with a/uni00A0loss of EUR 237/uni00A0million in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses decreased by 2% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A03.8/uni00A0billion in 2021. This decrease primarily reflects a/uni00A0reduction in addressable expenses, which decreased by 3% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A02.9/uni00A0billion. The reduction in addressable expense savings reflects the benefits from expense savings initiatives across the Group. All business units showed a/uni00A0reduction in addressable expenses compared with 2020, except for Asset Management. The latter was mainly driven by accruals of performance-related compensation.\n\n## Sales\n\nNet deposits in 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A05.4/uni00A0billion, whereas in 2020 net outflows of EUR/uni00A015.2/uni00A0billion were recorded. The improvement was due to the United Kingdom and Asset Management. In the United Kingdom, this was mainly driven by the Institutional business - which can be lumpy - while Retail and Workplace contributed positively as well. For Asset Management, this was mainly the result of net deposits from the Global Platforms, driven by net deposits in the fixed income platform. Net outflows in the Americas were mainly caused by Retirement Plans due to outflows in the low-margin Large-Market segment. Individual Solutions saw outflows from Variable and Fixed Annuities following product exits as these books mature. Net outflows in the Netherlands were driven by the Bank, and mainly resulted from Aegon's decision to stop offering savings products to non-fee-paying customers./uni00A0\n\nNew life sales in 2021 decreased by 7% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0686/uni00A0million. Higher new life sales in the United States, mainly driven by increased sales of whole life final expense and indexed universal life, were more than offset by lower new life sales in International and the Netherlands. The lower new life sales in International mainly reflect the exclusion of sales from Central & Eastern Europe as of 2021. In the Netherlands, the decrease follows from the decision to classify the Dutch Life business as a/uni00A0Financial Asset and to close most products for new sales. /uni00A0\n\nNew premium production for accident & health insurance decreased by 6% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0170/uni00A0million in 2021. This was mainly due to the decision to exit the individual Medicare supplement segment in the United States and an unfavorable impact from currency movements, which more than offset higher long-term-care sales also in the United States. The latter resulted from a/uni00A0change in legislation in the state of Washington. Otherwise, the product remains closed for new business.\n\nNew premium production for property & casualty insurance amounted to EUR/uni00A096/uni00A0million, which is a/uni00A0decrease of 26% compared with 2020. The decrease was mainly the result of the exclusion of sales from Central & Eastern Europe as of 2021. Adjusting for this impact, property & casualty sales increased compared with 2020 mainly due to higher sales in Spain & Portugal, driven by the introduction of a/uni00A0new household insurance product in the bancassurance channel.\n\n## Capital management\n\nDuring 2021, shareholders' equity increased by EUR/uni00A01.5/uni00A0billion to EUR/uni00A024.3/uni00A0billion, driven by the net result of EUR/uni00A01.7/uni00A0billion. Higher interest rates and their negative impact on the revaluation reserve were largely offset by the favorable impact of currency movements. Aegon's shareholders' equity, excluding revaluation reserves, non-controlling interests and share options not yet exercised amounted to EUR/uni00A018.1/uni00A0billion on December 31, 2021, or EUR/uni00A08.71 per common share.\n\nGross financial leverage improved to EUR/uni00A05.9/uni00A0billion on December 31, 2021, compared with EUR/uni00A06.0/uni00A0billion on December 31, 2020. This reduction was primarily driven by the redemption of USD 250/uni00A0million floating rate perpetual capital securities. There was a/uni00A0partial offset from the strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro in 2021.\n\nCash Capital at Holding increased from EUR/uni00A01.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2020 to EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021. Free cash/uni00A0flows amounted to EUR/uni00A0729/uni00A0million for 2021. These Free cash flows were used to reduce leverage and pay dividends to Aegon's shareholders. Capital injections amounted to EUR/uni00A0125/uni00A0million and more than offset EUR/uni00A066/uni00A0million proceeds from divestments, notably/uni00A0Transamerica's portfolio of fintech and insurtech companies and Stonebridge in the United Kingdom.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, Aegon's estimated Group Solvency II ratio amounted to 211%, an increase of 15%-points since December 31, 2020. This was mainly due to the positive impact from operating capital generation, management actions including the longevity reinsurance for Aegon Levensverzekering N.V. (NL Life) in December 2021 and model and assumption changes - including an increased L A C- DT factor for NL Life. There was a/uni00A0partial offset from other one-time items, a/uni00A0slight negative impact from markets, external dividends and the impact of deleveraging.

        "page_content": "## Results 2021 Americas\n\nAegon's businesses in the Americas reported a/uni00A0net result of USD 1,195/uni00A0million compared with a/uni00A0net loss of USD 611/uni00A0million in 2020. The operating result increased by 3% compared with 2020 to USD 932/uni00A0million in 2021, as favorable morbidity experience, the impact of favorable market performance on fee income, and lower expenses more than offset the impact of adverse mortality experience. A positive result of USD 1,213/uni00A0million in non-operating items in 2021 was driven by fair value gains and realized gains on investments. This was partly offset by USD 789/uni00A0million other charges, mainly driven by management actions to release capital and increase the predictability of capital generation from the US variable annuity business.\n\n## Net result\n\nAegon's businesses in the Americas reported a/uni00A0net result of USD 1,195/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with a/uni00A0net loss of USD 611/uni00A0million in 2020. The increase in net result was largely driven by higher operating result, a/uni00A0higher non-operating result, and lower other charges. The operating result in 2021 of USD 932/uni00A0million increased by 3% compared with 2020. Non-operating items of USD 1,213/uni00A0million were driven by fair value gains and realized gains on investments. This was partly offset by USD 789/uni00A0million other charges, mainly driven by management actions to release capital and increase the predictability of capital generation from the US variable annuity business./uni00A0\n\nResults on fair value items amounted to a gain of USD 826 million in 2021, which was primarily related to the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 Gains/uni00A0on fair value investments of USD 752/uni00A0million, mainly driven by the outperformance of private equity and real estate.\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0result on fair value hedges with an accounting match - which includes the hedges of the variable annuities GMWB portfolio/uni00A0amounted to a/uni00A0gain of USD 146/uni00A0million caused by gains on unhedged risks.\n- \u00b7 Hedges/uni00A0without an accounting match under IFRS resulted in a/uni00A0loss of USD 72/uni00A0million. This was mainly driven by the macro hedge program net of reserve movements as a/uni00A0result of equity markets movements through the end of the third quarter of 2021, and losses on unhedged risks and unhedged volatility in indexed universal life. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, the dynamic hedge program was expanded to cover guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) and guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) riders, and the former macro hedge programs ended at the end of the third quarter 2021. Due to the accounting treatment for the GMIB and GMDB riders, the results related to the dynamic hedge on this block are reported as fair value hedges without accounting match.\n\nRealized gains on investments were USD 370/uni00A0million and were primarily due to asset sales, in part to fund investments in long-duration assets as part of the interest rate risk management plan. Net impairments amounted to a/uni00A0gain of USD 17/uni00A0million, reflecting gross impairments of USD 22/uni00A0million more than offset by recoveries./uni00A0\n\nOther charges of USD 789/uni00A0million in 2021 were mainly driven by a/uni00A0charge for the expansion of the variable annuity dynamic hedge program as well as the execution of the lump-sum buy-out program for variable annuities with guaranteed minimum income benefit riders, charges from model and assumption changes, and investments in the operational improvement plan. The model and assumption changes were mainly driven by more conservative assumptions for variable annuities surrender rates to reflect portfolio and industry experience. These charges were partly offset by a/uni00A0one-time gain related to changes in the employee pension plan./uni00A0\n\n## Operating result\n\nThe operating result in 2021 increased by 3% compared with 2020 to USD 932/uni00A0million as favorable morbidity experience in Accident & Health and the impact of favorable market performance in Mutual Funds, Variable Annuities and Retirement Plans and lower expenses offset the impact of adverse mortality in the Life business./uni00A0\n\nThe/uni00A0Individual Solutions operating result increased by 5% compared with 2020 to USD 668/uni00A0million, which was driven by the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0operating result from Life resulted in a/uni00A0loss of USD 111/uni00A0million in 2021 compared to an operating result of USD 3/uni00A0million in 2020. The Life operating result was impacted by adverse mortality of USD 384/uni00A0million, which was driven by larger claims at older ages in universal life products and elevated claims in universal life, traditional and term life products. USD 207/uni00A0million of these claims can specifically be attributed to COVID-19 as direct cause of death, and Aegon believes much of the remaining adverse mortality experience is indirectly related to COVID-19.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Accident & Health operating result of USD 356/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 305/uni00A0million in 2020, mainly due to favorable morbidity experience of USD 209/uni00A0million. Most of the favorable morbidity experience was related to the closed block of Long-Term Care insurance, where the actual to expected claim ratio amounted to 64% in 2021 compared to 79% in 2020. This was partly driven by the partial release of the incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserve in 2021 that had been set up in 2020, as new claims trended back to pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2021.\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0Mutual Funds operating result of USD 58/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 30/uni00A0million in 2020 due to an increase in fees from favorable market performance and net deposits./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0Variable Annuities operating result of USD 345/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 263/uni00A0million in 2020, driven by higher fees as a/uni00A0result of favorable equity market performance, partly offset by net outflows.\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0Fixed Annuities operating result of USD 20/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 39/uni00A0million in 2020, mainly due to the impact of lower interest rates on reinvestments and lower account balances.\n\nWorkplace Solutions operating result increased by 6% compared with 2020 to USD 268/uni00A0million, which was driven by the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 Life/uni00A0operating result of USD 13/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 23/uni00A0million in 2020, reflecting adverse mortality experience of USD 24/uni00A0million.\n- \u00b7 Accident/uni00A0& Health operating result of USD 21/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 56/uni00A0million in 2020, reflecting more normalized claims utilization driving morbidity claims to pre-pandemic levels.\n- \u00b7 Retirement/uni00A0Plans operating result of USD 156/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 95/uni00A0million in 2020, driven by higher investment income from transferring customer assets to higher yielding general account products, as well as higher fees driven by favorable market performance despite net outflows and continued margin pressure.\n- \u00b7 Stable/uni00A0Value Solutions operating result of USD 77/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 80/uni00A0million in 2020, due to the decrease in fee revenue from lower fee rates and notional balances.\n\nThe/uni00A0operating result from Brazil resulted in a/uni00A0loss of USD 3/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with an operating result of USD 11/uni00A0million in 2020, mainly due to increased COVID-19 claims.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses decreased by 2% compared with 2020 to USD 1.8 billion in 2021, reflecting a/uni00A0favorable one-time benefit from changes to the employee pension plan of USD 104 million, largely offset by higher restructuring expenses and one-time investments./uni00A0\n\nAddressable expenses decreased by 1% compared with 2020 to USD 1.5/uni00A0billion in 2021, driven by expense savings initiatives and lower expenses for travel, marketing, and sales activities due to COVID-19 related restrictions and cancellations in the first half of 2021 partially offset by higher technology expenses and higher expenses related to performance-related compensation accruals.\n\n## Sales\n\nNet outflows amounted to USD 20.7 billion in 2021 compared to net outflows of USD 22.2 billion in 2020. The net outflows in 2021 were mainly caused by Retirement Plans due to outflows in the low-margin Large-Market segment as well as participant withdrawals following favorable market performance in the Middle-Market segment. Variable Annuities and Fixed Annuities also saw outflows following product exits as these books mature.\n\nNew life sales increased by 17% to USD 508/uni00A0million in 2021 compared with USD 433/uni00A0million in 2020. Individual Solutions new life sales grew by 19% compared to 2020 to USD 360/uni00A0million. This was mainly driven by increased sales of whole life final expense and indexed universal life, supported by the funeral planning benefit for eligible indexed universal life policyholders, which led to an increase in the average premium per policy especially for sales in the World Financial Group (WFG) distribution channel. Transamerica's market share within the WFG distribution channel expanded during 2021, and at the same time the WFG licensed agent salesforce grew by 6% versus 2020. New Accident & Health premium production declined by 1% compared to 2020 to USD 152/uni00A0million. In Workplace Solutions, new Accident & Health premium production declined to USD 116/uni00A0million in 2021 from USD 123/uni00A0million in 2020. New Individual Solutions Accident & Health premium production increased to USD 36/uni00A0million from USD 32/uni00A0million reflecting higher individual long-term care sales in the state of Washington resulting from a/uni00A0change in legislation. Otherwise, the product remains closed.",

        "page_content": "## Results 2021 The Netherlands\n\nThe net result for the Netherlands decreased by 10% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0505/uni00A0million in 2021. This was primarily driven by negative non-operating items and/uni00A0Other charges in 2021, which more than offset an increase in the operating result. Non-operating items reflect the adverse impact from an increase in inflation expectations. Other charges in 2021, were in part driven by investments in the operational improvement plan. The increase in the operating result reflects the benefits/uni00A0from expense savings, business growth and an improved investment margin in/uni00A0the Life segment./uni00A0\n\n## Net result\n\nThe net result from the Netherlands amounted to EUR/uni00A0505/uni00A0million in 2021, driven by an operating result of EUR/uni00A0755/uni00A0million. Non-operating items amounted to a/uni00A0loss of EUR/uni00A044/uni00A0million in 2021, compared to a/uni00A0gain of EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0million in 2020. In 2021, a/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0201/uni00A0million loss from fair value items, was largely offset by EUR/uni00A0118/uni00A0million realized gains and EUR/uni00A040/uni00A0million net recoveries. The 2021 fair value items were driven by the adverse impact from an increase in inflation expectations. Realized gains on investments were driven by sales of sovereign bonds. Net recoveries mainly related to the Bank's unsecured loan portfolio. Other charges in 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A033/uni00A0million, and were driven by investments in the operational improvement plan, while the negative impact from model and assumption updates was offset by the release of a/uni00A0technical provision following a/uni00A0settlement related to a/uni00A0co-insurance contract. The result before tax in 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A0688/uni00A0million. After the tax charge of EUR/uni00A0183/uni00A0million, the net result for 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A0505/uni00A0million. The effective tax in 2021 was 27%./uni00A0\n\n## Operating result\n\nThe operating result from Aegon's operations in the Netherlands increased by 13% compared with 2020 to EUR 755/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0operating result from Life increased by 11% compared with 2020 to EUR 519/uni00A0million in 2021. The increase was driven by a/uni00A0higher investment margin - in turn mainly driven by lower interest rate credited - and by the favorable impact from expense savings initiatives. There was a/uni00A0partial offset from less favorable claims experience.\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0operating result from Mortgages increased by 39% compared with 2020 to EUR 71/uni00A0million in 2021, mainly due to higher fees resulting from business growth. Mortgages under administration increased by EUR 5/uni00A0billion in 2021 to EUR 60/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2021. Expense saving initiatives and higher revenues from customer pre-payment compensation also contributed favorably.\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0operating result from Banking rose by 2% compared with 2020 to EUR 115/uni00A0million in 2021. Higher fee income from growth in the number of fee-paying customers at Knab and the favorable impact from expense savings initiatives were partly offset by a/uni00A0lower interest income. The latter was primarily due to a/uni00A0reduction of the unsecured loan portfolio.\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0operating result from Workplace Solutions increased by 42% to EUR 50/uni00A0million in 2021. Improved results from the non-life business were the main driver, due to favorable claims experience in 2021 and reserve additions in 2020. This more than offset a/uni00A0decrease in revenue at TKP due to a/uni00A0large pension fund having left at the beginning of 2021.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses in 2021 decreased by 4% to EUR/uni00A0729/uni00A0million compared with 2020, mainly as a/uni00A0result of lower addressable expenses./uni00A0\n\nAddressable expenses went down from EUR/uni00A0633/uni00A0million in 2020 to EUR/uni00A0607/uni00A0million in 2021. This was driven by expense savings initiatives, which led to lower employee expenses, lower IT costs and lower costs of outsourced services. In addition, there was a/uni00A0benefit from lower pension cost for own employees driven by lower interest rates./uni00A0\n\n## Sales\n\nWorkplace Solutions net deposits decreased by 7% compared to 2020 to EUR/uni00A0739/uni00A0million in 2021, driven by a/uni00A0large contract win in 2020 year that did not reoccur in 2021. Net deposits continued to be positive due to continued demand for defined contribution products (PPI).\n\nNet outflows for the Bank amounted to EUR/uni00A01.0/uni00A0billion in 2021, while 2020 had positive net deposits of EUR/uni00A01.0/uni00A0billion. The growth in net deposits from new fee-paying Knab customers was more than offset by gross outflows mainly stemming from Aegon's decision to stop offering savings products to non-fee-paying customers. Due to low market interest rates, Aegon could not offer these savings",

These customers were offered the opportunity to either transfer their funds to another bank or transfer their funds to a/uni00A0fee-based Knab account./uni00A0\n\nMortgage origination decreased by 2% compared to 2020 to EUR 10.9 billion in 2021, of which EUR 6.9 billion was for third-party investors. Third-party investors pay Aegon a fee for originating and servicing these mortgages. The decrease in 2021 when compared to 2020 is driven by lower mortgage spreads in combination with Aegon's focus on maintaining attractive margins./uni00A0\n\nNew premium production for accident & health insurance amounted to EUR/uni00A010/uni00A0million in 2021, a/uni00A0decrease of EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0million compared to 2020. This decrease was mostly due to lower production within the group disability segment, reflecting lower commercial activity in the market compared to 2020. New premium production for property & casualty insurance increased by 40% to EUR/uni00A020/uni00A0million, driven by good commercial momentum, in particular in the Motor segment./uni00A0\n\nNew life sales decreased by 19% to EUR/uni00A074/uni00A0million, as expected, following the decision to classify the Dutch Life business as a/uni00A0Financial Asset and to close most products for new sales. The remaining sales were mostly from direct annuities, which are linked to Aegon's defined contribution business and remain a/uni00A0core product.",

        "page_content": "## Results 2021 United Kingdom\n\nThe net result for the United Kingdom increased by 75% compared to 2020 to GBP/uni00A0104/uni00A0million in 2021. The improvement was driven by a/uni00A0higher operating result and the non-recurrence of Other charges that impacted the 2020 result. The operating result in 2021 amounted to GBP 158/uni00A0million, which is an increase of GBP 24/uni00A0million compared with 2020 driven by higher fee revenues from favorable equity markets, and/uni00A0lower expenses.\n\n## Net result\n\nThe net result for the United Kingdom in 2021 amounted to GBP 104/uni00A0million, as the operating result was partially offset by fair value losses. The operating result rose by 24% compared with 2020 to GBP 158/uni00A0million in 2021. Fair value items amounted to a/uni00A0loss of GBP 53/uni00A0million and included fair value losses on hedges to protect the solvency position, and were driven by higher interest rates, higher equity markets and higher inflation. Gains on investments of GBP 9/uni00A0million resulted from the sale of bonds. Other income amounted to GBP 1/uni00A0million, as investments related to the performance improvement plan were more than offset by income related to policyholder taxes, which were fully offset by higher income taxes. The result before tax in 2021 amounted to GBP 115/uni00A0million and the income tax amounted to GBP 10/uni00A0million. The latter includes a/uni00A0charge related to the aforementioned policyholder taxes.\n\n## Operating result\n\nThe operating result rose by 24% compared with 2020 to GBP 158 million in 2021. The increase in operating result was mainly driven by higher fee revenues from the growth of the platform business and favorable equity markets, and provision releases along with lower expenses, which more than offset the impacts from the loss of earnings due to the sale of Stonebridge and the gradual run-off of the traditional product portfolio.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses amounted to GBP 386/uni00A0million in 2021, which was a/uni00A0decrease of 5% compared with 2020. This decrease was driven by both lower restructuring expenses and expense savings. Addressable expenses amounted to GBP 335/uni00A0million in 2021, which was a/uni00A0decrease of 2% compared with 2020. This decrease was driven by expense initiatives, which led to lower cost for contractors, external advisors and IT platforms, partially offset by higher employee expenses as more permanent staff were hired to facilitate growth.\n\n## Sales\n\nGross deposits increased by 178% compared with 2020 to GBP 21.3/uni00A0billion in 2021. Net deposits amounted to GBP 8.8/uni00A0billion compared with net outflows of GBP 3.2/uni00A0billion in 2020. Net deposits were driven by GBP 8.8/uni00A0billion net deposits on the Institutional business as well as GBP 1.5/uni00A0billion net deposits on the Workplace platform. For the Retail platform GBP 210/uni00A0million net outflows were recorded in 2021, an improvement compared with the GBP 1.1/uni00A0billion net outflows in 2020. The improved net deposits on the Workplace and Retail segments of the platform reflect stronger investor sentiment, as well as the benefits from investments in the business. New life sales decreased by 10% compared with 2020 to GBP 27/uni00A0million in 2021, reflecting the impact on protection sales as a/uni00A0result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The/uni00A0result before tax increased compared with 2020, as a/uni00A0higher operating result from/uni00A0Spain & Portugal, China and Aegon's high-net-worth business, TLB, more than offset a/uni00A0loss from non-operating items.\n\n## Net result\n\nThe net result from International decreased by 3% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0159/uni00A0million in 2021. A decrease in operating result and non-operating items was partly offset by an increase in other income for 2021 compared with 2020. The operating result decreased by 12% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0145/uni00A0million in 2021 as a/uni00A0result of the reclassification of the result of Aegon's businesses in Central & Eastern Europe from operating result to Other income, following the announced divestment of the business. Adjusting for this impact, the operating result increased compared with 2020, as a/uni00A0result of higher operating result from Spain & Portugal, China and Aegon's high-net-worth business, TLB. The loss from non-operating items of EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0million in 2021 was driven by a/uni00A0fair value loss as a/uni00A0result of the revaluation of an earn-out obligation in Central & Eastern Europe. Other income amounted to EUR/uni00A065/uni00A0million in 2021, and consisted predominantly of the result from Aegon's businesses in Central & Eastern Europe. Income tax in 2021 was EUR/uni00A036/uni00A0million, compared with EUR/uni00A022/uni00A0million in 2020, which included a/uni00A0one-time tax benefit.\n\n## Operating result\n\nOperating result from International decreased by 12% compared with 2020 to EUR 145/uni00A0million in 2021. The decrease reflects the reclassification of the result of Aegon's businesses in Central & Eastern Europe from operating result to Other income, following the announced divestment of the business. This was partly offset by higher results in Spain & Portugal, China and TLB.\n\n- \u00b7 Operating result from Spain & Portugal was EUR 75/uni00A0million, 41% higher compared with 2020. This was mainly driven by portfolio growth and favorable claims experience.\n- \u00b7 Operating/uni00A0result from China increased by 38% compared with 2020 to EUR 24/uni00A0million in 2021 largely reflecting a/uni00A0growing portfolio.\n- \u00b7 TLB, the high-net-worth business, recorded operating result of EUR 77/uni00A0million, an increase of EUR 20/uni00A0million compared with 2020. This was mainly driven by an improved investment margin, reflecting a/uni00A0lowering of the crediting rate with the aim to offset lower reinvestment yields and favorable claims experience. In addition, expense savings initiatives led to a/uni00A0decrease in expenses.\n- \u00b7 For the Others segment, the result decreased to a/uni00A0loss of EUR 31/uni00A0million, an EUR 67/uni00A0million decrease compared with 2020. This was largely due to the reclassification of the result of Central & Eastern Europe from operating result to Other income. This was partly offset by reduced regional expenses.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses decreased by 3% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0386/uni00A0million in 2021. This largely reflects lower restructuring expenses, lower sales expenses in China, and expense savings in Central & Eastern Europe.\n\nAddressable expenses decreased by 2% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0113/uni00A0million in 2021. This was driven by expense savings initiatives across the businesses.\n\n## Sales\n\nNet deposits decreased by EUR/uni00A0152/uni00A0million compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million in 2021, mainly reflecting the exclusion of net deposits from Central & Eastern Europe as of 2021./uni00A0\n\nTotal new life sales declined by 35% compared with 2020 to EUR 151/uni00A0million in 2021, mainly reflecting the exclusion of sales from Central & Eastern Europe as of 2021./uni00A0\n\n- \u00b7 New life sales from the China joint venture decreased by EUR 7/uni00A0million to EUR 90/uni00A0million in 2021 reflecting industry-wide lower demand for critical illness products.\n- \u00b7 For TLB, new life sales increased by EUR 3/uni00A0million to EUR 11/uni00A0million in 2021 driven by higher Index Universal Life sales following the launch of new, capital-light products.\n- \u00b7 Spain & Portugal increased by EUR 5/uni00A0million to EUR 48/uni00A0million in 2021 mainly due to sales growth in the bancassurance channel.\n- \u00b7 In/uni00A0the Other segment, new life sales decreased by EUR 82/uni00A0million to EUR 2/uni00A0million, largely reflecting the exclusion of sales from Central & Eastern Europe as of 2021, following the announced divestment of the business./uni00A0",

This/uni00A0more than offset higher expenses driven by accruals of performance-related compensation.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses increased by 14% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0552/uni00A0million in 2021. The increase is mainly caused by higher performance-based compensation in AIFMC, and higher expenses driven by AIFMC's business growth. For Global Platforms, expenses increased driven by investments related to the operational improvement plan and higher accruals for performance-related compensation. The operating margin in 2021 increased by 2% compared with 2020 supported by higher revenues as a/uni00A0result of net deposits and favorable markets.\n\nAddressable expenses increased by 3% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0371/uni00A0million in 2021. This increase was mainly driven by accruals of performance-related compensation and unfavorable currency movements. This was partly offset by lower administration expenses as a/uni00A0result of performance improvement initiatives.\n\n## Sales\n\nThird-party gross deposits increased by EUR/uni00A022/uni00A0billion or 16% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0157/uni00A0billion in 2021. This increase resulted from higher gross deposits in Strategic Partnerships, which increased by EUR/uni00A016/uni00A0billion compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0131/uni00A0billion in 2021. This was driven by new fund launches at AIFMC in 2021, and gross deposits into existing AIFMC funds. Global Platforms recorded gross deposits of EUR/uni00A026/uni00A0billion in 2021, which was an increase of EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0billion compared with 2020, mainly due to the fixed income platform.\n\n2021 was the tenth consecutive full year of positive third-party net deposits for Asset Management. Third-party net deposits more than doubled compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A012.9/uni00A0billion in 2021.

Third-party net deposits from Strategic Partnerships increased by EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0billion compared with 2020 driven by net deposits in AIFMC.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nAssets under management increased by 6% compared with 2020 to EUR/uni00A0410/uni00A0billion in 2021. This was mainly attributable to thirdparty net deposits and favorable market movements.",

Aegon/uni00A0N.V. serves as the holding company for the Aegon Group and has listings of its common shares in Amsterdam and New York.\n\nAegon/uni00A0N.V. (or 'the Company') and its subsidiaries ('Aegon' or 'the Group') have life insurance and pensions operations and are also active in savings and asset management operations, accident and health insurance, general insurance and to a/uni00A0limited extent banking operations. Aegon focuses on three core markets (the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), three growth markets (Spain & Portugal, China, and Brazil) and one global asset manager./uni00A0Furthermore, Aegon has activities in Asia and Southern and Eastern Europe./uni00A0Headquarters are located in The Hague, the Netherlands. The Group employs over 22,000 people worldwide (2020: over 22,000).\n\n## 2 Significant accounting policies 2.1 Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of (investment) properties and those financial instruments (including derivatives) and financial liabilities that have been measured at fair value. Information on the standards and interpretations that were adopted in 2021 is provided below in note 2.1.1. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest/uni00A0million unless otherwise stated. The consequence is that the rounded amounts may not add up to the rounded total in all cases. All ratios and variances are calculated using the underlying amount rather than the rounded amount./uni00A0\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with EU-IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates. Included among the material (or potentially material) reported amounts and disclosures that require extensive use of estimates are: fair value of certain invested assets and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs, value of business acquired and other purchased intangible assets, goodwill, policyholder claims and benefits, insurance guarantees, pension plans, income taxes and the potential effects of resolving litigation matters. Aegon applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging) under the European Union (EU) 'carve out' of EU-IFRS. Details are provided in note 2.9/uni00A0Derivatives and note 24 Derivatives.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Aegon/uni00A0N.V. were approved by the Executive Board and by the Supervisory Board on March/uni00A016,/uni00A02022. The financial statements will be put for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 31, 2022. The shareholders' meeting can decide not to adopt the financial statements but cannot amend them.\n\n## 2.1.1 Adoption of new EU-IFRS accounting standards and amendments effective in 2021\n\nNew standards and amendments to standards become effective at the date specified by EU-IFRS, but may allow companies to opt for an earlier adoption date. In 2021, the following amendments to existing standards issued by the IASB became mandatory:\n\n| Accounting standard/ amendment/ interpretation                                                        | IASB effective date   | Endorsed by EU   | Impact for Aegon       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2  (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)  | January 1, 2021       | Yes              | See below for comments |\n| Extension of the Temporary Exemption from Applying IFRS 9  (Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts) | January 1, 2021       | Yes              | See 2.1.2 for comments |\n| Early adopted:                                                                                        |                       |                  |                        |\n| COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021  (Amendment to IFRS 16)                         | April 1, 2021         | Yes              | Low                    |",

In accordance with the transition provisions, the Phase 1 amendments have been adopted retrospectively to hedging relationships that existed on January 1, 2019 or were designated thereafter. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements, thereby ensuring that uncertainty on the outcome of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR reform) does not result in early termination of hedge accounting, notably because the retrospective effectiveness may fall outside of the required range due to the IBOR reform. Please refer to note 24 Derivatives for the required disclosures of the uncertainty arising from IBOR reform for hedging relationships for which the Group applied the reliefs.\n\nIn 2021, 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)' became effective. The Phase 2 amendments provide temporary reliefs which address issues that might affect financial reporting during the IBOR reform, including the effects of changes to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships arising from the replacement of an interest rate benchmark with an alternative benchmark rate. The amendments had no material impact on the financial position or the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Aegon continues to follow the developments of IBOR reform and intends to use the Phase 2 reliefs when applicable. Please refer to note 4 Financial risks for the required disclosures.\n\n## 2.1.2 Future adoption of new EU-IFRS accounting standards and amendments\n\nThe following standards and amendments to existing standards, published prior to January 1, 2022, were not early adopted by the Group, but will be applied in future years:\n\n| Accounting standard/ amendment/ interpretation                                                                  | IASB effective date   | Endorsed  by EU   | Early adopted  by Aegon   | Impact for Aegon       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| IFRS 17 Insurance contracts                                                                                     | January 1, 2023       | Yes               | No                        | See below for comments |\n| Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative  Information (Amendments to IFRS 17)                    | January 1, 2023       | Not yet           | No                        | See below for comments |\n| IFRS 9 Financial instruments                                                                                    | January 1, 2018 1)    | Yes               | No                        | See below for comments |\n| Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation  (Amendments to IFRS 9)                                          | January 1, 2019 1)    | Yes               | No                        | See below for comments |\n| Reference to the Conceptual Framework  (Amendments to IFRS 3)                                                   | January 1, 2022       | Yes               | No                        | Low                    |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended  Use (Amendments to IAS 16)                             | January 1, 2022       | Yes               | No                        | Low                    |\n| Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a/uni00A0Contract  (Amendments to IAS 37)                                | January 1, 2022       | Yes               | No                        | Low                    |\n| Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020                                                                 | January 1, 2022       | Yes               | No                        | Low                    |\n| Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current  (Amendments to IAS 1)                                  | January 1, 2023       | Yes               | No                        | Low                    |\n| Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1  and IFRS Practice Statement 2)                          | January 1, 2023       | Not yet           | No                        | Low                    |\n| Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8)                                                        | January 1, 2023       | Yes               | No                        | Low                    |\n| Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from  a/uni00A0Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12) | January 1, 2023       | Not yet           | No                        | Low                    |",

        "page_content": "## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments\n\nThe IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in July 2014, which was endorsed by the European Union in November 2016. IFRS 9 combines classification and measurement, the expected credit loss impairment model and hedge accounting. The standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. Under IFRS 9 Classification and Measurement, financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value through profit or loss or fair value through other comprehensive income, based on both the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics. The classification and measurement of financial liabilities is unchanged from existing requirements apart from own credit risk. For financial liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss, the changes which are attributable to the change in an entity's own credit risk are presented in other comprehensive income, unless doing so would enlarge or create an accounting mismatch. For the impairment component, the IASB included requirements for a/uni00A0credit loss allowance or provision which should be based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.\n\nApplication of IFRS 9 is required for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. However, on May 18, 2017, the IASB published the final version of the IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts standard. Prior to its finalization, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (the predecessor standard to IFRS 17) that provides for a/uni00A0qualifying insurer a/uni00A0temporary exemption that permits, but does not require, the insurer to apply IAS 39 rather than IFRS 9 for annual periods beginning before January 1, 2021 (i.e., a/uni00A0temporary exemption of IFRS 9). The objective of the amendment is to address the temporary accounting consequences of the different effective dates of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17./uni00A0This amendment was endorsed by the European Union in November 2017.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the IASB decided, next to a/uni00A0number of significant amendments to the Standard, to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As a/uni00A0consequence of the IFRS 17 deferral, the IASB also agreed to revise the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 in IFRS 4 to allow entities to continue applying the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 until January 1, 2023.\n\nAn entity is eligible to apply the temporary exemption if the carrying amount of its liabilities connected with insurance activities is\n\n- \u00b7 Greater than 90% of the total carrying value of all liabilities; or\n- \u00b7 Between 80%/uni00A0and 90% of the total carrying value of all its liabilities, and the insurer does not have significant activities unrelated to insurance.\n\nAegon performed this analysis at December 31, 2015, and concluded that it meets the requirements for the temporary exception as 94% of its liabilities are connected with insurance activities. As a/uni00A0result, Aegon elected to make use of the temporary exemption of IFRS 9.\n\nAs Aegon defers the application of IFRS 9 (including linked amendments as included in above table), the full impact of the standard in combination with IFRS 17 is not yet clear, however an initial impact assessment resulted in the expectation that it will have a/uni00A0significant impact on shareholders' equity, income and/or other comprehensive income and disclosures. An implementation project was started in 2017 and is combined with the implementation of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.\n\nBy qualifying for and electing the temporary exemption, the IFRS 4 amendment requires certain additional disclosures; specifically, Aegon is required to disclose information to enable users of financial statements to compare insurers applying the temporary exemption with entities applying IFRS 9. This information is presented below:\n\n## Fair value changes\n\nThe table below presents an overview of the fair value of the classes of financial assets as of December 31, 2021, as well as the change in fair value during the reporting period. The asset classes are divided into two categories:\n\n- \u00b7 SPPI: assets of which cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on an outstanding principal amount, excluding any financial assets that meet the definition of held for trading in IFRS 9, or that are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a/uni00A0fair value basis; and\n- \u00b7 Other: all financial assets other than those specified in SPPI:\n- \u00b7 with contractual terms that do not give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding;\n- \u00b7 that meet the definition of held for trading in IFRS 9; or\n- \u00b7 that are managed and whose performance are evaluated on a/uni00A0fair value basis.",

The Standard will replace IFRS 4, which was intended as an interim solution and allowed insurers to continue to use accounting principles that they had applied prior to the initial adoption of IFRS. IFRS/uni00A017 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held and investment contracts with discretionary participating features issued. The objective of the Standard is to ensure that entities provide relevant information in a/uni00A0way that faithfully represents those contracts. This information should provide users of financial statements with a/uni00A0basis to assess the effects that the contracts have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the insurer. The Standard also specifies presentation and disclosure requirements to enhance comparability between insurance companies.\n\nOn June 25, 2020, the IASB decided, next to a/uni00A0number of significant amendments to the Standard, to defer the effective date of IFRS 17 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. As a/uni00A0consequence of the IFRS 17 deferral, the IASB also agreed to revise the fixed expiry date of the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 in IFRS 4 to allow entities to continue applying the temporary exemption from IFRS 9 until January 1, 2023. The EU has endorsed IFRS 17 including the June 25, 2020 amendments as per November 2021.\n\nThe Standard represents a/uni00A0fundamental change to current financial reporting and the implementation effort is significant. Aegon will not early adopt the Standard. An implementation project was started soon after the publication of the new Standard./uni00A0Based on the final/uni00A0amendments/uni00A0of June 2020 quantitative/uni00A0assessments are performed and these continued during 2021. In 2022, finalization of methodology and policy choices are expected and will also form the basis of parallel runs. The impact of the initial application on Aegon's financial statements is expected to be significant. Aegon will communicate to the market, once results are reliable, final methodology and policy choices with related impact. Formal communication is expected in the second half year of 2022.\n\n## 2.2 Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Aegon/uni00A0N.V. and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries (including consolidated structured entities) are entities over which Aegon has control. Aegon controls an entity when Aegon is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The assessment of control is based on the substance of the relationship between the Group and the entity and, among other things, considers existing and potential voting rights that are substantive. For a/uni00A0right to be substantive, the holder must have the practical ability to exercise that right.\n\nThe subsidiary's assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value on the acquisition date and are subsequently accounted for in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, which is consistent with EU-IFRS. Intra-group transactions, including Aegon/uni00A0N.V. shares held by subsidiaries, which are recognized as treasury shares in equity, are eliminated. Intra-group losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests are initially stated at their share in the fair value of the net assets on the acquisition date and subsequently adjusted for the non-controlling share in changes in the subsidiary's equity.\n\nThe excess of the consideration paid to acquire the interest and the fair value of any interest already owned, over the Group's share in the net fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognized as goodwill. Negative goodwill is recognized directly in the income statement. If the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in the business combination has been determined provisionally, adjustments to these values resulting from the emergence of new evidence within 12 months after the acquisition date are made against goodwill. Aegon recognized contingent considerations either as provision or as financial",

If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are stated at fair value when control is obtained.\n\nSubsidiaries are deconsolidated when control ceases to exist. Any difference between the net proceeds plus the fair value of any retained interest and the carrying amount of the subsidiary including non-controlling interests is recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Transactions with non-controlling interests\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners. Therefore disposals to non-controlling interests and acquisitions from non-controlling interests, not resulting in losing or gaining control of the subsidiary are recorded in equity. Any difference between consideration paid or received and the proportionate share in net assets is accounted for in equity attributable to shareholders of Aegon/uni00A0N.V.\n\n## Investment funds\n\nInvestment funds managed by the Group in which the Group holds an interest are consolidated in the financial statements if the Group has power over that investment fund and it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. In assessing control, all interests held by the Group in the fund are considered, regardless of whether the financial risk related to the investment is borne by the Group or by the policyholders (unless a/uni00A0direct link between the policyholder and the fund can be assumed).\n\nIn determining whether Aegon has power over an investment fund all facts and circumstances are considered, including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Control structure of the asset manager (i.e. whether an Aegon subsidiary);\n- \u00b7 The investment constraints posed by investment mandate;\n- \u00b7 Legal rights held by the policyholder to the separate assets in the investment vehicle (e.g. policyholders could have the voting rights related to these investments);\n- \u00b7 The governance structure, such as an independent board of directors, representing the policyholders, which has substantive rights (e.g. to elect or remove the asset manager); and\n- \u00b7 Rights held by other parties (e.g. voting rights of policyholders that are substantive or not).\n\nExposure or rights to variability of returns can be the result of, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 General account investment of Aegon;\n- \u00b7 Aegon's investments held for policyholder;\n- \u00b7 Guarantees provided by Aegon on return of policyholders in specific investment vehicles;\n- \u00b7 Fees dependent on fund value (including, but not limited to, asset management fees); and\n- \u00b7 Fees dependent on performance of the fund (including, but not limited to, performance fees).\n\nInvestment funds where Aegon acts as an agent are not consolidated due to lack of control of the funds. In particular, for some separate accounts, the independent board of directors has substantive rights and therefore Aegon does not have power over these separate accounts but acts as an agent.\n\nFor limited partnerships, the assessment takes into account Aegon's legal position (i.e. limited partner or general partner) and any substantive removal rights held by other parties. Professional judgment is applied concerning the substantiveness of the removal rights and the magnitude of the exposure to variable returns, leading to the conclusion that Aegon controls some, but not all, of the limited partnerships in which it participates.\n\nUpon consolidation of an investment fund, a/uni00A0liability is recognized to the extent that the Group is legally obliged to buy back participations held by third parties. The liability is presented in the consolidated financial statements as investment contracts for account of policyholders. Where no repurchase obligation exists, the participations held by third parties are presented as noncontrolling interests in equity. The assets allocated to participations held by third parties or by the Group on behalf of policyholders are presented in the consolidated financial statements as investments for account of policyholders.\n\nEquity instruments issued by the Group that are held by investment funds are eliminated on consolidation. However, the elimination is reflected in equity and not in the measurement of the related financial liabilities towards policyholders or other third parties.",

In these instances the tests and indicators to assess control provided by IFRS 10 have more focus on the purpose and design of the investee (with relation to the relevant activities that most significantly affect the structured entity) and the exposure to variable returns, which for structured entities lies in interests through e.g. derivatives, and will not be focused on entities that are controlled by voting rights.\n\nStructured entities that are consolidated include certain mortgage backed securitization deals, where Aegon was involved in the design of the structured entities and also has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the investee's returns. Other factors that contribute to the conclusion that consolidation of these entities is required includes consideration of whether Aegon fully services the investees and can therefore influence the defaults of the mortgage portfolios and the fact that in these cases the majority of risks are maintained by Aegon.\n\nStructured entities that are not consolidated include general account investments in non-affiliated structured entities that are used for investment purposes.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale and disposal groups\n\nDisposal groups are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in their present condition, subject only to the customary sales terms of such assets and disposal groups and their sale is considered highly probable. Management must be committed to the sale, which is expected to occur within one year from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\nUpon classification as held for sale, the carrying amount of the disposal group (or group of assets) is compared to their fair value less cost to sell. If the fair value less cost to sell is lower than the carrying value, this expected loss is recognized through a/uni00A0reduction of the carrying value of any goodwill related to the disposal group or the carrying value of certain other non-current, non-financial assets to the extent that the carrying value of those assets exceeds their fair value. Any excess of the expected loss over the reduction of the carrying amount of these relevant assets is not recognized upon classification as held for sale, but is recognized as part of the result on disposal if and when a/uni00A0divestment transaction occurs.\n\nClassification into or out of held for sale does not result in restating comparative amounts in the statement of financial position.\n\n## 2.3 Foreign exchange translation\n\n## a. Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. Items included in the financial statements of individual group companies are recorded in their respective functional currency which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n\nAt the reporting date, monetary assets and monetary liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the closing rate of exchange prevailing on that date, except for own equity instruments in foreign currencies which are translated using historical exchange rates. Non-monetary items carried at cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction, while assets carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate when the fair value was determined.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognized in the income statement when they arise, except when they are deferred in other comprehensive income as a/uni00A0result of a/uni00A0qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge. Exchange differences on non-monetary items carried at fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income or the income statement, consistently with other gains and losses on these items.\n\n## b. Translation of foreign currency operations\n\nOn consolidation, the financial statements of group entities with a/uni00A0foreign functional currency are translated to euro, the currency in which the consolidated financial statements are presented. Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rates on the reporting date. Income, expenses and capital transactions (such as dividends) are translated at average exchange rates or at the prevailing rates on the transaction date, if more appropriate. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a/uni00A0foreign entity are translated at the closing rates on the reporting date.",

On disposal of a/uni00A0foreign entity the related cumulative exchange differences included in the reserve are recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 2.4 Segment reporting\n\nReporting segments and segment measures are explained and disclosed in note 5 Segment information.\n\n## 2.5 Offsetting of assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset in the statement of financial position when the Group has a/uni00A0legally enforceable right to offset and has the intention to settle the asset and liability on a/uni00A0net basis or simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterpart.\n\n## 2.6 Intangible assets\n\n## a. Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is recognized as an intangible asset for interests in subsidiaries and is measured as the positive difference between the acquisition cost and the Group's interest in the net fair value of the entity's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Subsequently, goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment charges. It is derecognized when the interest in the subsidiary is disposed.\n\n## b. Value of business acquired\n\nWhen a/uni00A0portfolio of insurance contracts is acquired, whether directly from another insurance company or as part of a/uni00A0business combination, the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the insurance liabilities is recognized as value of business acquired (VOBA). The Group also recognizes VOBA when it acquires a/uni00A0portfolio of investment contracts with discretionary participation features.\n\nVOBA is amortized over the useful life of the acquired contracts, based on either the expected future premiums, revenues or the expected gross profit margins. The amortization period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date; any change in estimates is recorded in the income statement. For all products, VOBA, in conjunction with deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) where appropriate, is assessed for recoverability using aggregation levels on a/uni00A0geographical jurisdiction basis or at the level of portfolio of contracts that are subject to broadly similar risks and managed together as a/uni00A0single portfolio. The portion determined not to be recoverable is charged to the income statement. VOBA is considered in the liability adequacy test for each reporting period, for more details refer to 2.19.f Liability adequacy testing.\n\nWhen unrealized gains or losses arise on available-for-sale assets backing the insurance liabilities, VOBA is adjusted to equal the effect that the realization of the gains or losses (through a/uni00A0sale or impairment) would have had on VOBA. The adjustment is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity. VOBA is derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.\n\n## c. Future servicing rights\n\nOn the acquisition of a/uni00A0portfolio of investment contracts without discretionary participation features under which Aegon will render investment management services, the present value of future servicing rights is recognized as an intangible asset. Future servicing rights can also be recognized on the sale of a/uni00A0loan portfolio or the acquisition of insurance agency activities.\n\nThe present value of the future servicing rights is amortized over the servicing period and is subject to impairment testing. It is derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.\n\nWhere applicable, Aegon recognizes other intangibles on the acquisition of a/uni00A0business combination such as those related to customer relationships./uni00A0This can include customer contracts, distribution agreements and client portfolios. For these intangibles the present value of future cash flows are recognized and amortized in the period when future economic benefits arise from these intangibles. These intangible assets are also presented under future servicing rights.\n\n## d. Software and other intangible assets\n\nSoftware and other intangible assets are recognized to the extent that the assets can be identified, are controlled by the Group, are expected to provide future economic benefits and can be measured reliably. The Group does not recognize internally generated intangible assets arising from research or internally generated goodwill, brands, customer lists and similar items.",

Depreciation of the asset is over its useful life as the future economic benefits emerge and is recognized in the income statement as an expense. The depreciation period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date, with any changes recognized in the income statement.\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognized when it is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n\n## 2.7 Investments\n\nGeneral account investments comprise financial assets, excluding derivatives, as well as investments in real estate.\n\n## a. Financial assets, excluding derivatives\n\nFinancial assets are recognized at trade date (except for Private placements that are recognized at settlement date) when the Group becomes a/uni00A0party to the contractual provisions of the instruments. All financial assets are classified for accounting purposes depending on the characteristics of the instruments and the purpose for which they were purchased.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe following financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss: financial assets held for trading, financial assets managed on a/uni00A0fair value basis in accordance with the Group's investment strategy and financial assets containing an embedded derivative that is not closely related and that cannot be reliably bifurcated. In addition, in certain instances the Group designates financial assets to this category when by doing so a/uni00A0potential accounting mismatch in the financial statements is eliminated or significantly reduced.\n\nFinancial assets with fixed or determinable payments, that are not quoted in an active market and that the Group does not intend to sell in the near future are classified as loans. Those for which the holder may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than because of credit deterioration, are accounted for as available-for-sale.\n\nAll remaining non-derivative financial assets are classified as available-for-sale.\n\n## Measurement\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus, in the case of a/uni00A0financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable incremental transaction costs.\n\nLoans and financial assets held-to-maturity are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement as incurred. Available-for-sale assets are recorded at fair value with unrealized changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. Financial assets that are designated as hedged items are measured in accordance with the requirements for hedge accounting.\n\n## Amortized cost\n\nThe amortized cost of a/uni00A0debt instrument is the amount at which it is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization of any difference between the initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction for impairment. The effective interest rate method is a/uni00A0method of calculating the amortized cost and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the debt instrument or, when appropriate, a/uni00A0shorter period to the net carrying amount of the instrument. When calculating the effective interest rate, all contractual terms are considered. Possible future credit losses are not taken into account. Charges and interest paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts are included in the calculation.\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide information on the fair value of all financial assets, including those carried at amortized cost where the values are provided in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a/uni00A0liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a/uni00A0market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). For quoted financial assets for which there is an active market, the fair value is the bid price at the reporting date. In the absence of an active market, fair value is estimated by using present value based or other valuation techniques. Where discounting techniques are applied, the discount",

The valuation techniques that include unobservable inputs can result in a/uni00A0different outcome than the actual transaction price at which the asset was acquired. Such differences are not recognized in the income statement immediately but are deferred. They are released over time to the income statement in line with the change in factors (including time) that market participants would consider in setting a/uni00A0price for the asset. Interest accrued to date is not included in the fair value of the financial asset.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the asset's cash flows expire or when the Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset but has an obligation to pay any received cash flows in full without delay to a/uni00A0third party and either: has transferred the asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or has neither transferred nor retained all the risks and rewards but has transferred control of the asset. Financial assets of which the Group has neither transferred nor retained significantly all the risk and rewards and retained control are recognized to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement. If significantly all risks are retained, the assets are not derecognized.\n\nOn derecognition, the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized in the income statement as a/uni00A0realized gain or loss. Any cumulative unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in the revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity is also recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Security lending and repurchase agreements\n\nFinancial assets that are lent to a/uni00A0third party or that are transferred subject to a/uni00A0repurchase agreement at a/uni00A0fixed price are not derecognized as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset. A liability is recognized for cash (collateral) received, on which interest is accrued.\n\nA security that has been received under a/uni00A0borrowing or reverse repurchase agreement is not recognized as an asset. A receivable is recognized for any related cash (collateral) paid by Aegon. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as investment income. If the Group subsequently sells that security, a/uni00A0liability to repurchase the asset is recognized and initially measured at fair value.\n\n## Collateral\n\nWith the exception of cash collateral, assets received as collateral are not separately recognized as an asset until the financial asset they secure defaults. When cash collateral is recognized, a/uni00A0liability is recorded for the same amount.\n\n## b. Real estate\n\nInvestments in real estate include property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both. Investments in real estate are presented as 'Investments'. Property that is occupied by the Group and that is not intended to be sold in the near future is classified as real estate held for own use and is presented in 'Other assets and receivables'.\n\nAll property is initially recognized at cost. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the real estate and borrowing cost for longterm construction projects if recognition criteria are met. Subsequently, investments in real estate are measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Real estate held for own use is carried at its revalued amount, which is the fair value at the date of revaluation less subsequent accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a/uni00A0straight line basis over the useful life of a/uni00A0building. Land is not depreciated. Revaluation of real estate for own use is recognized in/uni00A0other comprehensive income and accumulated in revaluation reserve in equity. On revaluation the accumulated depreciation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount.\n\nOn disposal of an asset, the difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying amount is recognized in the income statement. Any remaining surplus attributable to real estate in own use in the revaluation reserve is transferred to retained earnings.\n\n## Maintenance costs and other subsequent expenditure\n\nExpenditure incurred after initial recognition of the asset is capitalized to the extent that the level of future economic benefits of the asset is increased. Costs that restore or maintain the level of future economic benefits are recognized in the income statement as incurred.",

        "page_content": "## 2.8 Investments for account of policyholders\n\nInvestments held for account of policyholders consist of investments in financial assets as well as investments in real estate. Investment return on these assets is passed on to the policyholder. Also included are the assets held by consolidated investment funds that are backing liabilities towards third parties. Investments for account of policyholders are valued at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 2.9 Derivatives\n\n## a. Definition\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments of which the value changes in response to an underlying variable, that often require little or no net initial investment and are settled at a/uni00A0future date.\n\nAssets and liabilities may include derivative-like terms and conditions. With the exception of features embedded in contracts held at fair value through profit or loss, embedded derivatives that are not considered closely related to the host contract are bifurcated, carried at fair value and presented as derivatives. In assessing whether a/uni00A0derivative-like feature is closely related to the contract in which it is embedded, the Group considers the similarity of the characteristics of the embedded derivative and the host contract. Embedded derivatives that transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for as insurance contracts.\n\nDerivatives with positive values are reported as assets and derivatives with negative values are reported as liabilities. Derivatives for which the contractual obligation can only be settled by exchanging a/uni00A0fixed amount of cash for a/uni00A0fixed amount of Aegon/uni00A0N.V. equity instruments are accounted for in shareholders' equity.\n\n## b. Measurement\n\nAll derivatives recognized on the statement of financial position are carried at fair value.\n\nThe fair value is calculated net of the interest accrued to date and is based on market prices, when available. When market prices are not available, other valuation techniques, such as option pricing or stochastic modeling, are applied. The valuation techniques incorporate all factors that market participants would consider and are based on observable market data, to the extent possible.\n\n## c. Hedge accounting\n\nAs part of its asset liability management, the Group enters into economic hedges to limit its risk exposure. These transactions are assessed to determine whether hedge accounting can and should be applied.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship is designated and formally documented at inception, detailing the particular risk management objective and strategy for the hedge (which includes the item and risk that is being hedged), the derivative that is being used and how hedge effectiveness is being assessed. A derivative has to be highly effective in accomplishing the objective of offsetting either changes in fair value or cash flows for the risk being hedged. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated on a/uni00A0prospective and retrospective basis using qualitative and quantitative measures of correlation. Qualitative methods may include comparison of critical terms of the derivative to the hedged item. Quantitative methods include a/uni00A0comparison of the changes in the fair value or discounted cash flow of the hedging instrument to the hedged item. A hedging relationship is considered highly effective if the results of the hedging instrument are within a/uni00A0ratio of 80% to 125% of the results of the hedged item.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and other interbank offered rates ('IBORs') has become a/uni00A0priority for global regulators. There is currently uncertainty around the timing and precise nature of these changes, in light of which the following assumptions have been made with respect to hedge accounting:\n\n- \u00b7 When considering the 'highly probable' requirement, it is assumed that the current benchmark interest rate on which the hedged positions is based will not change as a/uni00A0result of IBOR reform.\n- \u00b7 In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be 'highly effective' on a/uni00A0forward-looking basis, it is assumed that the current benchmark interest rate on which the cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative that hedges it are based is not altered as a/uni00A0result of the IBOR reform.\n- \u00b7 Hedge accounting is not discontinued during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective effectiveness falls outside the required 80-125% range.\n- \u00b7 For macro hedging the assessment whether the hedged risk component is a/uni00A0separately identifiable, is performed only when a/uni00A0hedged item is first included in the hedge and not on an ongoing basis.\n- \u00b7 The cash flows hedge reserve relating to the period after the IBOR reform is expected to take effect, is not recycled solely because cash flows are expected to change.",

        "page_content": "When the uncertainty arising from IBOR reform is no longer present with respect to the hedged risk or the timing and the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument, the hedge documentation is amended to reflect the changes required by IBOR reform (i.e. a/uni00A0change results directly from IBOR reform and occurs on an economically equivalent basis). For this purpose, the hedge designation is amended only to make one or more of the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 designating an alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk;\n- \u00b7 amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged;\n- \u00b7 amending the description of the hedging instrument; or\n- \u00b7 amending the description of the method for assessing hedge effectiveness.\n\nAmending the formal designation of a/uni00A0hedging relationship to reflect the changes required by IBOR reform constitutes neither the discontinuation of the hedging relationship nor the designation of a/uni00A0new hedging relationship.\n\nFor hedge accounting purposes, a/uni00A0distinction is made between fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and hedges of a/uni00A0net investment in a/uni00A0foreign operation.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in the profit and loss account, together with fair value adjustments to the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment of the hedged item is, in the case of interest bearing instruments, amortized through the profit and loss account over the remaining term of the original hedge or recognized directly when the hedged item is derecognized.\n\nAegon applies fair value hedge accounting to portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedging) under the EU 'carve out' of EU-IFRS. The EU 'carve out' macro hedging enables a/uni00A0group of derivatives (or proportions thereof) to be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument and removes some of the limitations in fair value hedge accounting. Under the EU 'carve out', ineffectiveness in fair value hedge accounting only arises when the revised projection of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the designated amount of that bucket. Aegon applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (macro hedging) under the EU 'carve out' to mortgage loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in the profit and loss account, together with the fair value adjustment on the mortgages (hedged items) insofar as attributable to interest rate risk (the hedged risk).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a/uni00A0particular risk of a/uni00A0forecasted transaction or a/uni00A0recognized asset or liability and could affect profit or loss. To the extent that the hedge is effective, the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity. Any ineffectiveness is recognized directly in the income statement. The amount recorded in shareholders' equity is released to the income statement to coincide with the hedged transaction, except when the hedged transaction is an acquisition of a/uni00A0non-financial asset or liability. In this case, the amount in shareholders' equity is included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nNet investment hedges are hedges of currency exposures on a/uni00A0net investment in a/uni00A0foreign operation. To the extent that the hedge is effective, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in the net foreign investment hedging reserve in shareholders' equity. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement. The amount in shareholders' equity is released to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively for hedges that are no longer considered effective. When hedge accounting is discontinued for a/uni00A0fair value hedge, the derivative continues to be carried on the statement of financial position with changes in its fair value recognized in the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued for a/uni00A0cash flow hedge because the cash flow is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gain or loss in shareholders' equity is recognized immediately in the income statement. In other situations where hedge accounting is discontinued for a/uni00A0cash flow hedge, including those where the derivative is sold, terminated or exercised, accumulated gains or losses in shareholders' equity are amortized into the income statement when the income statement is impacted by the variability of the cash flow from the hedged item.",

        "page_content": "## 2.10 Investments in joint arrangements\n\nIn general, joint arrangements are contractual agreements whereby the Group undertakes, with other parties, an economic activity that is subject to joint control. Joint control exists when it is contractually agreed to share control over an economic activity. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInvestments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Aegon has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nUnder the equity method of accounting, interests in joint ventures are initially recognized at cost, which includes positive goodwill arising on acquisition. Negative goodwill is recognized in the income statement on the acquisition date. If joint ventures are obtained in successive share purchases, each significant transaction is accounted for separately.\n\nThe carrying amount is subsequently adjusted to reflect the change in the Group's share in the net assets of the joint venture and is subject to impairment testing. The net assets are determined based on the Group's accounting policies. Any gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income by the joint venture are recognized in other comprehensive income and reflected in other reserves in shareholders' equity, while the share in the joint ventures net result is recognized as a/uni00A0separate line item in the consolidated income statement. The Group's share in losses is recognized until the investment in the joint ventures' equity and any other long-term interest that are part of the net investment are reduced to nil, unless guarantees exist.\n\nGains and losses on transactions between the Group and the joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity, with the exception of losses that are evidence of impairment which are recognized immediately. Own equity instruments of Aegon/uni00A0N.V. that are held by the joint venture are not eliminated.\n\nOn disposal of an interest in a/uni00A0joint venture, the difference between the net proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized in the income statement and gains and losses previously recorded directly in the revaluation reserve are reversed and recorded through the income statement.\n\n## 2.11 Investments in associates\n\nEntities over which the Group has significant influence through power to participate in financial and operating policy decisions, but which do not meet the definition of a/uni00A0subsidiary, are accounted for using the equity method. Interests held by venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds that qualify as an associate are accounted for as an investment held at fair value through profit or loss. Interests held by the Group in venture capital entities, mutual funds and investment funds that are managed on a/uni00A0fair value basis, are also accounted for as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nInterests in associates are initially recognized at cost, which includes positive goodwill arising on acquisition. Negative goodwill is recognized in the income statement on the acquisition date. If associates are obtained in successive share purchases, each significant transaction is accounted for separately.\n\nThe carrying amount is subsequently adjusted to reflect the change in the Group's share in the net assets of the associate and is subject to impairment testing. The net assets are determined based on the Group's accounting policies. Any gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income by the associate are reflected in other reserves in shareholders' equity, while the share in the associate's net result is recognized as a/uni00A0separate line item in the consolidated income statement. The Group's share in losses is recognized until the investment in the associate's equity and any other long-term interest that are part of the net investment are reduced to nil, unless guarantees exist.\n\nGains and losses on transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity, with the exception of losses that are evidence of impairment which are recognized immediately. Own equity instruments of Aegon/uni00A0N.V. that are held by the associate are not eliminated.\n\nOn disposal of an interest in an associate, the difference between the net proceeds and the carrying amount is recognized in the income statement and gains and losses previously recorded directly in the revaluation reserve are reversed and recorded through the income statement.",

Reinsurance assets are also held as part of exiting the business. For contracts transferring sufficient insurance risk, a/uni00A0reinsurance asset is recognized for the expected future benefits, less expected future reinsurance premiums. Reinsurance contracts with insufficient insurance risk transfer are accounted for as investment or service contracts, depending on the nature of the agreement.\n\nReinsurance assets are measured consistently with the assumptions associated with the underlying insurance contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract. They are subject to impairment testing and are derecognized when the contractual rights are extinguished or expire or when the contract is transferred to another party.\n\nAegon is not relieved of its legal liabilities when entering into reinsurance transactions, therefore the reserves relating to the underlying insurance contracts will continue to be reported on the consolidated statement of financial position during the contractual term of the underlying contracts.\n\nReinsurance premiums, commissions and claim settlements are accounted for in the same way as the original contracts for which the reinsurance was concluded. The insurance premiums for the original contracts are presented gross of reinsurance premiums paid.\n\n## 2.13 Deferred expenses\n\n## a. Deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC)\n\nDPAC relates to all insurance contracts as well as investment contracts with discretionary participation features and represents directly attributable costs that are related to the selling, underwriting and initiating of these insurance contracts.\n\nDPAC are deferred to the extent that they are recoverable and are subsequently amortized based on factors such as expected gross profit margins. For products sold in the United States and Asia with amortization based on expected gross profit margins or revenues, the amortization period and pattern are reviewed at each reporting date and any change in estimates is recognized in the income statement. Estimates include, but are not limited to: an economic perspective in terms of future returns on bond and equity instruments, mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions, maintenance expenses and expected inflation rates.\n\nFor all products, DPAC, in conjunction with VOBA where appropriate, is assessed for recoverability at least annually as part of the liability adequacy test for each reporting period. If appropriate, the assumptions included in the determination of estimated gross profits or revenues are adjusted. The portion of DPAC that is determined not to be recoverable is charged to the income statement.\n\nFor products sold in the United States and Asia, when unrealized gains or losses arise on available-for-sale assets backing the insurance liabilities, DPAC is adjusted to equal the effect that the realization of the gains or losses (through sale or impairment) would have had on its measurement. This is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity.\n\nDPAC is derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.\n\n## b. Deferred cost of reinsurance\n\nA deferred cost of reinsurance is established when Aegon enters into a/uni00A0reinsurance transaction, except for reinsurance transactions that are entered into as part of a/uni00A0plan to exit a/uni00A0business. When Aegon enters into a/uni00A0reinsurance contract as part of a/uni00A0plan to exit a/uni00A0business, an immediate loss is recognized in the income statement. Upon reinsurance, Aegon is not relieved of its legal liabilities, so the reserves relating to the underlying reinsured contracts will continue to be reported in the consolidated statement of financial position during the contractual term of the underlying contracts.\n\nThe difference, if any, between amounts paid in a/uni00A0reinsurance transaction and the amount of the liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured contracts is part of the deferred cost of reinsurance.\n\nWhen losses on buying reinsurance are deferred, the amortization is based on the assumptions of the underlying insurance contracts. In the Netherlands, the amortization is based on the percentage of premium paid on the reinsurance contract. For products sold in the Americas and Asia where the amortization is based on expected gross profit margins (EGPs), these EGPs will be net of reinsurance (i.e., net of actual reinsurance cash flows that exceed expected reinsurance cash flows). The amortization is recognized in the income statement.",

Deferred transaction costs\n\nDeferred transaction costs relate to investment contracts without discretionary participation features under which Aegon will render investment management services. Incremental costs that are directly attributable to securing these investment management contracts are recognized as an asset if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and if it is probable that they will be recovered.\n\nFor contracts involving both the origination of a/uni00A0financial liability and the provision of investment management services, only the transaction costs allocated to the servicing component are deferred. The other transaction costs are included in the carrying amount of the financial liability.\n\nThe deferred transaction costs are amortized in line with fee income, unless there is evidence that another method better represents the provision of services under the contract. The amortization is recognized in the income statement. Deferred transaction costs are subject to impairment testing at least annually.\n\nDeferred transaction costs are derecognized when the related contracts are settled or disposed.\n\n## 2.14 Other assets and receivables\n\nOther assets include trade and other receivables, prepaid expenses, equipment and real estate held for own use. Trade and other receivables are initially recognized at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Equipment is initially carried at cost, depreciated on a/uni00A0straight line basis over its useful life to its residual value and is subject to impairment testing. The accounting for real estate held for own use is described in note 2.7 Investments.\n\n## 2.15 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash at banks and in-hand. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments generally with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known cash amounts, are subject to insignificant risks of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash requirements. Money market investments that are held for investment purposes (backing insurance liabilities, investment liabilities or equity based on asset liability management considerations) are not included in cash and cash equivalents but are presented as investments or investments for account of policyholders.\n\n## 2.16 Impairment of assets\n\nAn asset is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the amount that would be recovered through its use or sale. For tangible and intangible assets, financial assets and reinsurance assets, if not held at fair value through profit or loss, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated when there are indications that the asset may be impaired. Irrespective of the indications, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life that are not amortized, are tested at least annually.\n\nThere are a/uni00A0number of significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the process of monitoring investments and determining if impairment exists. These risks and uncertainties include the risk that the Group's assessment of an issuer's ability to meet all of its contractual obligations will change based on changes in the credit characteristics of that issuer and the risk that the economic outlook will be worse than expected or have more of an impact on the issuer than anticipated. Any of these situations could result in a/uni00A0charge against the income statement to the extent of the impairment charge recorded.\n\n## a. Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets are tested individually for impairment when there are indications that the asset may be impaired. For goodwill and intangible assets with an undefined life, an impairment test is performed at least once a/uni00A0year or more frequently as a/uni00A0result of an event or change in circumstances that would indicate an impairment charge may be necessary. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying and the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of an asset's value in use and its fair value less cost of disposal. The value in use represents the discounted future net cash flows from the continuing use and ultimate disposal of the asset and reflects its known inherent risks and uncertainties. The valuation utilizes the best available information, including assumptions and projections considered reasonable and supportable by management. The assumptions used in the valuation involve significant judgments and estimates. Refer to note 29 Intangible assets for more details.\n\nImpairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income to the extent that they offset a/uni00A0previously recorded revaluation reserve relating to the same item. Any further losses are recognized directly in the income statement. Impairment of deferred policy acquisition costs is included in note 15 Impairment charges/(reversals).\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, impairment losses are reversed when there is evidence that there has been a/uni00A0change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the recognition of the last impairment loss. The reversal is recognized",

        "page_content": "in the income statement to the extent that it reverses impairment losses previously recognized in the income statement. The carrying amount after reversal cannot exceed the amount that would have been recognized had no impairment taken place.\n\nNon-financial assets that only generate cash flows in combination with other assets and liabilities are tested for impairment at the level of the cash-generating unit. The goodwill acquired in a/uni00A0business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The allocation is based on the level at which goodwill is monitored internally and cannot be larger than an operating segment. When impairing a/uni00A0cash-generating unit, any goodwill allocated to the unit is first written-off and recognized in the income statement. The remaining impairment loss is allocated on a/uni00A0pro rata basis among the other assets, on condition that the resulting carrying amounts do not fall below the individual assets' recoverable amounts.\n\n## b. Impairment of debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments are impaired if there is objective evidence that a/uni00A0credit event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset that has a/uni00A0negative impact on the estimated future cash flows. Individually significant loans and other receivables are first assessed separately. All non-impaired assets measured at amortized cost are then grouped by credit risk characteristics and collectively tested for impairment.\n\nFor debt instruments carried at amortized cost, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is reduced through an allowance account. The impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying and recoverable amount of the investment. The recoverable amount is determined by discounting the estimated probable future cash flows at the original effective interest rate of the asset. For variable interest debt instruments, the current effective interest rate under the contract is applied.\n\nFor debt instruments classified as available-for-sale, the asset is impaired to its fair value. Any unrealized loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is taken to the income statement in the impairment loss. After impairment the interest accretion on debt instruments is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.\n\nImpairment losses recognized for debt instruments can be reversed if in subsequent periods the amount of the impairment loss decreases and that decrease can be objectively related to a/uni00A0credit event occurring after the impairment was recognized. For debt instruments carried at amortized cost, the carrying amount after reversal cannot exceed what the amortized cost would have been at the reversal date, had the impairment not been recognized.\n\n## c. Impairment of equity instruments\n\nFor equity instruments, objective evidence of impairment of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale includes information about significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the issuer operates, and indicates that the cost of the investment in the equity instrument may not be recovered. A significant or prolonged decline in fair value below initial cost is also considered objective evidence of impairment and always results in a/uni00A0loss being recognized in the income statement. Significant or prolonged decline is defined as an unrealized loss position for generally more than six months or a/uni00A0fair value of less than 80% of the cost price of the investment. Equity investments are impaired to the asset's fair value and any unrealized gain or loss previously recognized in shareholders' equity is taken to the income statement as an impairment loss. The amount exceeding the balance of previously recognized unrealized gains or losses is recognized in the income statement. If an available-for- sale equity security is impaired based upon Aegon's qualitative or quantitative impairment criteria, any further declines in the fair value at subsequent reporting dates are recognized as impairments. Therefore, at each reporting period, for an equity security that is determined to be impaired based upon Aegon's impairment criteria, an impairment is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the original cost basis, less any previously recognized impairments.\n\nImpairment losses on equity instruments cannot be reversed.\n\n## d. Impairment of reinsurance assets\n\nReinsurance assets are impaired if there is objective evidence, as a/uni00A0result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that not all amounts due under the terms of the contract may be received. In such a/uni00A0case, the value of the reinsurance asset recoverable is determined based on the best estimate of future cash flows, taking into consideration the reinsurer's current and expected future financial conditions plus any collateral held in trust for Aegon's benefit. The carrying value is reduced to this calculated recoverable value, and the impairment loss recognized in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 2.17 Equity\n\nFinancial instruments that are issued by the Group are classified as equity if they represent a/uni00A0residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and the Group has an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle its contractual obligation. In addition to common shares, the Group has issued perpetual securities. Perpetual securities have no final maturity date, repayment is at the discretion of Aegon and for junior perpetual capital securities, Aegon has the option to defer coupon payments at its discretion. The perpetual capital securities are classified as equity rather than debt, are measured at par and those that are denominated in US dollars are translated into euro using historical exchange rates.\n\nNon-cumulative subordinated notes were identified as a/uni00A0compound instrument due to the nature of this financial instrument. For these non-cumulative subordinated notes, Aegon had an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle the coupon payments. The redemption of the principal was however not at the discretion of Aegon and therefore Aegon had a/uni00A0contractual obligation to settle the redemption in cash or another financial asset or through the exchange of financial assets and liabilities at potentially unfavorable conditions for Aegon. Compound instruments were separated into liability components and equity components. The liability component for the non-cumulative subordinated notes was equal to the present value of the redemption amount and carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method./uni00A0The unwinding of the discount of this component was recognized in the income statement. At initial recognition the equity component was assigned the residual amount after deducting the liability component from the fair value of the instrument as a/uni00A0whole. The equity component in US dollars was translated into euro using historical exchange rates.\n\nIncremental external costs that are directly attributable to the issuing or buying back of own equity instruments are recognized in equity, net of tax. For compound instruments incremental external costs that were directly attributable to the issuing or buying back of the compound instruments were recognized proportionate to the equity component and liability component, net of tax.\n\nThe Group recognizes the income tax consequences of dividends in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where it originally recognized the past transactions or events that generated the distributable profits./uni00A0A liability for non-cumulative dividends payable is not recognized until the dividends have been declared and approved.\n\nTreasury shares are shares issued by Aegon/uni00A0N.V. that are held by Aegon, one of its subsidiaries or by another entity controlled by Aegon. Treasury shares are deducted from Group equity, regardless of the objective of the transaction. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the instruments. If sold, the difference between the carrying amount and the proceeds is reflected in retained earnings. The consideration paid or received is recognized directly in shareholders' equity. All treasury shares are eliminated in the calculation of earnings per share and dividend per common share.\n\n## 2.18 Trust pass-through securities and (subordinated) borrowings\n\nA financial instrument issued by the Group is classified as a/uni00A0liability if the contractual obligation must be settled in cash or another financial asset or through the exchange of financial assets and liabilities at potentially unfavorable conditions for the Group.\n\nTrust pass-through securities and (subordinated) borrowings are initially recognized at their fair value including directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, with the exception of specific borrowings that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate, or significantly reduce, an accounting mismatch, or specific borrowings which are carried as at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and evaluated on a/uni00A0fair value basis. The liability is derecognized when the Group's obligation under the contract expires, is discharged or is cancelled.\n\nSubordinated borrowings include the liability component of non-cumulative subordinated notes. These notes are identified as a/uni00A0compound instrument due to the nature of this financial instrument. Compound instruments are separated into equity components and liability components. The liability component for the non-cumulative subordinated notes is related to the redemption amount. For further information on the accounting policy of the non-cumulative subordinated notes refer to note 2.17 Equity.\n\n## 2.19 Insurance contracts\n\nInsurance contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. In accordance with this standard, Aegon continues to apply the existing accounting policies that were applied prior to the adoption of EU-IFRS with certain modifications allowed by IFRS 4 for standards effective subsequent to adoption. Aegon applies, in general, non-uniform accounting policies for insurance liabilities and insurance related intangible assets to the extent that it was allowed under Dutch Accounting Principles. As a/uni00A0result, specific methodologies applied may differ between Aegon's operations as they may reflect local regulatory requirements and local practices for specific product features in these local markets. At the time of EU-IFRS adoption, Aegon was applying US GAAP for its United States operations whereas in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, Aegon was applying Dutch Accounting Principles.

        "page_content": "of EU-IFRS, Aegon has considered new and amended standards in those GAAPs which have become effective subsequent to the date of transition to EU-IFRS. If any changes are made to current accounting policies for insurance contracts, these will be in accordance with IFRS 4.\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts under which the Group accepts a/uni00A0significant risk - other than a/uni00A0financial risk - from a/uni00A0policyholder by agreeing to compensate the beneficiary on the occurrence of an uncertain future event by which he or she will be adversely affected. Contracts that do not meet this definition are accounted for as investment contracts. The Group reviews homogeneous books of contracts to assess whether the underlying contracts transfer significant insurance risk on an individual basis. This is considered the case when at least one scenario with commercial substance can be identified in which the Group has to pay significant additional benefits to the policyholder. Contracts that have been classified as insurance are not reclassified subsequently.\n\nInsurance liabilities are recognized when the contract is entered into and the premiums are charged. The liability is derecognized when the contract expires, is discharged, disposed or cancelled. Within the United States, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, substantially modified contracts are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original liability and the recognition of a/uni00A0new liability.\n\nInsurance assets and liabilities are valued in accordance with the accounting principles that were applied by the Group prior to the transition to EU-IFRS and with consideration of standards effective subsequent to the date of transition to EU-IFRS, as further described in the following paragraphs. In order to reflect the specific nature of the products written, subsidiaries are allowed to apply local accounting principles to the measurement of insurance contracts. All valuation methods used by the subsidiaries are based on the general principle that the carrying amount of the net liability must be sufficient to meet any reasonably foreseeable obligation resulting from the insurance contracts.\n\n## a. Life insurance contracts\n\nLife insurance contracts are insurance contracts with life-contingent benefits. The measurement of the liability for life insurance contracts varies depending on the nature of the product.\n\nLiabilities arising from traditional life insurance products that are offered by Aegon, particularly those with fixed and guaranteed account terms, are typically measured using the net premium method. Under this method the liability is determined as the sum of the discounted value of the expected benefits and future administration expenses directly related to the contract, less the discounted value of the expected theoretical premiums that would be required to meet the future cash outflows based on the valuation assumptions used. The liability is either based on current assumptions or calculated using the assumptions established at the time the contract was issued, in which case a/uni00A0margin for risk and adverse deviation is generally included. Furthermore, the liability for life insurance comprises reserves for unearned premiums and accrued annuity benefits payable.\n\nDepending on local accounting principles, the liability may include amounts for future services on contracts where the policy administration charges are higher in the initial years than in subsequent years.\n\nTerms and conditions, including participation features, are considered when establishing the insurance liabilities. Where the Group has discretion over the amount or timing of the bonuses distributed resulting from participation features, a/uni00A0liability is recognized equal to the amount that is available at the reporting date for future distribution to policyholders.\n\nIn establishing the liability, guaranteed minimum benefits issued to the policyholder are measured as described in note 2.19.c Embedded derivatives or, if bifurcated from the host contract, as described in note 2.9 Derivatives.\n\n## b. Life insurance contracts for account of policyholders\n\nLife insurance contracts under which the policyholder bears the risks associated with the underlying investments are classified as insurance contracts for account of policyholders.\n\nThe liability for the insurance contracts for account of policyholders is measured at the policyholder account balance. Contracts with unit-denominated payments are measured at current unit values, which reflect the fair values of the assets of the fund. If applicable, the liability representing the nominal value of the policyholder unit account is amortized over the term of the contract so that interest on actuarial funding is at an expected rate of return.",

        "page_content": "## c. Embedded derivatives\n\nLife insurance contracts may include derivative-like terms and conditions. With the exception of policyholder options to surrender the contract at a/uni00A0fixed amount, contractual features that are not closely related to the insurance contract and that do not themselves meet the definition of insurance contracts are accounted for as derivatives.\n\n## Guaranteed minimum benefits\n\nCertain life insurance contracts, issued by the Group, contain guaranteed minimum benefits. Bifurcated guaranteed minimum benefits are classified as derivatives.\n\nIn the United States, the additional liability for guaranteed minimum benefits that are not bifurcated is determined each period by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The estimates are reviewed regularly and any resulting adjustment to the additional liability is recognized in the income statement. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are commonly based on the average benefits payable over a/uni00A0range of stochastic scenarios. Where applicable, the calculation of the liability incorporates a/uni00A0percentage of the potential annuitizations that may be elected by the contract holder.\n\nIn the Netherlands, an additional liability is established for guaranteed minimum investment returns on group pension plans with profit sharing and on traditional insurance contracts, with profit sharing based on an external interest index, that are not bifurcated. These guarantees are measured at fair value.\n\n## d. Shadow accounting\n\nShadow accounting allows that all gains and losses on investments affect the measurement of the insurance assets and liabilities in the same way, regardless of whether they are realized or unrealized and regardless of whether the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the income statement or/uni00A0through other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve. In some instances, realized gains or losses on investments have a/uni00A0direct effect on the measurement of the insurance assets and liabilities. For example, some insurance contracts include benefits that are contractually based on the investment returns realized by the insurer. In addition, realization of gains or losses on available-for-sale investments can lead to unlocking of VOBA or DPAC and can also affect the outcome of the liability adequacy test to the extent that it considers actual future investment returns. For similar changes in unrealized gains and losses, shadow accounting is applied. If an unrealized gain or loss triggers a/uni00A0shadow accounting adjustment to VOBA, DPAC or the insurance liabilities, the corresponding adjustment is recognized through other comprehensive income in the revaluation reserve, together with the unrealized gain or loss.\n\nSome profit sharing schemes issued by the Group entitle the policyholder to a/uni00A0bonus which is based on the actual total return on specific assets held. To the extent that the bonus relates to gains or losses on available-for-sale investments for which the unrealized gains or losses are recognized/uni00A0through other comprehensive income/uni00A0in the revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity, shadow accounting is applied. This means that the increase in the liability is also charged through other comprehensive income/uni00A0to shareholders' equity to offset the unrealized gains rather than to the income statement.\n\n## e. Non-life insurance contracts\n\nNon-life insurance contracts are insurance contracts where the insured event is not life-contingent. For non-life products the insurance liability generally includes reserves for unearned premiums, unexpired risk, inadequate premium levels and outstanding claims and benefits. No catastrophe or equalization reserves are included in the measurement of the liability.\n\nThe reserve for unearned premiums includes premiums received for risks that have not yet expired. Generally, the reserve is released over the coverage period of the premium and is recognized as premium income.\n\nThe liability for outstanding claims and benefits is established for claims that have not been settled and any related cash flows, such as claims handling costs. It includes claims that have been incurred but have not been reported to the Group. The liability is calculated at the reporting date using statistical methods based on empirical data and current assumptions that may include a/uni00A0margin for adverse deviation. Liabilities for claims subject to periodic payment are calculated using actuarial methods consistent with those applied to life insurance contracts. Discounting is applied if allowed by the local accounting principles used to measure the insurance liabilities. Discounting of liabilities is generally applied when there is a/uni00A0high level of certainty concerning the amount and settlement term of the cash outflows.",

        "page_content": "## f. Liability adequacy testing\n\nAt each reporting date, the adequacy of the life insurance liabilities (including life insurance contracts for account of policyholders), net of VOBA and DPAC, is assessed using a/uni00A0liability adequacy test.\n\nAll tests performed within the Group are based on current estimates of all contractual future cash flows, including related cash flows from policyholder options and guarantees. A number of valuation methods are applied, including discounted cash flow methods, option pricing models and stochastic modeling. Aggregation levels are set either on geographical jurisdiction or at the level of portfolio of contracts that are subject to broadly similar risks and managed together as a/uni00A0single portfolio./uni00A0Specifically, in the Netherlands the liability adequacy test is performed on a/uni00A0consolidated basis for all life and non-life business, whereas in the Americas and the UK it is performed at the level of the portfolio of contracts. To the extent that the tests involve discounting of future cash flows, the interest rate applied is based on market rates or is based on management's expectation of the future return on investments. These future returns on investments take into account management's best estimate related to the actual investments and, where applicable, reinvestments of these investments at maturity. Aegon the Netherlands, as required locally, adjusts the outcome of the liability adequacy test for the difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets that are measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. For details on the fair value (measurement) of Aegon's assets and liabilities, please refer to note 44 Fair value. Only differences between the fair value and the book value build up during the period when the assets were allocated to the insurance portfolio are included in the LAT.\n\nTo the extent that the account balances are insufficient to meet future benefits and expenses, any resulting deficiency is recognized in the income statement, initially by impairing the DPAC and VOBA and subsequently by establishing an insurance liability for the remaining loss, unless shadow loss recognition has taken place./uni00A0In the Netherlands, in situations where market interest rates for the valuation of debt securities lead to a/uni00A0change in the revaluation reserve, and where the result of using the same assumptions for the liabilities could lead to a/uni00A0deficiency in the liability adequacy test that should be recognized in the income statement, shadow loss recognition is applied. Shadow loss recognition is applied to the extent that the deficiency of the insurance liabilities relates to the revaluation of debt securities as a/uni00A0result of movements in interest rates, the addition to the insurance liabilities is then offset against the revaluation reserve. If in subsequent periods such a/uni00A0deficiency of the insurance liability is no longer applicable, shadow loss recognition is reversed via the revaluation reserve.\n\nThe adequacy of the non-life insurance liability is tested at each reporting date. Changes in expected claims that have occurred, but that have not been settled, are reflected by adjusting the liability for claims and future benefits. The reserve for unexpired risk is increased to the extent that the future claims and expenses in respect of current insurance contracts exceed the future premiums plus the current unearned premium reserve.\n\n## 2.20 Investment contracts\n\nAegon conducts its operations through the following type of investment contracts:\n\nContracts issued by the Group that do not transfer significant insurance risk, but do transfer financial risk from the policyholder to the Group are accounted for as investment contracts. Depending on whether the Group or the policyholder runs the risks associated with the investments allocated to the contract, the liabilities are classified as investment contracts or as investment contracts for account of policyholders. Investment contract liabilities are recognized when the contract is entered into and are derecognized when the contract expires, is discharged, cancelled or substantially modified.\n\n## a. Investment contracts with discretionary participation features\n\nSome investment contracts have participation features whereby the policyholder has the right to receive potentially significant additional benefits which are based on the performance of a/uni00A0specified pool of investment contracts, specific investments held by the Group or on the issuer's net result. If the Group has discretion over the amount or timing of the distribution of the returns to policyholders, the investment contract liability is measured based on the accounting principles that apply to insurance contracts with similar features.\n\nSome unitized investment contracts provide policyholders with the option to switch between funds with and without discretionary participation features. The entire contract is accounted for as an investment contract with discretionary participation features if there is evidence of actual switching resulting in discretionary participation benefits that are a/uni00A0significant part of the total contractual benefits.",

Investment contracts without discretionary participation features\n\nAt inception, investment contracts without discretionary participation features are carried at amortized cost.\n\nInvestment contracts without discretionary participation features are carried at amortized cost based on the expected cash flows and using the effective interest rate method. The expected future cash flows are re-estimated at each reporting date and the carrying amount of the financial liability is recalculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using the financial liability's original effective interest rate. Any adjustment is immediately recognized in the income statement. For these investment contracts deposit accounting is applied, meaning that deposits are not reflected as premium income, but are recognized as part of the financial liability.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide information on the fair value of all financial liabilities, including those carried at amortized cost. As these contracts are not quoted in active markets, their value is determined by using valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow methods and stochastic modeling. For investment contracts without discretionary participation features that can be cancelled by the policyholder, the fair value cannot be less than the surrender value.\n\n## c. Investment contracts for account of policyholders\n\nInvestment contracts for account of policyholders are investment contracts for which the actual return on investments allocated to the contract is passed on to the policyholder. Also included are participations held by third parties in consolidated investment funds that meet the definition of a/uni00A0financial liability.\n\nInvestment contracts for account of policyholders are designated at fair value through profit or loss. Contracts with unit-denominated payments are measured at current unit values, which reflect the fair values of the assets of the fund.\n\nFor unit-linked contracts without discretionary participation features and subject to actuarial funding, the Group recognizes a/uni00A0liability at the funded amount of the units. The difference between the gross value of the units and the funded value is treated as an initial fee paid by the policyholder for future asset management services and recognized as a/uni00A0deferred revenue liability, refer to note 2.23 Deferred gains.\n\n## 2.21 Provisions\n\nA provision is recognized for present legal or constructive obligations arising from past events, when it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits and the amount can be reliably estimated. Management exercises judgment in evaluating the probability that a/uni00A0loss will be incurred.\n\nThe amount recognized as a/uni00A0provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, considering all its inherent risks and uncertainties, as well as the time value of money. The estimate of the amount of a/uni00A0loss requires management judgment in the selection of a/uni00A0proper calculation model and the specific assumptions related to the particular exposure. The unwinding of the effect of discounting is recorded in the income statement as an interest expense.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nWith the exception of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features for which potential future losses are already considered in establishing the liability, a/uni00A0provision is recognized for onerous contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the resulting obligations exceed the expected future economic benefits. The unavoidable costs under a/uni00A0contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill it.\n\n## 2.22 Assets and liabilities relating to employee benefits\n\n## a. Short-term employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognized for the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be settled within one year after the end of the period in which the service was rendered. Accumulating short-term absences are recognized over the period in which the service is provided. Benefits that are not service-related are recognized when the event that gives rise to the obligation occurs.\n\n## b. Post-employment benefits\n\nThe Group has issued defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. A plan is classified as a/uni00A0defined contribution plan when the Group has no further obligation than the payment of a/uni00A0fixed contribution. All other plans are classified as defined benefit plans.",

An asset is recognized to the extent that the contribution paid exceeds the amount due for services provided.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is based on the terms and conditions of the plan applicable on the reporting date. In measuring the defined benefit obligation the Group uses the projected unit credit method and actuarial assumptions that represent the management's best estimates. The benefits are discounted using an interest rate based on the market yield for high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity that approximate the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the liability include the discount rate, estimated future salary increases, mortality rates and price inflation. To the extent that actual experience deviates from these assumptions, the valuation of defined benefit plans and the level of pension expenses recognized in the future may be affected. Plan improvements (either vested or unvested) are recognized in the income statement at the date when the plan improvement occurs.\n\nPlan assets are qualifying insurance policies and assets held by long-term employee benefit funds that can only be used to pay the employee benefits under the plan and are not available to the Group's creditors. They are measured at fair value and are deducted from the defined benefit obligation in determining the amount recognized on the statement of financial position.\n\n## Profit or loss recognition\n\nThe cost of the defined benefit plans are determined at the beginning of the year and comprise the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 Current year service cost which is recognized in profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) which is recognized in other comprehensive income are revisited quarterly and are not allowed to be reclassified to profit or loss in a/uni00A0subsequent period.\n\nDeducted from current year service cost are discretionary employee contributions and employee contributions that are linked to service (those which are independent of the number of years of service)./uni00A0Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the applicable discount rate. Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprises interest income on plan assets and interest cost on the defined benefit obligation. Whereby interest income on plan assets is a/uni00A0component of the return on plan assets and is determined by multiplying the fair value of the plan assets by the applicable discount rate. The difference between the interest income on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets is included in the remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability (asset).\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprise of:\n\n- \u00b7 Actuarial gains and losses;\n- \u00b7 The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset); and\n- \u00b7 Any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset).\n\n## Past service cost and gains or losses on settlements\n\nPast service cost is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service, resulting from a/uni00A0plan amendment or curtailment.\n\nGains or losses on curtailments or settlements of a/uni00A0defined benefit plan comprise of the difference between:\n\n- \u00b7 The present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled, as determined on the date of settlement; and\n- \u00b7 The settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by Aegon in connection with the settlement.\n\nAegon recognizes (in the income statement) gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a/uni00A0defined benefit plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\n## c. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has issued share-based plans that entitle selected employees to receive Aegon/uni00A0N.V. common shares, subject to pre-defined conditions such as the grant price of the shares and (business and personal) performance criteria. The number of shares that will vest may partly depend on Aegon's relative total shareholder return in comparison with a/uni00A0peer group.",

The fair value is measured at the market price of Aegon/uni00A0N.V. common shares, adjusted to take into account the non-vesting and market conditions upon which the shares were granted. For example, where the employee is not entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, this factor is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted. For the determination of factors such as expected dividends, market observable data has been considered. In addition, where the relative total shareholder return is included in the performance criteria, this factor represents a/uni00A0market condition and hence is taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares granted.\n\nThe cost for long term incentive plans are recognized in the income statement, together with a/uni00A0corresponding increase in shareholders' equity, as the services are rendered. During this period the cumulative expense recognized at the reporting date reflects management's best estimate of the number of shares expected to vest ultimately./uni00A0\n\nThe withholding of shares to fund the payment to the tax authority in respect of the employee's withholding tax obligation associated with the share-based payment is accounted for as a/uni00A0deduction from equity for the shares withheld, except to the extent that the payment exceeds the fair value at the net settlement date of the equity instruments withheld.\n\n## 2.23 Deferred gains\n\nInitial fees and front-end loadings paid by policyholders and other clients for future investment management services related to investment contracts without discretionary participation features are deferred and recognized as revenue when the related services are rendered.\n\n## 2.24 Taxation\n\nThe income tax charge on the result for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is calculated taking into account items that are non-taxable or disallowed, using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable relating to previous years./uni00A0\n\nCurrent tax receivables and payables for current and prior periods reflect the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received and includes provisions for uncertain income tax positions, if any./uni00A0\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the liability method, for temporary differences arising between the carrying value and tax value of an item on the balance sheet and for unused tax losses and credits carried forward. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates applicable that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realized, or the deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses and credits carried forward to the extent that the realization of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable. The recognition of the deferred tax assets is based on Aegon's mid-term projections including sensitivities and tax planning and is reassessed periodically. Deferred tax liabilities relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are not recognized if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future./uni00A0\n\nTax assets and liabilities are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet except where there is a/uni00A0legally enforceable right to offset the tax assets against tax liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction and the intention to settle such balances on a/uni00A0net basis.\n\nTax assets and liabilities are recognized in relation to the underlying transaction either in profit and loss, other comprehensive income or directly in equity./uni00A0\n\n## 2.25 Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nContingent assets are disclosed in the notes if the inflow of economic benefits is probable, but not virtually certain. When the inflow of economic benefits becomes virtually certain, the asset is no longer contingent and its recognition is appropriate.\n\nA provision is recognized for present legal or constructive obligations arising from past events, when it is probable that it will result in an outflow of economic benefits and the amount can be reliably estimated. If the outflow of economic benefits is not probable, a/uni00A0contingent liability is disclosed, unless the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is remote.",

For products where deposit accounting is required, the deposits are not reflected as premium income, but are recognized as part of the financial liability. For these products the surrender charges and charges assessed have been included in gross premiums.\n\nPremium loadings for installment payments and additional payments by the policyholder towards costs borne by the insurer are included in the gross premiums. Rebates that form part of the premium rate, such as no-claim rebates, are deducted from the gross premium, others are recognized as an expense. Depending on the applicable local accounting principles, bonuses that are used to increase the insured benefits may be recognized as gross premiums. The insurance premiums for the original contracts are presented gross of reinsurance premiums paid.\n\n## 2.27 Investment income\n\nFor interest-bearing assets, interest is recognized as it accrues and is calculated using the effective interest rate method. Fees and commissions that are an integral part of the effective yield of the financial assets or liabilities are recognized as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the instrument. Investment income includes the interest income and dividend income on financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nInvestment income also includes rental income due.\n\n## 2.28 Fee and commission income\n\nFees and commissions from investment management services and mutual funds are performed on an ongoing basis evenly throughout the year and are accounted for monthly (1/12 of the contractual agreement). Performance fees may be charged to policyholders in the event of outperformance in the investments compared to predefined benchmark levels. They are accounted for only when specified hurdles for generating performance fees are achieved i.e. when the full performance obligation is met.\n\nAegon acts also as an insurance broker selling insurance contracts of other insurance companies to policyholders and receiving direct sales commission as well as commissions over time when the same policyholders renew their contracts. These commissions are recognized only when received as policyholders' renewals are not certain enough to be recorded upfront.\n\n## 2.29 Policyholder claims and benefits\n\nPolicyholder claims and benefits consist of claims and benefits paid to policyholders, including benefits in excess of account value for products for which deposit accounting is applied and the change in the valuation of liabilities for insurance and investment contracts.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of real estate and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses (using the same rate to measure the lease liability), if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a/uni00A0change in future lease payments arising from a/uni00A0change in an index or rate, if there is a/uni00A0change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a/uni00A0residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a/uni00A0purchase, extension or termination option. The Group presents rightof-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'Other assets and receivables' and lease liabilities in 'Other liabilities' in the statement of financial position.\n\nShort-term leases and leases of low-value assets The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a/uni00A0lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, including small office equipment. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a/uni00A0straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## As a/uni00A0lessor\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor under an operating lease, the assets subject to the operating lease arrangement are presented in the statement of financial position according to the nature of the asset. Income from these leases is recognized in the income statement on a/uni00A0straight line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which use benefit derived from the leased asset is diminished.\n\n## 2.34 Events after the reporting period\n\nThe financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the reporting date and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at the reporting date.\n\nEvents that are indicative of conditions that arose after the reporting date are disclosed, but do not result in an adjustment of the financial statements themselves.",

Those estimates are inherently subject to change and actual results could differ from those estimates. Included among the material (or potentially material) reported amounts and disclosures that require extensive use of estimates are: fair value of certain invested assets and derivatives, deferred policy acquisition costs (please refer to paragraph 2.13), value of business acquired and other purchased intangible assets (please refer to paragraph 2.6), goodwill (please refer to paragraph 2.6), policyholder claims and benefits (please refer to paragraph 2.29), insurance guarantees (please refer to paragraph 2.19), pension plans (please refer to paragraph 2.22), income taxes/uni00A0(please refer to paragraph 2.24) and the potential effects of resolving litigation matters (please refer to paragraph 2.25). Accounting policies that are critical to the financial statement presentation and that require complex estimates or significant judgment are described in the following sections.\n\n## Uncertainty resulting from COVID-19\n\nDuring 2021, uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to significantly impact the/uni00A0Company's operations, the business, and the industry. Continued uncertainty with respect to how the pandemic would play out and what the resulting economic consequences might be, led to volatility in financial markets. Equity markets and interest rates in Aegon's three main markets increased in 2021, as vaccination rates rose and governments provided strong fiscal stimulus to the economy, while central banks provided monetary stimulus. Progress on vaccinations has reduced the spread of COVID-19 and will likely continue to reduce the effects of the public health crisis on the economy. However, the pace of vaccinations has slowed down, and new strains of the virus and reduced availability of healthcare remain risks./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, Aegon's operating result in the Americas was impacted by EUR/uni00A0345/uni00A0million of adverse mortality in Life, of which the large majority can be attributed to COVID-19, either directly or indirectly. This was partly offset by favorable morbidity experience in Accident & Health, mostly related to Long-Term Care insurance with higher claims terminations due to higher mortality and discharges from care facilities. Through 2021, Aegon continued to observe better morbidity experience than expected in Long-Term Care. Over the year, new claims started trending back to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, in the course of 2021, Aegon Americas released a/uni00A0portion of the EUR/uni00A051/uni00A0million Long-Term Care incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserve established during the pandemic, and at year end 2021 the balance of the reserve is EUR/uni00A027/uni00A0million.\n\nAs part of its normal process, Aegon has updated its sensitivity analysis for the impact of changes in financial assumptions on its IFRS equity and net result included in note 4 Financial risks.\n\nOverall there were no significant impacts from COVID-19 on Level-III measurements. Note 44 Fair value, provides additional information on the fair valuation methods and assumptions applied, as well as movements or transfers in fair value hierarchy.\n\nAegon Group's Solvency II capital position remained at a/uni00A0strong level increasing from 196% per December 31, 2020, to 211% per December 31, 2021.\n\nAegon continues to monitor the relevant market and the economic factors to proactively manage the associated risks. Management believes that the most significant risks are related to financial markets (particularly credit, equity, and interest rates risks) and underwriting risks (particularly related to mortality, morbidity, and policyholder behavior).\n\n## Management's assessment of going concern\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Aegon have been prepared assuming a/uni00A0going concern basis of accounting based on the reasonable assumption that the Company is, and will be, able to continue its normal course of business in the foreseeable future. Relevant facts and circumstances relating to the consolidated financial position on December 31, 2021, were assessed in order to reach the going concern assumption. The main areas assessed are the financial performance, capital adequacy, financial position and flexibility, liquidity, ability to access capital markets, leverage ratios and the level of Cash Capital at Holding. Considering all these areas management concluded that the going concern assumption for Aegon is appropriate in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of assets and liabilities arising from life insurance contracts\n\nThe valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts is developed using complex valuation models. The liability for life insurance contracts with guaranteed or fixed account terms is either based on current assumptions, on the assumptions established at inception of the contract, reflecting the best estimates at the time increased with a/uni00A0margin for adverse deviation, or on the valuation assumptions (historical cost), without risk margin. All contracts are subject to liability adequacy testing which reflects management's current estimates of future cash flows (including investment returns). To the extent that the liability is based on current",

Also, if a/uni00A0change in assumption results in not passing the liability adequacy test, the entire deficiency is recognized in the income statement. To the extent that the deficiency relates to unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, the additional liability is recognized through other comprehensive income in the/uni00A0related revaluation reserve in shareholders' equity.\n\nAegon the Netherlands, as required locally, adjusts the outcome of the liability adequacy test for the difference between the fair value and the book value of the assets that are measured at amortized cost in the statement of financial position. Mortgage loans and private loans are the primary asset classes for which the difference between the fair value and the book value of assets impacts the LAT./uni00A0For details on the fair value (measurement) of Aegon's assets and liabilities, please refer to note 44 Fair value.\n\nSome insurance contracts without a/uni00A0guaranteed or fixed contractual term contain guaranteed minimum benefits. Depending on the nature of the guarantee, it may either be bifurcated and presented as a/uni00A0derivative, or be reflected in the value of the insurance liability in accordance with local accounting principles. Given the dynamic and complex nature of these guarantees, stochastic techniques under a/uni00A0variety of market return scenarios are often used for measurement purposes. Such models require management to make numerous estimates based on historical experience and market expectations. Changes in these estimates will immediately affect the income statement.\n\nIn addition, certain acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force are recorded as DPAC and VOBA assets respectively, and are amortized to the income statement over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these policies are not realized, the amortization of these costs could be accelerated and may require write-offs due to unrecoverability.\n\n## Actuarial and economic assumptions\n\nThe main assumptions used in measuring DPAC, VOBA and the liabilities for life insurance contracts with fixed or guaranteed terms relate to mortality, morbidity, investment return and future expenses. Depending on local accounting principles, surrender, lapse, and utilization rates may be considered.\n\nMortality tables applied are generally developed based on a/uni00A0blend of company experience and industry wide studies, taking into consideration product characteristics, own risk selection criteria, target market and past experience. Mortality experience is monitored through regular studies, the results of which are fed into the pricing cycle for new products and reflected in the liability calculation when appropriate. For contracts insuring survivorship or mortality, allowance may be made for further longevity or mortality improvements. Morbidity assumptions are based on own claims severity and frequency experience, adjusted where appropriate for industry information.\n\nInvestment assumptions are prescribed by the local regulator, market observable or based on management's future expectations. In the latter case, the anticipated future investment returns are set by management on a/uni00A0countrywide basis, considering available market information and economic indicators. A significant assumption related to estimated gross profits on variable annuities and variable life insurance products in the United States and some of the smaller countries, is the annual long-term growth rate of the underlying assets. The reconsideration of this assumption may affect the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule, referred to as DPAC or VOBA unlocking. The difference between the original DPAC or VOBA amortization schedule and the revised schedule, which is based on actual and estimates of future gross profits, is recognized in the income statement as an expense or a/uni00A0benefit in the period of determination.\n\nAssumptions on future expenses are based on the current level of expenses, adjusted for expected expense inflation if appropriate. In Aegon the Netherlands, the expense basis makes an allowance for planned future cost savings, which are included in the liability adequacy test.\n\nSurrender and lapse rates depend on product features, policy duration and external circumstances such as the interest rate environment and competitor behavior. For policies with account value guarantees based on equity market movements, a/uni00A0dynamic lapse assumption is utilized to reflect policyholder behavior based on whether the guarantee is in the money. Own experience, as well as industry published data, are used in establishing assumptions. Lapse experience is correlated to mortality and morbidity levels, as higher or lower levels of surrenders may indicate future claims will be higher or lower than anticipated. Such correlations are accounted for in the mortality and morbidity assumptions based on the emerging analysis of experience.",

Similarly, the models and systems used for determining our liabilities are reviewed periodically and, if deemed necessary, updated based on emerging best practices and available technology.\n\nDuring 2021, Aegon implemented actuarial assumption and model updates resulting in a/uni00A0net EUR/uni00A0298/uni00A0million charge to result before tax (2020: EUR/uni00A0580/uni00A0million charge). This is mainly related to Aegon's businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands./uni00A0\n\nAssumption changes and model updates in the Americas led to a/uni00A0net negative impact of EUR/uni00A0250/uni00A0million. This mainly reflects a/uni00A0charge of EUR/uni00A0123/uni00A0million related to an update of the/uni00A0minimum surrender rate assumption for variable annuities with guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits from 2% to 1.5% to reflect latest portfolio and industry experience.\n\nAssumption changes and model updates in the Netherlands led to an unfavorable impact of EUR/uni00A052/uni00A0million mainly related to adverse impacts from more granular modeling driven by the transfer of the administration of defined benefit pensions to TKP. This was partly offset by/uni00A0the favorable impact of model updates relating to interest guarantees and indexation assumptions for certain pension products.\n\nFor the years 2019 through 2021, Aegon kept its long-term equity market return assumption for the estimated gross profits on variable life and variable annuity products in the Americas at 8%. The long term credit spread assumption, net of assumed defaults and expenses, on our most common corporate bonds is 120bps. The 90-day Treasury yield was 0.14%, 0.15% and 1.55% at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. During 2021, the 90-day Treasury yield was assumed to have a/uni00A0uniform grading over 10 years to 2.0%, which was a/uni00A0change from the assumption during 2020 and 2019 of grading over 10 years to 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. On a/uni00A0quarterly basis, the estimated gross profits are updated for the difference between the estimated market return and the actual market return.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nPlease note that the sensitivities listed in the disclosures below represent sensitivities to Aegon's position at the balance sheet date for the respective years. The sensitivities reflect single shocks where other elements remain unchanged. Real world market impacts (e.g. lower interest rates and declining equity markets) may happen simultaneously which can lead to more severe combined impacts and may not be equal to the sum of the individual sensitivities presented in the disclosure./uni00A0\n\n## Sensitivity on variable annuities and variable life insurance products in the United States Sensitivity analysis of DPAC and VOBA balances to changes in in expected long-term equity growth rate\n\n|                                                             | 2021       | 2020       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Estimated approximate effect                                | DPAC /VOBA | DPAC /VOBA |\n| 1% decrease in the expectected long-term equity growth rate | (95)       | (108)      |\n\nThe DPAC and VOBA balances for these products in the United States amounted to EUR/uni00A02.1/uni00A0billion at December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A02.4/uni00A0billion).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of net result to changes in various underwriting risks\n\n| Estimated approximate effect              | 2021 Net Result   | 2020 Net Result   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| 10% increase to mortality assumption      | (128)             | (124)             |\n| 20% increase in the lapse rate assumption | 71                | 89                |\n\nAny reasonably possible changes in the other assumptions Aegon uses to determine EGP margins (i.e. maintenance expenses) would reduce net result by less than EUR/uni00A08/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A011/uni00A0million).\n\n## Sensitivity on long term care (LTC) products in the United States\n\nAfter tax sensitivities of significant product liability assumptions on the LTC IFRS after-tax Gross Present Value Reserve (GPV) are indicated below.

The LAT assesses the adequacy of the insurance liabilities by comparing them to their fair value. Aegon the Netherlands adjusts the outcome of the LAT for certain unrealized gains in the bond portfolio (shadow loss recognition) and certain differences between the fair value and the book value of assets measured at amortized cost, mainly residential mortgages. Please also refer to Note 2.19f Liability adequacy testing for further details on the accounting policy.\n\nThe LAT deficit per December 31, 2021 in Aegon the Netherlands amounted to EUR/uni00A05.2/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A07.0/uni00A0billion), which was partially offset by the shadow loss recognition of EUR/uni00A03.0/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A04.5/uni00A0billion), resulting in a/uni00A0net deficit of EUR/uni00A02.2/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0billion).

This impact on the income statement will be partially offset by the application of shadow loss recognition, triggered by the interest rate shock.\n\n## Determination of fair value and fair value hierarchy\n\nThe following is a/uni00A0description of Aegon's methods of determining fair value, and a/uni00A0quantification of its exposure to assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is defined as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a/uni00A0liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a/uni00A0market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 In the absence of a/uni00A0principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.",

    {
        "page_content": "Aegon uses the following hierarchy for measuring and disclosing of the fair value of assets and liabilities:\n\n- \u00b7 Level I: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that Aegon can access at the measurement date;\n- \u00b7 Level II: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices of identical or similar assets and liabilities) using valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are based on observable market data; and\n- \u00b7 Level III: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) using valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.\n\nThe best evidence of fair value is a/uni00A0quoted price in an actively traded market. In the event that the market for a/uni00A0financial instrument is not active or quoted market prices are not available, a/uni00A0valuation technique is used.\n\nThe degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally inversely correlates with the level of observable valuation inputs. Aegon maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable valuation inputs when measuring fair value. Financial instruments, for example, with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and therefore less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment.\n\nThe assets and liabilities categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nAn active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. The judgment as to whether a/uni00A0market is active may include, although not necessarily determinative, lower transaction volumes, reduced transaction sizes and, in some cases, no observable trading activity for short periods. In inactive markets, assurance is obtained that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or it is determined that adjustments to transaction prices are necessary to measure the fair value of the instrument.\n\nThe majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data, and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high. However, certain assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable and, for such assets and liabilities, the derivation of fair value is more judgmental. An instrument is classified in its entirety as valued using significant unobservable inputs (Level III) if, in the opinion of management, a/uni00A0significant proportion of the instrument's carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs. 'Unobservable' in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an at arm's length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a/uni00A0determination of fair value. Additional information is provided in the table headed 'Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonably possible alternatives' in note 44 Fair Value. While Aegon believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain instruments (both financial and non-financial) could result in a/uni00A0different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\nThe valuation techniques applied to financial instrument affected by IBOR reforms remain consistent with those of other market participants, and the uncertainty on the outcome of the reforms has not affected the classification of the instruments.\n\nTo operationalize Aegon's fair value hierarchy, individual instruments (both financial and non-financial) are assigned a/uni00A0fair value level based primarily on the type of instrument and the source of the prices (e.g. index, third-party pricing service, broker, internally modeled). Periodically, this logic for assigning fair value levels is reviewed to determine if any modifications are necessary in the context of the current market environment.\n\n## 4 Financial risks\n\n## General\n\nAs an insurance group, Aegon is exposed to a/uni00A0variety of risks. Aegon's largest exposures are to changes in financial markets (e.g. foreign currency, interest rate, credit and equity market risks) that affect the value of the investments, liabilities from products that Aegon sells, deferred expenses and value of business acquired./uni00A0Other risks include insurance related risks, such as changes in mortality, morbidity, bond credit spread and liquidity premium, which are discussed in note 34 Insurance contracts. Aegon manages risk at local level where business is transacted, based on principles and policies established at the Group level. Aegon's integrated approach to risk management involves similar measurement of risk and scope of risk coverage to allow for aggregation of the Group's risk position.",

        "page_content": "To manage the risk from changes in financial markets, Aegon's products are priced using a/uni00A0market-consistent framework and comprehensive asset liability management (ALM) programs are implemented to ensure that the assets backing policyholder benefits are invested prudently over the long term. A range of ALM techniques are used across the Group. These range in terms of sophistication and complexity from cash-flow matching (for traditional fixed annuities) to duration matching (for the Universal Life range of products) to derivative-based semi-static and dynamic hedges (to match variable annuities)./uni00A0\n\nTo manage its risk exposure, Aegon has risk policies in place. Many of these policies are group-wide while others are specific to the unique situation of local businesses. For ALM specifically, the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework includes several risk policies that govern ALM strategies, such as the Investment and Counterparty Risk Policy (ICRP). The ICRP governs the management of investment risks associated with credit, equity, property, alternative asset classes, interest rate and currency risk in addition to option markets, implied volatility risk, interest rate options and swaptions. As well as product-level ALM programs, subsidiary businesses are required by the ICRP to maintain overarching entity-level ALM strategies that set the direction and limits for the aggregated productlevel programs. Significant or complex ALM strategies are approved at group level, and all programs are subject to Group Risk oversight./uni00A0\n\nTogether with the ICRP, which guides ALM strategy, several other ERM policies govern concentration risk, liquidity risk, use of derivatives and securities lending and repos. As Aegon uses derivatives extensively, collateral calls can be significant depending on market circumstances. Liquidity is managed at legal entity level in the first instance with central coordination by Aegon NV. The large US and Dutch units may use external market solutions to match projected liquidity requirements with funding./uni00A0\n\nNext to guidance, the Group level policies also provide limits the to Group's exposure to major risks such as equity, interest rates, credit, and currency. The limits in these policies in aggregate remain within the Group's overall tolerance for risk and the Group's financial resources. Operating within this policy framework, Aegon employs risk management programs including ALM processes and models and hedging programs (which are largely conducted via the use of financial derivative instruments). These risk management programs are in place in each country unit and are not only used to manage risk in each unit, but are also part of the Group's overall risk strategy.\n\nAegon operates a/uni00A0Derivative Use Policy to govern its usage of derivatives. This policy establishes the control, authorization, execution and monitoring requirements of the usage of such instruments. In addition, the policy stipulates necessary mitigation of credit risk created through derivatives management tools. For derivatives, counterparty credit risk is normally mitigated by requirements to post collateral via credit support annex agreements or through a/uni00A0central clearing house.\n\nAs part of its risk management programs, Aegon takes inventory of its current risk position across risk categories. Aegon also measures the sensitivity of net result and shareholders' equity under both deterministic and stochastic scenarios. Management uses the insight gained through these 'what if?' scenarios to manage the Group's risk exposure and capital position. The models, scenarios and assumptions used are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary.\n\nResults of Aegon's sensitivity analyses are presented throughout this section to show the estimated sensitivity of net result and shareholders' equity to various scenarios. For each type of market risk, the analysis shows how net result and shareholders' equity would have been affected by changes in the relevant risk variable that were reasonably possible at the reporting date. For each sensitivity test the impact of a/uni00A0reasonably possible change in a/uni00A0single factor is shown. Management action is taken into account to the extent that it is part of Aegon's regular policies and procedures, such as established hedging programs. However, incidental management actions that would require a/uni00A0change in policies and procedures are not considered.\n\nEach sensitivity analysis reflects the extent to which the shock tested would affect management's critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying Aegon's accounting policies. Market-consistent assumptions underlying the measurement of non-listed assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect the shock tested. The shock may also affect the measurement of assets and liabilities based on assumptions that are not observable in the market. For example, a/uni00A0shock in interest rates may lead to changes in the amortization schedule of DPAC or to increased impairment losses on equity investments. Although management's short-term assumptions may change if there is a/uni00A0reasonably possible change in a/uni00A0risk factor, long-term assumptions will generally not be revised unless there is evidence that the movement is permanent. This fact is reflected in the sensitivity analyses.\n\nThe accounting mismatch inherent in EU-IFRS is also apparent in the reported sensitivities. A change in interest rates has an immediate impact on the carrying amount of assets measured at fair value. However, the shock will not have a/uni00A0similar effect on the carrying amount of the related insurance liabilities that are measured based on locked-in assumptions or on management's long-term expectations. Consequently, the different measurement bases for assets and liabilities lead to increased volatility in EU-IFRS net result and shareholders' equity. Aegon has classified a/uni00A0significant part of its investment portfolio as 'available-for-sale', which is one of the main reasons why the economic shocks tested have a/uni00A0different impact on net result than on shareholders' equity.

As a/uni00A0result, economic sensitivities predominantly impact shareholders' equity but leave net result unaffected. The effect of movements of the revaluation reserve on capitalization ratios and capital adequacy are minimal. Aegon's target ratio for the composition of its capital base is based on shareholders' equity excluding the revaluation reserve.\n\nThe sensitivities do not reflect what the net result for the period would have been if risk variables had been different because the analysis is based on the exposures in existence at the reporting date rather than on those that actually occurred during the year. Nor are the results of the sensitivities intended to be an accurate prediction of Aegon's future shareholders' equity or earnings. The analysis does not take into account the impact of future new business, which is an important component of Aegon's future earnings. It also does not consider all methods available to management to respond to changes in the financial environment, such as changing investment portfolio allocations or adjusting premiums and crediting rates. Furthermore, the results of the analyses cannot be extrapolated for wider variations since effects do not tend to be linear.\n\nConcentration risk for financial risks are measured and managed at the following levels:\n\n- \u00b7 Concentration per risk type: Risk exposures are measured per risk type as part of Aegon's internal economic framework. A risk tolerance framework is in place which sets risk limits per risk type to target desired risk balance and promote diversification across risk types;\n- \u00b7 Concentration per counterparty: Risk exposure is measured and risk limits are in place per counterparty as part of the Counterparty Name Limit Policy; and\n- \u00b7 Concentration per sector, geography and asset class: Aegon's investment strategy is translated in investment mandates for its internal and external asset managers. Through these investment mandates limits on sector, geography and asset class are set. Compliance monitoring of the investment mandates is done by the insurance operating companies.\n\nMoreover, concentration of financial risks are measured in Aegon business planning cycle. As part of business planning, the resilience of Aegon's business strategy is tested in several extreme event scenarios. In the Adverse Financial scenario, financial markets are stressed without assuming diversification across different market factors. Within the projection certain management actions may be implemented when management deems this necessary.\n\nAegon's significant financial risks and related financial information are explained in the order as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk\n- \u00b7 Equity market risk and other investment risks\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk\n- \u00b7 Currency exchange risk\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\nAs premiums and deposits are received, these funds are invested to pay for future policyholder obligations. For general account products, Aegon typically bears the risk for investment performance which is equal to the return of principal and interest. Aegon is exposed to credit risk on its general account fixed-income portfolio (debt securities, mortgages and private placements), over-thecounter derivatives and reinsurance contracts. Some issuers have defaulted on their financial obligations for various reasons, including bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, downturns in the economy, downturns in real estate values, operational failure and fraud. During financial downturns, Aegon can incur defaults or other reductions in the value of these securities and loans, which could have a/uni00A0materially adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition. Investments for account of policyholders are excluded as the policyholder bears the credit risk associated with the investments.\n\nThe table that follows shows the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk from investments in general account financial assets, as well as general account derivatives and reinsurance assets, collateral held and net exposure. Please refer to note 45 and 46 for further information on capital commitments and contingencies and on collateral given, which may expose the Group to credit risk.",

        "page_content": "## Money market and short-term investments\n\nThe collateral reported for the money market and short-term investments are related to tri-party repurchase agreements (repos). Within tri-party repos Aegon invests under short-term reverse repurchase agreements and the counterparty posts collateral to a/uni00A0third party custodian. The collateral posted is typically high-quality, short-term securities and is only accessible for or available to Aegon in the event the counterparty defaults.\n\n## Mortgage loans\n\nThe real estate collateral for mortgages includes both residential and commercial properties. The collateral for commercial mortgage loans in Aegon Americas is measured at fair value. At a/uni00A0minimum on an annual basis, a/uni00A0fair value is estimated for each individual real estate property that has been pledged as collateral. When a/uni00A0loan is originally provided, an external appraisal is obtained to estimate the value of the property. In subsequent years, the value is typically estimated internally using various professionally accepted valuation methodologies. Internal appraisals are performed by qualified, professionally accredited personnel. International valuation standards are used and the most significant assumptions made during the valuation of real estate are the current cost of reproducing or replacing the property, the value that the property's net earning power will support, and the value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties. Valuations are primarily supported by market evidence. For Aegon the Netherlands, collateral for the residential mortgages is measured as the foreclosure value which is indexed periodically.\n\nCash collateral for mortgage loans includes the savings that have been received to redeem the underlying mortgage loans at redemption date. These savings are part of the credit side of the statement of financial position, but reduce the credit risk for the mortgage loan as a/uni00A0whole.\n\nA substantial part of Aegon's Dutch residential mortgage loan portfolio benefits from guarantees by a/uni00A0Dutch government-backed trust (Stichting Waarborgfonds Eigen Woning) through the Dutch Mortgage loan Guarantee program (NHG). With exception of NHGbacked mortgage loans originated after January 1, 2014, for which a/uni00A010% lender-incurred haircut applies on realized losses on each defaulted loan, these guarantees cover all principal losses, missed interest payments and foreclosure costs incurred upon termination and settlement of defaulted mortgage loans when lender-specific terms and conditions of the guarantee are met. When not fully met, the trust may pay claims in part or in full, depending on the severity of the breach of terms and conditions. For each specific loan, the guarantee amortizes in line with an equivalent annuity mortgage loan. When the remaining loan balance at default does not exceed the amortized guarantee, it covers the full loss under its terms and conditions. Any loan balance in excess of this decreasing guarantee profile serves as a/uni00A0first loss position for the lender.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe master netting agreements column in the table relates to derivative liability positions which are used in Aegon's credit risk management. The offset in the master netting agreements column includes balances where there is a/uni00A0legally enforceable right of offset, but no intention to settle these balances on a/uni00A0net basis under normal circumstances. As a/uni00A0result, there is a/uni00A0net exposure for credit risk management purposes. However, as there is no intention to settle these balances on a/uni00A0net basis, they do not qualify for net presentation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Reinsurance assets\n\nThe collateral related to the reinsurance assets include assets in trust that are held by the reinsurer for the benefit of Aegon. The assets in trust can be accessed to pay policyholder benefits in the event the reinsurers fail to perform under the terms of their contract. Further information on the related reinsurance transactions is included in note 26 Reinsurance assets.\n\n## Other loans\n\nThe collateral included in the other column represents the policyholders account value for policy loans. The excess of the account value over the loan value is included in the surplus collateral column. For further information on the policy loans refer to note 22.1 Financial assets, excluding derivatives.\n\nThe total collateral includes both under- and over-collateralized positions. To present a/uni00A0net exposure of credit risk, the overcollateralization, which is shown in the surplus collateral column, is extracted from the total collateral.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk management\n\nAegon manages credit risk exposure by individual counterparty, sector and asset class, including cash positions. Normally, Aegon mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into credit support agreement, where practical, and in ISDA master netting agreements for most of Aegon's legal entities to facilitate Aegon's right to offset credit risk exposure. Main counterparties to these transactions are investment banks which are typically rated 'A' or higher. The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aegon or its counterparty. Transactions requiring Aegon or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, equity swaps, currency swaps and credit swaps. Collateral received is mainly cash (USD and EUR). The credit support agreements that outline the acceptable collateral require high-quality instruments to be posted. Over the last three years, there was no default with any derivatives counterparty. The credit risk associated with financial assets subject to a/uni00A0master netting agreement is eliminated only to the extent that financial liabilities due to the same counterparty will be settled after the assets are realized. Eligible derivative transactions are traded via Central Clearing Houses as required by EMIR and the Dodd-Frank act. Credit risk in these transactions is mitigated through posting of initial and variation margins.\n\nAegon may also mitigate credit risk in reinsurance contracts by including downgrade clauses that allow the recapture of business, retaining ownership of assets required to support liabilities ceded or by requiring the reinsurer to hold assets in trust. For the resulting net credit risk exposure, Aegon employs deterministic and stochastic credit risk modeling in order to assess the Group's credit risk profile, associated earnings and capital implications due to various credit loss scenarios.\n\nAegon operates a/uni00A0Credit Name Limit Policy (CNLP) under which limits are placed on the aggregate exposure that it has to any one counterparty. Limits are placed on the exposure at both group level and individual country units. The limits also vary by a/uni00A0rating system, which is a/uni00A0composite of the main rating agencies (S&P, Moody's and Fitch) and Aegon's internal rating of the counterparty. If an exposure exceeds the stated limit, then the exposure must be reduced to the limit for the country unit and rating category as soon as possible. Exceptions to these limits can only be made after explicit approval from Aegon's Group Risk and Capital Committee (GRCC). The policy is reviewed regularly.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, there was one violation of the Credit Name Limit Policy at Group level (2020: one). This related to the Republic of Turkey and is being closely monitored. The breach will be resolved by the disposal of Aegon Turkey, which is expected to close in 2022.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Aegon's largest corporate credit exposures are to/uni00A0Wilton Re Holdings Ltd, American United Mutual Insurance, Reinsurance Group of America and JP Morgan. Aegon had large government exposures, the largest being to the United States, the Netherlands and Germany. Highly rated government bonds and government exposure domestically issued and owned in local currency are excluded from the Credit Name Limit Policy.\n\nAegon group level long-term counterparty exposure limits are as follows:\n\n## Group limits per credit rating\n\n| Amounts in EUR/uni00A0million   |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| AAA                             |    900 |    900 |\n| AA                              |    900 |    900 |\n| A                               |    675 |    675 |\n| BBB                             |    450 |    450 |\n| BB                              |    250 |    250 |\n| B                               |    125 |    125 |\n| CCC or lower                    |     50 |     50 |",

Aegon uses a/uni00A0composite rating based on a/uni00A0combination of the external ratings of S&P, Moody's, Fitch and National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC which is for US only) and internal ratings. The rating used is the lower of the external rating and the internal rating.\n\n| Credit rating general account                   | Americas        | Americas    | The Netherlands   | The Netherlands   | United Kingdom   | United Kingdom   | International   | International   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| investments, excluding reinsurance  assets 2021 | Amortized  cost | Fair  value | Amortized  cost   | Fair  value       | Amortized  cost  | Fair  value      | Amortized  cost | Fair  value     |\n| AAA                                             | 1,383           | 15,537      | 2,607             | 11,832            | -

The loan to value (LTV) amounted to approximately 53% (2020: 55%). Of the portfolio 0% (2020: 1%) is in delinquency (defined as 60 days in arrears). In 2021, Aegon Americas recognized EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million of net impairments (2020: EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million net impairments) on this portfolio. In 2021, there were no foreclosures (2020: EUR/uni00A00/uni00A0million) and no impairments or recoveries associated with foreclosed loans (2020: EUR/uni00A00/uni00A0million).\n\nThe fair value of Aegon the Netherlands mortgage loan portfolio as per December 31, 2021, amounted to EUR/uni00A034,198/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A033,761/uni00A0million). The LTV amounted to approximately 56% (2020: 66%). A significant part of the portfolio 42% (2020: 45%) is government guaranteed. Of the portfolio, 0.1% (2020: 0.1%) is in delinquency (defined as 60 days in arrears). Impairments in 2021 amounted to EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A00/uni00A0million). During the last ten years defaults of the portfolio have been 5 basis points on average.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAegon's investments in unconsolidated structured entities such as RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs and investment funds are presented in the line item 'Investments' of the statement of financial position. Aegon's interests in these unconsolidated structured entities can be characterized as basic interests, Aegon does not have loans, derivatives, guarantees or other interests related to these investments. Any existing commitments such as future purchases of interests in investment funds are disclosed in note 45 Commitments and contingencies.\n\nFor debt instruments, specifically for RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amount which is reflected in the credit risk concentration table regarding debt securities and money market investments. To manage credit risk Aegon invests primarily in senior notes of/uni00A0RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs. The composition of the RMBSs, CMBSs and ABSs/uni00A0portfolios of Aegon are widely dispersed looking at the individual amount per entity, therefore Aegon only has non-controlling interests in individual unconsolidated structured entities.

These indicators may include one or more of the following: 1) deteriorating market to book ratio, 2) increasing industry risk factors, 3) deteriorating financial condition of the issuer, 4) covenant violations by the issuer, 5) high probability of bankruptcy of the issuer, or 6) downgrades by internationally recognized credit rating agency. Additionally, for asset-backed securities, cash flow trends and underlying levels of collateral are monitored. A security is impaired if there is objective evidence that a/uni00A0loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset that has a/uni00A0negative impact on the estimated future cash flows.\n\nFor details on impairments on financial assets, including receivables, refer to note 15 Impairment charges / (reversals).\n\n## Past due and impaired assets\n\nThe tables that follow provide information on past due and individually impaired financial assets for the whole Aegon Group. An asset is past due when a/uni00A0counterparty has failed to make a/uni00A0payment when contractually due. Assets are impaired when an impairment loss has been charged to the income statement relating to this asset. After the impairment loss is reversed in subsequent periods, the asset is no longer considered to be impaired. When the terms and conditions of financial assets have been renegotiated, the terms and conditions of the new agreement apply in determining whether the financial assets are past due.\n\nAegon's policy is to pursue realization of the collateral in an orderly manner as and when liquidity permits. Aegon generally does not use the non-cash collateral for its own operations.\n\n|                                                | 2021       | 2021         | 2021     | 2021   | 2020        | 2020         | 2020     | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|--------|\n| Past due but not impaired assets               | 0-6 months | 6-12  months | > 1 year | Total  | 0-6  months | 6-12  months | > 1 year | Total  |\n| Debt securities - carried at fair value        | 1,171      | 255          | 40       | 1,466  | 369         | 34           | 9        | 412    |\n| Mortgage loans                                 | 129        | 1            | 1        | 131    | 169         | 55           | 1        | 226    |\n| Other loans                                    | 19         | 5            | 10       | 35     | 24          | 8            | 5        | 36     |\n| Accrued interest                               | 30         | 10           | 3        | 42     | 5           | 1            | 1        | 8      |\n| Other financial assets - carried at fair value | -          | -            | -        | -      | -           | -            | -        | -      |\n| At December 31                                 | 1,350      | 271          | 54       | 1,675  | 567         | 98           | 16       | 681    |",

Exposure to equity, real estate and capital markets exists in both assets and liabilities. Asset exposure exists through direct equity investment, where Aegon bears all or most of the volatility in returns and investment performance risk. Equity market exposure is also present in insurance and investment contracts for policyholders where funds are invested in equities, backing variable annuities, unit-linked products and mutual funds. Although most of the risk remains with the policyholder, lower investment returns can reduce the asset management fee earned by Aegon on the asset balance in these products. In addition, some of this business has minimum return or accumulation guarantees.\n\nIn 2021, Transamerica expanded its dynamic hedge program to variable annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefit riders (GMDB) and remaining policies with guaranteed minimum income (GMIB) riders. This builds on the effective dynamic hedge program of policies with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB). The dynamic hedge program now covers the equity risks (and interest rate risk) embedded in the guarantees of its entire variable annuity portfolio. Dynamic hedging stabilizes cash flows and reduces sensitivities to changes in equity markets (and interest rates) on an economic basis.\n\nThe general account equity, real estate and other non-fixed-income portfolio of Aegon is as follows:\n\n| Equity, real estate and  non-fixed income  exposure   | Americas   | The Netherlands   | United  Kingdom   | International   | Asset  Management   | Holding and other  activities   | Total   2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|\n| Equity funds                                          | 175        | 34                | -                 | 63              | 9                   | -                               | 280            |\n| Common shares 1)                                      | 190        | -                 | 29                | 5               | -                   | 1                               | 226            |\n| Preferred shares                                      | 128        | -                 | -                 | -               | -                   | -                               | 128            |\n| Investments in real estate                            | 39         | 2,588             | -                 | 16              | -                   | -                               | 2,643          |\n| Hedge funds                                           | 35         | -                 | -                 | -               | -                   | -                               | 35             |\n| Other alternative investments                         | 1,934      | 432               | -                 | -               | -                   | -                               | 2,366          |\n| Other financial assets                                | 1,595      | 1,023             | 598               | 7               | 2                   | -                               | 3,225          |\n| At December 31                                        | 4,097      | 4,076             | 628               | 91              | 10                  | 1                               | 8,903          |\n\n| Equity, real estate and  non-fixed income  exposure   | Americas   | The Netherlands   | United  Kingdom   | International   | Asset  Management   | Holding   and other  activities   | Total 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Equity funds                                          | 154        | 40                | -                 | 68              | 8                   | -                                 | 270          |\n| Common shares 1)                                      | 161        | -                 | 34                | 6               | -                   | 16                                | 218          |\n| Preferred shares                                      | 127        | -                 | -                 | -               | -                   | 27                                | 155          |\n| Investments in real estate                            | 37         | 2,331             | -                 | 16              | -                   | -                                 | 2,385        |\n| Hedge funds                                           | 74         | -                 | -                 | -               | -                   | -                                 | 75           |\n| Other alternative investments                         | 1,557      | 381               | -                 | -               | -                   | 7                                 | 1,945        |\n| Other financial assets                                | 1,104      | 1,046             | 800               | 6               | 1                   | -                                 | 2,957        |\n| At December 31                                        | 3,215      | 3,799             | 834               | 97              | 10                  | 51                                | 8,005        |",

The sensitivity of shareholders' equity and net result to changes in equity markets reflects changes in the market value of Aegon's portfolio, changes in DPAC amortization, contributions to pension plans for Aegon's employees and the strengthening of the guaranteed minimum benefits, when applicable. Aegon generally has positive income benefits from equity market increases and negative impacts from equity market declines as it earns fees on policyholder account balances and provides minimum guarantees for account values. Aegon uses options and other equity derivatives to provide protection against the negative impact of equity market declines.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of net result and shareholders' equity to equity markets\n\n| Immediate change of   | Estimated approximate effects  on net result   | Estimated approximate effects  on shareholders' equity   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2021                  |                                                |                                                          |\n| Equity increase 10%   | 151                                            | 341                                                      |\n| Equity decrease 10%   | (212)                                          | (221)                                                    |\n| Equity increase 25%   | 322                                            | 660                                                      |\n| Equity decrease 25%   | (529)                                          | (685)                                                    |\n| 2020                  |                                                |                                                          |\n| Equity increase 10%   | 146                                            | 394                                                      |\n| Equity decrease 10%   | (208)                                          | (199)                                                    |\n| Equity increase 25%   | 290                                            | 725                                                      |\n| Equity decrease 25%   | (541)                                          | (715)                                                    |",

        "page_content": "## Interest rate risk\n\nAegon bears interest rate risk with many of its products. In cases where cash flows are highly predictable, investing in assets that closely match the cash flow profile of the liabilities can offset this risk. For some Aegon country units, local capital markets are not well developed, which prevents the complete matching of assets and liabilities for those businesses. For some products, cash flows are less predictable as a/uni00A0result of policyholder actions that can be affected by the level of interest rates.\n\nIn periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase. Premiums in flexible premium policies may decrease as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This activity may result in cash payments by Aegon requiring the sale of invested assets at a/uni00A0time when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates; this may result in realized investment losses. These cash payments to policyholders result in a/uni00A0decrease in total invested assets and a/uni00A0decrease in net result. Among other things, early withdrawals may also require accelerated amortization of DPAC, which in turn reduces net result.\n\nDuring periods of sustained low interest rates, Aegon may not be able to preserve margins as a/uni00A0result of minimum interest rate guarantees and minimum guaranteed crediting rates provided on policies. Also, investment earnings may be lower because the interest earnings on new fixed-income investments are likely to have declined with the market interest rates. Mortgage loans and redeemable bonds in the investment portfolio are more likely to be repaid as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates and Aegon may be required to reinvest the proceeds in securities bearing lower interest rates. Accordingly, net result declines as a/uni00A0result of a/uni00A0decrease in the spread between returns on the investment portfolio and the interest rates either credited to policyholders or assumed in reserves.\n\nAegon manages interest rate risk closely, taking into account all of the complexity regarding policyholder behavior and management action. Aegon employs sophisticated interest rate measurement techniques and actively uses derivatives and other risk mitigation tools to closely manage its interest rate risk exposure. Aegon operates an Investment & Counterparty Risk policy that limits the amount of interest rate risk to which the Group is exposed. All derivative use is governed by Aegon's Derivative Use Policy. A detailed description on the use of derivatives within Aegon is included in note 24 Derivatives.\n\nIn 2020 Transamerica commenced a/uni00A0multi-year plan to gradually reduce its economic interest rate risk, primarily by lengthening the duration of the assets to provide a/uni00A0closer match to the liability duration and extending the existing forward starting swap program. The program is due to be completed by mid-2022./uni00A0\n\nFurthermore, in 2021, Transamerica expanded its dynamic hedge program to variable annuities with guaranteed minimum death benefit riders (GMDB) and remaining policies with guaranteed minimum income (GMIB) riders. This builds on the effective dynamic hedge program of policies with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB). The dynamic hedge program now covers the interest rate (and equity risks) embedded in the guarantees of its entire variable annuity portfolio. Dynamic hedging stabilizes cash flows and reduces sensitivities to changes in interest rates (and equity markets) on an economic basis./uni00A0\n\nThe following table shows interest rates at the end of each of the last five years.\n\n|                          | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 3-month US LIBOR         | 0.21%   | 0.24%   | 1.91%   | 2.81%   | 1.69%   |\n| 3-month EURIBOR          | (0.57%) | (0.55%) | (0.38%) | (0.31%) | (0.33%) |\n| 10-year US Treasury      | 1.78%   | 0.91%   | 1.91%   | 2.69%   | 2.41%   |\n| 10-year Dutch government | (0.03%) | (0.48%) | (0.06%) | 0.39%   | 0.53%   |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis in the table below shows an estimate of the effect of a/uni00A0parallel shift in the yield curves on net result and shareholders' equity arising from the impact on general account investments and offset due to liabilities from insurance and investment contracts. Timing and valuation differences between assets and liabilities may cause short-term reductions in net result as rates rise. Rising interest rates would also cause the fair value of the available-for-sale bond portfolio to decline and the level of unrealized gains could become too low to support recoverability of the full deferred tax asset triggering an allowance charge to income./uni00A0The offsetting economic gain on the insurance and investment contracts is however not fully reflected in the sensitivities because many of these liabilities are not measured at fair value. The short to medium term reduction in net result due to rising interest rates would be offset by higher net result in later years, all else being equal. Therefore, higher interest rates are not considered a/uni00A0long-term risk to the Group. However, a/uni00A0long sustained period of low interest rates will erode net result due to lower returns earned on reinvestments and due to lower long term returns from decreased overall portfolio yields.",

The FSB proposed new standards to reform interest rate benchmarks and the use of transaction-based input data instead of nontransactional/panel input data./uni00A0\n\nTo prepare for the IBOR transition all Aegon units have written transition plan containing among others project solutions and actions, timelines and ownership to ensure timely preparation and implementation. We are currently implementing the actions as described in the transition plans./uni00A0\n\nThere are no plans for the discontinuation for EURIBOR and appropriate fallback language has been implemented for derivatives via the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') fallback protocol and rulebook changes by the clearing houses.\n\nIn the US the relevant USD LIBOR benchmark rates are expected to remain available for existing contracts until mid 2023 and these instruments are expected to either be transitioned actively to Secured Overnight Funding Rate ('SOFR') before the 2023 deadline, via the ISDA fallback protocol or via a/uni00A0legislative solution./uni00A0\n\nIn July 2020 the discount rates of EUR/uni00A0cleared derivatives switched from EONIA to \u20acSTR which impacted the valuation of derivatives for which compensation was exchanged. All EUR/uni00A0Credit Support Annex ('CSA') which have positions outstanding have been amended from EONIA to \u20acSTR discounting. In the US, the cleared market has switched discount rates from Fed Funds to SOFR in October 2020. The switch in discount rates is expected to lead to increased liquidity in the new risk free rates./uni00A0\n\nAegon recognizes that the reform of IBORs and any transition to replacement rates entail risks for all our businesses across our assets and liabilities. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal risks, as Aegon is required to make changes to documentation for new and existing transactions, such as funding instruments issued with an IBOR reference and derivatives held with an IBOR reference;\n- \u00b7 Financial risks, arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark rates, such as derivatives and floating rate notes, issued by, or invested in by Aegon;\n- \u00b7 Pricing risks, as changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some funding instruments or investments;\n- \u00b7 Operational risks, due to the potential requirement to adapt informational technology systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes; and\n- \u00b7 Conduct risks, relating to communication with potential impact on Aegon's customers, and engagement during the transition period.\n\nVarious supranational institutions, central banks, regulators, benchmark administrators and industry working groups play a/uni00A0role in the benchmark reform and the preparation for the replacement of IBORs. Although a/uni00A0lot of work has been done, there is still significant uncertainty around liquidity development, and the timetable and mechanisms for implementation, including application of spread adjustments to the alternative reference rates. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would affect Aegon. However, the implementation of alternative reference rates may have a/uni00A0material adverse effect on Aegon's business, financial condition, customers, and operations.",

Foreign currency exposure exists mainly when policies are denominated in currencies other than the issuer's functional currency. Currency risk in the investment portfolios backing insurance and investment liabilities is managed using asset liability matching principles. Assets allocated to equity are kept in local currencies to the extent shareholders' equity is required to satisfy regulatory and self-imposed capital requirements. Therefore, currency exchange rate fluctuations will affect the level of shareholders' equity as a/uni00A0result of translation of subsidiaries into euro, the Group's presentation currency. Aegon holds the remainder of its capital base (perpetual capital securities, subordinated and senior debt) in various currencies in amounts that are targeted to correspond to the book value of the country units. This balancing mitigates currency translation impacts on shareholders' equity and leverage ratios. Aegon does not hedge the income streams from the main non-euro units and, as a/uni00A0result, earnings may fluctuate due to currency translation. As Aegon has significant business segments in the Americas and in the United Kingdom, the principal sources of exposure from currency fluctuations are from the differences between the US dollar and the euro and between the UK pound and the euro. Aegon may experience significant changes in net result and shareholders' equity because of these fluctuations.\n\nAegon operates an Investment & Counterparty Risk Policy which applies currency risk exposure limits both at Group and regional levels, and under which direct currency speculation or program trading by country units is not allowed unless explicit approval has been granted by the Group Risk and Capital Committee and the Management Board. Assets should be held in the functional currency of the business written or hedged back to that currency. Where this is not possible or practical, remaining currency exposure should be sufficiently documented and limits are placed on the total exposure at both group level and for individual country units.\n\nInformation on Aegon's three year historical net result and shareholders' equity in functional currency are shown in the table below:\n\n|                               | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net result                    |        |        |        |\n| Americas (in USD)             | 1,195  | (611)  | 1,324  |\n| United Kingdom (in GBP)       | 104    | 60     | (29)   |\n| Equity in functional currency |        |        |        |\n| Americas (in USD)             | 18,324 | 19,127 | 18,123 |\n| United Kingdom (in GBP)       | 1,260  | 1,391  | 1,358  |",

Each asset purchased and liability incurred has its own liquidity characteristics. Some liabilities are surrenderable while some assets, such as privately placed loans, mortgage loans, real estate and limited partnership interests, have low liquidity. If Aegon requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements and existing credit facilities, it may have difficulty selling these investments at attractive prices or in a/uni00A0timely manner. Liquidity risk is also affected by the use of collateralized financial derivatives to mitigate other risks.\n\nAegon operates a/uni00A0Liquidity Risk Policy under which country units are obliged to maintain sufficient levels of highly liquid assets to meet cash demands by policyholders and account holders over the next two years. Potential cash demands are assessed under a/uni00A0stress scenario including spikes in disintermediation risk due to rising interest rates and concerns over Aegon's financial strength due to multiple downgrades of the Group's credit rating. At the same time, the liquidity of assets other than cash and government issues is assumed to be severely impaired for an extended period of time. All legal entities and Aegon Group must maintain enough liquidity in order to meet all cash needs under this extreme scenario.\n\nAegon held EUR/uni00A031,101/uni00A0million of general account investments in cash, money market products and government bonds that are readily saleable or redeemable on demand (2020: EUR/uni00A033,465/uni00A0million). The Group expects to meet its obligations, even in a/uni00A0stressed liquidity event, from operating cash flows and the proceeds of maturing assets as well as these highly liquid assets. Further, the Group has access to back-up credit facilities, as disclosed in note 37 Borrowings, amounting to EUR/uni00A03,399/uni00A0million which were unused at the end of the reporting period (2020: EUR/uni00A03,288/uni00A0million).",

        "page_content": "The maturity analysis below shows the remaining contractual maturities of each category of financial liabilities (including coupon interest). When the counterparty has a/uni00A0choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is included on the basis of the earliest date on which it can be required to be paid. Financial liabilities that can be required to be paid on demand without any delay are reported in the category 'On demand.' If there is a/uni00A0notice period, it has been assumed that notice is given immediately and the repayment has been presented at the earliest date after the end of the notice period. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount reported is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the reporting date. For example, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the reporting date.\n\nTo manage the liquidity risk arising from financial liabilities, Aegon holds liquid assets comprising cash and cash equivalents and investment grade investment securities for which there is an active and liquid market. These assets can be readily sold to meet liquidity requirements. For this reason, Aegon believes that it is not necessary to disclose a/uni00A0maturity analysis in respect of these assets to enable users to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.\n\n| Maturity analysis -

All reportable segments are involved in insurance or reinsurance business, asset management or services related to these activities. The reportable segments are:\n\n- \u00b7 Americas: one operating segment which covers business units in the United States and Brazil, including any of the units' activities located outside these countries;\n- \u00b7 The Netherlands: which covers businesses activities from Aegon the Netherlands;\n- \u00b7 United Kingdom: which covers businesses activities from platform business and traditional insurance in the United Kingdom;\n- \u00b7 International: one operating segment which covers businesses operating in Hong Kong, Singapore, China, India, Indonesia, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, Romania, Spain and Portugal including any of the units' activities located outside these countries;",

There is no standardized meaning to these measures under EU-IFRS or any other recognized set of accounting standards.\n\nAegon believes that its performance measure operating result provides meaningful information about the operating results of Aegon's business, including insight into the financial measures that Aegon's senior management uses in managing the business. Among other things, Aegon's senior management is compensated based in part on Aegon's results against targets using operating result. While many other insurers in Aegon's peer group present substantially similar performance measures, the performance measures presented in this document may nevertheless differ from the performance measures presented by other insurers.\n\nThe reconciliation from operating result to result before tax, being the most comparable EU-IFRS measure, is presented in the tables in this note.\n\nThe items that are excluded from operating result as described further below are: fair value items, realized gains or losses on investments, impairment charges/reversals, other income or charges and share in earnings of joint ventures and associates.\n\n## Change in naming convention of performance measure\n\nAegon has changed the naming convention of its primary performance measure to improve alignment with industry practice and the way in which Aegon manages its business. As of 2021, Aegon no longer refers to underlying earnings before tax for segment reporting purposes, instead Aegon refers to Operating result. Furthermore, Aegon introduced a/uni00A0new grouping of non-operating result which is the sum of Fair value items, Realized gains and losses on investments, and Net impairments. Other income / charges remains a/uni00A0separate category outside of Aegon's operating result.\n\n## Change in measurement of performance measure\n\nIn addition, Aegon has changed the measurement of its operating result from January 1, 2021. The following changes have been made:\n\n- \u00b7 The running cost of the US macro hedge related to the variable annuity portfolio is recorded within Operating result instead of in Fair value items. Management views this as a/uni00A0better reflection of Aegon's operating performance and improves the relevance of Aegon's operating result./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 The periodic intangibles unlocking, caused by short term market movements, in the US Life and TLB business is recorded in Fair value items, instead of Operating result, to improve the insight in Aegon's recurring operating result./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Results from run-off businesses, mainly related to US are part of Aegon's operating result. The results of run-off businesses were previously recorded outside of Aegon's operating result. Based on management actions executed in prior years the importance of run-off businesses has diminished and continuing to report this as a/uni00A0separate line item is considered no longer relevant.\n- \u00b7 Following the announcement to sell Aegon's operations in CEE, results from these businesses, previously reported in operating result, are prospectively recorded within Other income / charges.\n\nFor segment reporting purposes, the impact of these changes in measurement on full year 2020 was a decrease in Aegon's consolidated operating result of EUR 19 million, (2019: a decrease of EUR 75 million),/uni00A0as certain losses are no longer reported in Fair value items (2020: EUR 48 million, 2019: EUR 97 million) and results of Run-off businesses are no longer separately reported (2020: EUR 29 million loss,/uni00A02019: EUR 22 million loss). There is no impact on Aegon's net result, shareholders' equity, dividend per share, or any of the main schedules included in Aegon's Financial Statements, in any of the reporting periods. Comparative numbers have been restated in Aegon's segment reporting note, enabling a like for like comparison, with the exception of the reclassification of the results from Aegon's operations in CEE to Other income / charges which is applied prospectively.",

        "page_content": "## Fair value items\n\nFair value items include the over- or underperformance of investments and guarantees held at fair value for which management's best estimate investment return is included in operating result.\n\nIn addition, hedge ineffectiveness on hedge transactions, fair value changes on economic hedges without natural offset in earnings and for which no hedge accounting is applied and fair value movements on real estate are included under fair value items.\n\nCertain assets held by Aegon are carried at fair value and managed on a/uni00A0total return basis, with no offsetting changes in the valuation of related liabilities. These include assets such as investments in hedge funds, private equities, real estate (limited partnerships), convertible bonds and structured products. Operating result exclude any over- or underperformance compared to management's best estimate investment return on assets. Based on current holdings and asset returns, the long-term expected return on an annual basis is 3-10%, depending on asset class, including cash income and market value changes. The expected earnings from these asset classes are net of deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) where applicable.\n\nIn addition, certain products offered by Aegon Americas contain guarantees and are reported on a/uni00A0fair value basis and include the total return annuities and guarantees on variable annuities. The earnings on these products are impacted by movements in equity markets and risk-free interest rates. Short-term developments in the financial markets may therefore cause volatility in earnings.\n\nThe fair value movements of certain guarantees and the fair value change of derivatives that hedge certain risks on these guarantees of Aegon's businesses in the Netherlands and Japan are excluded from operating result, because management's best estimate expected return for these guarantees is set at zero. In addition, fair value items include market related results on the loyalty bonus reserves in the United Kingdom. The value of these reserves are directly related to policyholder investments which value is directly impacted by movements in equity and bond markets.\n\nHolding and other activities include certain issued bonds that are held at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The interest rate risk on these bonds is hedged using swaps. The fair value movement resulting from changes in Aegon's credit spread used in the valuation of these bonds are excluded from operating result and reported under fair value items.\n\nThe periodic intangibles unlocking in the US Life and TLB business is recorded in fair value items instead of operating result.\n\n## Realized gains or losses on investments\n\nRealized gains or losses on investments includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments, mortgage loans and other loan portfolios.\n\n## Impairment charges/(reversals)\n\nImpairment charges/(reversals) include impairments on available-for-sale debt securities, shares including the effect of deferred policyholder acquisition costs, mortgage loans and other loan portfolios at amortized cost, joint ventures and associates. Impairment reversals include reversals on available-for-sale debt securities. For Aegon the Netherlands, the expected impairments on alternative assets classes (e.g. illiquid investments - including consumer loans and catastrophe bonds - and residential real estate) are allocated to operating result before tax in order to present management's best estimate investment return in operating result before tax. Deviations from the expected impairments are presented as part of impairment charges / (reversals) in non-operating result.\n\n## Other income or charges\n\nOther income or charges includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Items which cannot be directly allocated to a/uni00A0specific line of business;\n- \u00b7 The impact of actuarial and economic assumption and model updates used to support calculations of our liabilities for insurance and investment contracts sold to policyholders and related assets (refer to note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgement in applying accounting policies); and\n- \u00b7 Items that are outside the normal course of business, including restructuring charges.\n\nIn the Consolidated income statement, the restructuring charges are included in operating expenses. Actuarial assumption and model updates are recorded in 'Policyholder claims and benefits' in the Consolidated income statement.",

Assumption changes and model updates in the Americas led to a net negative impact of EUR 250 million. This mainly reflects a charge of EUR 123 million related to an update of the minimum surrender rate assumption for variable annuities with guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits from 2% to 1.5% to reflect latest portfolio and industry experience. Assumption changes and model updates in the Netherlands led to a negative impact of EUR 52 million, mainly related to adverse impacts from a more granular modeling driven by the conversion of the administration of defined benefit pensions to TKP. This was partly offset by/uni00A0the favorable impact of model updates relating to interest guarantees and indexation assumptions for/uni00A0certain pension products.\n\nThe 2020 assumption changes and model updates amounted to a/uni00A0negative impact of EUR/uni00A0580/uni00A0million and mainly relates to Aegon's businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands. Assumption changes and model updates in the Americas led to a/uni00A0net negative impact of EUR/uni00A0805/uni00A0million. This reflects a/uni00A0charge of EUR/uni00A0460/uni00A0million related to the lowering the long-term interest rate assumption from 4.25% to 2.75% and the corresponding adjustment of the separate account bond return assumptions. Non-economic assumption changes resulted in a/uni00A0charge of EUR/uni00A0345/uni00A0million, mainly related to Universal Life premium persistency and an increase in mortality rate assumptions, as well as lowering the morbidity improvement assumption for Long-Term Care from 1.5% to 0.75% per year for the next 15 years. Assumption changes and model updates in the Netherlands led to a/uni00A0favorable impact of EUR/uni00A0225/uni00A0million mainly related to favorable longevity assumption changes, partially offset by adverse impacts from mortgage prepayment model and expense assumption updates./uni00A0\n\nThe/uni00A02019 assumption changes and model updates amounted to a/uni00A0negative impact of EUR/uni00A0196/uni00A0million and mainly relates to Aegon's businesses in the Americas and the Netherlands. Assumption changes and model updates in the Americas led to a/uni00A0net negative impact of EUR/uni00A064/uni00A0million mainly driven by/uni00A0updates to Universal Life products for surrender, lapse and mortality to reflect actual experience, partially offset by gains driven by updates to the annuitization of Variable Deferred Annuities Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit and to the returns on Equity-Index Universal Life. In the second half of 2019,/uni00A0a negative impact of EUR/uni00A075/uni00A0million resulted mostly from expenses assumption updates in the Americas. Assumption changes and model updates/uni00A0in the Netherlands led to negative impact of EUR/uni00A057/uni00A0million mainly/uni00A0related to model enhancements and expense assumption updates which more than offset favorable longevity assumption changes.\n\n| Other selected income statement/uni00A0items                                 | Americas   | The  Netherlands   | United  Kingdom   | International   | Asset  Management   | Holding and  other activities   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| 2021                                                                         |            |                    |                   |                 |                     |                                 |         |\n| Amortization of deferred expenses, VOBA and  future servicing rights         | 929        | -                  | 113               | 61              | -                   | -                               | 1,103   |\n| Depreciation                                                                 | 56         | 20                 | 6                 | 15              | 2                   | 1                               | 99      |\n| Impairment charges / (reversals) on financial  assets, excluding receivables | (23)       | (14)               | -                 | -               | -                   | (8)                             | (45)    |\n| Impairment charges / (reversals) on non-  financial assets and receivables   | 37         | 12                 | -                 | -               | 1                   | 11                              | 60      |\n| 2020                                                                         |            |                    |                   |                 |                     |                                 |         |\n| Amortization of deferred expenses, VOBA and  future servicing rights         | 637        | -                  | 119               | 97              | -                   | -                               | 854     |\n| Depreciation                                                                 | 56         | 20                 | 9                 | 12              | 2                   | 1                               | 101     |\n| Impairment charges / (reversals) on financial  assets, excluding receivables | 151        | 86                 | -                 | 15              | -                   | 11                              | 262     |\n| Impairment charges / (reversals) on non-  financial assets and receivables   | 72         | 21                 | 17                | -               | 4                   | 14                              | 128     |\n| 2019                                                                         |            |                    |                   |                 |                     |                                 |         |\n| Amortization of deferred expenses, VOBA and  future servicing rights         | 687        | 4                  | 117               | 66              | -                   | -                               | 875     |\n| Depreciation                                                                 | 44         | 18                 | 12                | 11              | 1                   | 2                               | 87      |\n| Impairment charges / (reversals) on financial  assets, excluding receivables | (12)       | 72                 | -                 | -               | -                   | -                               | 60      |\n| Impairment charges / (reversals) on non-  financial assets and receivables   | 3          | 94                 | -                 | 3               | -                   | 10                              | 109     |",

In line with these rules, variable compensation for Material Risk Takers is partially paid in cash and partly in Aegon shares. The grant price of these shares is equal to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding the plan year and January 15 of the plan year. The actual allocation of variable compensation in cash and shares depends on Aegon's performance, the employee's unit performance and individual performance against predefined financial and non-financial performance indicators and targets, as well as the continued employment of the employee. Once variable compensation is allocated, the cash part is paid directly and the payment of the shares is deferred for three years.

In exceptional circumstances Aegon's Supervisory Board can adjust variable compensation downwards before allocation or pay-out (malus) or after pay-out (claw back), after considering the outcomes of an ex-ante or ex-post risk assessment./uni00A0\n\n## Shares as Fixed Compensation\n\nSelected members of the Management Board as well as other senior employees receive part of their fixed compensation in Aegon shares each pay round, next to receiving fixed compensation in cash. The grant price of these shares is equal to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam during the period between December 15 preceding the plan year and January 15 of the plan year. Once allocated these shares are unconditional and do not depend on the continued employment of the employee. These shares are either paid as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting or the pay-out is deferred until the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting three years after the plan year. In the former case, these paid-out shares are subject to an additional holding period of three years, while in the latter case there is no holding period after pay-out. During the holding period (if applicable), the employee is not allowed to sell these shares. During the deferral period (if applicable), the employee is not eligible to receive dividend.\n\n## Shares as part of a/uni00A0Sign-on Arrangement\n\nEmployees may be offered a/uni00A0sign-on arrangement when joining Aegon, with payments in cash and Aegon shares, within the applicable rules and regulations. Once allocated, the sign-on shares depend on the continued employment of the employee. These shares are deferred and typically cliff-vest after one, two and three years after allocation as soon as the Integrated Annual Report has been adopted by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of that year. Employees are not eligible to receive dividend during the deferral period.\n\nThe following overview contains the cumulative number of shares and their status in relation to active Long Term Incentive Plans, variable compensation allocated to Material Risk Takers, shares allocated as fixed compensation and shares allocated as part of a/uni00A0sign-on arrangement.\n\n## Number of shares per plan year\n\n|                          | 2017      | 2018      | 2019      | 2020      | 2021      | Total      |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Conditionally granted 1) | 6,722,418 | 6,513,984 | 7,378,113 | 8,381,086 | 9,449,451 | 38,445,052 |\n| Allocated 2)             | 7,461,564 | 6,123,546 | 6,761,360 | 6,522,324 | -         | 26,868,794 |",

The weighted average applicable statutory tax rate decreased compared to 2020 due to high contribution of income before tax in the United Stated and relatively high income in 2021 from equity accounted joint ventures and associates - compared to the total consolidated income - which is presented net of tax in the consolidated income statement.\n\nNon-taxable income in 2021 is comprised of the regular non-taxable items such as the dividend received deduction in the United States and the participation exemption in the Netherlands. Compared to 2020 non-taxable income increased due to more exempt income in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the enacted future corporate income tax rate increased from 25% to 25.8% as from January 1, 2022 which resulted in an unfavorable tax rate impact. In the United Kingdom, the enacted future corporate income tax rate will increase from 19% to 25% as of April 1, 2023 which resulted in a/uni00A0beneficial tax rate impact.\n\nTax credits mainly include tax benefits from United States investments that provide affordable housing to individuals and families that meet median household income requirements.",

If approved and in combination with the interim dividend 2021 of EUR/uni00A00.08 per common share, Aegon's total dividend over 2021 will amount to EUR/uni00A00.17 per common share. After taking into account the interim dividend 2021 of EUR/uni00A00.002 per common share B, Aegon's total dividend over 2021 will amount to EUR/uni00A00.00425 per common share B.\n\n## Interim dividend 2021\n\nThe interim dividend 2021 was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. Approximately 42% of holders of common shares elected to receive the cash dividend. The remaining 58% of shareholders elected to receive the interim dividend in stock. The cash dividend amounted to EUR/uni00A00.08 per common share, the stock dividend amounted to one new Aegon common share for every 52 common shares held. The stock dividend and cash dividend are approximately equal in value. The dividend was payable as of September 17, 2021. The interim dividend 2021 for common shares B amounted to 1/40 th of the dividend paid on common shares.\n\nTo neutralize the dilutive effect of the 2021 interim dividend paid in shares, Aegon executed a/uni00A0program to repurchase 21,531,927 common shares. The repurchase of shares commenced on October 1, 2021 and was completed on October 27, 2021. Aegon engaged a/uni00A0third party to execute the transactions on its behalf. The common shares were repurchased at a/uni00A0maximum of the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices during the repurchase period.\n\n## Final dividend 2020\n\nIt was decided at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 3, 2021 to pay a/uni00A0final dividend for 2020 of EUR/uni00A00.06 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.0015 per common share B. After taking into account the interim dividend of EUR/uni00A00.06 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.0015 per common share B, this resulted in a/uni00A0total 2020 dividend of EUR/uni00A00.12 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.0030 per common share B.\n\nThe final dividend for 2020 was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. The value of the dividend in common shares was approximately equal to the cash dividend. Those who elected to receive a/uni00A0stock dividend received one Aegon common share for every 59 common shares held. The stock fraction was based on Aegon's average share price as quoted on Euronext Amsterdam, using the high and low of each of the five trading days from June 24 up to and including June 30, 2021. The average price calculated on this basis amounted to EUR/uni00A03.52. The dividend was paid as of July 7, 2021.\n\nTo neutralize the dilutive effect of the 2020 final dividend paid in shares, Aegon executed a share buyback program to repurchase 35,933,035 common shares. Between July 8, 2021 and August 20, 2021, these common shares were repurchased at an average price of EUR 3.7013 per share. These shares are held as treasury shares and are used to cover future stock dividends.\n\n## Interim dividend 2020\n\nThe interim dividend 2020 was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. Approximately 52% of holders of common shares elected to receive the cash dividend. The remaining 48% of shareholders elected to receive the interim dividend in stock. The cash dividend amounted to EUR/uni00A00.06 per common share, the stock dividend amounted to one new Aegon common share for every 39 common shares held. The stock dividend and cash dividend are approximately equal in value. The dividend was payable as of September 18, 2020. The interim dividend 2020 for common shares B amounted to 1/40 th of the dividend paid on common shares.\n\nTo neutralize the dilutive effect of the 2020 interim dividend paid in shares, Aegon executed a/uni00A0program to repurchase 24,028,645 common shares. The repurchase of shares commenced on October 1, 2020 and was completed on October 27, 2020. Aegon engaged a/uni00A0third party to execute the transactions on its behalf. The common shares were repurchased at a/uni00A0maximum of the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices during the repurchase period.\n\n## Final dividend 2019\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2020 it was decided to forego the 2019 final dividend. Aegon decided to comply with the call made by European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and Dutch Central Bank (DNB)",

Furthermore, in 2020 Aegon took several actions to strengthen its balance sheet and improve its risk profile. In this context, Aegon decided to retain the final dividend for 2019. Taking into account the interim dividend paid in September 2019, this results in a/uni00A0total dividend for the financial year 2019 of EUR/uni00A00.15 per common share and EUR/uni00A00.00375 per common share B, paid in September 2019.\n\n## Interim dividend 2019\n\nThe interim dividend 2019 was paid in cash or stock at the election of the shareholder. Approximately 55% of holders of common shares elected to receive the cash dividend. The remaining 45% opted for stock dividend. The cash dividend amounted to EUR/uni00A00.15 per common share, the stock dividend amounted to one new Aegon common share for every 25 common shares held. The stock dividend and cash dividend are approximately equal in value. The interim dividend was payable as of September 20, 2019. The interim dividend 2019 for common shares B amounted to 1/40 th of the dividend paid on common shares.\n\nTo neutralize the dilutive effect of the 2019 interim dividend paid in shares, Aegon executed a/uni00A0program to repurchase 43,149,667 common shares. Between October 1, 2019, and November 8, 2019, these common shares were repurchased at an average price of EUR/uni00A03.89 per share. These shares are held as treasury shares and are used to cover future stock dividends.\n\n## 21 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n|                                                                                                                        | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                                                                               | 3,638   | 4,907   | 4,619   |\n| Short-term deposits                                                                                                    | 1,576   | 2,214   | 2,518   |\n| Money market investments                                                                                               | 1,675   | 1,247   | 5,116   |\n| Short-term collateral                                                                                                  | -       | 4       | 11      |\n| At December 31                                                                                                         | 6,889   | 8,372   | 12,263  |\n| Cash collateral received related to securities lending, repurchase agreements and  margins on derivatives transactions | 5,776   | 9,208   | 7,166   |\n| Income from security lending programs                                                                                  | 3       | 9       | 6       |\n| Weighted effective interest rate on short-term deposits                                                                | (0.72%) | (0.64%) | (0.38%) |\n| Average maturity days on short-term deposits                                                                           | 16      | 10      | 19      |\n\nThe carrying amounts disclosed reasonably approximate the fair values as at the year-end.\n\nFor cash collateral received related to securities lending, repurchase agreements and margins on derivatives transactions, a/uni00A0corresponding liability to repay the cash is recognized in other liabilities (refer to note 41 Other liabilities). Also, refer to note 46 Transfer of financial assets for details on collateral received and paid. Investment of cash collateral received is restricted through limitations on credit worthiness, duration, approved investment categories and borrower limits. Short-term collateral relates to cash collateral received included in cash and cash equivalents and the remainder is included in other asset classes as that collateral is typically reinvested. Aegon earns a/uni00A0share of the spread between the collateral earnings and the rebate paid to the borrower of the securities which is reflected in Income from securities lending programs.\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and demand balances held at the Dutch Central Bank. The Dutch Central Bank requires Aegon Bank N.V. to place 1% of their deposits with agreed maturity or the savings accounts (without restrictions to withdraw their money) in an account with the Dutch Central Bank. This deposit is renewed every 42-49 days, based on an updated valuation of total assets./uni00A0The interest paid on this minimum reserve deposit is equal to the ECB deposit facility rate amounting to -50bp. The year-end minimum required balance on deposit by the Dutch Central Bank was EUR/uni00A074/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A084/uni00A0million, 2019: EUR/uni00A079/uni00A0million). These deposits are therefore not freely available.\n\n| Summary cash flow statement                              | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net cash flows from operating activities                 | (1,796) | (2,854) | 7,302   |\n| Net cash flows from investing activities                 | (54)    | (139)   | (86)    |\n| Net cash flows from financing activities                 | 300     | (778)   | (3,730) |\n| Net increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents   | (1,550) | (3,770) | 3,486   |\n| Net cash and cash equivalents are impacted by:           |         |         |         |\n| Positive (negative) effects of changes in exchange rates | 67      | (121)   | 33      |",

The main movements are the decreased cash outflows regarding purchase of investments and the increased/uni00A0cash inflows from disposal of investments (refer to note 22 Investment), partially offset by outflow from insurance and investment liabilities (refer to note 34 Insurance contracts) and by the increased outflow from/uni00A0results from financial transactions (refer to note 10 Results from financial transactions).\n\n## Net cash flows from investing activities\n\nNet cash flows from investing activities increased by EUR/uni00A085/uni00A0million to a/uni00A0EUR/uni00A054/uni00A0million outflow (2020: EUR/uni00A0139/uni00A0million outflow).

The increase is a/uni00A0result of lower repayments of borrowings/uni00A0and higher proceeds (refer to note 37 Borrowings), partially offset by higher purchases of treasury shares (refer to the table below and note 31 Other equity instruments).\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\n## Net cash flows from operating activities\n\nTotal net cash flow from operating activities decreased by EUR/uni00A010,156/uni00A0million to a/uni00A0EUR/uni00A02,854/uni00A0million outflow (2019: EUR/uni00A07,302/uni00A0million inflow). The main movements are the cash inflows regarding insurance and investment liabilities general account and for account of policyholders (refer to note 34 Insurance contracts and note 35 Investment contracts), cash inflows from disposal of investments (other than money market investments, refer to note 22 Investments), partially offset by outflow from results from financial transactions (refer to note 10 Results from financial transactions).\n\n## Net cash flows from investing activities\n\nNet cash flows from investing activities decreased by EUR/uni00A053/uni00A0million to a/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0139/uni00A0million outflow (2019: EUR/uni00A086/uni00A0million outflow).

The total consideration received for disposals, excluding transferred assets and reinsurance assets from reinsurance transactions, was EUR/uni00A0154/uni00A0million. The outflow in 2020 is mainly driven by the expansion of the joint venture arrangement with Banco Santander in Spain, offset by the sale of its 50% stake in the variable annuity joint ventures in Japan/uni00A0(refer to note 48 Companies and businesses acquired and divested).\n\n## Net cash flows from financing activities\n\nNet cash flow from financing activities increased by EUR/uni00A02,952/uni00A0million to a/uni00A0EUR/uni00A0778/uni00A0million outflow (2019: EUR/uni00A03,730/uni00A0million outflow).

These longevity derivatives are constructed to pay out if the mortality rates in future years decrease more than a/uni00A0predetermined percentage compared with the base scenario at the moment of signing the contract. These derivatives are used to enhance Aegon's risk-return profile and to improve capital efficiency. The value of the longevity derivatives are calculated using an internal model as there is no active market for this type of derivatives. As per December 31, 2021 no longevity derivatives are in place. Refer to note 26 Reinsurance assets for further information on the risk of future longevity of Aegon the Netherlands.",

The derivatives held for risk management purposes are classified as economic hedges to the extent that they do not qualify for hedge accounting, or that Aegon has elected not to apply hedge accounting. The economic hedges of certain exposures relate to an existing asset, liability or future reinvestment risk. In all cases, these are in accordance with internal risk guidelines and are closely monitored for continuing compliance.\n\nBifurcated embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host contracts have been bifurcated and recorded at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position. These bifurcated embedded derivatives are embedded in various institutional products, modified coinsurance and unit-linked insurance contracts in the form of guarantees for minimum benefits. Please refer to note 36 Guarantees in insurance contracts for more disclosures about these guarantees.\n\n## Credit Default Swaps\n\nAegon has entered into free-standing credit derivative transactions.

This involves the purchase of high quality, low risk assets and the sale of credit derivatives. The table above provides a/uni00A0breakdown in credit quality of these credit derivatives./uni00A0The credit ratings relate to the underlying exposures/uni00A0of these credit derivatives.\n\n## Derivatives designated as fair value hedges\n\nAegon's fair value hedges includes interest rate swaps, swaptions, equity and fixed income total return swaps, equity options, equity futures, bond futures and variance swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of interest rate and equity sensitive instruments or liabilities. Gains and losses on derivatives designated under fair value hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement. The effective portion of the fair value change on the hedged item is also recognized in the income statement. As a/uni00A0result, only the net accounting ineffectiveness has an impact on the net result.\n\nAegon has entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert certain fixed-rate assets and liabilities to a/uni00A0floating-rate basis (generally to six months or less LIBOR). These hedges are used for portfolio management to better match assets to liabilities or to protect the value of the hedged item from interest rate movements. These agreements involve the payment or receipt of fixed-rate interest amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest amounts over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Some of the arrangements use forward starting swaps to better match the duration of assets and liabilities.\n\nAegon has entered into cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert certain foreign currency fixed-rate and floating-rate assets and liabilities to US dollar floating-rate assets and liabilities. These agreements involve the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.",

This amount was offset by EUR/uni00A0442/uni00A0million positive fair value changes recognized on the derivatives used as hedging instrument (2020: EUR/uni00A0255/uni00A0million negative).\n\n## Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges\n\nAegon has entered primarily into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert certain variable-rate assets and liabilities to a/uni00A0fixed-rate basis in order to match the cash flows of the assets and liabilities within Aegon's portfolio more closely. These agreements involve the payment or receipt of variable-rate interest amounts in exchange for fixed-rate interest amounts over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Aegon hedges its exposure to the variability of future cash flows from the interest rate movements for terms up to 23 years for hedges converting existing floating-rate assets and liabilities to fixed-rate assets.\n\nAegon uses forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in future cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of fixed-income assets. These agreements reduce the impact of future interest rate changes on the forecasted transaction. Fair value adjustments for these interest rate swaps are deferred and recorded in equity until the occurrence of the forecasted transaction at which time the interest rate swaps will be terminated. The accumulated gain or loss in equity will be amortized into investment income as the acquired asset affects income. Aegon hedges its exposure to the variability of future cash flows from interest rate movements for terms up to 22 years. The cash flows from these hedging instruments are expected to affect the profit and loss for approximately the next 40 years. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the contracts for which cash flow hedge accounting was terminated resulted in deferred gains of EUR/uni00A060/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0186/uni00A0million) that are recognized directly in equity to be reclassified into net result during the period when the cash flows occur of the underlying hedged items. During the year ended December 31, 2021, none of Aegon's cash flow hedges were discontinued as it was highly probable that the original forecasted transactions would occur by the end of the originally specified time period documented at the inception of the hedging relationship./uni00A0Aegon projects investment needs many years into the future in order to support the insurance liabilities and pay all contractual obligations arising from the policies in force today.\n\nIn addition, Aegon also makes use of cross currency swaps to convert variable or fixed foreign currency cash flows into fixed cash flows in local currencies. The cash flows from these hedging instruments are expected to occur over the next 35 years. These agreements involve the exchange of the underlying principal amounts.\n\n| Hedge ineffectiveness and reclassification of gains (losses)                                            | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges                                                               | 1      | -      | -      |\n| Gains (losses) reclassified from equity into the income statement                                       | (38)   | 74     | 51     |\n| Expected deferred gain (loss) to be reclassified from equity into net result during  the next 12 months | 113    | 92     | 89     |\n\nThe periods when the cash flows are expected to occur are as follows:\n\n|                | < 1 year   | 1 - 5 years   | 5 - 10 years   | > 10 years   | 2021 Total   |\n|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Cash inflows   | 535        | 2,158         | 1,640          | 5,868        | 10,201       |\n| Cash outflows  | -          | 4             | -              | -            | 4            |\n| Net cash flows | 535        | 2,154         | 1,640          | 5,868        | 10,197       |\n\n|                | < 1 year   |   1 - 5 years | 5 - 10 years   | > 10 years   | 2020 Total   |\n|----------------|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Cash inflows   | 268        |           761 | 767            | 5,402        | 7,197        |\n| Cash outflows  | -          |             4 | -              | -            | 4            |\n| Net cash flows | 267        |           757 | 767            | 5,402        | 7,193        |",

        "page_content": "## Effect of uncertainty of IBOR reform on derivatives designated as fair value and cash flows hedges\n\nThe future of IBORs (Interbank Offered Rates) such as EURIBOR, EONIA and LIBOR has been a/uni00A0major topic on the global agenda since the G20 asked the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to undertake a/uni00A0fundamental review of leading interest rate benchmarks in 2013. The FSB proposed new standards to reform interest rate benchmarks and the use of transaction-based input data instead of nontransactional/panel input data. In the EU this is adopted in the new Benchmark Regulation (BMR) which stipulates that from January 2020 only BMR compliant benchmarks may be used within the EU./uni00A0\n\nIn order to prepare for the IBOR transition all Aegon units have written transition plans containing among others project solutions and actions, timelines and ownership to ensure timely preparation and implementation. We are currently implementing the actions as described in the transition plans./uni00A0\n\nIn July 2020 the discount rates of EUR/uni00A0cleared derivatives switched from EONIA to \u20acSTR which impacted the valuation of derivatives for which compensation was exchanged. All EUR/uni00A0Credit Support Annex ('CSA') which have positions outstanding have been amended from EONIA to \u20acSTR discounting. In the US, the cleared market has switched discount rates from Fed Funds to Secured Overnight Funding Rate ('SOFR') in October 2020. The switch in discount rates is expected to lead to increased liquidity in the new risk free rates./uni00A0\n\nThe majority of the fair value and cash flow hedges are directly exposed to changes in benchmark rates (predominantly EURIBOR and USD LIBOR). There are no plans for the discontinuation of EURIBOR and appropriate fallback language has been implemented via the International Swaps and Derivatives ('ISDA') fallback protocol and rulebook changes by the clearing houses. The relevant USD LIBOR benchmark rates are expected to remain available for existing contracts until mid 2023 and these derivatives will either be actively transitioned to SOFR before the 2023 deadline or via the ISDA fallback protocol. The total notional of financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges with a/uni00A0USD LIBOR reference that have a/uni00A0maturity date beyond June 30, 2023 amount to EUR/uni00A03,439/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A01,283/uni00A0million)./uni00A0\n\nAegon applies the reliefs offered in IAS 39 to ensure that this uncertainty does not result in the early termination of hedge accounting, whilst also assuming for measurement purposes that, owing to the general principle of equivalence, transitions to alternative rates will not result in significant contract modifications.\n\n## Net foreign investment hedges\n\nAegon funds its investments in insurance subsidiaries with a/uni00A0mixture of debt and equity. Aegon aims to denominate debt funding in the same currency as the functional currency of the investment. Investments outside the Eurozone, the United States and the United Kingdom are funded in euros. When the debt funding of investments is not in the functional currency of the investment, Aegon uses derivatives to swap the currency exposure of the debt instrument to the appropriate functional currency. This policy will ensure that total capital will reflect currency movements without distorting debt to shareholders' equity ratios. Aegon utilizes various financial instruments as designated hedging instruments of its foreign investments. These instruments include long-term and short-term borrowings, short-term debts to credit institutions, cross currency swap contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\n## 25 Investments in joint ventures and associates\n\n|                                        | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Associates   | Associates   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                        | 2021             | 2020             | 2021         | 2020         |\n| At January 1                           | 1,376            | 1,983            | 1,264        | 363          |\n| Additions                              | 61               | 254              | 12           | 59           |\n| Disposals                              | -                | (105)            | -            | (5)          |\n| Share in net result                    | 265              | 184              | 112          | 111          |\n| Share in changes in equity (note 30.6) | 25               | 12               | (6)          | 7            |\n| Impairment reversals / (charges)       | -                | (4)              | 3            | (20)         |\n| Dividends                              | (88)             | (94)             | (39)         | (44)         |\n| Net exchange difference                | 45               | (7)              | 2            | (28)         |\n| Transfer to / (from) other headings    | 58               | (836)            | (58)         | 818          |\n| Other                                  | -                | (11)             | -            | 1            |\n| At December 31                         | 1,743            | 1,376            | 1,289        | 1,264        |",

        "page_content": "In 2021, Aegon amended its agreement related to the investment in MAG Seguros and injected EUR/uni00A040/uni00A0million in the undertaking. Following the amendment the investment required reclassification from Investments in associates to Investments in joint ventures as the level of influence was affected. The transfer to / (from) other headings in 2021 reflect the carrying amount of the investment of EUR/uni00A058/uni00A0million prior to the capital injection of EUR/uni00A040/uni00A0million.\n\nWith the exception of a/uni00A0limited number of immaterial venture capital entities, all joint ventures and associates are unlisted and are accounted for using the equity method and are considered to be non-current. The investments in joint ventures and associates include interest in insurance companies that are required to maintain a/uni00A0minimum solvency margin based on local directives. Such restrictions can affect the ability of these joint ventures and associates to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends, or repayment of loans or advances, and therefore, there can be no assurance that these restrictions will not become a/uni00A0limitation in the future. Refer to note 45 Commitments and contingencies for any commitments and contingencies related to investments in joint ventures. There are no unrecognized shares of losses in joint ventures and associates. The financial statements of the principal joint ventures and associates have the same reporting date as the Group. Refer to note 49 Group companies for a/uni00A0listing of the investments in joint ventures and associates and the Group's percentage holding.\n\n## Summarized financial information of joint ventures\n\nThe summarized financial information presented in the following table presents the joint ventures on a/uni00A0100% basis. Aegon considers its investments in Santander Vida Seguros y Reaseguros S.A. ('Santander Spain Life') and Aegon Industrial Fund Management Co.Ltd. ('AIFMC') as/uni00A0material joint ventures and are therefore presented separately.\n\n|                                                                                  | Santander Spain Life   | Santander Spain Life   | AIFMC   | AIFMC   | Other Joint ventures   | Other Joint ventures   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                                  | 2021                   | 2020                   | 2021    | 2020    | 2021                   | 2020                   |\n| Summarized statement of financial  position                                      |                        |                        |         |         |                        |                        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                        | 20                     | 14                     | 351     | 227     | 157                    | 198                    |\n| Other current assets                                                             | 130                    | 35                     | 810     | 423     | 697                    | 588                    |\n| Total current assets                                                             | 150                    | 50                     | 1,161   | 650     | 854                    | 785                    |\n| Non-current assets                                                               | 1,134                  | 700                    | 204     | 127     | 5,574                  | 6,442                  |\n| Total assets                                                                     | 1,284                  | 750                    | 1,364   | 777     | 6,428                  | 7,227                  |\n| Current financial liabilities excluding trade  payables and other provisions     | -

Furthermore, in the Netherlands a reinsurance agreement protecting against longevity risk was closed with Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) leading to a deferred cost of reinsurance of EUR 115 million.\n\nIn 2020, a/uni00A0model change and updated parameters regarding education and mortality experience factors in Aegon the Netherlands led to a/uni00A0decrease in the deferred cost of reinsurance of EUR/uni00A0214/uni00A0million, which is included in the line Other.",

None of the intangible assets have titles that are restricted or have been pledged as security for liabilities.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, all intangible assets have a/uni00A0finite useful life and are amortized accordingly. VOBA and future servicing rights are amortized over the term of the related insurance contracts, which can vary significantly depending on the maturity of the acquired portfolio./uni00A0The amortization is based on either the expected future premiums, revenues or the expected gross profit margins, which for the most significant blocks of business ranges between 50 and 80 years. Future servicing rights are amortized over a/uni00A0period of 10 to 30 years of which 13 years remain at December 31, 2021 (2020: 13 years). Software is generally depreciated over an average period of 3 to 5 years (no changes compared to 2020).\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe goodwill balance has been allocated across the cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies inherent in the goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment both annually and when there are specific indicators of a/uni00A0potential impairment. The recoverable amount is the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs of disposal for a/uni00A0cash-generating unit. The operating assumptions used in all the calculations are best estimate assumptions and based on historical data where available.\n\nThe economic assumptions used in all the calculations are based on observable market data and projections of future trends. All the cash-generating units tested showed that the recoverable amount was higher than their carrying values, including goodwill. A reasonably possible change in any key assumption is not expected to cause the carrying value of the cash-generating units to exceed its recoverable amount.",

Transamerica uses the value in use concept to determine the recoverable amount and it is calculated annually in the fourth quarter. Transamerica reviewed the recoverable amount of the annuities and retirement plan cash-generating units under the Economic Available Capital (EAC) approach. This approach measures the difference between the market value of assets assigned to a/uni00A0block of business and the market value of liabilities. The EAC is reflective of market conditions where a/uni00A0pre-tax benchmark discount rate ranged from approximately 0.10% to 2.14% from the one month to 30-year tenors. Based on the value in use tests, Transamerica's goodwill for the group of annuities cash-generating units (2021: EUR/uni00A0125/uni00A0million: 2020: EUR/uni00A0116/uni00A0million) and the retirement plans cash-generating unit (2021: EUR/uni00A056/uni00A0million: 2020: EUR/uni00A052/uni00A0million) remain unchanged from prior year except for the impact of currency translation adjustments./uni00A0\n\nFor Aegon the Netherlands, goodwill was allocated to Robidus - a/uni00A0cash generating unit whose value in use exceeds its carrying value. The value in use calculations were based on business plans covering a/uni00A0period of five years, pre-tax and post-tax discount rate of 7.2%, and terminal growth rate at 1%. The goodwill arises mainly from new customers, future software platform developments, synergies, and assembled workforce.\n\n## 30 Shareholders' equity\n\nIssued share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of Aegon/uni00A0N.V.\n\n|                                        | Note   | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Share capital - par value              | 30.1   | 321     | 320     | 323     |\n| Share premium                          | 30.2   | 7,033   | 7,160   | 7,213   |\n| Total share capital                    |        | 7,354   | 7,480   | 7,536   |\n| Retained earnings                      |        | 12,635  | 11,124  | 11,262  |\n| Treasury shares                        | 30.3   | (273)   | (181)   | (281)   |\n| Total retained earnings                |        | 12,362  | 10,943  | 10,981  |\n| Revaluation reserves                   | 30.4   | 6,442   | 7,480   | 5,873   |\n| Remeasurement of defined benefit plans | 30.5   | (2,199) | (2,534) | (2,397) |\n| Other reserves                         | 30.6   | 325     | (553)   | 456     |\n| Total shareholders' equity             |        | 24,282  | 22,815  | 22,449  |",

The assets of these trusts consist of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by Transamerica Corporation. The trust pass-through securities carry provisions with regard to deferral of distributions for extension periods up to a/uni00A0maximum of 10 consecutive semi-annual periods. The trust passthrough securities are subordinated to all other unsubordinated borrowings and liabilities of Transamerica Corporation./uni00A0 There were no defaults or breaches of conditions during the period.\n\n## 34 Insurance contracts 34.1 Underwriting risk\n\nAegon's earnings depend significantly upon the extent to which actual claims experience differs from the assumptions used in setting the prices for products and establishing the technical liabilities and liabilities for claims. To the extent that actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities, income would be reduced. Furthermore, if these higher claims were part of a/uni00A0permanent trend, Aegon may be required to change best estimate assumptions for future claims which could increase the required reserves for these future claims, which could reduce income. In addition, certain acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force have been recorded as assets on the statement of financial position and are being amortized into the income statement over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these policies (such as future claims, investment income and expenses) are not realized, the amortization of these costs could be accelerated and may even require write offs should there be an expectation of unrecoverability. This could have a/uni00A0materially adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSources of underwriting risk include policyholder behavior (such as lapses, surrender of policies or partial withdrawals), policy claims (such as mortality, longevity or morbidity) and expenses. For some product lines, Aegon is at risk if policy lapses increase as sometimes Aegon is unable to fully recover upfront expenses in selling a/uni00A0product despite the presence of commission recoveries or surrender charges and fees. There are also products where Aegon is at risk if lapses decrease, for example where this would result in a/uni00A0higher utilization rate of product guarantees. For mortality and morbidity risk, Aegon sells certain types of policies that are at risk if mortality or morbidity increases, such as term life insurance and accident insurance, Aegon also sells certain types of policies that are at risk if mortality decreases (longevity risk) such as annuity products. Aegon is also at risk if expenses are higher than the expenses assumed beforehand by management and that were priced into the products.\n\nAegon monitors and manages its underwriting risk by underwriting risk type. Attribution analysis is performed on earnings and reserve movements in order to understand the source of any material variation in actual results from what was expected. Aegon's units also perform experience studies for underwriting risk assumptions, comparing Aegon's experience to industry experience as well as combining Aegon's experience and industry experience based on the depth of the history of each source to Aegon's underwriting assumptions. Where policy charges are flexible in products, Aegon uses these analyses as the basis for modifying these charges, with a/uni00A0view to maintain a/uni00A0balance between policyholder and shareholder interests. Aegon also has the ability to reduce expense levels over time, thus mitigating unfavorable expense variation.\n\nAnother way to mitigate underwriting risk is through reinsurance. Aegon uses reinsurance to primarily manage and diversify risk, limit volatility, improve capital positions, limit maximum losses and gain access to reinsurer support. While the objectives and use can vary by region due to local market considerations and product offerings, the use of reinsurance is coordinated and monitored globally.",

Also, Excess of Loss reinsurance is used to limit our exposure to large losses on non-life business. In addition, in recent years in the Netherlands, we have used longevity reinsurance to manage our longevity exposure in line with our Risk Appetite, and Aegon the Netherlands entered into a/uni00A0new contract taking the level of longevity reinsurance to around 40%/uni00A0in December 2021./uni00A0\n\nIn order to minimize its reinsurer defaults exposure, Aegon regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its reinsurers, and where appropriate, arranges additional protection through letters of credit, trust agreements and over-collateralization. For certain agreements, funds are withheld for investment rather than relying on the reinsurer to meet investment expectations. Default exposure is further reduced by using multiple reinsurers within certain reinsurance agreements./uni00A0\n\nExternal reinsurance counterparties are, in general, major global reinsurers. At the same time, local reinsurers are utilized to ensure a/uni00A0balance for local capacity and diversification.\n\nSensitivity analysis of net result and shareholders' equity to various underwriting risks is shown in the table that follows. Aegon's best estimate assumptions already include expected future developments and the sensitivities represent an increase or decrease of lapse rates, mortality rates and morbidity rates, compared to Aegon's best estimate assumptions. These underwriting sensitivities were run using a/uni00A0permanent shock applied to all of Aegon's products, exposed to an increase and to a/uni00A0decrease in the rates. The table below indicates that the morbidity sensitivity has the largest impact and in aggregate, Aegon is exposed to a/uni00A0decrease in mortality rates.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of net result and shareholders' equity to changes in various underwriting risks\n\n|                                 | 2021                     | 2021          | 2020                     | 2020          |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| Estimated approximate effect    | On shareholders'  equity | On net result | On shareholders'  equity | On net result |\n| 20% increase in lapse rates     | 108                      | 109           | (151)                    | 156           |\n| 20% decrease in lapse rates     | (110)                    | (115)         | 47                       | (157)         |\n| 5% increase in mortality rates  | 340                      | 295           | 52                       | 344           |\n| 5% decrease in mortality rates  | (434)                    | (378)         | (217)                    | (354)         |\n| 10% increase in morbidity rates | (292)                    | (284)         | (225)                    | (235)         |\n| 10% decrease in morbidity rates | 178                      | 175           | 134                      | 140           |\n\n## 34.2 Insurance contracts for general account\n\n|                                         | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Life insurance                          | 110,691 | 109,062 |\n| Non-life insurance                      |         |         |\n| - Unearned premiums and unexpired risks | 6,548   | 6,117   |\n| - Outstanding claims                    | 2,247   | 2,120   |\n| - Incurred but not reported claims      | 816     | 881     |\n| Incoming reinsurance                    | 4,120   | 3,965   |\n| At December 31                          | 124,422 | 122,146 |\n\n|                                 | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Non-life insurance:             |        |        |\n| - Accident and health insurance | 9,374  | 8,887  |\n| - General insurance             | 237    | 231    |\n| Total non-life insurance        | 9,611  | 9,118  |",

The net LAT deficit was positively impacted by the impact of higher interest rate of EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A01.5/uni00A0billion negative) and positive credit spread movements (tightened mortgage spreads and liquidity premium) of EUR/uni00A00.4/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion negative). This was partly offset by other unfavorable impacts (model and assumptions updates and portfolio changes) totaling EUR/uni00A00.9/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A01.0/uni00A0billion positive).\n\nAs a/uni00A0result of the current deficit, changes in the LAT of Aegon the Netherlands, triggered by up or down movements in interest rates, are directly recognized in the income statement./uni00A0However, net result is less sensitive to interest rate movements as the results from interest rate hedging are also recognized in net result.\n\nFurthermore, as a/uni00A0result of the current negative LAT deficit position, results are volatile due to changes in credit spreads as these are not hedged. Please find below the estimated sensitivities on shareholders' equity and on net result, for up and down shocks for credit spreads, mortgage spreads for the bond and mortgage portfolio and liquidity premium shocks for general account insurance liabilities.\n\n| Sensitivity analysis of net result and shareholders' equity   | Estimated approximate effects  on net result   | Estimated approximate effects  on shareholders' equity   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2021                                                          |                                                |                                                          |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads                | (192)                                          | (2,418)                                                  |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads              | 169                                            | 2,387                                                    |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                   | (444)                                          | (401)                                                    |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                 | 452                                            | 496                                                      |\n| Shift up 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                   | 136                                            | 178                                                      |\n| Shift down 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                 | (148)                                          | (104)                                                    |\n| 2020                                                          |                                                |                                                          |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads                | (185)                                          | (1,998)                                                  |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Bond credit spreads              | 172                                            | 1,873                                                    |\n| Shift up 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                   | (449)                                          | (449)                                                    |\n| Shift down 50 basis points - Mortgage spreads                 | 476                                            | 477                                                      |\n| Shift up 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                   | 162                                            | 159                                                      |\n| Shift down 5 basis points - Liquidity premium                 | (164)                                          | (161)                                                    |",

Financial guarantees: these guarantees are treated as bifurcated embedded derivatives, valued at fair value and presented as derivatives (refer to note 2.9 and note 44 Fair value);\n- b.  Total return annuities: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts because they are presented and valued at fair value together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19);\n- c. Life contingent guarantees in the United States: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, presented and valued in accordance with insurance accounting together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19); and\n- d.  Minimum investment return guarantees in the Netherlands: these guarantees are not bifurcated from their host contracts, valued at fair value and presented together with the underlying insurance contracts (refer to note 2.19 and note 44 Fair value).\n\nIn addition to the guarantees mentioned above, Aegon has traditional life insurance contracts that include minimum guarantees that are not valued explicitly; however, the adequacy of all insurance liabilities, net of VOBA and DPAC, and including all guarantees, are assessed periodically (refer to note 2.19).\n\n## a. Financial guarantees\n\nIn the United States, a/uni00A0guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) is offered directly on some variable annuity products Aegon issues and is also assumed from a/uni00A0ceding company. Variable annuities allow a/uni00A0customer to provide for the future on a/uni00A0tax-deferred basis and to participate in equity or bond market performance. Variable annuities allow a/uni00A0customer to select payout options designed to help meet the customer's need for income upon maturity, including lump sum payment or income for life or for a/uni00A0period of time. This benefit guarantees that a/uni00A0policyholder can withdraw a/uni00A0certain percentage of the account value, starting at a/uni00A0certain age or duration, for either a/uni00A0fixed period or during the life of the policyholder.\n\nIn the Netherlands, individual variable unit-linked products have a/uni00A0minimum benefit guarantee if premiums are invested in certain funds. The sum insured at maturity or upon the death of the beneficiary has a/uni00A0minimum guaranteed return (in the range of 3% to 4%) if the premium has been paid for a/uni00A0consecutive period of at least ten years and is invested in a/uni00A0mixed fund and/or fixed-income funds. No guarantees are given if the invested amount is in equity only.",

The increased account value in 2021 was mainly driven by foreign currency translation differences, partially offset by the impact from significantly reduced sales of guaranteed living benefits in the US after the first quarter.\n\nTransamerica mitigates the exposure from the elective guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider issued with a/uni00A0ceding company's variable annuity contracts. The rider is essentially a/uni00A0return of premium guarantee, which is payable over a/uni00A0period of at least 14/uni00A0years from the date that the policyholder elects to start withdrawals. At contract inception, the guaranteed remaining balance is equal to the premium payment. The periodic withdrawal is paid by the ceding company until the account value is insufficient to cover additional withdrawals. Once the account value is exhausted, Aegon pays the periodic withdrawals until the guaranteed remaining balance is exhausted. At December 31, 2021, the reinsured account value was EUR/uni00A01.8/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A01.7/uni00A0billion) and the guaranteed remaining balance was EUR/uni00A00.9/uni00A0billion (2020: EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion).\n\nThe GMWB rider Aegon assumed from the ceding company is accounted for as a/uni00A0derivative and is carried in Aegon's statement of financial position at fair value. At December 31, 2021, the contract had a/uni00A0value of EUR/uni00A039/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A046/uni00A0million). Aegon entered into a/uni00A0derivative program to mitigate the overall exposure to equity market and interest rate risks associated with the reinsurance contract. This program involves selling equity futures contracts and equity total return swap contracts (S&P 500, Midcap, Russell 2000, and the MCSI EAFE index in accordance with Aegon's exposure) to mitigate the effect of equity market movement on the reinsurance contracts and the purchase of interest rate swaps, treasury futures and treasury forwards to mitigate the effect of movements in interest rates on the reinsurance contracts.\n\nAegon the Netherlands provides guarantees to its customers on expiry date for certain insurance contracts. In order to mitigate the risks related to the guarantees Aegon the Netherlands has setup a/uni00A0hedging program. Aegon the Netherlands does not use reinsurance in order to mitigate risks related to insurance contracts with a/uni00A0guarantee component./uni00A0\n\n## b. Total return annuities\n\nTotal Return Annuity (TRA) is an annuity product in the United States which provides customers with a/uni00A0pass-through of the total return on an underlying portfolio of investment securities (typically a/uni00A0mix of corporate and convertible bonds) subject to a/uni00A0cumulative minimum guarantee. Both the assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, however, due to the minimum guarantee not all of the changes in the market value of the asset will be offset in the valuation of the liability. This product exists for the fixed annuity line of business and represents a/uni00A0closed block.\n\nThe fixed annuities product balance as of December 31, 2021, amounted to EUR/uni00A0179/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0186/uni00A0million).\n\n## c. Life contingent guarantees in the United States\n\nCertain variable insurance contracts in the United States also provide guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB). Under a/uni00A0GMDB, the beneficiaries receive the greater of the account balance or the guaranteed",

The net amount at risk for GMDB contracts is defined as the current GMDB in excess of the capital account balance at the reporting date.\n\nThe GMIB feature provides for minimum payments if the contract holder elects to convert to an immediate payout annuity. The guaranteed amount is calculated using the total deposits made by the contract holder, less any withdrawals and sometimes includes a/uni00A0roll-up or step-up feature that increases the value of the guarantee with interest or with increases in the account value.\n\nThe additional liability for guaranteed minimum benefits that are not bifurcated are determined each period by estimating the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The estimates are reviewed regularly and any resulting adjustment to the additional liability is recognized in the income statement. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a/uni00A0range of stochastic scenarios. Where applicable, the calculation of the liability incorporates a/uni00A0percentage of the potential annuitizations that may be elected by the contract holder.\n\nThe following table provides information on the liabilities for guarantees for minimum benefits that are included in the valuation of the host contracts:\n\n|                                          | 2021       | 2021       | 2021     | 2020       | 2020       | 2020     |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|------------|------------|----------|\n|                                          | GMDB 1)    | GMIB 2)    | Total 4) | GMDB 1)    | GMIB 2)    | Total 4) |\n| At January 1                             | 488        | 638        | 1,127    | 448        | 686        | 1,133    |\n| Incurred guarantee benefits 5)           | 27         | (127)      | (99)     | 144        | 44         | 189      |\n| Paid guarantee benefits                  | (49)       | (25)       | (75)     | (61)       | (34)       | (95)     |\n| Net exchange differences                 | 36         | 42         | 79       | (43)       | (57)       | (100)    |\n| At December 31                           | 502        | 529        | 1,031    | 488        | 638        | 1,127    |\n|                                          | GMDB 1),3) | GMIB 2),3) |          | GMDB 1),3) | GMIB 2),3) |          |\n| Account value 6)                         | 56,426     | 5,186      |          | 52,481     | 5,337      |          |\n| Net amount at risk 7)                    | 843        | 472        |          | 919        | 542        |          |\n| Average attained age of contract holders | 71         | 72         |          | 70         | 72         |          |\n\n- 1 Guaranteed minimum death benefit in the United States.\n- 2 Guaranteed minimum income benefit in the United States.\n\n- 4 Balances are included in the insurance liabilities on the face of the statement of financial position; refer to note 34 Insurance contracts.\n- 5 Incurred guarantee benefits mainly comprise the effect of guarantees from new contracts, releases related to expired out-of-the-money guarantees and value changes as a/uni00A0consequence of interest movements during the reporting year.\n- 6 Account value reflects the actual fund value for the policyholders.\n- 7 The net amount at risk is defined as the present value of the minimum guaranteed annuity payments available to the contract holder determined in accordance with the terms of the contract in excess of the current account balance.\n\n## d. Minimum investment return guarantees in the Netherlands\n\nThe traditional life and pension products offered by Aegon in the Netherlands include various products that accumulate a/uni00A0cash value. Premiums are paid by customers at inception or over the term of the contract. The accumulation products pay benefits on the policy maturity date, subject to survival of the insured. In addition, most policies also pay death benefits if the insured dies during the term of the contract. The death benefits may be stipulated in the policy or depend on the gross premiums paid to date. Premiums and amounts insured are established at inception of the contract. The amount insured can be increased as a/uni00A0result of profit sharing, if provided for under the terms and conditions of the product. Minimum interest guarantees exist for all generations of traditional accumulation products written. Older generations contain a/uni00A04% guarantee; in 1999 the guarantee decreased to 3% and in 2013 the guarantee decreased to 0%.\n\nThe traditional group pension contracts offered by Aegon in the Netherlands include large group insurance contracts that have an individually determined asset investment strategy underlying the pension contract. The guarantee given is that the profit sharing is the minimum of 0% and the realized return on an asset portfolio specified in the policy conditions, adjusted for technical interest rates ranging from 3% to 4%. If the adjusted return is negative, the 0% minimum is effective, but the loss in any given year is carried forward to be offset against any future surpluses within the contract period. In general, a/uni00A0guarantee is given for the life of the underlying employees so that their pension benefit is guaranteed. Large group contracts also share technical results (mortality risk and disability risk). The contract period is typically five years and the premiums are fixed over this period.\n\nThese guarantees are valued at fair value and are included as part of insurance liabilities with the underlying host insurance contracts in note 34 Insurance contracts.",

For further details refer to note 44 Fair value.\n\nFor equity volatility, Aegon uses a/uni00A0term structure assumption with market-based implied volatility inputs for the first five years and a/uni00A0long-term forward rate assumption of 25% thereafter. The volume of observable option trading from which volatilities are derived generally declines as the contracts' term increases, therefore, the volatility curve grades from implied volatilities for five years to the ultimate rate. The resulting volatility assumption in year 20 for the S&P 500 index (expressed as a/uni00A0spot rate) was 22.3% at December 31, 2021, and 22.6% at December 31, 2020. Correlations of market returns across underlying indices are based on historical market returns and their inter-relationships over a/uni00A0number of years preceding the valuation date. Assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, such as lapses, included in the models are derived in the same way as the assumptions used to measure insurance liabilities.\n\nThese assumptions are reviewed at each valuation date, and updated based on historical experience and observable market data, including market transactions such as acquisitions and reinsurance transactions. Disclosure on interest rate risk, including interest rate risk sensitivity is included in note 4 Financial risks.\n\nAegon utilizes different risk management strategies to mitigate the financial impact of the valuation of these guarantees on the results including asset and liability management and derivative hedging strategies to hedge certain aspects of the market risks embedded in these guarantees.\n\nGuarantees valued at fair value contributed a/uni00A0net gain before tax of EUR/uni00A063/uni00A0million (2020: gain of EUR/uni00A0539/uni00A0million) to earnings. The main drivers of this gain before tax are a/uni00A0gain of EUR/uni00A01,214/uni00A0million related to an increase in equity markets (2020: EUR/uni00A0380/uni00A0million gain),a gain of EUR/uni00A02,795/uni00A0million related increases in risk free rates (2020: EUR/uni00A03,775/uni00A0million loss) and a gain of EUR/uni00A016/uni00A0million related to increases in equity volatility (2020: EUR/uni00A0134/uni00A0million loss). These gains are partly offset by a/uni00A0fair value loss on hedges related to the guarantee reserves of EUR/uni00A03,855/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A03,199/uni00A0million gain), a/uni00A0loss of EUR/uni00A019/uni00A0million related to widening own credit spread (2020: EUR/uni00A0234/uni00A0million gain) and other and DPAC offset contributed a/uni00A0loss of EUR/uni00A065/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0305/uni00A0million gain).\n\nGuarantee reserves decreased by EUR/uni00A02,997/uni00A0million in 2021 (2020: increase of EUR/uni00A03,230/uni00A0million) to EUR/uni00A09,878/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A012,875/uni00A0million).",

This is offset by a decrease of other mortgage loan funding of EUR 0.5 billion.\n\nDuring 2020, operational funding decreased by EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion mainly due to the redemption of 'SAECURE 15' of EUR/uni00A00.9/uni00A0billion and the redemption of a/uni00A0covered bond for EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion. This is partly offset by an increase in other mortgage loan funding of EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion and the issuance of a/uni00A0covered bond in the Netherlands of EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion.",

The following sections contain a/uni00A0general description of the plans in each of these subsidiaries and a/uni00A0summary of the principal actuarial assumptions applied in determining the value of defined benefit plans.\n\n## Transamerica\n\nTransamerica/uni00A0has defined benefit plans covering substantially all its employees that are qualified under the Internal Revenue Service Code, including all requirements for minimum funding levels. The defined benefit plans are governed by the Board of Directors of Transamerica Corporation. The Board of Directors has the full power and discretion to administer the plan and to apply all of its provisions, including such responsibilities as, but not limited to, developing the investment policy and managing assets for the plan,",

The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's eligible annual compensation. The plans provide benefits based on a/uni00A0traditional final average formula or a/uni00A0cash balance formula (which defines the accrued benefit in terms of a/uni00A0stated account balance), depending on the age and service of the plan participant. The defined benefit plans have a/uni00A0deficit of EUR/uni00A07/uni00A0million at December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A0436/uni00A0million deficit)./uni00A0Transamerica amended some of their defined benefit pension plans in 2021. The amendments included an updated pay credit percentage and interest credit rates resulting in a/uni00A0decrease of the defined benefit obligation of EUR/uni00A088/uni00A0million.\n\nInvestment strategies are established based on asset and liability studies by actuaries which are updated as they consider appropriate. These studies, along with the investment policy, assist to develop the appropriate investment criteria for the plan, including asset allocation mix, return objectives, investment risk and time horizon, benchmarks and performance standards, and restrictions and prohibitions. The overall goal is to maximize total investment returns to provide sufficient funding for the present and anticipated future benefit obligations within the constraints of a/uni00A0prudent level of portfolio risk and diversification. Aegon believes that the asset allocation is an important factor in determining the long-term performance of the plan. The plan uses multiple asset classes as well as sub-classes to meet the asset allocation and other requirements of the investment policy, which minimizes investment risk. From time to time the actual asset allocation may deviate from the desired asset allocation ranges due to different market performance among the various asset categories. If it is determined that rebalancing is required, future additions and withdrawals will be used to bring the allocation to the desired level.\n\nTransamerica maintains minimum required funding levels as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. If contributions are required, the funding would be provided from the Company's general account assets. Pension plan contributions were not required for Transamerica in 2021 or 2020. However, with the Transamerica Management Board approval of a/uni00A0proposal from Transamerica Corporation, Transamerica Corporation made a/uni00A0pension plan contribution of EUR/uni00A091/uni00A0million in August 2021 that was over and above the minimum required funding levels as set forth by the Internal Revenue Code. In 2020, Transamerica Corporation did not make a/uni00A0voluntary pension plan contributions.\n\nTransamerica/uni00A0also sponsors supplemental retirement plans to provide senior management with benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits. The plans are unfunded and are not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. The supplemental retirement plans are governed by either Transamerica Corporation, or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Transamerica Corporation. Transamerica Corporation, or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has the full power and discretion to apply all of the plan's provisions, including such responsibilities as, but not limited to, interpret the plan provisions, to make factual determinations under the plan, to determine plan benefits, and to comply with any statutory reporting and disclosure requirements. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's eligible annual compensation. The plans provide benefits based on a/uni00A0traditional final average formula or a/uni00A0cash balance formula (which defines the accrued benefit in terms of a/uni00A0stated account balance), depending on the age and service of the plan participant. The company funds the benefit payments of the supplemental retirement plans from its general account assets. The unfunded amount related to these plans, for which a/uni00A0liability has been recorded, was EUR/uni00A0235/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0249/uni00A0million unfunded).\n\nTransamerica provides health care benefits to retired employees through continuation of coverage primarily in self funded plans, and partly in fully insured plans, which are classified as unfunded per IAS 19 financial guidance. The postretirement health care benefits under the Plans are administered by Transamerica Corporation, which has delegated the claims administration to third-party administrators. Transamerica/uni00A0maintains two plans which provide continuation of coverage for retiree medical benefits. For each plan, Transamerica has the fiduciary responsibility to administer the plan in accordance with its terms, and decides questions related to eligibility and determines plan provisions and benefit amounts.\n\nUnder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), Transamerica/uni00A0has the fiduciary responsibility to monitor the quality of services provided by the third-party claims administrator and to replace the third-party administrator if needed. In addition, Transamerica/uni00A0has the fiduciary obligation to interpret the provisions of the plans, and to comply with any statutory reporting and disclosure requirements. Finally, Transamerica/uni00A0reviews the terms of the plans and makes changes to the plans if and when appropriate. Transamerica/uni00A0funds the benefit payments or premium payments of the post-retirement health care plans from its general account assets. The post-retirement health benefit liability amounted to EUR/uni00A0220/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A0214/uni00A0million).\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 12.9 years (2020: 12.9 years).",

The defined benefit plans are subject to Dutch Pension regulations and governed by the Board of Directors of Aegon the Netherlands.

Aegon the Netherlands runs, in principle, full actuarial and investment risk regarding the defined benefit plans. This includes the risks of low interest rates, low returns and increased longevity. A part of this risk can be attributed to plan participants by lowering indexation or by increasing employee contributions.\n\nFurthermore, the specific statutory requirements governing the administration of group pension schemes have been laid down in the Pension Act (Pensioenwet / Pw).

For this plan, Aegon the Netherlands has the responsibility to administer the plan in accordance with its terms, and decides on questions related to eligibility and determines plan provisions and benefit amounts. In addition, Aegon the Netherlands has the obligation to interpret the provisions of the plans, and to comply with any statutory reporting and disclosure requirements. Finally, Aegon the Netherlands reviews the terms of the plans and makes changes to the plans if and when appropriate. The liabilities related to these other post-employment benefit plans are fully unfunded and amount to EUR/uni00A057/uni00A0million at December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A061/uni00A0million). The weighted average duration of the other post-employment benefit plans is 12.7 years (2020: 11.1 years).\n\nThe principal actuarial assumptions that apply for the year-ended December 31 are as follows:\n\n| Actuarial assumptions used to determine defined benefit obligations at year-end   | 2021                       | 2020                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Demographic actuarial assumptions                                                 |                            |                           |\n| Mortality                                                                         | NL mortality table 1)      | NL mortality table 1)     |\n| Financial actuarial assumptions                                                   |                            |                           |\n| Discount rate                                                                     | 1.01%                      | 0.51%                     |\n| Salary increase rate  2)                                                          | Curve 2021 53.05% of Curve | Curve 2020 55.6% of Curve |\n| Indexation  3)                                                                    | 2021                       | 2020                      |\n\nThe principal actuarial assumptions have an effect on the amounts reported for the defined benefit obligation.

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognized within the statement of financial position.\n\n## Aegon UK\n\nAegon UK operated a/uni00A0defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits for staff based on final pensionable salary and years of service. The scheme closed to new entrants a/uni00A0number of years ago and closed to future accrual on March 31, 2013. Aegon UK now offers a/uni00A0defined contribution pension scheme to all employees.\n\nThe pension scheme is administered separately from Aegon UK and is governed by Trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the pension scheme members.\n\nThe pension scheme Trustees are required to carry out triennial valuations on the scheme's funding position, with the latest valuation being as at March 31, 2019. As part of this triennial valuation process, a/uni00A0schedule of contributions is agreed between the Trustees and Aegon UK in accordance with UK pensions legislation and guidance issued by the Pensions Regulator in the UK. The schedule of contributions includes deficit reduction contributions to clear any scheme deficit. Under IAS 19, the defined benefit plan has a/uni00A0surplus of EUR/uni00A0119/uni00A0million at December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A043/uni00A0million surplus)./uni00A0During 2021, EUR/uni00A073/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A054/uni00A0million) of contributions were paid into the scheme.\n\nThe investment strategy for the scheme is determined by the trustees in consultation with Aegon UK. Currently 30% of assets are invested in growth assets (i.e. primarily equities) and 70% are income and liability driven investments where the investments are a/uni00A0portfolio of fixed interest and inflation-linked bonds and related derivatives, selected to broadly match the interest rate and inflation profile of liabilities.\n\nUnder the scheme rules, pensions in payment increase in line with the UK Retail Price Index, and deferred benefits increase in line with the UK Consumer Price Index. The pension scheme is therefore exposed to UK inflation changes as well as interest rate risks, investment returns and changes in the life expectancy of pensioners.\n\nThe scheme purchased a/uni00A0buy-in policy in the name of the Trustee to cover full scheme benefits for a/uni00A0group of pensioners in 2019. The liability (and matching asset) calculated on the year end assumptions has been included in the funded position as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 21.0 years (2020: 22.0 years).\n\nThe principal actuarial assumptions that apply for the year ended December 31 are as follows:\n\n| Actuarial assumptions used to determine defined benefit obligations at year-end   | 2021                   | 2020                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Demographic actuarial assumptions                                                 |                        |                        |\n| Mortality                                                                         | UK mortality table  1) | UK mortality table  2) |\n| Financial actuarial assumptions                                                   |                        |                        |\n| Discount rate                                                                     | 1.79%                  | 1.45%                  |\n| Price inflation                                                                   | 3.34%                  | 2.95%                  |",

The key capital management priority is to ensure adequate capitalization to cover Aegon's obligations towards its policyholders and debtholders while providing sustainable dividends to shareholders. This priority is accomplished by allocating capital to products that offer high growth and return prospects./uni00A0",

Aegon balances the funding of new business growth with the funding required to ensure that its obligations towards policyholders and debtholders are always adequately met, and providing for a/uni00A0sustainable dividend to shareholders.\n\nAegon's goal for both its operating units and for the Aegon group as a/uni00A0whole is to maintain a/uni00A0strong financial position and to be able to sustain losses from extreme business and market conditions.       Aegon's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework ensures that the Aegon Group and its operating companies are adequately capitalized and that obligations towards policyholders are always adequately met. Embedded in this larger framework is Aegon's capital management policy, which is based on adequate capitalization of the operating units, Cash Capital at Holding and leverage.\n\nAegon manages capital in the operating units to their respective operating levels, sufficient to absorb moderate shocks and pay sustainable remittances to the Group, and above their minimum dividend payment levels. Cash Capital at Holding is maintained within an operating range of EUR/uni00A00.5 - 1.5/uni00A0billion and covers holding expenses, near-term dividends, and contingencies, such as potential recapitalization of units. Furthermore, Aegon aims to reduce its gross financial leverage from the current level of EUR/uni00A05.9/uni00A0billion to the range of EUR/uni00A05.0 - 5.5/uni00A0billion by 2023. This reduction of leverage will strengthen the balance sheet, reduce Aegon's risk profile and therefore make Aegon more resilient.\n\nThe frequent monitoring of actual and forecasted capitalization levels of its underlying businesses is an important element in Aegon's capital framework in order to actively steer and manage towards maintaining adequate capitalization levels. Group operating capital generation contributed favorably and more than offset dividend payments.\n\n## Capital ratios of Aegon's main operating units\n\n|                                               | December 31, 2021  1)   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| US RBC ratio                                  | 426%                    | 432%                |\n| NL Life Solvency II ratio                     | 186%                    | 159%                |\n| Scottish Equitable Plc (UK) Solvency II ratio | 167%                    | 156%                |\n\nThe estimated RBC ratio/uni00A0in the United States decreased from 432% on December 31, 2020, to 426% on December 31, 2021, and remained above the operating level of 400%. The RBC ratio was positively impacted by higher equity markets and by private equity revaluations. One-time impacts were negative overall, driven by updates to regulatory factors that determine required capital, and in part by the impact of actions taken to reduce mortality risk. There was a partial offset from capital release from the lump-sum buy-out program for variable annuities. Operating capital generation contributed favorably, despite being impacted by adverse mortality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but was more than offset by dividend payments to the intermediate holding company.\n\nThe estimated Solvency II ratio of NL Life increased from 159% on December 31, 2020, to 186% on December 31, 2021, which is above the operating level of 150%. The increase includes benefits from management actions and model updates. The main management action was the longevity transaction as announced on December 15, 2021, which significantly reduced required capital. Market impacts had a/uni00A0slight negative impact, mainly due to higher interest rates. This is a/uni00A0reflection of the fact that Aegon hedges on an economic basis. Operating capital generation had a/uni00A0positive impact, which more than offset remittances to Group.\n\nThe estimated/uni00A0Solvency II ratio for Scottish Equitable Plc increased from 156% on December 31, 2020, to 167% on December 31, 2021, and remained above the operating level of 150%. The increase was primarily driven by management actions to reduce the equity risk in the own pension plan. Furthermore, a/uni00A0forthcoming change in the corporate income tax rate led to a/uni00A0reduction in required capital, contributing favorably. In addition, strong operating capital generation had a/uni00A0positive impact. These positive impacts more than offset the impact of dividend payments to the intermediate holding company.\n\nThe ability/uni00A0of Aegon's operating units, principally insurance companies, to pay remittances to the holding company is constrained by the requirement for these operating units to remain adequately capitalized to the levels set by local insurance regulations and governed by local insurance supervisory authorities. Based on the capitalization level of the operating units, local insurance supervisors are able to restrict and/or prohibit the transfer of remittances to the holding company. In addition, the ability of operating units to pay remittances to the holding company can be constrained by the requirement for these operating units to hold sufficient shareholders' equity as determined by law. The capitalization level and shareholders' equity of the operating units can be impacted by various",

To mitigate the impact of such factors on the ability of operating units to transfer funds, Aegon establishes an operating level of capital in each of the units, 150% SCR for Solvency II units and 400% RBC CAL in the US, which includes additional capital in excess of regulatory capital requirements. Aegon manages capital in the units to this operating level over-the-cycle.\n\n## Cash Capital at Holding\n\nCash Capital at Holding increased from EUR 1.1 billion on December 31, 2020 to EUR 1.3 billion on December 31, 2021, driven by free cash flows from the operating units. These free cash flows were used to reduce leverage and pay dividends to Aegon's shareholders and to support operating units through capital injections. Proceeds from divestments also contributed to Cash Capital at Holding, notably Transamerica's portfolio of fintech and insurtech companies and Stonebridge in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Aegon Group Solvency Ratio\n\nTo calculate its Group Solvency Ratio, Aegon applies a/uni00A0combination of the Group consolidation methods available under Solvency II: the Accounting Consolidation (AC) and Deduction & Aggregation (D&A) based methods. Solvency II capital requirements are mainly used for the European Economic Area (EEA)-based insurance and reinsurance entities, applying the AC method. Local requirements are used for insurance and reinsurance entities in (provisionally) equivalent third-country jurisdictions. Aegon's UK insurance subsidiaries have been included in the Group Solvency II calculation in accordance with Solvency II standards, including Aegon's approved Partial Internal Model./uni00A0For more details, reference is made to the section 'Regulation and Supervision'./uni00A0\n\nThe Group Solvency II ratio is calculated as the ratio between the Eligible Own Funds and the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). The Eligible Own Funds equal to the Available Own Funds after applying any Own Funds eligibility restrictions.\n\nThe Group SCR is calculated based on Solvency II Partial Internal Model (PIM), which includes the SCR of AC entities, the D&A entities and the Other Financial Sector entities (including Aegon Bank). The SCR amount (or 100% Solvency II ratio) reflects a/uni00A0level of Eligible Own Funds that enables insurance and reinsurance entities to absorb significant losses (1-in-200 year events) and gives reasonable assurance to policyholders and beneficiaries that payments will be made as they fall due. On December 31, 2021, Aegon's estimated capital position was:\n\n|                         | December 31, 2021  1)   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Group Own Funds         | 19,431                  | 18,582              |\n| Group SCR               | 9,226                   | 9,473               |\n| Group Solvency II ratio | 211%                    | 196%                |\n\nAegon Group Eligible Own Funds amounted to EUR/uni00A019,431/uni00A0million on December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A018,582/uni00A0million). The increase of EUR/uni00A0849/uni00A0million in Own Funds since December 31, 2020, was mostly driven by the positive impact from expected return on inforce business and market impacts. The positive impact was partly offset by claims experience in the Americas/uni00A0due to COVID-19,/uni00A0and the negative impact on Own Funds resulting from management actions.\n\nAegon's Group PIM SCR amounted to EUR/uni00A09,226/uni00A0million on December 31, 2021 (2020: EUR/uni00A09,473/uni00A0million). The SCR decreased by EUR/uni00A0247/uni00A0million since December 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly the result from the release of required capital of in force business, partially offset by the need to setup SCR for new business, the impact from management actions - notably the reinsurance of longevity risk announced in December 2021 for NL Life - and model and assumption changes including the increased L AC-DT factor for NL Life from 45% to 65%. There were partial offsets from market impacts and a/uni00A0lower benefit of group diversification. As a/uni00A0result of the above changes in Eligible Own Funds and PIM SCR, the Group Solvency II ratio increased by 15%-points to 211% in 2021.\n\n## Minimum regulatory requirements\n\nInsurance laws and regulations in local regulatory jurisdictions often contain minimum regulatory capital requirements. For insurance companies in the European Union, Solvency II formally defines a/uni00A0lower capital requirement, being the Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR). An irreparable breach of the MCR would lead to a/uni00A0withdrawal of the Company's insurance license. Similarly, for the US insurance entities the withdrawal of the insurance license is triggered by a/uni00A0breach of the 100% Authorized Control Level (ACL), which is set at 50% of the Company Action Level (CAL).",

Restricted Tier 1 capital consists of Aegon's junior perpetual capital securities (2021: EUR/uni00A01,391/uni00A0million, 2020: EUR/uni00A01,563/uni00A0million), perpetual cumulative subordinated bonds (2021: EUR/uni00A0459/uni00A0million; 2020: EUR/uni00A0475/uni00A0million), and perpetual contingent convertible security (2021: EUR/uni00A0515/uni00A0million;/uni00A02020: EUR/uni00A0532/uni00A0million). Both junior perpetual capital securities and perpetual cumulative subordinated bonds are grandfathered. The reduction in junior perpetual capital securities is driven by the redemption in September 2021 of USD 250/uni00A0million floating rate perpetual capital securities with a/uni00A0minimum coupon of 4% issued in 2005. Perpetual contingent convertible securities are Solvency II compliant liabilities which were issued in 2019./uni00A0Restricted Tier 1 capital is subject to eligibility restrictions to qualify as Eligible Own Funds.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, Tier 2 capital amounted to EUR/uni00A02,348/uni00A0million (2020: 2,340/uni00A0million). This consists of the subordinated notes issued by Aegon Funding Company LLC (AFC) in 2019 (2021: EUR/uni00A0832/uni00A0million; 2020: EUR/uni00A0818/uni00A0million), the Solvency II compliant subordinated liabilities that were issued during 2018 (2021: EUR/uni00A0767/uni00A0million;/uni00A02020: EUR/uni00A0754/uni00A0million), and grandfathered subordinated notes (2021: EUR/uni00A0750/uni00A0million;/uni00A02020: EUR/uni00A0768/uni00A0million). Tier 2 capital is subject to eligibility restrictions to qualify as Eligible Own Funds.\n\nThe grandfathered restricted Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments are grandfathered such that they are considered as capital under the Solvency II framework until December 31, 2025. For the terms and conditions of these grandfathered instruments refer to note 31 Other equity instruments and note 32 Subordinated borrowings.\n\nIt is to be noted that the difference between the amounts mentioned above for junior perpetual capital securities and perpetual cumulative subordinated bonds, and those in note 31 Other equity instruments and note 32 Subordinated borrowings, stem from valuation differences between Solvency II (market value) and EU-IFRS rules (refer to related accounting policies in note 2, paragraphs 2.17 and 2.18).\n\nTier 3 capital as of December 31, 2021 is comprised of deferred tax assets balances related to Solvency II entities.",

The Solvency II revaluations and reclassification can be grouped into four categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Items that are not recognized under Solvency II. The most relevant examples of this category for Aegon include Goodwill, deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC)/uni00A0and other intangible assets (EUR 2,263/uni00A0million negative, 2020: EUR 1,989/uni00A0million negative);\n- \u00b7 Items that have a/uni00A0different valuation treatment between EU-IFRS and Solvency II. Solvency II is a/uni00A0market consistent framework hence all assets and liabilities are to be presented at fair value while EU-IFRS also includes other valuation treatments in addition to fair value. The most relevant examples of this category for Aegon Group include loans and mortgages, reinsurance recoverables, and technical provisions. The revaluation difference stemming from this category amounted to EUR 3,197/uni00A0million positive (2020: EUR 2,878/uni00A0million positive) compared to the EU-IFRS Statement of Financial Position;\n- \u00b7 The Net Asset Value of subsidiaries that are included under the D&A method (on provisional equivalence or Standard Formula basis) in the Group Solvency II results. The revaluation difference stemming from this category amounted to EUR 7,331/uni00A0million negative (2020: EUR 6,942/uni00A0million negative) compared to the EU-IFRS Statement of Financial Position;\n- \u00b7 Reclassification of subordinated liabilities of EUR 3,168/uni00A0million negative (2020: EUR 3,366 negative).\n\nThe transferability restrictions reflect the restrictions on Tier 1 unrestricted Own Funds as a/uni00A0consequence of the RBC CAL conversion methodology as described above.\n\nThe availability adjustments are changes to the availability of Own Funds of Aegon Group in accordance with Solvency II requirements. Examples include the adjustments for subordinated liabilities, ring-fenced fund, treasury shares and foreseeable dividend.\n\nFinally, the fungibility restrictions limit the availability of Own Funds on Aegon Group level as prescribed by Supervisory Authorities. These limitations refer to charitable trusts in the Americas for which the local Supervisory Authority could limit the upstream of capital to the Group and therefore are excluded for Solvency II purposes.\n\n## Capital leverage\n\nAegon's total capitalization reflects the capital employed in the business units and consists of shareholders' capital and total gross financial leverage. Aegon assesses its gross financial leverage position based on various leverage metrics, including the gross financial leverage ratio, which is calculated by dividing total financial leverage by total capitalization. Aegon defines total financial leverage as debt or debt-like funding issued for general corporate purposes and for capitalizing Aegon's business units. Total financial leverage includes hybrid instruments, in addition to both subordinated and senior debt. Aegon's total capitalization comprises the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 Shareholders' equity excluding revaluation reserves/uni00A0based on IFRS as adopted by the EU;\n- \u00b7 Non-controlling interests and Long Term Incentive Plans not yet vested; and\n- \u00b7 Total financial leverage.",

Under Dutch law, the amount that is available to pay dividends consists of total shareholders' equity less the issued and outstanding capital and the reserves required by law. The legal reserves in respect of the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), group companies and the revaluation reserves, cannot be freely distributed. In case of negative balances for individual reserves legally to be retained, no distributions can be made out of retained earnings to the level of these negative amounts.

When available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of investments and derivatives. In the absence of an active market, the fair value of investments in financial assets is estimated by using other market observable data, such as corroborated external quotes and present value or other valuation techniques. An active market is one in which transactions are taking place regularly on an arm's length basis. Fair value is not determined based upon a/uni00A0forced liquidation or distressed sale.\n\nValuation techniques are used when Aegon determines the market is inactive or quoted market prices are not available for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, that is, to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a/uni00A0market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability). Therefore, unobservable inputs reflect Aegon's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). These inputs are developed based on the best information available.\n\nAegon employs an oversight structure over valuation of financial instruments that includes appropriate segregation of duties. Senior management, independent of the investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies. For fair values determined by reference to external quotation or evidenced pricing parameters, independent price determination or validation is utilized to corroborate those inputs. Further details of the validation processes are set out below.\n\nValuation of assets and liabilities is based on a/uni00A0pricing hierarchy, in order to maintain a/uni00A0controlled process that will systematically promote the use of prices from sources in which Aegon has the most confidence, where the least amount of manual intervention exists and to embed consistency in the selection of price sources. Depending on asset type the pricing hierarchy consists of a/uni00A0waterfall that starts with making use of market prices from indices and follows with making use of third-party pricing services or brokers.",

The reason for the change in level was that the market liquidity for these securities decreased, which led to a/uni00A0change in market observability of prices. Prior to transfer, the fair value for the Level II securities was determined using observable market transactions or corroborated broker quotes respectively for the same or similar instruments. Since the transfer, all such assets have been valued using valuation models incorporating significant non market-observable inputs or uncorroborated broker quotes.",

It is estimated that changing the other significant unobservable inputs to reflect reasonable possible alternatives in valuation would have no significant impact for the Group.\n\nAn increase in own credit spread results in lower valuation, while a/uni00A0decrease results in a/uni00A0higher valuation of the embedded derivatives.\n\nThe table below presents the impact on a/uni00A0fair value measurement of a/uni00A0change in the own credit spread by 5 basis points included in the discount rate.\n\n|                                             | December 31,  2021   | Effect of reasonably  possible alternative  assumptions (+/-)   | Effect of reasonably  possible alternative  assumptions (+/-)   | December 31,  2020   | Effect of reasonably  possible alternative  assumptions (+/-)   | Effect of reasonably  possible alternative  assumptions (+/-)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             |                      | Increase                                                        | Decrease                                                        |                      | Increase                                                        | Decrease                                                        |\n| Financial liabilities carried at fair value |                      |                                                                 |                                                                 |                      |                                                                 |                                                                 |\n| Embedded derivatives in insurance contracts | 3,437                | 39                                                              | (39)                                                            | 4,902                | 48                                                              | (48)                                                            |\n\n## Fair value information about assets and liabilities not measured at fair value\n\nThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of assets and liabilities, excluding assets and liabilities which are carried at fair value on a/uni00A0recurring basis.\n\n|                                                        |                                    | Estimated fair value hierarchy   | Estimated fair value hierarchy   | Estimated fair value hierarchy   | Total estimated                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 2021                                                   | Carrying amount  December 31, 2021 | Level I                          | Level II                         | Level III                        | fair value   December 31, 2021 |\n| Assets                                                 |                                    |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                |\n| Mortgage loans -

        "page_content": "## Fair value measurement\n\nThe description of Aegon's methods of determining fair value and the valuation techniques are described on the following pages.\n\n## Shares\n\nWhen available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its investments in shares. For Level III unquoted shares,/uni00A0the net asset value can be considered the best approximation to the fair value. Net asset value is the value of an entity's assets minus the value of its liabilities and may be the same as the book value or the equity value of the entity./uni00A0\n\nAlso for unquoted shares, the fair value may be estimated using other methods, such as observations of the price/earnings or price/ cash flow ratios of quoted companies considered comparable to the companies being valued. Valuations are adjusted to account for company-specific issues and the lack of liquidity inherent in an unquoted investment. Adjustments for lack of liquidity are generally based on available market evidence. In addition, a/uni00A0variety of other factors are reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, current operating performance, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment./uni00A0\n\nAvailable-for-sale shares include shares in a/uni00A0Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) for an amount of EUR/uni00A0112/uni00A0million (2020: EUR/uni00A093/uni00A0million), which are reported as part of the line-item Net asset value. A FHLB has implicit financial support from the United States government. The redemption value of the shares is fixed at par and they can only be redeemed by the FHLB.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThe fair values of debt securities are determined by management after taking into consideration several sources of data. When available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its debt securities. As stated previously, Aegon's valuation policy utilizes a/uni00A0pricing hierarchy which dictates that publicly available prices are initially sought from indices and third-party pricing services. In the event that pricing is not available from these sources, those securities are submitted to brokers to obtain quotes, the majority of which are non-binding. As part of the pricing process, Aegon assesses the appropriateness of each quote (i.e. as to whether the quote is based on observable market transactions or not) to determine the most appropriate estimate of fair value.\n\nWhen broker quotes are not available, securities are priced using internal cash flow modeling techniques. These valuation methodologies commonly use the following inputs: reported trades, bids, offers, issuer spreads, benchmark yields, estimated prepayment speeds, issue specific credit adjustments, indicative quotes from market makers and/or estimated cash flows.\n\nTo understand the valuation methodologies used by third-party pricing services Aegon reviews and monitors the applicable methodology documents of the third-party pricing services. Any changes to their methodologies are noted and reviewed for reasonableness. In addition, Aegon performs in-depth reviews of prices received from third-party pricing services on a/uni00A0sample basis. The objective for such reviews is to demonstrate that Aegon can corroborate detailed information such as assumptions, inputs and methodologies used in pricing individual securities against documented pricing methodologies. Only third-party pricing services and brokers with a/uni00A0substantial presence in the market and with appropriate experience and expertise are used.\n\nThird-party pricing services will often determine prices using recently reported trades for identical or similar securities. The third-party pricing service makes adjustments for the elapsed time from the trade date to the reporting date to take into account available market information. Lacking recently reported trades, third-party pricing services and brokers will use modeling techniques to determine a/uni00A0security price where expected future cash flows are developed based on the performance of the underlying collateral and discounted using an estimated market rate.\n\nPeriodically, Aegon performs an analysis of the inputs obtained from third-party pricing services and brokers to ensure that the inputs are reasonable and produce a/uni00A0reasonable estimate of fair value. Aegon's asset specialists and investment valuation specialists consider both qualitative and quantitative factors as part of this analysis. Several examples of analytical procedures performed include, but are not limited to, recent transactional activity for similar debt securities, review of pricing statistics and trends and consideration of recent relevant market events. Other controls and procedures over pricing received from indices, third-party pricing services, or brokers include validation checks such as exception reports which highlight significant price changes, stale prices or unpriced securities. Additionally, Aegon performs back testing on a/uni00A0sample basis. Back testing involves selecting a/uni00A0sample of securities trades and comparing the prices in those transactions to prices used for financial reporting. Significant variances between the price used for financial reporting and the transaction price are investigated to explain the cause of the difference.",

However, Aegon does not rely solely on external credit ratings and there is an internal process, based on market observable inputs, for determining Aegon's view of the risks associated with each security.\n\nAegon's portfolio of private placement securities (held at fair value under the classification of available-for-sale or fair value through profit or loss) is valued using a/uni00A0matrix pricing methodology. The pricing matrix is obtained from a/uni00A0third-party service provider and indicates current spreads for securities based on weighted average life, credit rating, and industry sector. Each month, Aegon's asset specialists review the matrix to ensure the spreads are reasonable by comparing them to observed spreads for similar bonds traded in the market. Other inputs to the valuation include coupon rate, the current interest rate curve used for discounting and a/uni00A0liquidity premium to account for the illiquid nature of these securities. The liquidity premiums are determined based upon the pricing of recent transactions in the private placements market; comparing the value of the privately offered security to a/uni00A0similar public security. The impact of the liquidity premium for private placement securities to the overall valuation is insignificant.\n\nAegon's portfolio of debt securities can be subdivided into Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), Commercial mortgagebacked securities (CMBS), Asset-backed securities (ABS), Corporate bonds and Government debt. Below relevant details of the valuation methodologies for these specific types of debt securities are described.\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities\n\nValuations of RMBS, CMBS and ABS are monitored and reviewed on a/uni00A0monthly basis. Valuations per asset type are based on a/uni00A0pricing hierarchy which uses a/uni00A0waterfall approach that starts with market prices from indices and follows with third-party pricing services or brokers. The pricing hierarchy is dependent on the possibilities of corroboration of the market prices. If no market prices are available, Aegon uses internal models to determine fair value. Significant inputs included in the internal models are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Market standard models may be used to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each transaction. The most significant unobservable input is the liquidity premium which is embedded in the discount rate.\n\nAegon the Netherlands has mandated Aegon Asset Management to invest in RMBS transactions. Aegon Asset Management uses its own proprietary cash flow tools to analyze and stress test RMBS transactions. The key input parameters are default rates and loss given default assumptions, which are established based on historical pool characteristics and current loan level data.\n\n## Corporate bonds\n\nValuations of corporate bonds are monitored and reviewed on a/uni00A0monthly basis. The pricing hierarchy is dependent on the possibility of corroboration of market prices when available. If no market prices are available, valuations are determined by a/uni00A0discounted cash flow methodology using an internally calculated yield. The yield is comprised of a/uni00A0credit spread over a/uni00A0given benchmark. In all cases the benchmark is an observable input. The credit spread contains both observable and unobservable inputs. Aegon starts by taking an observable credit spread from a/uni00A0similar bond of the given issuer, and then adjust this spread based on unobservable inputs. These unobservable inputs may include subordination, liquidity and maturity differences. During 2021, there were no corporate bonds that met the policy threshold to be internally modeled.\n\n## Government debt\n\nWhen available, Aegon uses quoted market prices in active markets to determine the fair value of its government debt investments. When Aegon cannot make use of quoted market prices, market prices from indices or quotes from third-party pricing services or brokers are used.\n\n## Money market and other short-term investments and deposits with financial institutions\n\nThe fair value of assets maturing within a/uni00A0year is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amount adjusted for credit risk where appropriate. Credit risk adjustments are based on market observable credit spreads if available, or management's estimate if not market observable.\n\n## Tax credit investments\n\nThe Level III fair value of tax credit investments is determined by using a/uni00A0discounted cash flow valuation technique. This valuation technique takes into consideration projections of future capital contributions and distributions, as well as future tax credits and the tax benefits of future operating losses. The present value of these cash flows is calculated by applying a/uni00A0discount rate. In general, the discount rate is determined based on the cash outflows for the investments and the cash inflows from the tax credits and/or tax benefits (and the timing of these cash flows). These inputs are unobservable in the market place. The discount rate used in valuation of tax credit investments has increased to 7.1% (December 31, 2020: 6.6%).",

Aegon reviews the valuations each month and performs analytical procedures and trending analyses to ensure the fair values are appropriate. The net asset value is considered the best valuation method that approximates the fair value of the funds.\n\n## Mortgage loans, policy loans and private loans (held at amortized cost)\n\nFor private loans, fixed interest mortgage loans and other loans originated by the Group, the fair value used for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a/uni00A0current market rate applicable to financial instruments with similar yield and maturity characteristics. For fixed interest mortgage loans, the market rate is adjusted for expenses, prepayment rates, lapse assumptions (unobservable inputs), liquidity and credit risk (market observable inputs). An increase in expense spread, prepayment rates and/or prepayment assumptions, would decrease the fair value of the mortgage loan portfolio.\n\nThe fair value of floating interest rate mortgage loans, policy loans and private placements used for disclosure purposes is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amount, adjusted for changes in credit risk. Credit risk adjustments are based on market observable credit spreads if available, or management's estimate if not market observable.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWhere quoted market prices are not available, other valuation techniques, such as option pricing or stochastic modeling, are applied. The valuation techniques incorporate all factors that a/uni00A0typical market participant would consider and are based on observable market data when available. Models are validated before they are used and calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual experience and comparable market prices.\n\nFair values for exchange-traded derivatives, principally futures and certain options, are based on quoted market prices in active markets. Fair values for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments represent amounts estimated to be received from or paid to a/uni00A0third party in settlement of these instruments. These derivatives are valued using pricing models based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows, directly observed prices from exchange-traded derivatives, other OTC trades, or external pricing services. Most valuations are derived from swap and volatility matrices, which are constructed for applicable indices and currencies using current market data from many industry standard sources. Option pricing is based on industry standard valuation models and current market levels, where applicable. The pricing of complex or illiquid instruments is based on internal models or an independent third party. For long-dated illiquid contracts, extrapolation methods are applied to observed market data in order to estimate inputs and assumptions that are not directly observable. To value OTC derivatives, management uses observed market information, other trades in the market and dealer prices.\n\nSome OTC derivatives are so-called longevity derivatives. The payout of longevity derivatives is linked to publicly available mortality tables. The derivatives are measured using the present value of the best estimate of expected payouts of the derivative plus a/uni00A0risk margin. The best estimate of expected payouts is determined using best estimate of mortality developments. Aegon determined the risk margin by stressing the best estimate mortality developments to quantify the risk and applying a/uni00A0cost-of-capital methodology. Depending on the duration of the longevity swaps either the projected mortality development or discount rate are the most significant unobservable inputs.\n\nAegon normally mitigates counterparty credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements where practical and in ISDA master netting agreements for each of the Group's legal entities to facilitate Aegon's right to offset credit risk exposure. Changes in the fair value of derivatives attributable to changes in counterparty credit risk were not significant.\n\n## Embedded derivatives in insurance contracts including guarantees\n\nBifurcated guarantees for minimum benefits in insurance and investment contracts are carried at fair value. These guarantees include Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (GMWB) in the United States and United Kingdom which are offered on some variable annuity products and are also assumed from a/uni00A0ceding company; minimum investment return guarantees on insurance products offered in the Netherlands, including group pension and traditional products; variable annuities sold in Europe.\n\nSince the price of these guarantees is not quoted in any market, the fair values of these guarantees are based on discounted cash flows calculated as the present value of future expected payments to policyholders less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the guarantees. Given the complexity and long-term nature of these guarantees which are unlike instruments available in financial markets, their fair values are determined by using stochastic models under a/uni00A0variety of market return scenarios. A variety of factors are considered, including own credit spread, expected market rates of return, equity and interest rate volatility, correlations of market",

        "page_content": "returns, discount rates and actuarial assumptions. The most significant unobservable factor is own credit spread. The weighted average own credit spread used in the valuations of embedded derivatives in insurance contracts decreased to 0.23% (2020: 0.25%).\n\nThe expected returns are based on risk-free rates. Aegon added a/uni00A0premium to reflect the credit spread as required. The credit spread is set by using the Credit default swap (CDS) spreads of a/uni00A0reference portfolio of life insurance companies (including Aegon), adjusted to reflect the subordination of senior debt holders at the holding company level to the position of policyholders at the operating company level (who have priority in payments over other creditors). Aegon's assumptions are set by region to reflect differences in the valuation of the guarantee embedded in the insurance contracts.\n\nAegon extrapolates yield curves beyond market observable maturities. The discount rates converge linearly in 10 years to an Ultimate Forward Rate. In the Netherlands, the ultimate forward rate is 3.65% from the last liquid point. The US ultimate forward rate extrapolates linearly beyond 30 years using an average of forward interest rates implied by the market between 20 years and 30 years. In the US, the ultimate forward rate is 3.55% from the last liquid point. The uniform last liquid point for all Aegon's major currencies (EUR, USD and GBP) is set at 30 years.\n\nSince many of the assumptions are unobservable and are considered to be significant inputs to the liability valuation, the liability included in future policy benefits has been reflected within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to note 36 Guarantees in insurance contracts for more details about Aegon's guarantees.\n\n## Real estate\n\nValuations of Level III investments in real estate and real estate held for own use are conducted in full by independent external appraisers at least every three to five years and reviewed at least once a/uni00A0year by qualified internal appraisers to ensure the value correctly reflects the fair value at the reporting date. Appraisals are different for each specific local market, but are based on market guidelines such as International Valuation Standards, Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice or guidelines issued by the Investment Property Databank. Valuations are mostly based on active market prices, adjusted for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific property. If such information is not available, other valuation methods are applied, considering the value that the property's net earning power will support, the value indicated by recent sales of comparable properties and the current cost of reproducing or replacing the property. Discount rates used in the valuation of real estate reflect the risk embedded in the projected cash flows for the asset being valued. Capitalization rates represent the income rate for a/uni00A0real estate property that reflects the relationship between a/uni00A0single year's net operating income expectancy and the total property price or value. For property held for own use, appraisers consider the present value of the future rental income cash flows that could be achieved had the real estate been rented to a/uni00A0third party.\n\n## Trust pass-through securities and subordinated borrowings\n\nTrust pass-through securities and subordinated borrowings are either carried at fair value (if they are designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) or amortized cost (with fair value being disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). For the determination of the fair value of these instruments, the level hierarchy as described by EU-IFRS is used. The preferred method of obtaining the fair value of the fair value option bonds is the quoted price (Level I). In case markets are less liquid or the quoted prices are not available, Aegon's valuation policy utilizes a/uni00A0pricing hierarchy which dictates that publicly available prices are initially sought from indices and third-party pricing services. During 2021, the US method of obtaining fair value for trust pass-through securities and subordinated borrowings changed from using internal models to obtaining independent third-party vendor prices. The updated approach reflects consistency in pricing source for the investment grade corporate debt interests and moves the pricing from an internally generated approach to one or more independent third parties. The US trust pass-through securities and subordinated borrowings are classified as Level II of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Investment contracts\n\nInvestment contracts issued by Aegon are either carried at fair value (if they are designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) or amortized cost (with fair value being disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements). These contracts are not quoted in active markets and their fair values are determined by using valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow methods and stochastic modeling or in relation to the unit price of the underlying assets. All models are validated and calibrated. A variety of factors are considered, including time value, volatility, policyholder behavior, servicing costs and fair values of similar instruments.\n\nSimilar to embedded derivatives in insurance contracts, certain investment products are not quoted in active markets and their fair values are determined by using valuation techniques. Because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows, stochastic or similar techniques under a/uni00A0variety of market return scenarios are often used. A variety of factors are considered, including expected market rates of return, market volatility, correlations of market returns, discount rates and actuarial assumptions.",

Market volatility assumptions for each underlying index are based on observed market implied volatility data and/or observed market performance. Correlations of market returns for various underlying indices are based on observed market returns and their inter-relationships over a/uni00A0number of years preceding the valuation date.

In addition, some investments for general account that include an embedded derivative that would otherwise have required bifurcation, such as convertible instruments, preferred shares and credit linked notes, have been designated at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAegon has certain insurance and investment liabilities that are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in the income statement. The Group has elected to designate the investments backing those liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, as a/uni00A0classification of available-for-sale would result in accumulation of unrealized gains and losses in a/uni00A0revaluation reserve within equity whilst changes to the liability would be reflected in net result (accounting mismatch).\n\n## Investments for account of policyholders\n\nInvestments held for account of policyholders comprise assets that are linked to various insurance and investment contracts for which the financial risks are borne by the customer. Under the Group's accounting policies these insurance and investment liabilities are measured at the fair value of the linked assets with changes in the fair value recognized in the income statement. To avoid an accounting mismatch the linked assets have been designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn addition, the investment for account of policyholders include with profit assets, where Aegon manages these assets together with related liabilities on a/uni00A0fair value basis in accordance with a/uni00A0documented policy of asset and liability management. In accordance with the Group's accounting policies, these assets have been designated as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Investment contracts for account of policyholders\n\nWith the exception of the financial liabilities with discretionary participating features that are not subject to the classification and measurement requirements for financial instruments, all investment contracts for account of policyholders that are carried at fair value or at the fair value of the linked assets are included in the table above.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nWith the exception of derivatives designated as a/uni00A0hedging instrument, all derivatives held for general account and held for account of policyholders are included in the table above.",

Over the course of the multi-year contract, Transamerica will pay approximately USD 390/uni00A0million to LTCG. These fees represent compensation for administering Transamerica's long term care product line including policyholder service, claims processing and care management. The agreement also contains a/uni00A0termination clause in which Transamerica - subject to certain limitations - agrees to compensate LTCG, on a/uni00A0specified schedule, for early termination.\n\nIn April 2018, affiliates of Transamerica Corporation entered into a/uni00A0series of agreements with affiliates of Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS) to administer the Company's US life insurance, voluntary benefits, and annuity business lines. The collaboration enables Transamerica to accelerate the enhancement of its digital capabilities and the modernization of its platforms to service its customers in all lines of business. Over the course of the multi-year contract, Transamerica could pay more than USD 2/uni00A0billion to TCS. These fees represent compensation for administering Transamerica's over 10/uni00A0million policies and are driven by both new business and policies already in force. In addition, this commitment includes remaining transition and conversion charges of approximately USD 9/uni00A0million in 2022 as well as administrative, IT and finance service fees which are contingent on TCS meeting specified milestones in the underlying agreement with Transamerica. The agreement also contains termination clauses which in certain conditions and subject to certain limitations, could require Transamerica to compensate TCS, on a/uni00A0specified schedule, for early termination.\n\nIn November 2018, Aegon UK announced an extended partnership with Atos BPS Ltd (Atos) to service and administer its Traditional Products Business (non-Platform customers). The agreement is a/uni00A015-year contract under which Aegon UK pays Atos to administer around 1.4/uni00A0million customers, which took effect on June 1, 2019 as planned. At year-end 2021, outstanding transition and conversion charges are estimated to amount to approximately GBP 8/uni00A0million, which are expected to be recorded over the next year, with fixed payments to Atos defined in the agreement and subject to completion of milestones which have been agreed with Aegon UK.",

Aegon Derivatives N.V. enters into derivative transactions with counterparties with which ISDA master netting agreements, including collateral support annex agreements, have been agreed. Net (credit) exposure on derivative transactions with these counterparties was therefore limited as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Legal and arbitration proceedings, regulatory investigations and actions\n\nAegon faces significant risks of litigation as well as regulatory exams and investigations and actions relating to its and its subsidiaries' businesses. Aegon is also subject to compliance with regulations applicable to it as a/uni00A0corporate entity.\n\nDue to the geographic spread of its business, Aegon Group may be subject to tax audits or litigation in various jurisdictions. Although uncertainties are provided for adequately in the tax position, the ultimate outcome of tax audits or litigation may result in an outcome that differs from the amounts provided for.\n\nInsurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities are routinely subject to litigation, investigation and regulatory activity by various governmental and enforcement authorities, individual claimants and policyholder advocate groups in the jurisdictions in which Aegon does business, including the United States, the Netherlands, Poland and the United Kingdom. These actions may involve issues including, but not limited to, employment or distribution relationships; operational and internal controls and processes; investment returns; sales practices; transparency and adequacy of product disclosures including regarding initial costs, ongoing costs, and costs due on policy surrender as well as changes to costs over time; environmental and climate change related matters; competition and antitrust matters; data privacy; information security; intellectual property; and anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and economic sanctions compliance.\n\nGovernment and regulatory investigations may result in the institution of administrative, injunctive or other proceedings and/ or the imposition of monetary fines, penalties and/or disgorgement as well as other remedies, sanctions, damages and restitutionary amounts. Regulators may also seek changes to the way Aegon operates. In some cases, Aegon subsidiaries have modified business practices in response to inquiries.\n\nCustomers of certain Aegon products bear significant investment risks with respect to those products, which are affected by fluctuations in equity markets as well as interest rate movements. When investment returns disappoint, are volatile or change due to changes in the market or other relevant conditions, customers may threaten or bring litigation against Aegon. Disputes and investigations initiated by governmental entities and private parties may lead to orders or settlements including payments or changes to business practices even if Aegon believes the underlying claims are without merit./uni00A0\n\nThe existence of potential claims may remain unknown for long periods of time after the events giving rise to such claims. Determining the likelihood of exposure to Aegon and the extent of any such exposure may not be possible for long periods of time after Aegon becomes aware of such potential claims. Litigation exposure may develop over long periods of time; once litigation is initiated, it may be protracted and subject to multiple levels of appeal, which can lead to significant costs of defense, adverse publicity and other constraints.",

        "page_content": "In some jurisdictions, plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts under claims of bad faith, which can result in tort, punitive and/or statutory damages. Damages alleged may not be quantifiable or supportable, or may have no relationship to economic losses or final awards. As a/uni00A0result, Aegon cannot predict the effect of litigation, investigations or other actions on its business./uni00A0\n\nSeparate from financial loss, litigation, regulatory action, legislative changes or changes in public opinion may require Aegon to change its business practices, which could have a/uni00A0material adverse impact on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\n## Proceedings in which Aegon is involved\n\nSeveral US insurers, including Aegon subsidiaries, have been named in class actions as well as individual litigation relating to increases in monthly deduction rates (MDR) on universal life products. Plaintiffs generally allege that the increases were made to recoup past losses rather than to cover the future costs of providing insurance coverage. Aegon's subsidiary in the US has settled two such class actions that had been venued in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The settlement in the first of these cases, approved in January 2019, arose from increases implemented in 2015-2016. Over 99% of affected policyholders participated in that settlement. While less than 1% of policyholders opted out of the settlement, they represented approximately 43% of the value of the settlement fund. In a/uni00A0second case, Aegon's subsidiary agreed to settle a/uni00A0class action lawsuit arising out of MDR increases in 2017 and 2018. The court approved that settlement in September 2020. Opt-outs in this case represented less than 7% of the value of the settlement fund. The settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs. In 2021, settlements were reached with some of the opt-out parties from both settled class actions. The remaining opt-out cases and disputes are ongoing, and Aegon continues to hold a/uni00A0provision for the remaining opt-outs from the settlements that were approved by the court in 2019 and 2020. If this provision for these cases proves to be insufficient, then these matters could have an adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations, and financial position.\n\nTransamerica subsidiaries may face employment-related lawsuits from time to time. For example, several Transamerica subsidiaries are defendants in a/uni00A0class action alleging that the business model at issue improperly characterizes distributors as independent contractors instead of employees. Depending on the outcome, these lawsuits, along with similar claims against Transamerica subsidiaries and other companies and regulatory action could result in significant settlements or judgments, and could necessitate a/uni00A0change in the distribution model, which would be costly and could have a/uni00A0material impact on the financial results for that part of the Transamerica business.\n\nA former subsidiary of Transamerica Corporation was involved in a/uni00A0contractual dispute with a/uni00A0Nigerian travel broker that arose in 1976. That dispute was resolved in Delaware court for USD 235 thousand plus interest in 2010. The plaintiff took the Delaware judgment relating to the 1976 dispute to a/uni00A0Nigerian court and alleged that it was entitled to approximately the same damages for 1977 through 1984 despite the absence of any contract relating to those years. The Nigerian trial court issued a/uni00A0judgment in favor of the plaintiff of the alleged actual damages as well as pre-judgment interest of approximately USD 120/uni00A0million. On appeal this decision was reversed on procedural grounds and remanded back to the trial court which ruled to dismiss the case; however, the Plaintiff appealed the trial court's ruling. The appeal is still pending. Aegon has no material assets located in Nigeria.\n\nIn Poland, owners of unit-linked policies continue to file claims in civil court against Aegon over fees payable upon purchase or surrender of the product. Plaintiffs claim that these fees are not contractually supported. Aegon faces a/uni00A0significant number of these cases. For reasons of commercial necessity as well as at the instigation of the regulatory authorities, Aegon decided to modify the fee structure. As of 2021, a/uni00A0provision of EUR/uni00A08/uni00A0million remains, which represents management's best estimate of the exposure. The final amount may vary based on regulatory developments and the outcome of litigation.\n\nIn the Netherlands, unit linked products (beleggingsverzekeringen) have been controversial and the target of litigation since at least 2005. Allegations include excessive cost, unfair terms, inadequate disclosure, and failure to perform as illustrated. Consumer groups have formed to address these issues and initiate mass claims against insurers. Regulators as well as the Dutch Parliament have been involved ever since, with the principal goal of achieving an equitable resolution. Aegon has made improvements across its product lines, including after settlements reached in 2009 with Stichting Woekerpolis and Stichting Verliespolis. Aegon also decided to reduce future policy costs for the large majority of its unit-linked portfolio. Some of the unit linked products are still involved in ongoing litigation. In September 2014, consumer interest group Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl filed a/uni00A0claim against Aegon in court. The claim related to a/uni00A0range of unit linked products that Aegon sold in the past, including Aegon products involved in the earlier litigation. The claim challenges a/uni00A0variety of elements of these products, on multiple legal grounds, including allegations made previously. In June 2017 (and revised in December 2017), the court issued a/uni00A0verdict which upheld the principle that disclosures must be evaluated according to the standards at the time when the relevant products were placed in-force. Most of the claims of Vereniging Woekerpolis. nl were dismissed under this standard, although the court found that Aegon did not adequately disclose certain charges on a/uni00A0limited",

The district court did not decide on the reasonableness of the cost levels and whether the previous compensation arrangements provide sufficient compensation. This court decision has been appealed by both parties. The Court of Appeal has stayed the proceedings during the preliminary proceedings at the Supreme Court in another class action of Vereniging Woekerpolis. nl against another insurance company. On February 11, 2022 the Supreme Court ruled in these preliminary proceedings. The answers to the preliminary questions of the court regarding transparency and consent about costs and cost levels are a/uni00A0(re)confirmation of the EU Court ruling in a/uni00A0previous case against another insurance company. The legal debate will now continue at the level of the Court of Appeal. Aegon expects the uncertainty about the possible impact to continue for the foreseeable future. Developments in similar cases against other Dutch insurers currently before regulators and courts may also affect Aegon. At this time, Aegon is unable to estimate the range or potential maximum liability. There can be no assurances that these matters, in the aggregate, will not ultimately result in a/uni00A0material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.\n\nSecurities leasing products (aandelenlease producten) have also been the subject of litigation in the Netherlands. Although sales of securities leasing products ended more than a/uni00A0decade ago, litigation relating to these products has resurfaced. In December 2020 Aegon Bank N.V. reached an agreement in principle on a/uni00A0settlement with Leaseproces B.V. for claims regarding Vliegwiel and Sprintplan customers represented by Leaseproces. On June 4, 2021 Aegon and Leaseproces B.V. announced it had finalized its agreement to settle these claims. In September 2021, the parties announced that more than 90% of customers had agreed to the settlement, by which the last remaining threshold was met. Subsequently, most claims have been paid during the fourth quarter 2021, with a/uni00A0small amount remaining at year-end. Full performance of the agreement is expected in the first half of 2022. There are still some individual claims pending. There can be no assurances that Aegon is able to resolve these cases in the way it expects and that this matter will not ultimately result in a/uni00A0material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial position.\n\n## 46 Transfers of financial assets\n\nTransfers of financial assets occur when Aegon transfers contractual rights to receive cash flows of financial assets or when Aegon retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the transferred financial asset, but assumes a/uni00A0contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in that arrangement.\n\nIn the normal course of business Aegon is involved in the following transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 Transferred financial assets that are not derecognized in their entirety:\n- \u25a0 Securities lending; whereby Aegon legally (but not economically) transfers assets and receives cash and non-cash collateral. The/uni00A0transferred assets are not derecognized. The obligation to repay the cash collateral is recognized as a/uni00A0liability. The non-cash collateral is not recognized in the statement of financial position; and\n- \u25a0 Repurchase activities; whereby Aegon receives cash for the transferred assets. The financial assets are legally (but not economically) transferred, but are not derecognized. The obligation to repay the cash received is recognized as a/uni00A0liability.\n- \u00b7 Transferred financial assets that are derecognized in their entirety and Aegon does not have a/uni00A0continuing involvement (normal sale);\n- \u00b7 Transferred financial assets that are derecognized in their entirety, but where Aegon has a/uni00A0continuing involvement;\n- \u00b7 Collateral accepted in the case of securities lending, reverse repurchase agreement and derivative transactions; and\n- \u00b7 Collateral pledged in the case of (contingent) liabilities, repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions.\n\nThe following disclosures provide details for transferred financial assets that are not derecognized in their entirety, transferred financial asset that are derecognized in their entirety, but where Aegon has a/uni00A0continuing involvement and assets accepted and pledged as collateral.\n\n## 46.1 Transferred financial assets that have not been derecognized in their entirety\n\nThe following table reflects the carrying amount of financial assets that have been transferred to another party in such a/uni00A0way that part or all of the transferred financial assets do not qualify for derecognition.

Cash collateral is recorded on the statement of financial position as an asset and an offsetting liability is established for the same amount as Aegon is obligated to return this amount upon termination of the lending arrangement. Cash collateral is usually invested in pre-designated high quality investments. The sum of cash and non-cash collateral is typically greater than the market value of the related securities loaned.

As shown in the second column there are no financial assets and liabilities offset in 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe line Derivatives includes derivatives for general account and for account of policyholder.\n\nAegon mitigates credit risk in derivative contracts by entering into collateral agreements, where practical, and in ISDA master netting agreements for each of the Aegon's legal entities to facilitate Aegon's right to offset credit risk exposure. The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aegon or its counterparty. Transactions requiring Aegon or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of over-the-counter derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and credit swaps. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard long-term borrowing, derivative, securities lending and securities borrowing activities, as well as requirements determined by exchanges where the bank acts as intermediary.\n\n## 48 Companies and businesses acquired and divested Companies and businesses acquired\n\n## 2021\n\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2021.\n\n## 2020\n\nOn July 30, 2020, Aegon announced the completion of the expansion of its partnership with Santander in Spain. This follows the agreement signed on July 3, 2018 between Aegon and Banco Santander to expand their life and non-life insurance partnership, following Banco Santander's acquisition of Banco Popular./uni00A0Aegon's insurance joint ventures with Banco Santander in Spain completed the acquisition of the in force term life policies previously sold through Banco Popular branches as well as the right to write new term life and selected lines of non-life policies through the former Banco Popular branches now owned by Banco Santander./uni00A0The transaction was closed following satisfaction of all closing conditions, including the termination of existing alliances of Banco Popular. For its 51% stake in the expansion of the joint venture with Banco Santander, Aegon paid an upfront amount of EUR/uni00A0187/uni00A0million - lower than the EUR/uni00A0215/uni00A0million communicated in July 2018 mainly due to the results of the in-force portfolio which accrued to Santander till closing. Furthermore, the previously agreed contingent payment of up to EUR/uni00A075/uni00A0million is due in 2024, subject to the performance of the partnership.\n\n## 2019\n\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2019.\n\n## Companies and businesses divested\n\n## 2021\n\nOn November 29, 2020, Aegon agreed to sell its insurance, pension, and asset management businesses in Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Turkey to Vienna Insurance Group AG Wiener Versicherung Gruppe (VIG) for EUR 830 million, of which EUR 35 million was received by Aegon in the form of net remittances in 2021./uni00A0As a result of the transaction, the Group Solvency II ratio is estimated to improve by approximately 8 percentage points. Based on the balance sheet position at December 31, 2021, a book gain amounting to EUR 266 million is expected, which includes a loss of EUR 204 million related to the foreign currency translation reserve, which will be reclassified from Other Comprehensive Income into the income statement. As a result of this transaction, IFRS equity is expected to increase by EUR 470 million./uni00A0The closing of the transaction is subject to local regulatory and competition approvals customary for transactions of this nature. Aegon will continue to work with VIG to close this transaction.",

This excludes a contingent consideration of up to GBP 10 million. The transaction had no material impact on Aegon's capital position and results.\n\n## 2020\n\nOn January 29, 2020, Aegon completed the sale of its 50% stake in the variable annuity joint ventures in Japan. The sale was announced on May 17, 2019. The total cash proceeds are EUR 153 million (JPY 18.75 billion). The divestment had no material impact on Aegon's capital position and led to an IFRS gain of EUR 53 million. This divestment had no material impact on operating result before tax going forward.\n\n## 2019\n\nOn January 8, 2019, Aegon completed the sale of its businesses in Czech Republic and Slovakia. The businesses consisted mainly of unit linked life insurance coverage, term life products and pension reserves. The proceeds of the sale amount to EUR 155 million and the book gain amounts to approximately EUR 70 million, which were reflected in other income. As a consequence of the transaction, annual result before tax and operating result before tax decreased.

The revaluation linked to cash flow hedging hedging is identified on individual cash flow hedge positions.\n\nThe legal reserves in respect of the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), group companies and the revaluation reserves, cannot be freely distributed. In case of negative balances for individual reserves legally to be retained, no distributions can be made out of retained earnings to the level of these negative amounts.\n\nCertain of Aegon's subsidiaries, principally insurance companies, are subject to restrictions on the amounts of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise to their parent companies. There can be no assurance that these restrictions will not limit or restrict Aegon in its ability to pay dividends in the future.\n\nFor more details on distributable reserves, refer to note 43 Capital management and solvency of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOn the reporting date, Aegon/uni00A0N.V. and its subsidiaries held 71,780,196 /uni00A0(2020: 53,747,701) of its own common shares and/uni00A030,588,800 (2020: 12,884,400)/uni00A0own common shares B         with a/uni00A0par value of EUR/uni00A00.12 each./uni00A0",

At the date of this report the depth and length of this invasion is unknown, and the situation is changing rapidly from day to day.\n\nAegon is closely monitoring the financial markets and economic turbulence that has arisen as a consequence of the situation and the related international sanctions, and its impact on Aegon. The most significant risks Aegon faces are related to financial markets, particularly from volatility in credit, equity and interest rates. The notes to Aegon's financial statements include elaborate descriptions and related financial market sensitivities. Aegon is actively managing its risks and capital position to maintain a robust balance sheet, as the Company navigates through the uncertainty created by the current geopolitical situation.

        "page_content": "## Our audit approach\n\nWe designed our audit procedures with respect to the key audit matters, fraud and going concern, and the matters resulting from that, in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a/uni00A0whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The information in support of our opinion, like our findings and observations related to individual key audit matters, the audit approach on fraud risk and the audit approach on going concern was addressed in this context, and we do not provide a/uni00A0separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n## Overview and context\n\nAegon/uni00A0N.V. is a/uni00A0provider of mainly life insurance, pension and asset management services. The Group consists of several components. Aegon/uni00A0N.V.'s main operating units are separate legal entities and operate under the laws of their respective countries. Aegon has the following reportable segments: Americas (which covers the business unit in United States), the Netherlands, United Kingdom, International (which covers business units in Southern and Eastern Europe as well as Asia), Asset Management, and Holding and other activities. Aegon has significant operations in the Americas, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. To be able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence over the consolidated financial statements, we considered our group audit scope and approach as set out in the section 'The scope of our group audit'. We paid specific attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the Group, as set out below.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We determined our group materiality based on Adjusted Shareholders' Equity since we believe that this metric is the most relevant and suitable benchmark to determine our overall materiality, as we have set out in the section 'Materiality'. In particular, we considered where management made important judgments, for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.\n\nIn Note 3, 'Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies', to the consolidated financial statements, the Group describes the areas of judgment in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty and the related higher inherent risks of material misstatement in the valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts and the valuation of certain Level 3 investments, we considered these matters as key audit matters as set out in the section 'Key audit matters' of this report. Furthermore, we identified uncertainties in policyholder claims and litigation as a/uni00A0key audit matter.\n\nWe discussed with management their assessment on how the risk of climate change impacts the strategy, operations, and financial position of the Group. The Group committed to a/uni00A0net zero impact objective in respect to its general account investment portfolio and an operational greenhouse gas emission reduction. We discussed with management the planned actions which in their view should lead to realization of the commitments. The impact on the 2021 financial statements resulting from the risk of climate change on the insurance activities is considered limited, due to among others, the size and nature of the property and casualty portfolio of the group. As the investment portfolio is largely valued at market value, based on market observable inputs, the risk of climate change on this portfolio does also not lead to a/uni00A0material risk from a/uni00A02021 financial statements perspective. Hence, the risk of climate change on the Group does not warrant a/uni00A0key audit matter.\n\nBased on our risk assessment, including cyber security risks and given the importance of information technology (IT) for the Group and hence for our audit of the financial statements, we have, to the extent relevant to our audit, paid specific attention to the IT dependencies and IT general controls, which comprise the policies and procedures to ensure reliable automated processing of information used for financial reporting purposes, and relevant application controls.\n\nWe ensured that the group audit team and the component audit teams included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a/uni00A0complex financial conglomerate, such as Aegon. This includes industry expertise in life and non-life insurance, banking, and asset management. We included experts and specialists in the areas of risk assurance (IT), tax services, actuarial services, global human resource services, valuation services for certain types of assets (e.g., complex financial instruments and real estate) and forensics in our team. For the assessment of the other information included in the annual report in respect of the required EU Taxonomy disclosures we added ESG specialists to our team.",

Adjusted Shareholders' Equity is defined as EU-IFRS Shareholders'  Equity minus revaluation reserves (i.e., the volatile effect of unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale  investments) plus non-controlling interests and long-term incentive plan not yet vested (which are immaterial  to the calculation). We believe that Adjusted Shareholders' Equity is the most relevant and suitable benchmark  to determine our overall materiality due to the focus of stakeholders (e.g., regulators, rating agencies and  shareholders) on capital generation in combination with the nature of the Group's business and the volatility of  earnings. Adjusted Shareholders' Equity is a key metric to evaluate Aegon's equity position, which is important  for the dividend paying potential of Aegon and gives a relevant indication of the ability of the Group to cover  its/uni00A0liabilities. |\n|                                    | We applied professional judgment to determine the percentage to be applied to this metric. In this respect we  considered the activities of the Group, the balance sheet total, revenue, the underlying result, and the result  before tax. Based on this assessment, during our planning procedures we considered a percentage of 0.75%  adequate considering the anticipated level of Adjusted Shareholders' equity. We have set our final materiality  based on the Adjusted Shareholders' Equity position at year end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Component materiality              | To each component in our audit scope, we, based on our judgment, allocate materiality that is less than our  overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between EUR 15 million and  EUR 100 million.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |",

The Group is structured predominantly along geographical lines as described in Note 5, 'Segment information', to the consolidated financial statements. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Aegon/uni00A0N.V.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a/uni00A0whole, taking into account the management structure of the Group, the nature of operations of its components, the accounting processes and controls, and the markets in which the components of the Group operate. In establishing the overall group audit strategy and plan, we determined the type of work required to be performed at the component level by the Group engagement team and by each component auditor.\n\nThe group audit primarily focused on the significant components: Americas, the Netherlands and United Kingdom.\n\nWe subjected these components to audits of their complete financial information, as these components are individually financially significant to the Group. Additionally, we selected Spain, two operating entities in Asia, and Holdings and other activities for audit of specified balances to achieve appropriate coverage on financial line items in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn total, in performing these procedures and excluding our consolidated analytical procedures, we achieved the following coverage on the financial line items:\n\n| Revenue           | 96%   |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Total assets      | 99%   |\n| Result before tax | 97%   |\n\nNone of the remaining components represented more than 2% of total consolidated revenue or total consolidated assets. For those remaining components we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those components.\n\nWhere component auditors performed the work, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their audit work to be able to conclude whether we had obtained sufficient and appropriate audit evidence as a/uni00A0basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a/uni00A0whole.\n\nWe issued instructions to the component audit teams in our audit scope. These instructions included amongst others our risk analysis, materiality and scope of the work. We explained to the component audit teams the structure of the Group, the main developments that are relevant for the component auditors, the risks identified (including the risk of fraud), the materiality levels to be applied and our global audit approach. We discussed the risk assessment and audit approach with each of the component teams. This particularly concerned the risk of fraud, revenue recognition, significant estimates and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the risk assessment, for instance the risk of working in a/uni00A0remote and/or hybrid environment. We developed an oversight strategy for each component based on its significance and/or risk characteristics to the Group./uni00A0This strategy included procedures such as regular virtual meetings and discussions with component auditors to challenge and review significant audit matters and judgments including the review of selected working papers via remote access to our component teams' audit files which is fully supported by the use of the global PwC electronic audit file program.\n\nFurthermore, we had individual calls with each of the in-scope component audit teams during the year and upon conclusion of their work. During these calls, we discussed the significant accounting and audit issues identified by the component auditors and the audit procedures in this respect, their reports, the findings of their procedures, updates on risk assessments and other matters, which could be of relevance for the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Furthermore, we analyzed the reports received from the component auditors and attended the virtual closing meetings.",

During these meetings, we discussed the business development, strategy, financial performance of the local businesses, and fraud and climate related risks. We also discussed the impact of change on the organization and people from transformation programs (e.g., performance improvement initiatives), the IFRS 17 implementation, and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on controls and the control environment. The impact of change also affects considerations of controls in respect of outsourcing.\n\nThe group engagement team performed the audit work on the group consolidation and financial statement disclosures.\n\nBy performing the procedures above at the component level, combined with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence on the Group's financial information, as a/uni00A0whole, to provide a/uni00A0basis for our opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Audit approach on fraud risks\n\nWe identified and assessed the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the Group and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors, including internal audit, risk management, legal, compliance, human resources, local management, and the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption. Together with our forensic specialists, we evaluated these fraud risk factors to consider whether those factors indicated a/uni00A0risk of material misstatement due to fraud. In all our audits, we pay attention to the risk of management override of controls, as this risk is always considered to present a/uni00A0significant risk of fraud.\n\nWe evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment and management, as well as among others, the code of conduct, whistle blower procedures and incident registration and follow-up. Where considered appropriate, we tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks. We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance. If so, we reevaluated our assessment of fraud risk and its resulting impact on our audit procedures. Further, we performed an assessment of matters reported on the (Group's) whistleblowing and complaints procedures and results of management's investigation of such matters.\n\nBased on our considerations of various factors, such as the high volume of individually small transactions, and our assessment of the inherent risk at the assertion level, the engagement team concluded that the risk of fraud in revenue recognition does not rise to the level of a significant risk for any of the revenue streams for the Aegon N.V. consolidated audit.\n\nTaking into account all factors, we identified 'management override of controls', including the risk of management bias when setting assumptions, as a/uni00A0fraud risk and performed the following specific procedures:",

We also paid specific attention to the restricted access in IT systems and the possibility that segregation of duties is not enforced.\n\nWe identified significant assumptions and tested these against the Group's and market experience information. For details we refer to the key audit matters in respect of Valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts and Valuation of certain level 3 investments.\n\nWe tested the appropriateness of journal entries recorded in the general ledger and other adjustments made in the preparation of the financial statements. We selected journal entries based on risk criteria and performed specific audit procedures on these. We identified no significant transactions outside normal business operations.\n\nOur work did not lead to specific indications of fraud or suspicions of fraud with regard to the override of internal control by management.\n\n## Audit approach on going concern\n\nAs disclosed in Note 3, 'Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies', to the consolidated financial statements management performed their assessment of the entity's ability to continue as a/uni00A0going concern for the foreseeable future and has not identified events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a/uni00A0going concern (hereafter: going concern risks). Our procedures to evaluate management's going concern assessment include, amongst others:\n\n- \u00b7 Considering whether management's going concern assessment includes all relevant information of which we are aware as a/uni00A0result of our audit, inquire with management regarding management's most important assumptions underlying their going concern assessment;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating management's assessment of the adequacy of the solvency positions, and the sufficiency of free cash flows to cover the projected dividends and other cash outflows;\n- \u00b7 Understanding and evaluating the Group's stress testing of liquidity and regulatory capital requirements, including severity of the stress scenarios that were applied;\n- \u00b7 Performing inquiries of management as to their knowledge of going concern risks beyond the period of management's assessment.\n\nOur procedures did not result in outcomes contrary to management's assumptions and judgments used in the application of the going concern assumption.\n\n## Our focus on the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe obtained a/uni00A0general understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and how the Group is complying with that framework. There is an industry risk that emerging compliance or litigation areas have not been identified and/or addressed by management for financial statement purposes. This includes the consideration whether there is a/uni00A0need for the recognition of a/uni00A0provision or a/uni00A0contingent liability disclosure on the future outcome of legal or regulatory processes.\n\nIn our audit, a/uni00A0distinction is made between those laws and regulations which have a/uni00A0direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those that do not have a/uni00A0direct effect but where compliance may be fundamental to the operating aspect of the business, to the Group's ability to continue its business or to avoid material penalties.\n\nWe identified that the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations mainly relates to the laws and regulations which have an indirect impact on the financial statements, such as anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regulations, regulations linked to the operating licenses for the Group's activities (insurance, asset management, banking) including Solvency II in Europe and Risk-Based Capital (RBC) in the US. For this category, we performed specific procedures to identify non-compliance with those laws and regulations that may have a/uni00A0material effect on the financial statements. These procedures comprise inquiring of management, evaluating compliance reporting and inspecting correspondence with relevant authorities.",

We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a/uni00A0comprehensive reflection of all matters identified by our audit and that we discussed. In this section, we described the key audit matters and included a/uni00A0summary of the audit procedures we performed on those matters.\n\nThe key audit matters described below are mostly related to the nature of the Group and are therefore expected to occur year over year. In prior year, given the economic impacts resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but also the new strategy presented by the Group in December 2020, we gave significant additional attention to the risk of impairment of assets. Compared to last year, we do not consider the risk of impairment of assets as a/uni00A0key audit matter anymore. Based on our assessment, the economic impact of the pandemic and the impact of the late 2020 announced new strategy on the future earnings capacity do not to lead to such an increased risk for impairment of assets at the 2021 year-end that it warrants a/uni00A0key audit matter.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## Our audit work and observations\n\n## Valuation of certain assets and liabilities arising from insurance contracts.\n\nNote 3 'Critical accounting estimates and judgment in applying accounting policies', Note 27 'Deferred expenses', Note 29 'Intangible assets', Note 34 'Insurance contracts' and Note 44 'Fair/uni00A0value'.\n\nThe Group has the following assets and liabilities as at December/uni00A031, 2021 arising from insurance contracts:\n\n- \u00b7 Deferred policy acquisition costs (DPAC) of EUR 9.3/uni00A0billion included in the deferred expenses line item;\n- \u00b7 Value of business acquired (VOBA) of EUR 0.8/uni00A0billion included in the intangible assets line item;\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts of EUR 124.4/uni00A0billion; and\n- \u00b7 Embedded derivatives in insurance contracts of EUR 3.4/uni00A0billion included in the derivatives liability line item.\n\nThese areas involve the use of valuation models that use significant inputs that are not market observable and significant judgment over uncertain future outcomes, including the timing and ultimate full settlement of long-term policyholder liabilities and as a/uni00A0result, are more likely to be subject to a/uni00A0material misstatement either due to error or fraud. Therefore, we considered these areas a/uni00A0key matter for our audit.\n\nTo assess the recoverability of DPAC and VOBA and the adequacy of the liabilities for insurance contracts, at each reporting date, Aegon performs liability adequacy testing. This testing is done to verify that the valuation of these assets and liabilities are adequate as compared to the expected future contractual cash flows.\n\nThe main assumptions used in measuring the DPAC and VOBA and the liabilities for insurance contracts relate to mortality, morbidity, future expenses, surrender, lapse, utilization rates and, for embedded derivatives, own credit spread. In addition, Aegon the Netherlands adjusts the outcome of the liability adequacy test for the difference between the fair value and the book value of mortgage loans and private loans. The fair value of mortgage loans and private loans is determined using significant assumptions that require judgment, including prepayment rate and lapse assumptions. Given the magnitude of the insurance contract liabilities and the sensitivities as explained in Note 34, 'Insurance contracts', a change in non-market observable inputs (especially mortality and morbidity) could have a significant effect on net income and shareholders' equity.\n\nDuring 2021, Aegon continued a multi-year review of its actuarial models with focus on those considered medium and high risk. Model updates in combination with the Group's actuarial and economic assumptions update resulted in a EUR 298 million pre-tax charge for the year as explained in Note/uni00A05, 'Segment information'.\n\nWe performed audit procedures over the valuation and liability adequacy testing models and the model updates to determine the appropriateness of those and assessed the compliance with the applicable accounting standards. We tested the impact of model updates against supporting evidence. For the models used, we tested the completeness and accuracy of key data underlying the development of the significant assumptions, as well as judgments applied, which may vary depending on the product and/or the specifications of the product. We evaluated the reasonableness of management's significant assumptions, taking also into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on mortality and morbidity, assumed future expenses, surrender and utilization rates and investment return. In our assessment, we considered the risk of management bias in setting these significant assumptions. Based on our procedures, we found these assumptions to be reasonable and appropriate.\n\nThe quality of previous years' assumptions is assessed by the analyses of the actual versus expected developments. We also evaluated the different market return scenarios that management used for measurement purposes by performing audit procedures on historical experience. Where expert judgment was used, we challenged management on the judgment applied and the use of alternative scenarios. Based on our procedures performed, we found that the assumptions set by management and the different scenarios used were supported by available audit evidence and are within a/uni00A0range we consider acceptable based on the Group's and industry experience.\n\nIn respect of mortgage loans and private loans of Aegon in the Netherlands, we evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of the fair value of the portfolio that is included in the liability adequacy test by independently developing a/uni00A0range of acceptable outcomes and comparing management's estimate to the independently developed ranges.\n\nWe also evaluated whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and in accordance with EU-IFRS. We found the disclosures to be appropriate in this context.",

These estimations involve significant judgment by management and have a higher potential risk to be affected by error or management bias. Therefore, these areas are considered a key audit matter. Our focus considered both the positions that are presented at fair value on the balance sheet and those positions carried at amortized cost on the balance sheet but for which fair value is required to be disclosed.\n\nThe models that are utilized in the assessment of impairments on structured securities are dependent on assumptions such as prepayments, severities, and Constant Default Rate vectors. The significant inputs used in valuing real estate are monthly rent rolls, capital expenditure budgets provided by the asset manager, and discount rates and capitalization rates obtained from outside parties. In addition, real estate properties are valued using industry standard models and sales comparison based on the type of property.\n\nGiven the nature of certain inputs/rates utilized and valuation methodology employed, the valuation of real estate has a high estimation uncertainty and a change in assumptions could have a/uni00A0significant effect on net income and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Uncertainties in policyholder claims and litigation.\n\nNote 38 'Provisions', Note 45 'Commitments and contingencies'.\n\nThe insurance industry continues to face consumer activism and regulatory scrutiny over product design and selling practices. The/uni00A0Group has encountered claims and litigations in this respect. Depending on the actual legal position and expectations from management, claims, including litigation related, are either provided for as a liability or reflected as contingent liabilities in the notes to the financial statements based on the criteria as outlined in EU-IFRS. The Group uses internal and external legal experts where applicable to evaluate its legal positions.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and judgment in this area in terms of valuation and presentation and disclosure, this area is subject to the risk of understatement of recorded liabilities and incomplete disclosure of contingent liabilities. Therefore, we determined this as a/uni00A0key audit matter.\n\nWe performed substantive audit procedures to supplement procedures over our testing of internal controls in respect of assumption setting and data and those assessing service organization reports. These substantive procedures included, among others, developing an independent estimate of the value for a/uni00A0sample of investments by obtaining independent pricing from third-party vendors, if available. We performed retrospective testing, where possible, to assess the quality of previous estimates and assumptions. Also, on a/uni00A0sample basis for certain Level 3 investments, we evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate by developing an independent range of prices utilizing a/uni00A0range of prices and comparing management's estimate to the independently developed ranges. Developing the independent estimate involved utilizing a/uni00A0range of available market inputs and assumptions and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management. We assessed pricing models and the underlying methodologies against industry practice and valuation guidelines. We used real estate valuation experts to assess on a/uni00A0sample basis the fair value of properties as determined by management and as reported by outsourcing parties based on available market information. Based on our procedures, we considered that the valuation of these investments was within the bandwidth that we consider acceptable.\n\nWe also evaluated whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and in accordance with EU-IFRS. We found the disclosures to be appropriate in this context.\n\nWe gained an understanding of the policyholders' claims and litigations through discussions with management including the general legal counsel.\n\nOur procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating lawyers' letters to the extent considered necessary for our audit. For all (potential) material claims, we tested the underlying facts and circumstances considered and assessed the best estimate of outflows as determined by the Group.\n\nWe evaluated that the Group has properly reflected the claims and litigations in either the provisions or the contingent liabilities by assessing these against the criteria in IAS 37. In this respect, we assessed whether the Group has a/uni00A0present obligation (legal or constructive) as a/uni00A0result of a/uni00A0past event, if it is probable (i.e., more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a/uni00A0reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Based on our procedures performed, we noted no exceptions.\n\nWe also evaluated whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are adequate and in accordance with EU-IFRS. We found the disclosures to be appropriate in this context.",

Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a/uni00A0basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a/uni00A0material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Executive Board.\n- \u00b7 Concluding on the appropriateness of the Executive Board's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a/uni00A0material uncertainty exists related to events and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a/uni00A0going concern. If we conclude that a/uni00A0material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a/uni00A0whole. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a/uni00A0going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a/uni00A0manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nConsidering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the consolidated financial statements, we are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the Group to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a/uni00A0whole. Determining factors are the geographic structure of the Group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.\n\nWe communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect, we also issue an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the Supervisory Board with a/uni00A0statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.",

At the same date, there were 2,106,313,195/uni00A0common shares and 568,839,440/uni00A0common shares B issued. Of the issued common shares, 301,774,161/uni00A0common shares and 538,250,640/uni00A0common shares B were held by Vereniging Aegon and 821,758 common shares were held by Aegon's subsidiaries.\n\nAll of Aegon's common shares and common shares B are fully paid and not subject to calls for additional payments of any kind. All of Aegon's common shares are registered shares./uni00A0New York Registry Shares ('NYRS') are common shares and are traded at the New York Stock Exchange. Holders of NYRS hold their shares in the registered form issued by Aegon's New York transfer agent on Aegon's behalf. NYRS and shares of listed at Euronext are exchangeable on a one-to-one basis and are entitled to the same rights, except that cash dividends are paid in US dollars on NYRS.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, 254/uni00A0million common shares were held in the form of NYRS. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 13,232 record holders of Aegon's NYRS resident in the United States.\n\n## Vereniging Aegon\n\nVereniging Aegon is the continuation of the former mutual insurer AGO. In 1978, AGO demutualized and Vereniging AGO became the only shareholder of AGO Holding N.V., which was the holding company for its insurance operations. In 1983, AGO Holding N.V. and Ennia N.V. merged into Aegon/uni00A0N.V.. Vereniging AGO initially received approximately 49% of the common shares and all of the preferred shares in Aegon, giving it voting majority in Aegon. At that time, Vereniging AGO changed its name to Vereniging Aegon.\n\nThe purpose of the Association is a/uni00A0balanced representation of the direct and indirect interests of Aegon and of companies with which Aegon forms a/uni00A0group, of insured parties, employees, shareholders and other related parties of these companies./uni00A0Influences that threaten the continuity, independence or identity of Aegon, in conflict with the aforementioned interests will be resisted as much as possible.\n\nIn accordance with the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement, Vereniging Aegon had certain option rights on preferred shares to prevent dilution of voting power as a/uni00A0result of share issuances by Aegon. This enabled Vereniging Aegon to maintain voting control at the General Meeting of Shareholders of Aegon. In September 2002, Aegon effected a/uni00A0capital restructuring whereby Vereniging Aegon's ownership interest in Aegon's common shares decreased from approximately 37% to approximately 12% and its aggregate ownership interest in Aegon's voting shares decreased from approximately 52% to approximately 33%.\n\nIn May 2003, Aegon's shareholders approved certain changes to Aegon's corporate governance structure, introducing a/uni00A0second class of preferred shares. Both classes of preferred shares had a/uni00A0nominal value of EUR/uni00A00.25 each. The voting rights pertaining to the preferred shares were adjusted accordingly to 25/12 vote per preferred share. However, in May 2003, Aegon and Vereniging Aegon also entered into a/uni00A0Preferred Shares Voting Agreement, pursuant to which Vereniging Aegon agreed to exercise one vote only per preferred share, except in the event of a/uni00A0'Special Cause', as defined below. At that time Aegon and Vereniging Aegon amended the option arrangements under the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement so that, in the event of an issuance of shares by Aegon, Vereniging Aegon could purchase as many class B preferred shares as would enable Vereniging Aegon to prevent or correct dilution to below its actual percentage of voting shares, to a/uni00A0maximum of 33%.\n\nOn February 15, 2013, Aegon and Vereniging Aegon entered into an agreement to simplify the capital structure of Aegon and to cancel all of Aegon's preferred shares, of which Vereniging Aegon was the sole owner. The execution of this agreement was approved by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2013.\n\nThe simplified capital structure entailed, but was not limited, to the conversion of all outstanding preferred shares A and B, with a/uni00A0nominal value of EUR/uni00A00.25 each, into a/uni00A0mix of common shares and common shares B, with a/uni00A0nominal value of EUR/uni00A00.12 each. The financial rights attached to a/uni00A0common share B were determined at 1/40 th of the financial rights attached to a/uni00A0common share.\n\nThe simplified capital structure also entailed the amendment of the Voting Rights Agreement between Aegon and Vereniging Aegon, known as the Preferred Shares Voting Agreement before May 2013. As a/uni00A0matter of Dutch corporate law, the shares of both classes offer equal full voting rights, as they have equal nominal values (EUR/uni00A00.12). The amended Voting Rights Agreement ensures that under normal circumstances, i.e. except in the event of a/uni00A0Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon will no longer exercise more votes than",

The repurchase of common shares B was executed to align the aggregate holding of voting shares by Vereniging Aegon in Aegon with its special cause voting rights of 32.6% following the completion of the Share Buy Back Programs, initiated by Aegon in July and October 2021 to neutralize the dilutive effect of the distribution of the final dividend 2020 and the interim dividend 2021 in stock.\n\n## Development of shareholding in Aegon\n\nAccordingly, at December 31, 2021, the voting power of Vereniging Aegon under normal circumstances amounted to approximately 15.39%, based on the number of outstanding and voting shares (excluding issued common shares held in treasury by Aegon). In the event of a/uni00A0Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon's voting rights will increase, currently to 32.6%, for up to six months.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the General Meeting of Members of Vereniging Aegon consisted of nineteen members.

In Workplace Solutions, Transamerica is focused on small to mid-sized retirement plan administration, employee benefits, stable value solutions and the Transamerica Advice Center. It also continues to operate in the retirement plan administration market for large employers. In addition, Workplace Solutions provides value-added services, such as Managed Advice \u00ae and its proprietary investment solutions. In Individual Solutions, Transamerica focuses on select life insurance and investment products, including term life insurance, final expense whole life insurance, and indexed universal life insurance, as well as mutual funds and individual retirement products, like accumulation variable annuities (VA) with limited interest rate sensitivity.\n\nSeveral Transamerica product lines are considered Financial Assets, which/uni00A0are capital intensive with relatively low returns on capital employed. These are traditional VAs with interest rate sensitive guaranteed living benefits and death benefits; stand-alone individual long-term care (LTC) insurance; and fixed annuities. Transamerica ceased new sales of these products in the first half of 2021 and any future new sales for Financial Assets are limited, if any, and focused on products with higher returns and a/uni00A0moderate risk profile.\n\n## Overview of sales and distribution channels\n\nTransamerica offers its products and services through affiliated and non-affiliated distributors to meet customer needs and provide guidance to its customers. Workplace Solutions supports individuals primarily through their employers as customers, whereas Individual Solutions supports individual customers.\n\n## Workplace Solutions\n\nTransamerica distributes its Workplace Solutions products and services to employers and employees through independent financial advisors, benefits consultants, and insurance agents as well as through an affiliated team of experienced registered representatives, investment advisor representatives, and licensed insurance agents.\n\n## Individual Solutions\n\n## Wholesale distribution\n\nThe Individual Solutions business line of Transamerica offers annuities, investments such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs), and life insurance through agreements with independent broker-dealers, banks, wirehouses, independent financial planners, and independent insurance producers. Annuity and investment products are also offered through institutions including large broker-dealer research and advisory platforms, and registered investment advisors.\n\nAdditionally, Transamerica offers protection products through direct marketers, independent marketing organizations, and distribution outlets known as brokerage general agents. These products are predominantly non-registered life insurance products (term life, indexed universal life, and whole life insurance) sold through approximately 51,000 independent brokerage distributors and financial institutions.\n\n## Retail distribution\n\nTransamerica's retail affiliated distribution group, Transamerica Financial Network (TFN), offers products, guidance and advice to individuals to meet their protection and investment needs. TFN consists of World Financial Group Insurance Agency (WFGIA), Transamerica Agency Network (TAN), and Transamerica Financial Advisors, Inc. (TFA). TFN, through licensed agents and registered representatives/investment advisor representatives, offers insurance, annuities, mutual funds, retirement plans and advisory account solutions.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Universal life insurance\n\nUL insurance is flexible permanent life insurance that offers death benefit protection together with the potential for cash value accumulation. After the first few years, there is usually no set premium. The policyholder can adjust the frequency and amount of premium payments, as long as sufficient premiums are accumulated in the policy's account value to cover charges in the month that follows, which are called 'monthly deductions'. Some versions of this product have 'secondary guarantees.' These maintain life insurance coverage when the cash value is insufficient, as long as the customer pays a/uni00A0specified minimum premium.\n\n## Variable universal life insurance\n\nVUL insurance is permanent life insurance that offers both a/uni00A0death benefit and cash value accumulation potential with financial market participation. The premium amount for VUL insurance is flexible and may be changed by the policyholder within contract limits. Coverage amounts may change as well. The investment feature usually includes 'sub-accounts,' which provide exposure to investments, such as stocks and bonds. This exposure increases cash value return potential, but also the risk of additional premium requirements or lower coverage amounts in comparison with a/uni00A0traditional, non-variable life insurance policy. Transamerica did not actively market VUL insurance in 2021 but may do so in the future.\n\n## Index universal life insurance\n\nIUL insurance provides permanent death benefit protection and cash value accumulation with flexible premium payments. What distinguishes it from other types of permanent life insurance is the way in which interest earnings are credited. Net premiums may be allocated to either a/uni00A0fixed account or indexed accounts. Indexed accounts credit interest based in part on the performance of one or more market indices. The credited interest is based on the index, but with a/uni00A0floor and a/uni00A0cap. IUL offers both market-paced growth potential in the indexed accounts and downside protection. It is an alternative to traditional UL - for which interest is credited at a/uni00A0fixed rate - and VUL, in which the cash value is directly exposed to market fluctuations. LTC riders and other living benefit riders are available on IUL products./uni00A0\n\n## Whole life insurance\n\nWL insurance provides permanent death benefit protection provided that the required premiums are paid, while accumulating cash values based on statutory requirements. Premiums are generally fixed and usually payable over the life of the policy. Among the WL insurance products offered is final expense WL insurance, which is intended to cover medical bills and burial expenses.\n\n## Accident & Health\n\nTransamerica offers supplemental health insurance and LTC insurance.\n\n## Supplemental health insurance\n\nSupplemental health insurance products include accidental death and dismemberment, accidental injury, cancer, critical illness, disability, hospital indemnity, Medicare supplement, retiree medical, dental, vision, and supplemental medical expense indemnity issued by affiliated and/or unaffiliated insurance companies.\n\n## Long-term care insurance\n\nLTC insurance products are a/uni00A0category of health insurance and provide benefits to policyholders that require qualified LTC services when they are unable to perform two or more specified activities of daily living or develop a/uni00A0severe cognitive impairment. LTC insurance helps protect against the high cost of LTC services, and it may also help families better manage the financial, health and safety issues associated with LTC. Transamerica offers a/uni00A0LTC rider on certain life insurance products/uni00A0and ceased offering a/uni00A0standalone product in the first half of 2021.\n\n## Mutual Funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and Collective Investment Trusts (CITs)\n\nMutual funds are professionally managed investment vehicles comprised of pooled money invested by numerous individuals or institutions. Such funds are invested in various underlying security types such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other securities. Transamerica offers mutual funds that are focused on several different asset classes, including US equity, global/ international equity, fixed income, money markets and alternative investments, as well as asset allocation and target-date funds with combined equity and fixed income strategies. Transamerica mutual funds utilize the portfolio management expertise of asset managers across the industry in a/uni00A0sub-advised platform, using managers both affiliated with and not affiliated with Aegon. These managers are subject to a/uni00A0rigorous selection and monitoring due diligence process conducted by Transamerica Asset Management.\n\nETFs are a/uni00A0pooled investment vehicle for individual and institutional investors that combine some of the features of a/uni00A0mutual fund with the flexibility of allowing investors to trade throughout the day on an exchange. Transamerica offers a/uni00A0suite of managed-risk passive",

This Managed Risk strategy is applied to US Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, International Developed Equity and Emerging Market Equity Indices.\n\nA CIT is a/uni00A0pooled investment fund, held by a/uni00A0bank or trust company, and generally available only to certain types of retirement plans and other institutional investors. Transamerica serves as the advisor to some of the CITs it offers, which are focused on several different asset classes including US equity, international equity, and fixed income. Transamerica also leverages the portfolio management expertise of asset managers across the industry.\n\n## Variable Annuities\n\nVAs allow the policyholder to accumulate assets for retirement on a/uni00A0tax-deferred basis and to participate in equity or bond market performance. Additional insurance guarantees, which are offered through riders, can be added to VAs, including guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDBs) and guaranteed living benefits (GLBs). GMDBs provide a/uni00A0guaranteed benefit in the event of death. GLBs are intended to provide a/uni00A0measure of protection against market risk while the annuitant is alive. Different forms of GLBs are offered, such as guaranteeing an income stream for life and/or guaranteeing principal protection. While Transamerica discontinued sales of variable annuities with significant interest rate sensitive living and death benefits in the first quarter of 2021, it continues to offer variable annuities, including certain annuities with GLBs and GMDBs.\n\n## Fixed Annuities\n\nFixed annuities allow the policyholder to accumulate assets for retirement on a/uni00A0tax-deferred basis through periodic interest crediting and principal protection. Transamerica no longer allows new contracts of any fixed annuities as it ceased new sales of fixed indexed annuities in the first quarter of 2021. Premium additions on in force fixed annuities are allowed in some contracts; however, Transamerica's fixed indexed annuity rider will no longer receive any premium deposits after the second quarter of 2022, as the contracts allow for additions only for one year after issue.\n\n## Retirement Plans and IRAs\n\nComprehensive and customized retirement plan services are offered to employers across the entire range of defined benefit, defined contribution, and non-qualified deferred compensation plans for single employer plans, multiple employer plans (MEPs) and pooled employer plans (PEPs). Services are also offered to individuals rolling over funds from other qualified retirement funds or IRAs.\n\nRetirement plan services, including administration, recordkeeping and related services are offered to employers of all sizes and to plans across all market segments with focus on small to mid-sized organizations. Transamerica also works closely with plan advisors and third-party administrators to serve their customers. Transamerica Retirement Solutions is a/uni00A0top-ten defined contribution record-keeper in the United States based on number of plan participants 1 .\n\nPlan sponsors have access to a/uni00A0wide array of investment options./uni00A0Tools are provided to help plan participants monitor their retirement accounts and engage in behavior to stay on track towards a/uni00A0funded retirement. Managed Advice\u00ae is a/uni00A0managed account option that plan sponsors can make available to participants that provides investment advice to participants using the plan's slate of funds.\n\nFor individuals, retirement related services and products include IRAs, advisory services, and annuities as well as access to other financial insurance products and resources.\n\n## Stable Value Solutions\n\nTransamerica's Stable Value Solutions business offers synthetic guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) primarily to tax-qualified institutional entities such as 401(k) plans and other retirement plans and college savings plans. A synthetic GIC 'wrapper' is offered around fixed income invested assets, which are owned by the plan and managed by the plan or a/uni00A0third-party money manager hired by the plan. A synthetic GIC is typically issued with an evergreen maturity and may be terminated under certain conditions. Such a/uni00A0contract helps to reduce fluctuations in the value of the wrapped assets and provides book value withdrawals for plan participants. Stable Value fixed annuity contracts are also available to certain types of qualified retirement plans as a/uni00A0participant investment option.\n\n## Brazil\n\nAegon has designated Brazil as a/uni00A0growth market. The Americas business in Brazil consists of a/uni00A054.9% economic interest, inclusive of 50% of voting common shares, in MAG Seguros, a/uni00A0Brazilian independent life insurer.

Some activities, products and services are also subject to federal regulation.\n\n## State regulation\n\nThe Transamerica insurance companies are licensed as insurers and are regulated in each US state and jurisdiction in which they conduct insurance business. The insurance regulators in each state carry out their mission by providing oversight in the broad areas of market conduct and financial solvency.\n\nTransamerica's largest insurance company, Transamerica Life Insurance Company, is domiciled in the State of Iowa, and the Iowa Insurance Division exercises principal regulatory jurisdiction over it. Iowa is Transamerica's designated lead state, giving Iowa a/uni00A0coordinating role in the collective supervision of Transamerica's insurance entities.\n\nIn the areas of licensing and market conduct, states grant or revoke licenses to transact insurance business, regulate trade, advertising and marketing practices, approve policy forms and certain premium rates, review and approve products and certain rates prior to sale, address consumer complaints, and perform market conduct examinations on both a/uni00A0regular and targeted basis.\n\nIn the area of financial regulation, state regulators implement and supervise statutory reserve and minimum risk-based capital requirements. Insurance companies are also subject to extensive reporting requirements, investment limitations, and required approval of significant transactions. State regulators conduct extensive financial examinations every three to five years.\n\nState regulators have the authority to impose a/uni00A0variety of corrective measures, including the revocation of an insurer's license, for failure to comply with applicable regulations. All state insurance regulators are members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a/uni00A0non-regulatory industry association that works to achieve uniformity and efficiency of insurance regulation across the United States and US territories.\n\nRecent state-level regulatory developments that impact Transamerica include changes to the product illustration rules for IUL insurance. The new rules attempt to make product illustrations more consistent across various product designs and should lead to a/uni00A0more level playing field for new sales within the industry.",

The factors result in required capital increases for many categories of bonds, whereas real estate capital charges decrease. In combination, the changes to bond and real estate risk charges have the effect of increasing regulatory capital requirements for Transamerica.\n\nThe NAIC has finalized and is gradually implementing a/uni00A0liquidity stress testing framework for large life insurers, including Transamerica. The requirements are effectuated by changes to the NAIC's Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act, which must be adopted by each state, but current submissions are occurring under existing authority. It is anticipated that the required liquidity stress testing exercise will be performed annually.\n\nRecent amendments to the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act adjust guaranty fund assessments for future LTC insurance-related insolvencies so that 50% of such assessments come from life/annuity accounts, with the other 50% from health/ Health Maintenance Organization accounts. Under the new formula, in the event of an LTC-related insolvency, Transamerica would be subject to a/uni00A0relatively greater burden for assessments imposed by state guaranty associations. To date, approximately 35 states have adopted the amended model.\n\nOther emerging state issues that may impact Transamerica include a/uni00A0project by the NAIC to update the economic scenario generator that is required to be used to calculate prudential provisions for variable annuities and other products. The NAIC is also investigating emerging simplified and automated underwriting methodologies in light of nondiscrimination objectives. Finally, the NAIC is also exploring enhancements to existing climate risk regulation, including solvency assessment and risk disclosure.\n\n## Federal regulation\n\nAlthough the insurance and retirement-related directed trustee and CIT business is primarily regulated at the state level, securities products, and retirement plans products and services are also subject to federal regulation.\n\nVariable insurance products and mutual funds offered by Transamerica are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws administered and enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The distribution and sale of SEC-registered products by broker-dealers is regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and state securities regulators. A number of Transamerica companies are also registered as investment advisors and are subject to the SEC's Regulation Best Interest (Regulation BI), which establishes a/uni00A0'best interest' standard of conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisors when making a/uni00A0recommendation to a/uni00A0retail customer and requires potential conflicts of interest to be disclosed. Several states have adopted an NAIC model law that imposes similar standards as Regulation BI for the sale of non-variable annuities.\n\nThere continues to be a/uni00A0very active US federal legislative and regulatory environment with respect to financial services. While there is no certainty whether or in what form these proposals might be adopted, emerging federal proposals that may impact the businesses of Transamerica include a/uni00A0Department of Labor fiduciary advice proposal, several legislative proposals considering independent contractor classification, and new requirements regarding the disclosure of climate risks and potentially other environmental, social, and governance factors.\n\n## Information security and privacy regulation\n\nTransamerica's businesses are regulated with respect to information security, data breach response, privacy, and data use at both the federal and state levels. At the federal level, various Transamerica companies are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), among other laws. At the state level, Departments of Insurance and Financial Services typically administer a series of privacy and information security laws and regulations that impact several Transamerica businesses. In addition, in recent years numerous state legislatures have passed or have attempted to pass additional, more broad-based general consumer privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Privacy Rights Act. Those California laws, as amended, will be administered by the newly formed California Privacy Protection Agency. Additional laws and regulations with respect to these topics are also anticipated to be promulgated and to go into effect in the coming years, and they may be administered by new or different state agencies or by the offices of state Attorneys General. The White House, SEC, and other regulators have also increased their focus on companies' cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, including in relation to third-party service providers.",

Aegon the Netherlands employs approximately 3,300 people and is headquartered in The Hague, with main other offices in Amsterdam, Leeuwarden, and Groningen.\n\n## Organizational structure\n\nAegon is one of the most widely recognized brands in the Dutch financial services sector. Aegon the Netherlands also operates through several other brands, including Knab, TKP Pensioen, Nedasco and Robidus.\n\nAegon the Netherlands has four lines of business:\n\n- \u00b7 Life;\n- \u00b7 Mortgages;\n- \u00b7 Banking; and\n- \u00b7 Workplace Solutions.\n\nAegon the Netherlands' primary subsidiaries are:\n\n- \u00b7 Aegon Bank N.V.;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Cappital B.V.;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Hypotheken B.V.;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Levensverzekering N.V.;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Schadeverzekering N.V.;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Spaarkas N.V.;\n- \u00b7 Nedasco B.V.;\n- \u00b7 Robidus Groep B.V.;\n- \u00b7 TKP Pensioen B.V.\n\nWithin the strategy of Aegon, Aegon the Netherlands is designated a/uni00A0core market, organized into Financial Assets and Strategic Assets.\n\nThe Life activities of Aegon the Netherlands are considered Financial Assets./uni00A0Aegon has established a/uni00A0dedicated team to manage these businesses, which is responsible for maximizing its value through active in-force management, disciplined risk management and capital management actions. These actions are focused on protecting the capital position, increasing capital generation, and reducing expenses by outsourcing of the servicing of the life-books. Aegon selectively competes in the defined benefit market. This also includes supporting employers in their transition towards defined contribution solutions under the new pension agreement. In 2021, new life sales consisted mainly of immediate pensions annuities, indexations on existing group life contracts and risk insurance.\n\nStrategic Assets are the businesses in which Aegon the Netherlands will invest to grow its customer base and increase margins. Aegon the Netherlands strategically focuses on the following business: Mortgages (Aegon Hypotheken), Banking (Knab); and Workplace solutions for employers. The last category consists of the following businesses: Aegon Cappital, TKP Pensioen, Aegon Schadeverzekering, Robidus and Nedasco.\n\n## Overview of sales and distribution channels\n\nAegon the Netherlands uses a/uni00A0variety of distribution channels to help customers access the products and services appropriate to their needs. All business lines use an intermediary channel, which focuses on independent brokers in different market segments in the Netherlands./uni00A0Aegon the Netherlands continues to invest in online capabilities to support customers and intermediaries, to further enhance the digital self-service experience.\n\nIn 2021, Aegon decided to stop offering bank savings products to non-fee-paying customers. Due to low market interest rates, Aegon could not offer these savings products to its customers in a/uni00A0profitable way. These customers were offered the opportunity to either transfer their funds to another bank or transfer their funds to a/uni00A0fee-based Knab account. Going forward, new banking products will be offered through the Knab label only, distributed fully online.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview of business lines\n\n## Life\n\nAegon the Netherlands' Life entity (Aegon Levensverzekering) is managed as a/uni00A0Financial Asset. This means that the focus is on/uni00A0maximizing its value through active in-force management, disciplined risk management and capital management actions. These actions are focused on protecting the capital position, increasing capital generation, and reducing expenses by outsourcing of the servicing of the life-books.\n\n## Pensions\n\nInterest rates have been low for an extended period of time, creating a/uni00A0shift from Defined Benefit (DB) pension plans to Defined Contribution (DC) pensions plans./uni00A0In 2020, fundamental changes were proposed to the Dutch pension system. Although implementation is delayed from 2026 to 2027, these include that new pension accrual is only allowed in DC schemes. As Aegon the Netherlands offers DC schemes through a/uni00A0separate legal entity - Aegon Cappital - the consequence for Aegon Levensverzekering is that all of its Group pension products will become closed books.\n\nAegon the Netherlands will only selectively compete in the defined benefit market. This also includes supporting employers in their transition towards defined contribution solutions under the new pension agreement. Renewals of existing contracts are possible, but only if the renewal facilitates the existing customers in their transition to DC. In addition, Aegon Levensverzekering will continue to sell risk insurance and annuities that are closely linked to DC schemes. More detail on annuities is provided further below.\n\nThe Group DB products that remain on the balance sheet of Aegon Levensverzekering are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Separate account group contracts with individually determined asset investment strategies, profit sharing and guarantees;\n- \u00b7 Contracts with profit sharing based on a/uni00A0pre-determined interest rate;\n- \u00b7 Traditional variable unit-linked products;\n- \u00b7 DB subscriptions, a/uni00A0standardized product that offers a/uni00A01-year guarantee; and\n- \u00b7 Contracts without profit sharing.\n\nAs the DB subscription product remains open for existing customers and, as some contracts have a/uni00A0due date in the future, there are still premiums received for these products. In addition, indexations remain possible for all of the Group DB products.\n\n## Annuities\n\nThe actively sold products in this category are simple payout annuities and variable annuities without guarantees. These products are linked to DC schemes in which participants build up their capital and are obliged, by law, to purchase an annuity at the pension date. Participants can choose between a/uni00A0guaranteed annuity - where all risks are borne by Aegon - or a/uni00A0variable annuity without investment guarantees, where all risks are borne by the participant. Given that a/uni00A0significant shift has been observed to DC schemes, these annuities are a/uni00A0natural driver of growth as they provide a/uni00A0solution for the payout phase. Annuity insurance also includes older products with guaranteed interest rates and profit sharing for which no new business is written.\n\n## Risk insurance\n\nThis category mainly includes the survivor's pension insurance sold as a/uni00A0rider to DC pension schemes. Premiums are mainly paid by the employer and the product pays benefits to the spouse/children in the event of the death of the insured.\n\n## Endowment insurance\n\nEndowment insurance includes several products that accumulate a/uni00A0cash value. Premiums are paid at inception or over the term of the contract. These products pay benefits on the policy maturity date, subject to survival of the insured. Most policies also pay death benefits should the insured die during the term of the contract./uni00A0Minimum interest guarantees exist for all generations of endowment insurance products written, except for universal life products, for which premiums are invested solely in equity funds. These products are no longer being sold.\n\n## Term and whole life insurance\n\nTerm life insurance pays out death benefits should the insured die during the term of the contract. Whole life insurance pays out death benefits in the event of death, regardless of when this occurs. Premiums and amounts insured are established at inception of the contract and are guaranteed. The amount insured may be adjusted at the request of the policyholder. Term life insurance policies do not include profit-sharing mechanisms. Part of the whole life insurance portfolio has profit-sharing features, which are based on external indices or the return of related assets. In the first quarter of 2020, Aegon the Netherlands stopped offering these products.",

Mortgage loans are originated both as investments for Aegon the Netherlands' insurance and bank entities as well as distributed to third-party investors. Such investors are provided access to this high-quality asset class through the Aegon Dutch Mortgage Fund, Robuust/uni00A0(a third-party label where Aegon has the exclusive right to purchase and distribute the mortgages receivables), SAECURE (Aegon's Dutch residential mortgage-backed securities program), Aegon Bank's covered bond program, and various bespoke structures to tailor to investors' needs. Investors value our mortgage offering for the attractive spread and low creditloss experience through disciplined underwriting. Consumers and independent financial advisors choose Aegon mortgages for the high quality of service, reliable operations, and accessibility through the economic cycle./uni00A0\n\n## Banking\n\nIn 2021, Aegon completed the migration and integration of the Aegon Bank brand to the Knab brand. Knab is a/uni00A0fully online digital bank that went live in 2012. By integrating both operations and rationalizing product offerings, costs are lower, operations more efficient, and governance is unified. Knab continues to offer banking products like savings accounts and investments, as part of Aegon's pension offerings in the Netherlands. In 2020, Banking was/uni00A0classified as a/uni00A0Strategic Asset and forms the gateway to individual retirement solutions./uni00A0\n\nKnab customer growth is geared towards fee-paying customers and products. Increasing efforts to deliver products and offer functionalities (e.g., Google pay, VAT savings) in a/uni00A0higher customer demand environment is key for retaining and acquiring new customers.\n\n## Workplace solutions\n\nNon-life\n\n## Accident and Health\n\nAegon the Netherlands offers disability and sick leave products to employers that cover these payments for employees not covered by social security and where the employer bears the risk. For some forms of disability, employers can choose to use the social security system to insure these risks or opt out and seek private insurance, which Aegon also offers. Private insurance appeals to employers,/uni00A0because it offers a/uni00A0wider set of coverage options and therefore better tailor to the needs of the employer regarding the disability risk of their employees, and as a/uni00A0result helps reduce absenteeism and disability thanks to better reintegration efforts.\n\nFor individuals, Aegon the Netherlands offers a/uni00A0disability product mainly targeted at the growing self-employed market.\n\n## Property and Casualty (P&C)\n\nAegon the Netherlands has focused exclusively on retail lines in P&C insurance, offering products in the segments of property, motor, travel, legal assistance, private liability claims, pet insurance, and injury. The ambition for the P&C retail segment is to provide the best digital service in the Dutch P&C market while building long-lasting relationships with customers and distribution partners.\n\nThrough the service concepts, Aegon the Netherlands supports intermediaries with excellent digital processes to help their customers in the best possible way. This is done by stimulating performance at sustainable levels for customers, intermediaries, and the insurer. In addition to the intermediary market, Aegon the Netherlands has further developed digital and online capabilities, especially as the direct market has sustained a/uni00A0sizable share in the overall distribution in the past years, in particular for the Motor segment. The direct market includes sales via Aegon's own website and affiliates, as well as through aggregator websites.\n\n## Aegon Cappital\n\nAegon Cappital is a/uni00A0low-cost provider of DC pension schemes offered through intermediary advisors. Aegon Cappital offers DC pension schemes in a/uni00A0standardized subscription-based model to small and medium enterprises and customized contracts for medium-to-large corporations. The model enables employers to choose from a/uni00A0variety of contribution tables and social security offsets, while remaining flexible for regulatory changes, such as changes in pension age or fiscal contribution limits. Savings premiums are invested in life cycle funds managed by Aegon Investment Management B.V..\n\nAegon Cappital is one of the largest pension premium institutions ('PPIs') in the Netherlands and benefits considerably from economies of scale. The low interest rate environment, and the fundamental changes of the Dutch pension system as of January 1, 2027, will result in a/uni00A0continued shift to DC schemes.\n\nPPIs cannot bear any investment or insurance risks on their offerings due to regulatory requirements. The schemes include disability and/or life insurance which are offered by partners Aegon Levensverzekering, Aegon Schadeverzekering and Elips Life AG, and",

The main risks for Aegon Cappital are operational and regulatory risk.\n\n## TKP Pensioen, Robidus and Nedasco\n\nTKP Pensioen is a/uni00A0top three player in the Dutch market for pension administration 1 . TKP Pensioen administers pension rights for several large company and industry pension funds, as well as other pension providers such as premium pension institutions. Their customers - 67,000 employers representing 3.4/uni00A0million participants - rely on TKP Pensioen for correct and timely pension payments, and clear and accessible pension information and communication. This ranges from the mandatory pension statements to customer contact and digital customer services.\n\nRobidus Groep advises corporations on the risks and associated costs of absenteeism and disability under Dutch social security legislation and acts as an insurance broker for income related insurances.\n\nNedasco is an intermediary service provider that is mainly active in non-life business domains.\n\n## Competition\n\nAegon the Netherlands faces strong competition in all markets from insurers, banks, investment companies and pension funds. Its main competitors are Allianz Benelux, ASR and NN Group.\n\nAegon has been a/uni00A0key player in the total life market for many years and was ranked fourth in 2020 based on gross premium income 2 . The life insurance market in the Netherlands comprises pensions and life insurance. The top five life insurance companies in the Netherlands by gross premium income accounted for over 80% of total premium (Individual Life and Pensions) income in 2020. Aegon the Netherlands is one of many insurers in the non-life market with a/uni00A0market share of around 2% 3 , making it the tenth largest company in the market.\n\nIn the mortgage loans market, Aegon the Netherlands held a/uni00A0market share of over 7% based on new sales in 2020, making it the fourth largest mortgage loan provider in the market 4 . Rabobank, ABN AMRO, and ING Bank are the largest mortgage loan providers in the market, but their market share is under pressure, because of a/uni00A0shift to fixed rates for longer periods. Competition is still increasing from foreign competitors and capital from pension funds.\n\nAegon the Netherlands' share in the market for Dutch household savings was just over 3% in 2020 5 , which is relatively small in comparison to the top three which are Rabobank, ING and ABN AMRO. In 2021, market share decreased as a/uni00A0result from the decision to stop selling products under the Aegon Bank label./uni00A0\n\nIn the pensions market the defined contribution (PPI) segment is set to grow further due to the fundamental changes of the Dutch pension system as of 2027 and the demand for transparent and cost-effective pension products. Significant growth of scale is necessary to effectively serve this market. Aegon the Netherlands has identified this market as an opportunity for growth and intends to maintain its leadership position with Aegon Cappital in cooperation with other Aegon units. Aegon Cappital is the number two in the market based on number of participants and assets under management 6 .\n\n## Regulation and supervision General\n\nRegulation of the financial sector in the Netherlands is included in the Financial Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht or Wft). The Wft embeds the cross-sectorial functional approach within the Dutch supervisory system. The supervision of financial institutions pursuant to the Wft rests with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM).\n\nThe DNB is responsible for prudential supervision, while the AFM supervises the conduct of business of financial institutions, and the conduct of business on financial markets. The aim of the DNB's prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial institutions and contribute to the stability of the financial sector. Regarding banks, the DNB undertakes its supervisory role, in particular with respect to prudential supervision, together with the European Central Bank (ECB).",

These tools include the authority to request information, if this is necessary for the purpose of prudential supervision, and the power to issue formal instructions to financial institutions, to impose fines, or to publish sanctions. The DNB, as prudential supervisory authority, can, under certain circumstances, require a/uni00A0recovery plan, a/uni00A0short-term financing plan, appoint a/uni00A0trustee, draw up a/uni00A0transfer plan or (ultimately) withdraw the license of a/uni00A0financial institution.\n\nThe Dutch Data Protection Authority (Dutch DPA) supervises processing of personal data in order to ensure compliance with laws that regulate such use. The tasks and powers of the Dutch DPA are described in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), supplemented by the Dutch Implementation Act of the GDPR.\n\n## Financial supervision of insurance companies\n\nThe Solvency II framework consists of, inter alia, an EU Directive and EU Delegated Regulation. The EU Directive has been transposed into Dutch legislation, in particular the Wft. The EU Delegated Regulation is directly applicable, without transposition into local legislation.\n\nThe following insurance entities of Aegon the Netherlands are subject to prudential supervision by the DNB:\n\n- \u00b7 Aegon Levensverzekering;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Schadeverzekering;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Spaarkas.\n\nAn insurance company is neither permitted to conduct both life insurance and non-life insurance business within a/uni00A0single legal entity (except for reinsurance), nor to carry out both insurance and banking activities within the same legal entity. Within Aegon the Netherlands, Aegon Levensverzekering and Aegon Spaarkas conduct life insurance activities. Aegon Schadeverzekering conducts non-life insurance activities.\n\n## Solvency II/uni00A0\n\nThe Solvency II framework is described in more detail in the section 'Regulation and supervision' of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report 2021.\n\nAegon the Netherlands uses a/uni00A0partial internal model (PIM) to calculate the solvency position of its life insurance activities under Solvency II. The calculation includes the use of the volatility adjustment (VA), but does not include the use of any transitional measures. The initial internal model of Aegon the Netherlands was approved on November 26, 2015, by the supervisor, the DNB, as part of the Internal Model Application Process. Following the Internal Model Application Process, Aegon the Netherlands made several major changes to its PIM, which have all been approved by DNB.\n\n## Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers\n\nThe Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers (R&R Act) is the applicable intervention regime for insurance and reinsurance companies in the Netherlands faced with financial difficulties.\n\nThe R&R Act has introduced a/uni00A0revised regulatory framework for recovery and resolution of Dutch insurance and reinsurance companies and provides for a/uni00A0range of measures to be taken by these companies and the DNB ex ante, in order for these insurance and reinsurance companies to be prepared for recovery in circumstances where it no longer meets the required solvency requirements and for orderly resolution, in circumstances where it is failing or is likely to fail.\n\n## Financial supervision of credit institutions\n\nAegon Bank is subject to Basel requirements pursuant to the EU Capital Requirements Regulation ('CRR') and the Capital Requirement Directive ('CRD'), as implemented in the Netherlands in the Wft. The CRD and CRR include requirements with respect to the quality and quantity of capital, as well as a/uni00A0liquidity framework. According to EU legislation, competent authorities remain responsible for monitoring leverage policies and processes of individual institutions and may impose additional measures to address risk of excessive leverage, if warranted.\n\nTaking into account the regulatory requirements mentioned above and the outcomes of the annual Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process ('SREP'), Aegon Bank's minimal capital and liquidity requirements are set.",

The leading operating subsidiaries, which all operate under the Aegon brand, are:\n\n- \u00b7 Scottish Equitable plc;\n- \u00b7 Cofunds Ltd.;\n- \u00b7 Aegon Investment Solutions Ltd.; and\n- \u00b7 Aegon Investments Ltd.\n\n## Overview of business Lines\n\nAegon UK has both a/uni00A0modern fee-based investment 'platform' business, built organically and scaled through the acquisition of Cofund's retail savings platform and BlackRock's Workplace Defined Contribution business, and a/uni00A0'traditional insurance' business.\n\nAegon UK's platform business delivers a/uni00A0range of propositions through Retail and Workplace channels, together with protection products and an institutional trading platform business. This is supported by an investment solutions capability which allows customers to invest in proprietary Aegon funds, driving additional fee margin.\n\nAegon UK's traditional insurance business consists of older contracts that are no longer actively marketed to new customers. An outsource relationship is in place with Atos to service and administer the book, building on an existing relationship, which has seen Atos successfully administer over 400,000 protection policies since 2016.\n\n## Overview of sales and distribution\n\nAegon UK has two principal distribution channels: financial advisers who advise Retail customers and the workplace.\n\nAegon UK works with those advisers and employers to deliver an online experience for customers. The platform is designed to support customers throughout their life as needs evolve by providing a/uni00A0comprehensive range of products and funds, moving with them each time they change employers and allowing them to link in with different advisers./uni00A0\n\nThis gives Aegon UK the ability to support customers throughout their lives with the flexibility required to support the modern, complex lives they are living to and through retirement, unlike the majority of its competitors.\n\nAegon UK is now investing in organic growth where it is seeking to capitalize on its strong positions in the Retail and Workplace pension markets, which are forecast to grow materially in the medium to long term./uni00A0",

It aims to capitalize on the strong demand for advice, especially within the growing affluent population nearing and in retirement.\n\nAegon UK offers a/uni00A0comprehensive proposition allowing advisers to manage their clients long-term investments by offering equity trading, and a/uni00A0choice of over 4,500 funds./uni00A0Aegon UK is continuing to develop a/uni00A0strong range of own brand investment solutions, and plans to extend them in 2022.\n\nAegon UK provides a/uni00A0technology platform that supports advisers and their customers in managing their finances, and is integrated with the back offices of the advisers. The aim is to create a/uni00A0primary platform relationship, which positions Aegon UK to receive the majority of new business flows from the adviser partner.\n\nOver 4,000 adviser firms have placed business with Aegon UK in the last year/uni00A0across a/uni00A0wide range of business models. These include leading wealth management firms such as Chase De Vere, financial services networks such as Quilter, and execution-only brokers.\n\nNationwide Building Society has been an important partner for Aegon UK since the relationship was established in 2017. There are/uni00A0plans to expand the product offering beyond Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) and General Investment Accounts (GIAs) to pensions and other solutions. An important dimension of the Nationwide partnership is the inclusion of Aegon's own investment solutions.\n\n## Workplace channel\n\nThe Workplace channel provides UK-based employers with Workplace pensions and savings schemes. It allows Aegon UK to participate in the strongly growing auto-enrolment market, cost effectively acquiring around 150,000/uni00A0individual customer relationships every year.\n\nAegon UK has a/uni00A0market-leading position covering all major Workplace savings products, and participates in both the small and medium-sized (SME) and large employer segments. A key driver of growth is in the Master Trust product, the fastest growing sector of the UK Defined Contribution market, where Aegon UK has an established and market-leading offering.\n\nAegon UK works with leading employee benefits consultants and corporate advisers to provide a/uni00A0Workplace savings platform to employers such as WH Smith, EasyJet and Skanska. This combines its core pension capabilities with ISAs and GIAs, allowing employees to maximize their savings whilst employed, then take the product with them when they leave or choose to take financial advice in the future.\n\nAt the heart of this is Aegon UK's employee digital portal, which provides tools to enable employees to make more informed decisions. The portal also links into the wider engagement activities such as seminars in the workplace, and online innovations such as the launch of digital personalized summaries and an app that helps customers consolidate assets held elsewhere, increase their savings and transition into retirement.\n\nThe acquisition of Pensions Geeks in 2021 will allow Aegon UK to bring to market an interactive digital financial education platform in 2022, which will utilize their award-winning marketing capability to further enhance the experience offered to the end customer.\n\n## Individual customer channel\n\nAegon UK has a/uni00A0growing individual customer base of 1.5/uni00A0million, who are not attached to an adviser or employer. These individuals are provided with tools that enable them to manage their finances, and with customer service support to help with guidance and referrals available to Aegon UK's in-house Financial Adviser business, Origen, where appropriate. The Pension Geeks education platform will also be made available here.\n\n## Protection channel\n\nAegon UK offers a/uni00A0range of products for Retail customers, including life cover, critical illness and income protection available through financial advisers. The target market is wealthier customers over the age of 40, where Aegon UK's underwriting expertise helps it to provide a/uni00A0customer-centric proposition.\n\nIn addition, Aegon UK offers a/uni00A0range of protection products for small to medium-sized companies that wish to insure key personnel, complementing the core offerings in the Workplace channel.",

And, competitors include Aviva, Legal & General and Willis Towers Watson.\n\n## Regulation and supervision\n\nAll relevant Aegon UK companies based in the UK are either: authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the PRA; or authorized and regulated by the FCA, dependent on firm type.\n\nThe PRA is responsible for the prudential regulation of deposit takers, insurers and major investment firms. The FCA is responsible for regulating firms' conduct in Retail and Wholesale markets. It is also responsible for the prudential regulation of those financial services firms that do not come under the PRA's remit.\n\nThe Aegon Master Trust is subject to regulatory oversight by The Pensions Regulator.\n\nThe UK exit from the European Union (EU) has implications for financial services companies in the UK. Much of the financial regulation applicable in the UK derived originally from EU legislation and has been retained by the UK. In light of their new autonomy, the UK Government and Regulators are reviewing the UK Regulatory Framework to consider if changes are needed, as well as focusing on specific changes in areas such as Solvency II.\n\n## Financial supervision of insurance companies\n\nScottish Equitable plc is authorized by the PRA and is subject to prudential regulation by the PRA and conduct regulation by the FCA. Every life insurance company licensed by and/or falling under the supervision of the PRA must file audited regulatory reports at least annually. These reports, primarily designed to enable the PRA to monitor the solvency of the insurance company, include a/uni00A0(consolidated) balance sheet, a/uni00A0(consolidated) income statement, a/uni00A0breakdown of the Solvency Capital Requirements, extensive actuarial information, and detailed information regarding the investments of the insurance company. The PRA's regulatory reporting is based on a/uni00A0single entity focus and is designed to highlight risk assessment and risk management.\n\n## Regulatory Solvency Requirements\n\nThe UK adopted Solvency II regulations and Binding Technical Standards as they stood at the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020 into UK law. Temporary Transitional Powers are in place under which certain provisions of these onshored regulations will continue to apply until March 31, 2022. Consequently, the UK continues to adopt regulatory solvency requirements which are broadly aligned to those under Solvency II. UK life insurance companies are required to maintain Own Funds which are sufficient to withstand a/uni00A01-in-200 shock on a/uni00A01-year value-at-risk basis, subject to certain absolute minimum requirements.\n\nOne area of divergence is that the PRA now publishes its own Technical Information, including basic risk-free term structures, which must be used by UK Solvency II firms. The UK and EU are both conducting separate reviews of Solvency II which may lead to some further divergence, although both the UK and EU remain committed to the principles underlying Solvency II.",

        "page_content": "Since the introduction of Solvency II on January 1, 2016, Scottish Equitable plc has been using the Aegon Group Partial Internal Model (PIM) to calculate its solo solvency position and its contribution to group solvency. Following the end of the Brexit transition period, the PRA approved the use of the existing PIM for the calculation of the solo regulatory solvency requirements of Scottish Equitable plc. The UK PIM and Group PIM are currently aligned and Aegon UK intends to maintain close alignment in the future, where this remains appropriate.\n\nScottish Equitable plc uses the Matching Adjustment in the calculation of the technical provisions for its annuities, and uses the Volatility Adjustment in the calculation of the technical provisions for the With-Profits business with investment guarantees. Following the sale of the majority of its annuity business in 2017, Scottish Equitable plc ceased the use of the Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions.\n\n## Regulatory requirements for investment firms\n\nIn January 2021, Aegon UK Investment Holdings Ltd was established as a/uni00A0wholly owned subsidiary of Aegon UK plc, and became the direct parent of: Cofunds Ltd, Aegon Investment Solutions Ltd, Aegon Investments Ltd, Momentum Group Ltd, Origen Financial Services Ltd, and Origen Ltd. Aegon UK Investment Holdings Ltd and these subsidiaries are referred to as Aegon UK Investment Group (AUKIG). From January 1, 2021, much of Aegon UK's regulatory reporting has been on an AUKIG basis.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, the FCA's Investment Firm Prudential Regime (IFPR) rules entered into force. These are relevant to AUKIG. Under the new regime, the Pillar 1 capital requirement is the higher of the Fixed Overhead Requirement (FOR), the Permanent Minimum Requirement, or the new 'K-factor' requirement (which replaces the credit risk requirement). The IFPR also replaces the Pillar 2 Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), with a/uni00A0new Internal Capital and Risk Assessment (ICARA) process. Under ICARA, there is more focus on the impact of risks and the potential harm to clients, wider markets and the firm itself. There is also a/uni00A0greater focus on liquidity.",

As of 2022, International will include Brazil and be responsible for all three growth markets of Aegon.\n\nAegon's presence in the Spanish insurance market dates to 1980. The activities in Spain (and eventually Portugal) have developed largely through distribution partnerships with major Spanish banks Banco Santander S.A. and Liberbank S.A. Spain & Portugal are now one of the three growth markets of Aegon Group. In 1992, Aegon purchased the majority stake in Hungary's former state-owned insurance company, \u00c1llami Biztos\u00edt\u00f3. It expanded in Central & Eastern Europe (CEE) in the 2000s. Operations in Asia were established in 2003, starting with a/uni00A0JV in China, which is another growth market for Aegon. TLB was established in 2005/uni00A0and incorporated in Hamilton, Bermuda followed by full-service branches openings in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2006.

The strategy is to invest in digital distribution platforms, particularly in China, to build distribution capabilities for the future.\n\n## Spain & Portugal\n\nIn Spain & Portugal, the life insurance and health products are sold by Santander Life Insurance and Reinsurance, whereas the non-life insurance (accident, home, unemployment, disability, critical illness dependency and funeral) products are sold by Santander General Insurance and Reinsurance Company.\n\nLiberbank, S.A.,/uni00A0another/uni00A0bancassurance partner of Aegon, has a/uni00A0nationwide presence with a/uni00A0special focus on retail markets in several regions (Asturias, Cantabria, Castilla La Mancha and Extremadura).

The joint venture also acquired the right to write new term life and selected lines of non-life policies through the former Banco Popular branches now owned by Banco Santander.\n\nOn July 30, 2021, a/uni00A0merger between Liberbank and Unicaja Bank was completed, with Unicaja being the acquiring legal entity. Liberbank has ceased to be a/uni00A0distinct legal entity and all of its assets and liabilities have been transferred to Unicaja. As a/uni00A0result of the merger, Unicaja Bank now has bancassurance agreements with each of Aegon, Mapfre and Santa Luc\u00eda. These relationships are currently under review.\n\nAegon Espa\u00f1a's own distribution channel offers life, health and pension products. The network of brokers and agents accounts for approximately 80% of the total sales of the fully owned subsidiary, and the remaining 20% is generated by the direct channel.\n\n## Central & Eastern Europe\n\nDistribution channels in CEE are dominated by tied and external agency as well as brokers./uni00A0\n\n## TLB and Aegon Insights\n\nTransamerica Life (Bermuda) Ltd.

It primarily worked with local insurers to develop tailored solutions to specific needs. The revenue is generated through underwriting reinsurance agreements and fee income. With changes in consumer preferences, Aegon made the strategic decision to discontinue Aegon Insights' new business acquisition, while continuing to provide services to the existing customer base in Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Japan.\n\n## China: Aegon THTF\n\nAegon operates in China through a/uni00A0joint venture with Tongfang Co.

In Hungary, however, insurance companies established before 1995 are exempt from this rule. This exemption therefore applies to Aegon Hungary, which is a/uni00A0composite insurance company.\n\nState supervision and oversight of the insurance industry is conducted by the following bodies and institutions:\n\n- \u00b7 General Directorate of Insurance and Pension Funds (DGSFP) (Spain);\n- \u00b7 The Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority (ASF) (Portugal);\n- \u00b7 The Central Bank of Hungary (MNB) (Hungary);\n- \u00b7 The Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) (Poland);\n- \u00b7 Authority for Financial Supervision (ASF) (Romania); and\n- \u00b7 Insurance and Private Pension Regulatory and Supervisory Board's (IRSB) (Turkey).\n\nThe authorities mentioned above promote consumer protection and have the right to investigate prudential activities and conduct, financial position and solvency, and compliance with all relevant laws.\n\nThe foundation and operations of voluntary pension funds are regulated in Hungary by the country's Voluntary Mutual Pension Funds Act. Activity in this area is also supervised by the MNB. In Romania, the private and voluntary pension system is regulated and supervised by the ASF. The mandatory pension system is subject to the Privately Administered Pension Funds Act and the voluntary pension system is subject to the Voluntary Pension Law, both complemented by individual regulations (as secondary legislation). In Poland, this activity is supervised by the KNF and governed by the Organization and Operation of Pension Funds Act. In Turkey, the voluntary pension funds are under the supervision of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and the companies are subject to Individual Retirement Saving and Investment System Law and Insurance Law. In Spain, the pension system is supervised by DGSFP and governed by Law on Pension Funds and Plans approved by Royal Legislative Decree, and its implementing regulations.\n\n## China: Aegon THTF\n\nChina's insurance industry is regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC). In 2021, the main work focus of the CBIRC was to strengthen corporate governance and strengthen product control. In order to consolidate the management responsibility of insurance institutions, new regulation has been introduced by the CBIRC with stronger controls, with the aim of improving product development and compliance practices.\n\nSince February 1, 2021, 91 life insurance companies have been divided into two groups: 39 insurers are under the direct supervision of the CBIRC and 52 are under the territorial supervision of the local bureaus of CBIRC. Aegon THTF are now under the direct territorial supervision of Shenzhen Bureau. Certain functions, including product filing and approval are still under CBIRC's direct supervision.\n\n## India: Aegon Life\n\nIndian life insurance companies are regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). The IRDAI regulates, promotes and encourages the orderly growth of insurance and reinsurance businesses in India. Established by the government of India, it safeguards the interests of the country's insurance policyholders.\n\n## TLB\n\nTLB is incorporated in Bermuda and regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the Regulator of the financial services sector in Bermuda. TLB has full-service branches which are registered and licensed in Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. The Insurance Industry is regulated in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong Insurance Authority (HKIA) and in Singapore by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)./uni00A0Hong Kong's Insurance Authority (IA) is currently developing HK RBC, a/uni00A0risk-based capital regime that is consistent with core principles issued by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). Under this regime, the capital requirements of licensed insurers will be determined based on the level of risk faced by the insurer. Once in effect, HK RBC will significantly transform the current capital framework defined in the Hong Kong Insurance Ordinance (HKIO). TLB is well progressed in its RBC developments.\n\n## Aegon Insights\n\nA broad range of regulations apply to Aegon Insights' activities. Depending on the precise nature of the activities undertaken and the form of business entity used in the jurisdictions in which Aegon Insights operates, relevant regulations include marketing/ consultancy business licensing rules, insurance laws, and personal data protection laws. In addition, various regulators also keep oversight of activities undertaken by entities licensed by Aegon Insights. These regulators include the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in Australia, and the Hong Kong/uni00A0Insurance Authority.",

These funds have various legal structures and performance is usually measured against a/uni00A0benchmark or peer group. The main asset classes include fixed income, equities, real estate, and multi-asset.\n\nThe Aegon general account is the third source, this consists of funds held on the balance sheet of Aegon insurance companies to back policyholder liabilities, typically when the insurer has given the policyholder a/uni00A0guarantee. These assets are managed to match the insurers' liabilities. As a/uni00A0rule, general account assets are managed in a/uni00A0closed architecture structure, and the main asset classes are fixed income and real assets. Furthermore, Aegon AM manages the general account derivatives book of Aegon the Netherlands.\n\n## Competition\n\nAegon AM competes with other asset management companies to acquire business from Aegon customers in the open-architecture parts of the affiliate business and from third parties.\n\nIn the United States, Aegon AM focuses on offering investors fixed income, equity, and real estate related strategies. It works directly with pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, endowments, and foundations as well as investment consultants within the institutional market. In the wholesale market, Aegon AM works as a/uni00A0sub-advisor with its insurance company affiliates and other partners to offer competitive and relevant strategies for its client base. It also works with investment consultants and other partners to offer products to third-party institutions. Primary competitors in the United States include AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, Invesco, JP Morgan, Legg Mason, Principal, PIMCO and PGIM.\n\nIn continental Europe, Aegon AM focuses on offering investors fixed income, equities, real estate, multi-asset and solutions strategies to institutional and wholesale clients, and through its affiliated insurance company to retail clients. In the Netherlands, Aegon AM also offers fiduciary services to institutional clients. In the third-party institutional market, it competes with domestic and global asset managers, as well as with fiduciary and balance sheet managers. Competition continues to be strong in the institutional market due to both the ongoing consolidation of pension funds and the growing service requirements of pension fund clients. Primary competitors in the Netherlands include BlackRock, Robeco, NN Investment Partners, Achmea and Kempen.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Aegon AM focuses on offering investors fixed income, equities, real estate, and multi-asset and solutions strategies. It serves institutional clients and their advisors and is active in the wholesale market. Primary competitors in the UK include Abrdn, LGIM, Janus Henderson and M&G.\n\nIn mainland China, AIFMC focuses on Chinese equity, fixed income, multi-asset and money market strategies. It competes against a/uni00A0wide range of local based asset managers including Alibaba's Yuebao fund, China Universal Asset Management, E Fund Management, Fullgoal Fund Management, and Yinhua Fund Management. The company's products are distributed through banks, securities brokers, and digital platforms.\n\nIn France, La Banque Postale Asset Management services private investors through La Banque Postale's/uni00A0retail banking network, representing LBPAM and Aegon Asset Management-advised strategies. In the institutional market, it also offers investment strategies from Aegon Asset Management to compete for affiliate and third-party insurance and pension clients with large local asset managers and specialized international competitors. In France, primary competitors include Amundi Asset Management, AXA Investment Management, and BNP Paribas Investment Partners./uni00A0LBPAM is in the process of selling its 45% stake in Ostrum, a/uni00A0jointventure with Natixis that focuses on providing public market fixed income asset management and operational investment services to insurance companies.\n\n## Regulation and supervision\n\nRegulation of asset management companies in general differs to that of insurers. Aegon AM's local operating entities are regulated by their local regulators, most notably the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) (conduct of business supervision) and the DNB (prudential supervision) for Dutch-based entities, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for Aegon Asset Management UK plc, and the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for the US-based entities. Aegon Asset Management UK is also regulated by the SEC for its activities in the US market. Aegon Hungary AM is supervised by the National Bank of Hungary. From a/uni00A0regulatory perspective, the asset management activities of the US-based entities of Aegon AM in the United States do not fall directly under the responsibility of Aegon Asset Management Holding B.V., as these entities are subsidiaries of Transamerica Corporation.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors Aegon/uni00A0N.V.\n\nAegon faces numerous risks, some of which may arise from internal factors, factors such as failures of compliance systems and other operational risks. Others may arise from external factors, such as developments in financial markets, the business and/or political environment, economic trends, politics and regulations. Any of the risks described below, whether internal or external, may materially and adversely affect the Company's operations, its earnings, the value of its investments, the sale of certain products and services or its ability to fulfill its obligations in respect of securities issued or guaranteed by it. The market price of Aegon securities could decline due to any of the risks described in this section and investors could lose some or all of the value of their investments. Additional risks of which Aegon is not presently aware could also materially and adversely affect its operations and share price. The business of an international financial services group such as Aegon is inherently exposed to risks that may only become apparent with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nThis chapter groups the risk factors into different categories based on the origin of the risk, while recognizing that the identified risk factor can have broader consequences, e.g. developments on financial markets (included under financial risks) can impact policyholder behavior (included under underwriting risk). The categories used are: 1) financial risks, 2) underwriting risks, 3) operational risks, 4) political, regulatory and supervisory risks, 5) legal and compliance risks, and 6) risks relating to Aegon's common shares. Within each category, the most material risk factors have been presented first. The order in which the remaining risk factors are presented is not necessarily an indication of the likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of the consequences of the materialization of risks, as that can rarely be determined with any degree of certainty. Furthermore, risks with a low likelihood can have a large impact should they materialize.\n\nThe described risk factors below may affect Aegon's businesses and operations in normal market circumstances and in periods of significant economic uncertainty, when the manifestation of those risks may be more acute.\n\n## Summary\n\nIn summary, the risk factors cover the following topics in the designated categories:\n\n- 1. Financial risks\n- \u00b7 Interest rate volatility, and sustained low or negative interest rate levels/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Rapidly rising interest rates/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Disruptions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Illiquidity of certain investment assets/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Declines in value and defaults in Aegon's debt securities, private placements, mortgage loan portfolios and other instruments or the failure of certain counterparties\n- \u00b7 Decline in equity markets/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Downturn in the real estate market/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Default of a major market participant/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Failure by reinsurers to which Aegon has ceded risk/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Downgrade in Aegon's credit ratings/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Unsuccessful management of derivatives\n- \u00b7 Subjective valuation of Aegon's investments, allowances and impairments/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Higher inflation/uni00A0\n- 2.

Investment earnings may be lower because the interest earnings on new fixed-income investments are likely to have declined with the market interest rates. A prolonged low or even negative interest rate environment may also result in a lengthening of maturities of the policyholder liabilities from initial estimates, due to lower policy lapses and longer duration of annuities. In this context, negative interest rates have comparable but larger impacts than low but positive rates.",

        "page_content": "In-force life insurance and annuity policies may be relatively more attractive to consumers due to built-in minimum interest rate guarantees, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features and a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force year-to-year. The majority of assets backing the insurance liabilities are invested in fixed-income securities.\n\nAegon, in managing its investments and derivative portfolio, considers a variety of factors, including the relationship between the expected duration of its assets and liabilities. However, if interest rates remain low or even negative, the yield earned upon reinvesting interest payments from current investments, or from their sale or maturity, may decline. Reinvestment at lower yields may reduce the spread between interest earned on investments and interest credited to some of Aegon's products and accordingly profitability may decline. In addition, borrowers may prepay or redeem fixed maturity investments or mortgage loans in Aegon's investment portfolio in order to borrow at lower rates. Aegon's ability to lower crediting rates on certain products to offset the decrease in spread may be limited by contractually guaranteed minimum rates or competitive influences.\n\nDepending on economic developments, interest rates for securities with shorter maturities may remain at low or even negative levels for a prolonged period. In such an environment, an anchored expectation of low inflation or deflation could further push down the longer end of the interest rate curve, which could have significant implications for Aegon's profitability.\n\n## Rapidly rising interest rates may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and available liquidity.\n\nIn periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may and usually do increase. Premiums in flexible premium policies may decrease as policyholders seek investments with perceived higher returns. This activity may result in cash payments by Aegon requiring the sale of invested assets at a time when the prices of those assets are affected adversely by the increase in market interest rates. This may result in realized investment losses.\n\nThese cash payments to policyholders also result in a decrease in total invested assets and net result. Early withdrawals may also require accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs ('DPAC'), which in turn reduces net result.\n\nIn addition, if interest rates rise, unrealized losses on assets carried at fair value will be recorded in other comprehensive income (available-for-sale investments) or as losses (investments at fair value through profit or loss) under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union ('EU-IFRS'). This is inconsistent with the EU-IFRS accounting on much of Aegon's liabilities, where corresponding economic gains from higher interest rates do not affect shareholders' equity or net income in the shorter term. Such temporal mismatch could cause Aegon's results of operations to fluctuate significantly in/uni00A0the short-term.\n\n## Disruptions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions may affect, and could have material adverse effects on, Aegon's businesses, profitability, liquidity and financial condition.\n\nAegon's profitability and financial condition may be materially affected by uncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in general economic conditions, such as economic growth, levels of unemployment, consumer confidence, inflation and interest rate levels in the countries in which Aegon operates. The COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets.\n\nAny disruptions or downturns in the global financial markets or general economic conditions may result in reduced demand for Aegon's products as well as impairments and reductions in the value of the assets in Aegon's general account, separate account, and company pension schemes. Aegon may also experience a higher incidence of claims and unexpected policyholder behavior such as unfavorable changes in lapse rates. Aegon's policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums, which may impact Aegon's businesses, profitability, cash flows and financial condition, and Aegon cannot predict with any certainty if or when such actions may occur.\n\nGovernmental action in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere to address market disruptions and economic conditions may impact Aegon's businesses. Aegon cannot predict the effect that these or other government actions, including economic sanctions, as well as actions by the European Central Bank (ECB) or the US Federal Reserve may have on financial markets or on Aegon's businesses, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## Illiquidity of certain investment assets may prevent Aegon from selling investments at fair prices in a timely manner and Aegon's access to external financing sources may be constrained under certain circumstances.\n\nAegon must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term cash demands under normal circumstances, as well as in crisis situations. Liquidity risk is inherent in many of Aegon's businesses. Each asset purchased and liability (e.g. insurance products) sold has unique liquidity characteristics. Some liabilities can be surrendered, while some assets, such as privately placed loans, mortgage loans, real estate and limited partnership interests, are to some degree illiquid. In depressed markets, Aegon may be unable to sell or buy significant volumes of assets at quoted prices.\n\nAny security Aegon issues in significant volume may be issued at higher financing costs if funding conditions are impaired. The necessity to issue securities can be driven by a variety of factors; for instance, Aegon may need liquidity for operating expenses, debt servicing and the maintenance of capital levels of insurance subsidiaries. If these extreme conditions were to persist for an extended period of time, Aegon may need to sell assets substantially below the prices at which they are currently recorded to meet its insurance obligations.\n\nAegon makes use of bilateral and syndicated credit facilities to support liquidity requirements and meet payment obligations under adverse (market) conditions. An inability to access these credit facilities, for example due to non-compliance with conditions for borrowing or the default of a facility provider under stressed market circumstances, could have an adverse effect on Aegon's ability to meet liquidity needs and to comply with contractual and other requirements.\n\nAegon's derivatives transactions require Aegon to provide collateral against declines in the fair value of these contracts. Volatile financial markets may significantly increase requirements to provide collateral and adversely affect its liquidity position. Further, a downgrade of Aegon's credit ratings may also result in additional collateral requirements.\n\nDeclines in value and defaults in debt securities, private placements, mortgage loan portfolios and other instruments held in Aegon's general and separate accounts, or the failure of certain counterparties, may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the default by, or failure to meet contractual obligations of, issuers and counterparties. Aegon also considers credit risk to include spread risk, that is, a decline in the value of a bond due to a general widening of credit spreads. For general account products, Aegon typically bears the risk for investment performance equaling the return of principal and interest on fixed income instruments. Aegon is exposed to credit risk on its general account fixed-income portfolio (debt securities, mortgages, small and medium sized entities ('SME') and consumer loans and private placements), over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives and reinsurance contracts. In addition, financial institutions acting as a counterparty on derivatives may not fulfill their obligations. Default by issuers and counterparties on their financial obligations may be due to, among other things, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, market downturns or operational failures, and the collateral or security they provide may prove inadequate to cover their obligations at the time of the default. Losses in excess of predicted losses due to any such default or series of defaults by issuers or counterparties may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's profitability and financial condition.\n\nAdditionally, Aegon is indirectly exposed to credit risk on the investment portfolios underlying separate account liabilities. Changes to credit risk can decrease the value of fixed interest assets in the separate accounts. Reduced separate account values will decrease fee income and may accelerate DPAC amortization. In addition, certain separate account products sold in the United States and the Netherlands include guarantees that protect the policyholders against some or all of the downside risks in their separate account portfolios. Reconsideration of assumptions might also affect the DPAC amortization schedule. These factors may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's profitability and financial position.\n\nAegon's investment portfolio includes Dutch government bonds, US Treasury, agency and state bonds, other government-issued securities and corporate bonds. Especially in a weak economic environment Aegon may incur significant investment impairments due to defaults and overall declines in the capital markets. Defaults or other reductions in the value of these securities and loans may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## A decline in equity markets may adversely affect Aegon's profitability and shareholders' equity, sales of savings and investment products, and the value of assets under management.\n\nAegon and its customers run the risk that the market value of their equity investments can decline. Exposure to equity markets exists in both assets and liabilities. Asset exposure exists through direct equity investment where Aegon bears all or most of the volatility in returns and investment performance risk. Equity market exposure is also present in policyholders' accounts for insurance and investment contracts (such as variable annuities, unit-linked products, and mutual funds) where funds are invested in equities. Although most of the risk remains with the policyholder, guarantees within certain products may transfer some or all of this risk to Aegon. Lower investment returns also reduce the asset management and administration fee that Aegon earns on the asset balance in these products, and prolonged investment under-performance may cause existing customers to withdraw funds and potential customers not to grant investment mandates.\n\nSome of Aegon's insurance and investment contract businesses have minimum return or accumulation guarantees, which require Aegon to establish reserves to fund these future guaranteed benefits when equity market returns do not meet or exceed these guarantee levels. Aegon's reported results under EU-IFRS are also at risk if returns are not sufficient to allow amortization of DPAC, which may impact the reported net result as well as shareholders' equity. Volatile or poor market conditions may also significantly reduce the demand for some of Aegon's savings and investment products, which may lead to lower sales and reduced profitability.\n\n## A downturn in the real estate market may adversely impact valuations and cash flows.\n\nAegon's investment portfolio has a large exposure to the residential real estate market in the Netherlands through the residential mortgages sourced by Aegon and the AMVEST funds. Aegon also has exposure to the real estate market in the US through commercial mortgage loans. Risks for Aegon in the US and the Netherlands in the event of a downturn in the real estate market include lower returns or valuation losses on its mortgage portfolio, lower margins due to higher prepayment in the mortgage portfolio in the event of lower interest rates and increased payment defaults.\n\n## The default of a major financial market participant and systemic risk may disrupt the markets and affect Aegon.\n\nThe failure of a sufficiently large and influential financial market participant may disrupt securities markets or clearing and settlement systems in Aegon's markets. This may cause market declines or volatility. Such a failure may lead to a chain of defaults that may adversely affect Aegon and Aegon's contract counterparties. In addition, such a failure may impact future product sales as a potential result of reduced confidence in the insurance industry. The default of one or more large international financial institutions, which may result in disruption or termination of their cash, custodial and/or administrative services, may also have a material adverse impact on Aegon's ability to run effective treasury and asset management operations.\n\nEven the perceived lack of creditworthiness of a government or financial institution (or a default by any such entity) may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults. This risk is sometimes referred to as 'systemic risk' and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing members or futures commissions merchants, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges with which Aegon interacts on a daily basis and financial instruments of governments in which Aegon invests. Systemic risk could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's ability to raise new funds and on its business, financial condition, profitability, liquidity and/or prospects.\n\n## Reinsurers to which Aegon has ceded risk may fail to meet their obligations.\n\nAegon's insurance subsidiaries cede premiums to other insurers under various agreements that cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, on a co-insurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess basis. The purpose of these reinsurance agreements is to spread the risk and minimize the effect of losses. The amount of each risk retained depends on an evaluation of the specific risk, which is subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum limits based on the characteristics of coverage. Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse for the ceded amount in the event a covered claim is paid. However, Aegon's insurance subsidiaries remain liable to their policyholders for ceded insurance if any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed by it. A bankruptcy or insolvency or inability of any of Aegon's reinsurance counterparties to satisfy its obligations may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's financial condition and results of operations.",

        "page_content": "## A downgrade in Aegon's credit ratings may increase policy surrenders and withdrawals, adversely affect Aegon's relationships with distributors, and negatively affect Aegon's results of operations.\n\nClaims-paying ability and financial strength ratings are factors in establishing the competitive position of insurers. A rating downgrade (or a change in outlook indicating the potential for such a downgrade) of Aegon or any of its rated insurance subsidiaries may, among other things, materially increase the number of policy surrenders and withdrawals by policyholders of cash values from their policies. Aegon cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions Aegon may take in response to the actions of rating agencies. As with other companies in the financial services industry, Aegon's credit ratings may be downgraded at any time and without notice by any rating agency.\n\nWithdrawals by policyholders may require the sale of invested assets, including illiquid assets, at a price that may result in realized investment losses. These cash payments to policyholders would result in a decrease in total invested assets and a decrease in net result. Among other things, early withdrawals may also cause Aegon to accelerate amortization of DPAC, reducing net result.\n\nAegon has experienced downgrades and negative changes to its outlook in the past and may experience rating and outlook changes in the future. A downgrade or potential downgrade, including changes in outlook, may result in higher funding costs on future longterm debt funding transactions and/or affect the availability of funding in the capital markets and lead to increased fees on credit facilities. In addition, a downgrade may adversely affect relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of Aegon's products and services, which may negatively impact new sales and adversely affect Aegon's ability to compete. A downgrade of Aegon's credit ratings may also affect its ability to obtain reinsurance contracts at reasonable prices or at all.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect Aegon's financial condition and reported results of operations.\n\nAs an international group, Aegon is subject to foreign currency translation risk. Foreign currency exposure also exists when policies are denominated in currencies other than Aegon's functional currency. Currency risk in the investment portfolios backing insurance and investment liabilities is managed using asset liability matching principles. Assets allocated to equity are kept in local currencies to the extent shareholders' equity is required to satisfy regulatory and Aegon's self-imposed capital requirements. Therefore, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect the level of Aegon's consolidated shareholders' equity as a result of translation of the equity of Aegon's subsidiaries into euro, Aegon's reporting currency. Aegon holds the remainder of its capital base (capital securities, subordinated and senior debt) in various currencies in amounts that are targeted to correspond to the book value of Aegon's business units. This balancing is intended to mitigate currency translation impacts on equity and leverage ratios. Aegon may also hedge proceeds from divestments or the foreign exchange component of expected dividends from its principal business units that maintain their equity in currencies other than the euro.\n\nTo the extent the foreign exchange component of proceeds from divestments or the expected dividends is not hedged, or actual dividends vary from expected, Aegon's net result and shareholders' equity may fluctuate. As Aegon has significant business segments in the Americas and in the United Kingdom, the principal sources of exposure from currency fluctuations are from the differences between the US dollar and the euro and between the UK pound and the euro. Aegon may experience significant changes in net result and shareholders' equity because of these fluctuations.\n\n## Aegon may be unable to manage asset liability management risks successfully through derivatives.\n\nAegon is exposed to changes in the fair value of its investments, as a result of the impact of interest rate, equity markets and credit spread changes, currency fluctuations and changes in mortality and longevity. Aegon uses common financial derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forward contracts, to hedge some of the exposures related to both investments backing insurance products and Company borrowings. Aegon may not be able to manage these asset liability management risks associated with these activities successfully through the use of derivatives. In addition, a counterparty may fail to honor the terms of its derivatives contracts with Aegon. Clearing members and clearing houses may terminate their derivatives contracts with Aegon. Aegon's inability to manage risks successfully through derivatives, a counterparty's failure to honor Aegon's obligations or a systemic risk that is transmitted from counterparty to counterparty may each have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, net result and financial condition.\n\n## Valuation of Aegon's investments, allowances and impairments is subjective, and discrepant valuations may adversely affect Aegon's net result and financial condition.\n\nThe valuation of many of Aegon's financial instruments is based on methodologies, estimations, and assumptions that are subject to different interpretations. Changes to investment valuations may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's net result and financial",

In addition, the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments taken on certain investments and other assets is subjective and based on assumptions, estimations and judgments that may not reflect or correspond to Aegon's actual experience, any of which may materially impact Aegon's net result or financial condition.\n\n## Higher inflation may adversely affect Aegon's business plans and strategy and the profitability of its business.\n\nInflation has increased in the major economies driven by many factors, such as supply chain disruption, energy and commodity costs. Central banks and governments are assessing whether inflation increases are transitionary or lasting and recently started to consider raising interest rates and other monetary policies to combat inflation./uni00A0\n\nA high inflation environment can adversely affect Aegon directly through higher claims and higher expenses or through broader macroeconomic impacts that are associated with high inflation, such as higher interest rates and a correction to the market value of assets.\n\nCertain products Aegon offers have a direct or very strong link to inflation, most notably index linked pension products. Other products have a high correlation to inflation over the longer term, such as long term care products. It is Aegon's practice to hedge the indexation of pension products but it is not possible to hedge the inflation associated with long term care products as no instrument exists to match this risk. Rather Aegon mitigate this risk by close management of claims costs and benefits in the US.\n\nOperating expenses have a strong correlation with inflation (wage and price inflation)./uni00A0An increase in observed inflation may lead to increased expenses and a lower earnings if Aegon is unable to offset the expense of inflation through expense savings initiatives.\n\nHigher inflation may have broader economic impacts on asset valuations and economic activity, which will adversely impact Aegon's business plans and strategy and its profitability.\n\n## Underwriting risks\n\nAegon's reported results of operations and financial condition may be affected by differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserve assumptions both due to incurred gains/losses and from potential changes in best estimate assumptions that are used to value insurance liabilities.\n\nThere is a risk that the pricing of Aegon's products turns out to be inadequate if the assumptions used for pricing do not materialize. Aegon's earnings depend significantly on the extent to which actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions used in setting the prices for Aegon's products and the extent to which the established technical provisions for insurance liabilities, both under IFRS and Solvency II reporting, prove to be sufficient. If actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying assumptions used in establishing such liabilities, Aegon's net income would be reduced. Furthermore, if less favorable claims experience became sustained, Aegon may be required to change its best estimate assumptions with respect to future experience, potentially increasing the technical provisions for insurance liabilities, which may reduce Aegon's net income and solvency ratio. In addition, certain acquisition costs related to the sale of new policies and the purchase of policies already in force have been recorded as assets on the balance sheet and are being amortized into net income over time. If the assumptions relating to the future profitability of these policies (such as future claims, investment net income and expenses) are not realized, the amortization of these costs may be accelerated and may require write-offs should there be an expectation that the costs are not fully recoverable. This may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSources of underwriting risk include policyholder behavior (such as lapses or surrender of policies), policy claims (such as mortality and morbidity) and expenses. For some product lines, Aegon is at risk if policy lapses increase, as sometimes Aegon is unable to fully recover up-front sales expenses despite the presence of commission recoveries or surrender charges and fees. In addition, some policies have embedded options which at times are more valuable to the client if they stay (lower lapses) or leave (higher lapses), which may result in losses to Aegon's businesses. Aegon sells certain types of policies that are at risk if mortality or morbidity increases, such as term life insurance and accident insurance. Aegon also sells certain other types of policies, such as annuity products, that are at risk if mortality decreases (longevity risk). For example, certain current annuity products, as well as products sold in previous years, have seen their profitability deteriorate as longevity assumptions have been revised upward. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains possible for the trend toward increased longevity to return, such that Aegon's annuity products may continue to experience adverse effects due to longer expected benefit payment periods. Aegon is also at risk if expenses are higher than assumed.",

These guarantees are designed, among other things, to protect policyholders against downturns in equity markets and interest rates. The value of the guarantees depends on market prices of such products. Failure to re-price the products following a fall in interest rates or a move into more volatile markets could result in Aegon writing business at a loss and potentially writing higher volumes of loss making business if competitors re-price their products. Alternatively, if competitors re-price their products on aggressive pricing terms, then Aegon may be pressured to re-price with less favorable terms than it is willing to take without the pressure.\n\n## Restrictions on underwriting criteria and the use of data may adversely impact Aegon's results of operations.\n\nSome jurisdictions impose restrictions on particular underwriting criteria, such as gender or race, or use of genetic test results, for determination of premiums and benefits of insurance products./uni00A0Such restrictions, now or in the future, could adversely impact Aegon's results/uni00A0of/uni00A0operations if it is unable to take into consideration all factors that potentially bear correlation with risk. Further developments in underwriting, such as automation and use of additional types and sources of data, may also be affected by future regulatory developments regarding privacy and other restrictions with respect to the use of personal data.\n\n## Aegon's products may not achieve expected returns and Aegon may be confronted with litigation and negative publicity.\n\nAegon may face lawsuits from customers and experience negative publicity if Aegon's products fail to perform as expected, regardless of the suitability of products for customers or the adequacy of the disclosure provided to customers by Aegon and by the intermediaries who distribute Aegon's products. Products that are less well understood and that have a lower performance track record may be more likely to be the subject of such lawsuits. Any such lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations, corporate reputation, and financial condition.\n\n## Reinsurance may not be available, affordable, or adequate to protect Aegon against losses.\n\nAs part of Aegon's overall risk and capital management strategy, Aegon purchases reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by Aegon's various business segments. Market conditions beyond Aegon's control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection Aegon purchases. In addition, interpretations of terms and conditions may differ over time from anticipated coverage as contracts extend for decades, which may lead to denials of coverage and potentially protracted litigation, which may lead to Aegon incurring losses.\n\n## Catastrophic events, which are unpredictable by nature, may result in material losses and abruptly and significantly interrupt Aegon's business activities.\n\nAegon's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by volatile natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, terrorism, cyber-crime, riots, wars, fires and explosions, pandemics, and other catastrophes. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposure. Aegon is also exposed to the risk of epidemics or pandemics occurring in one or more of the countries in which Aegon operates or globally. For instance, Aegon can be impacted through higher mortality rates in the countries in which it operates and through lower sales and higher lapses on its/uni00A0products due to limitations on customer interactions, pressure on customer income and increased uncertainty. Such events may lead to considerable financial losses to Aegon's businesses. These catastrophic events may also lead to adverse market movements which increase the adverse impacts to Aegon's financial position. For instance, prices and credit quality of investments can be impacted. In/uni00A0addition, monetary policy measures from central banks can result in fluctuations in interest rates. Furthermore, natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, civil unrest, military actions, acts of war and fires may disrupt Aegon's operations and result in significant loss of",

If its business continuity plans have not included effective and sufficient contingencies for such events, Aegon may also experience business disruption and damage to corporate reputation and financial condition for a substantial period of time.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Competitive factors may adversely affect Aegon's market share and profitability.\n\nCompetition in Aegon's business segments is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength, claims paying ability, ratings, and name recognition. Aegon faces intense competition from a large number of other insurers, as well as noninsurance financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual customers, employers, other group customers, agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Consolidation in the global financial services industry can enhance the competitive position of some of Aegon's competitors by broadening the range of their products and services and increasing their distribution channels and their access to capital. New competitors backed by private equity investors may lead to further pressure on Aegon's margins. In addition, development of alternative distribution channels for certain types of insurance and securities products, including use of digital technologies and platforms, may result in increasing competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. Traditional distribution channels are also challenged by a ban on sales-based commissions in some countries. These competitive factors may result in increased pricing pressures on Aegon's products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share. This may harm Aegon's ability to maintain or increase profitability.\n\nAdverse market and economic conditions can be expected to result in changes to the competitive landscape. Financial distress experienced by financial services industry participants as a result of weak economic conditions and newly imposed regulations may lead to acquisition opportunities. Additionally, the competitive landscape in which Aegon operates may be affected by governmentsponsored programs or actions taken in response to, for instance, dislocations in financial markets. Aegon's ability or that of Aegon's competitors to pursue such opportunities may be limited due to lower earnings, reserve increases, capital requirements or a lack of access to debt capital markets and other sources of financing. Such conditions may also lead to changes by Aegon or Aegon's competitors in product offerings and product pricing that may affect Aegon and Aegon's relative sales volumes, market shares and profitability.\n\n## Aegon may have difficulty managing its expanding operations, and Aegon may not be successful in acquiring new businesses or divesting existing operations.\n\nOver time, Aegon has made a number of acquisitions and divestments around the world and it is possible that Aegon may make further acquisitions and divestments in the future. Acquisitions and divestments involve risks that may adversely affect Aegon's results of operations and financial condition. These include: the potential diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; difficulties in assimilating or disentangling operations, technologies, products and personnel; significant delays in completing the integration or disentangling of operations; the potential loss of key employees or customers; and potential losses from unanticipated litigation and tax and accounting issues. In addition, expansion into new and emerging markets may involve heightened political, legal and regulatory risks, such as discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls.\n\nAegon's acquisitions may result in additional indebtedness, costs, contingent liabilities, and impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Acquisitions may also have a dilutive effect on the ownership and voting percentages of existing shareholders if shares are used as consideration. Divestments of existing operations may result in Aegon assuming or retaining certain contingent liabilities. Aegon may not be able to divest assets within the time or at the price planned. All of these factors may adversely affect Aegon's businesses, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that Aegon will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or buyers for operations to be divested or that Aegon will properly value acquisitions or divestments. Aegon is unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate or buyer for operations to be divested will become available, or the likelihood that any transaction will be completed once negotiations have commenced.\n\n## Aegon may experience difficulties in distributing and marketing products through its current and future distribution channels.\n\nAlthough Aegon distributes its products through a wide variety of distribution channels, Aegon's ability to market its products could be affected if key relationships are interrupted. Distributors may elect to reduce or terminate their distribution relationship with Aegon due to adverse developments in its (or their) business. Further, key distribution partners may also merge or change their business models in ways that affect how Aegon's products are sold, or new distribution channels could emerge and adversely impact the effectiveness of its current distribution efforts.",

        "page_content": "When Aegon's products are distributed through unaffiliated firms, Aegon may not always be able to monitor or control the manner of their distribution despite its significant compliance training and programs. If Aegon's products are distributed by such firms in an inappropriate manner, or to customers for whom they are unsuitable, Aegon may suffer reputational and other harm to its business.\n\n## Aegon may be unable to adapt to and apply new technologies.\n\nNew technologies are transforming the insurance industry. New technologies include but are not limited to communication channels, automation, artificial intelligence, additional processing platforms and cloud services, data analytics and distributed ledger technology. These technologies are changing the way insurance is distributed and sold. They are also changing the way insurers manage their businesses and the skills they need in their workforces. Furthermore, the new technologies are influencing customer and consumer demands. Technology makes it easier to move into new markets. This increases competition, not just among peers, but also from new competitors and disruptors. An inability to adapt and apply these technologies quickly, and in a controlled manner may impact Aegon's competitive position, and its ability to maintain profitability, and may adversely affect Aegon's future financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Failure of data management and governance can result in regulatory and reputational risk as well as missed business opportunities.\n\nData is essential for Aegon's operational performance. However, much of the data held by Aegon is subject to various legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions. To be able to benefit from the data that Aegon holds, areas like data management and governance are of key importance. Most internal processes and customer interactions are dependent on accessible, reliable, and compliant data practices and operations. If Aegon fails to adequately execute on these obligations, it faces potential legal, regulatory, contractual and reputational risks. Aegon also must endeavor to obtain adequate data rights to be able to execute its business strategy. Failure to do so will expose it to additional legal risks, including litigation risks./uni00A0\n\n## Aegon may be impacted by epidemics or pandemics.\n\nAegon is exposed to the risk of an epidemic or a pandemic - such as Asian flu, SARs or COVID-19 - occurring in one or more of the countries in which it operates or globally. Aegon's daily activities may be adversely impacted in addition to the financial and underwriting consequences of higher mortality and economic hardship, as previously mentioned. If the health of a significant number of employees or key functions is compromised or internal controls need to be executed in an atypical way, these could have an impact on core business processes, service levels to customers, and the effectiveness of the control environment. In addition, Aegon faces additional operational risks related to prolonged and expanded working from home/remote working by Aegon's workforce, such as additional remote access to company information which could increase information security risk. Also, Aegon can be impacted via its relationships with third parties. These third parties can also be impacted by an epidemic or pandemic with consequential impacts on Aegon such as disruption in service. The described risks may directly or indirectly impact Aegon's financial health and its ability to generate capital in the medium to long term.\n\n## Aegon may not be successful in managing its exposure to climate risk and adequately adapting investment portfolios for the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nClimate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope and severity of potential impacts. Climate risks can be grouped into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks relate to losses from overall climate changes (i.e. changing weather patterns and sea level rise) and acute climate events (i.e. extreme weather and natural disasters). These physical risks impact property & casualty (P&C) insurance, but also life insurance, for instance through higher-than-expected mortality rates. Losses can also follow from credit risk and collateral linked to Aegon's mortgage portfolio. Aegon is exposed to mortality risk and mortgage underwriting risks. Beyond insured losses, climate change may have disrupting and cascading effects on the wider economy and may lead to adverse market movements - prices and credit quality of investments and defaults on investments - and monetary policy measures resulting in lower interest rates.\n\nTransition risks are those arising from the shift to a low-carbon economy. These risks are a function of policy and regulatory uncertainty, including political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Transition risks can affect the value of assets and investment portfolios. Furthermore, Aegon may be unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. Linked to both the physical and the transition risks, there could also be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks.

Nevertheless, it is possible that risks present in its business strategies and initiatives are not fully identified, monitored, and managed or that risks are not properly measured. Risk measurements make use of historic and public data that may be inaccurate or may not predict future exposures. As a result, Aegon's businesses, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\n## Failure of Aegon's information technology or communications systems may result in a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, financial condition and corporate reputation.\n\nAny failure of or gap in the systems and processes necessary to support complex transactions and avoid and/or detect systems failure, fraud, information security failures, processing errors, cyber intrusion, loss of data and breaches of regulation may lead to a material adverse effect on Aegon's results of operations and corporate reputation. In addition, Aegon must commit significant resources to maintain and enhance its existing systems in order to keep pace with applicable regulatory requirements, industry standards and customer preferences. If Aegon fails to maintain secure and well-functioning information systems, Aegon may not be able to rely on data for product pricing, compliance obligations, risk management and underwriting decisions. In addition, Aegon cannot assure investors or consumers that interruptions, failures or breaches in security of these processes and systems will not occur, or that if they do occur, that they can be timely detected and remediated. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, financial condition and corporate reputation.\n\n## A computer system failure or security breach of Aegon's IT systems or that of critical third parties/uni00A0may disrupt Aegon's business, damage Aegon's reputation and adversely affect Aegon's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n\nAegon relies heavily on computer and information systems and internet and network connectivity (collectively, 'IT systems')/uni00A0to conduct a large portion of its business operations. This includes the need to securely store, process, transmit and dispose of confidential information, including personal information, through a number of complex systems. In many cases this also includes transmission and processing to or through customers, business partners, (semi-) governmental agencies and third-party service providers. The introduction of new technologies, computer system failures, cyber-crime attacks or security or data privacy breaches may material disrupt Aegon's business operations, damage Aegon's reputation, result in regulatory and litigation exposure, investigation and remediation costs, and materially and adversely affect Aegon's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nThe information security risk that Aegon faces includes the risk of malicious outside forces using public networks and other methods, including social engineering and the exploitation of targeted offline processes, to attack Aegon's systems and information and potentially demand ransom. It also includes inside threats, both malicious and accidental. For example, human error, bugs and vulnerabilities that may exist in Aegon's systems or software,/uni00A0unauthorized user activity and lack of sufficiently automated processing or sufficient logging and monitoring can result in improper information exposure or failure or delayed detection of such activity in a timely manner. Aegon also faces risk in this area due to its reliance in many cases on third-party systems, all of which may face cyber and information security risks of their own. Third-party administrators or distribution partners used by Aegon or its subsidiaries may not adequately secure their own IT systems or may not adequately keep pace with the dynamic changes in this area. Potential bad actors that target Aegon and applicable third parties may include, but are not limited to, criminal organizations, foreign government bodies, political factions, and others.\n\nIn recent years, information security risk has increased sharply due to a number of developments in how information systems are used, not only by companies such as Aegon, but also by society in general. Threats have increased in frequency and magnitude, and are expected to continue to increase,/uni00A0as criminals and other bad actors become more organized and employ more sophisticated techniques. At the same time companies increasingly make information systems and data available through the internet, mobile devices or other network connections to customers, employees and business partners, thereby expanding the attack surface that bad actors can potentially exploit. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Aegon also faces increased cybersecurity risks due to the number of Aegon's",

The/uni00A0White House, SEC and other regulators have also increased their focus on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\n\nLarge, global financial institutions such as and including Aegon have been, and will continue to be, subject to information security attacks for the foreseeable future. The nature of these attacks will also continue to be unpredictable, and in many cases may arise from circumstances that are beyond Aegon's control. Attackers are also increasingly using tools and techniques that are specifically designed to circumvent controls, to evade detection and even to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. As a result, Aegon may be unable to timely or effectively detect, identify, contain, investigate or remediate IT systems in response to, future cyberattacks or security breaches. Especially if and to the extent Aegon fails to adequately invest in defensive infrastructure, timely response capabilities, technology, controls and processes or to effectively execute against its information security strategy, it may suffer material adverse consequences.\n\nTo date the highest impact information security incidents that Aegon has experienced are believed to have been the result of e-mail phishing attacks targeted at Aegon's business partners and customers. This in turn led to the unauthorized use of valid Aegon website credentials to engage in fraudulent transactions and improper data exfiltration. Additionally, Aegon has faced other types of attacks, including, but not limited to, other types of phishing attacks, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, technology implementation and update errors, various human errors, e-mail related errors, paper-based errors, exploitations of vulnerabilities and/uni00A0certain limited cases of unauthorized internal user activity, including activity between different Aegon country units. Like many other companies, Aegon could also be subject to malware, ransomware and similar types of attacks or intrusions. There is no guarantee that the measures that Aegon takes will be sufficient to stop all types of attacks or mitigate all types of information security or data privacy risks.\n\nAegon maintains cyber liability insurance to help decrease the financial impact of cyber-attacks and information security events, subject to the terms and conditions of the policy; however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all applicable losses that Aegon may suffer.\n\n## A breach of data privacy or security obligations may disrupt Aegon's business, damage Aegon's reputation and adversely affect financial conditions and results of operations.\n\nPursuant to applicable laws, various government and semi-governmental and other administrative bodies have established numerous rules protecting the privacy and security of personal information and other confidential or sensitive information held by Aegon. Notably, certain of Aegon's businesses are subject to laws and regulations enacted by US federal and state governments, the EU or other non-US/EU jurisdictions and/or enacted by various regulatory organizations relating to the privacy and/or information security of the information of customers, employees or others. Aegon's European operations are mainly subjected to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In addition, in several Asian and Latin American jurisdictions where Aegon has activities, new privacy and information security laws and regulations have been enacted or existing legislation has been strengthened and updated.\n\nIn the United States, the New York Department of Finance Services (NYDFS), pursuant to its cybersecurity regulation, requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including certain Aegon subsidiaries, to, among other things, satisfy an extensive set of minimum information security requirements, including but not limited to governance, management, reporting, policy, technology and control requirements. Other states have adopted similar cybersecurity laws and regulations.\n\nNumerous other US state and federal laws also impose various information security and privacy related obligations with respect to various Aegon subsidiaries operating in the US, including but not limited to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related state laws and implementing regulations (GLBA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), among many others./uni00A0These laws generally provide for governmental investigative and enforcement authority, and in certain cases provide for private rights of action.\n\nNumerous other legislators and regulators with jurisdiction over Aegon's businesses are considering or have already enacted enhanced information security risk management and privacy laws and regulations, with the overall number and scope of such laws and regulations continuing to increase every year. A number of Aegon's subsidiaries are also subject to contractual restrictions with respect to the use and handling of the sensitive information of Aegon's clients and business partners.\n\nAegon, and numerous of its systems, employees, third-party providers and business partners have access to, and routinely process, the personal information of consumers and employees. Aegon relies on a large number of processes and controls to protect",

It is possible that an Aegon or a third party's employee, contractor, business partner or system could, intentionally or unintentionally, inappropriately disclose or misuse personal or confidential information. Aegon's data or data in its possession could also be the subject of an unauthorized information security attack. If Aegon fails to maintain adequate processes and controls or if Aegon or its business partners fail to comply with relevant laws and regulations, policies and procedures, misappropriation or intentional or unintentional inappropriate disclosure or misuse of personal information or other confidential information could occur. Such control inadequacies or non-compliance could cause disrupted operations and misstated or unreliable financial data, materially damage Aegon's reputation or lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or civil or criminal penalties or (class action) litigation, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, Aegon analyzes personal information and customer data to better manage its business, subject to applicable laws and regulations and other restrictions. It is possible that additional regulatory or other restrictions regarding the use of such information may be imposed. Additional privacy and information security obligations have been imposed by various governments with jurisdiction over Aegon or its subsidiaries in recent years, and more similar obligations are likely to be imposed in the near future across Aegon's operations. Such restrictions and obligations could have material impacts on Aegon's business, financial conditions and results of operations.\n\nInaccuracies in econometric, financial, or actuarial models, or differing interpretations of underlying methodologies, assumptions and estimates, could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAegon uses econometric, financial, and actuarial models to measure and manage multiple types of risk, to price products and to establish and assess key valuations and report financial results. All these functions are critical to Aegon's operations. Aegon has a model risk management framework in place to manage modelling risk. If, despite this framework, models, their underlying methodologies, assumptions and estimates, or their implementation and monitoring prove to be inaccurate, this could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMany of Aegon's business units offer investment products that utilize quantitative models, algorithms or calculations that could experience errors or prove to be incorrect, incomplete or unsuccessful, resulting in losses for clients who have invested in such products and possible regulatory actions and/or litigation against Aegon and/or its affiliates.\n\nAegon's business units may utilize quantitative models, algorithms or calculations (whether proprietary or supplied by third parties) (Models) or information, or data supplied by third parties (Data) for the management of, or to assist in the management of, investment products offered to clients. Examples of such investment products include volatility-controlled funds, mutual funds, separately managed accounts, and other types of advisory accounts. Models and Data are used to construct sets of transactions and investments, to provide risk management insights, and may be used to assist in hedging investments. If Models and Data prove to be incorrect or incomplete, any decisions made, in whole or part, in reliance thereon expose the investment product to additional risks. For example, by utilizing Models or Data, certain investments may be bought at prices that are too high, certain other investments may be sold at prices that are too low, or favorable opportunities may be missed altogether./uni00A0Similarly, any hedging based on faulty Models and Data may prove to be unsuccessful. The applicable investment product bears the risk that Models or Data used will not be successful and the product may not achieve its investment objective.\n\nModels can be predictive in nature. The use of predictive Models has inherent risks. For example, such Models may incorrectly forecast future behavior, leading to potential losses on a cash flow and/or a mark-to-market basis. In addition, in unforeseen or certain low-probability scenarios (often involving a market disruption of some kind), such Models may produce unexpected results, which can result in losses for an investment product./uni00A0Furthermore, the success of relying on or otherwise using Models depends on a number of factors, including the validity, accuracy and completeness of the Model's development, implementation and maintenance, the Model's assumptions, factors, algorithms and methodologies, and the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical or other Data./uni00A0\n\nModels rely on, among other things, correct and complete Data inputs. If incorrect Data is entered into even a well-founded Model, the resulting information will be incorrect. However, even if Data is input correctly, Model prices may differ substantially from market prices, especially for securities with complex characteristics. Investments selected with the use of Models may perform differently than expected as a result of the design of the Model, inputs into the Model or other factors./uni00A0",

        "page_content": "Additionally, if investment products offered by Aegon's affiliates experience Model errors or use erroneous Data, this could result in regulatory actions and/or litigation brought against Aegon and/or its affiliates.\n\nIssues with third party providers (outsourcing partners and suppliers), including events such as bankruptcy, disruption of services, or standards of service level agreements not upheld may adversely impact Aegon's operational effectiveness and financial condition.\n\nAs Aegon continues to focus on reducing expenses necessary to support its business, a key part of its operating strategy has been to outsource certain services that are important to its business. Aegon outsources certain information technology, finance and actuarial services, investment management services and policy administration operations to third party providers and may do so increasingly in the future. If Aegon fails to maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or if third party providers do not provide the core administrative, operational, financial, and actuarial services Aegon requires and anticipates, or perform as contracted, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffer an information security or data privacy breach, Aegon may not realize the desired productivity improvements or cost efficiencies or customers might experience lower service levels. In addition, Aegon may not be able to find an adequate alternative provider, and instead experience financial loss, reputational harm, operational difficulties, increased costs, a loss of business and other negative consequences, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's financial condition. In addition, Aegon's reliance on third party providers does not relieve Aegon of its responsibilities and requirements. Any failure or negligence by such third-party providers in carrying out their contractual duties may result in Aegon being subjected to liability and litigation. Any litigation relating to such matters could be costly and time-consuming, and the outcome would be uncertain. Moreover, any adverse publicity arising from such litigation, even if the litigation is not successful, could adversely affect Aegon's reputation and distribution of its products. Finally, Aegon's ability to receive services from third party providers based in different countries might be impacted by political instability, cultural differences, regulatory requirements or policies inside or outside of the countries within which Aegon has operations. As a result, Aegon's ability to conduct its business might be adversely affected.\n\n## Aegon may be unable to attract and retain personnel who are key to the business.\n\nAs a global financial services enterprise, Aegon relies, to a considerable extent, on the quality of local management and personnel in the various countries in which Aegon operates. The success of Aegon's operations is dependent, among other things, on Aegon's ability to attract and retain highly qualified professional personnel. The right talent for critical positions and availability of required capabilities determines Aegon's ability to deliver on its strategic objectives. Competition for key personnel in most countries in which Aegon operates is intense. Aegon competes for talent in areas such as digital, information technology, with companies in the consumer products, technology, financial sectors./uni00A0Aegon's success attracting and retaining key personnel is very much dependent on the competitiveness of the compensation and benefits package and flexibility for employees in the market in which it competes and the work environment it offers.\n\nAs a part of the governmental response in Europe and, to a certain extent, the United States to the financial crisis in 2008, there have been various legislative initiatives that have sought to give guidance or regulate the structure of remuneration for personnel, in particular senior management, with a focus on performance-related remuneration and limiting severance payments. With differences in interpretation of these regulations by local regulators on how the guidelines need to be applied these restrictions create an uncertain playing field and may adversely affect Aegon's ability to compete for qualified employees, as well as Aegon's ability to transfer employees between regions.\n\n## Political, Regulatory and Supervisory\n\nAegon may be required to increase its technical provisions and/or hold higher amounts of regulatory capital as a result of changes in the regulatory environment or changes in rating agency analysis, which may impact Aegon's financial condition and/or decrease Aegon's returns on its products.\n\nPrudential regulatory requirements such as with respect to the calculation of technical provisions, capital requirements, the eligibility of own funds and the regulatory treatment of investments may change, which could require Aegon to increase technical provisions, hold higher amounts of regulatory capital and subject it to more stringent requirements with respect to investments and/or own funds. Important examples include changes to applicable capital requirements by the European Union and/or the interpretation thereof by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority ('EIOPA'), the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ('NAIC') in the US or US state regulators or local regulators in jurisdictions in which Aegon operates. Aegon cannot predict specific proposals that might be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws may have on its businesses, results of operations, or financial condition.",

        "page_content": "Prudential regulatory requirements may not only apply to the individual entities in the Aegon Group but may additionally apply at Group level or apply to part of the Group. Consequently, those requirements may have different, and more or less impact depending on their scope. Important examples of such requirements are Solvency II group supervision and consolidated requirements resulting from the Capital Requirements Directive ('CRD') and the Capital Requirements Regulation ('CRR'), as applied to groups containing bank and/ or asset management activities.\n\nThe way such requirements are applied to groups like Aegon has an impact on the Group's capital position, as well as on the availability of capital at a Group level. Changes to prudential regulatory requirements may have an impact on Aegon's competitive position versus companies that are not subject to these or similar requirements at Group level. As an example, as part of the Solvency II group calculation, Aegon applies a specific methodology for its US insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries at Group level, in addition to the requirements to which these subsidiaries are subject under their local prudential regime. This methodology is approved by Aegon's group supervisor, De Nederlandsche Bank N.V. ('DNB'), but remains subject to periodic review. Changes to this methodology might have an impact on Aegon's capital position, as calculated under Solvency II group requirements and/or the manner in which DNB otherwise exercises group supervision on Aegon, for example through more stringent requirements with respect to intra-group transactions, risk concentrations and reporting.\n\nThere are several important regulatory standards with respect to capital adequacy that apply to Aegon and are subject to change, which changes could impact Aegon's financial condition and results and operations:\n\n- \u00b7 The/uni00A0European Commission has recently published a formal legislative proposal for amendments to the Solvency II Directive following an extensive technical advice by EIOPA to the European Commission. Proposals to amend the Solvency II Delegated Regulation, amend existing or introduce additional technical standards and/or EIOPA guidelines may follow in a later stage. The impact on Aegon's financial position and results depends on the final form of the requirements, standards and guidelines;\n- \u00b7 Following/uni00A0the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020, UK insurers are no longer directly subject to regulation under the EU's Solvency II. The UK government launched a review into the European Union's Solvency II framework in October 2020 which has resulted in divergence between the UK and EU regulatory regimes in 2021. Increasing divergence cannot be ruled out going forward which could further impact the UK capital ratio;\n- \u00b7 In/uni00A0the US, the NAIC periodically updates various prudential requirements. The NAIC is currently updating the risk-based capital ('RBC') charges for mortality risk and is embarking on a project to reconsider the RBC treatment of structured investments. These initiatives or other regulatory changes to capital factors may lead to higher risk-based capital requirements. In addition, the NAIC has constructed a US group capital calculation ('GCC') using an RBC aggregation approach that would be used by regulators as a monitoring tool. The results of the GCC could impact the translation of RBC in the Group capital ratio for the United States; and\n- \u00b7 Aegon/uni00A0utilizes affiliated captive insurance companies to manage risks of various insurance policies issued before the adoption of principle-based reserves, including universal life with secondary guarantees and level term life insurance. These structures have been utilized to finance regulatory reserves. To the extent that state insurance regulations restrict or require insurers to restate the valuation of the assets used to finance these structures, this could increase costs or reduce available capital.\n\nIn addition to requirements imposed by regulatory and/or supervisory authorities, rating agencies may incorporate higher capital thresholds into their quantitative analyses, thus requiring additional capital for Aegon Group and/or its regulated subsidiaries to maintain their desired credit ratings.\n\nThe application of these capital standards and changes thereto could adversely affect Aegon's ability to compete with other insurers that are not subject to those capital requirements. These requirements may also lead Aegon to engage in transactions that affect capital and constrain Aegon's ability to pay dividends or repurchase its own shares. Furthermore, such requirements may constrain Aegon's ability to provide guarantees and may increase the cost to Aegon of offering certain products, resulting in price increases, discontinuance of offering of certain products or reducing the amount of risk Aegon takes on. Aegon may consider structural and other business alternatives in light of requirements or standards applicable with respect to systemic entities or activities, of which the impact on shareholders cannot be predicted. For further detail on developments in these areas, reference is made to the section 'Regulation and supervision' of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report 2021.\n\n## Political or other instability in a country or geographic region, could adversely affect Aegon's international business activities and it's financial condition.\n\nPolitical developments such as, foreign investment restrictions, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions, or military action, and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, and global supply chains could have an adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in many ways, including disruption to our business",

Any future changes in these accounting standards may have a significant impact on Aegon's reported results of operations, financial condition, shareholders' equity and dividend. This includes the level and volatility of reported results of operations and shareholders' equity. New accounting standards that are likely to have a significant impact on Aegon's reported results, financial condition and shareholders' equity include, but are not limited to, IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments and IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts.\n\nThe IASB issued the complete version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in July 2014, which was endorsed by the European Union in November 2016. The IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts in May 2017/uni00A0and issued amendments to the standard in June 2020. Both IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 were endorsed by the European Union, except that the endorsement of IFRS 17 included an optional carveout regarding the grouping of policies for certain contracts. For Aegon, both standards will apply across the group for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023./uni00A0\n\nAn implementation project was started soon after the publication of the new accounting standards. It is expected that the impact of the initial application on Aegon's financial statements will be significant.\n\n## Local statutes, regulators, and decisions of supervisory and other authorities may limit the ability of Aegon's subsidiaries to pay dividends to Aegon N.V., thereby limiting Aegon's ability to make payments on debt obligations and operating expenses.\n\nAegon's ability to make payments on debt obligations and pay operating expenses is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from subsidiaries, in particular, but not limited to, the operating companies in the US, the Netherlands, and the UK. Most of these subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions that can limit the payment of dividends. In addition, local regulators in the countries where Aegon operates, supervisory and other authorities (such as EIOPA or the European Systemic Risk Board) may decide to impose or advise on further restrictions to dividend payments, or discourage such payments, specifically in exceptional and unpredictable economic circumstances. This may affect Aegon's ability to satisfy its debt obligations or pay its operating expenses.\n\n## Risks of application of intervention measures may adversely affect Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Dutch Act on Recovery & Resolution for Insurers ('R&R Act') allows DNB to intervene in situations where a Dutch insurer or reinsurer is faced with financial difficulties. The powers under the R&R Act may also extend to the level of the Group and to entities, in addition to insurance or reinsurance entities in the Netherlands, which are part of the Group, such as Aegon N.V.\n\nIn addition, the R&R Act allows DNB to require a Dutch insurance or reinsurance company or a group to remove, ex ante, material impediments to effective resolution of a Dutch insurance or reinsurance undertaking (such as the revision of financing arrangements, the reduction of exposures, the transfer of assets, the termination or limitation of business activities, or the prohibition on starting certain business activities, changing the legal or operational structure of the Group, or securing certain critical business lines). The use of this tool may adversely affect Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn September 2021, the European Commission published a formal proposal for a European Insurance Recovery & Resolution Directive, which will introduce minimum standards at European level for recovery & resolution frameworks in EU member states, such as the Dutch R&R Act. This might lead to the introduction of intervention tools, largely similar to those included in the R&R Act, in other EU member states in which Aegon's subsidiaries are active.\n\nFurthermore, to parts of the Aegon Group, in particular Aegon Bank N.V., the framework of the EU Directive on the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive') is applicable. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive contains provisions that where both Aegon Bank N.V. and Aegon N.V. fail or are likely to fail, could be applied to mixed financial holding companies such as Aegon N.V., including the right of bail-in of creditors.\n\nLastly, when the stability of the financial system is threatened by the condition of a financial institution the Dutch Minister of Finance may intervene immediately, in which case legal or statutory provisions, applicable to the financial institution, might be superseded. The intervention measures available to the Minister of Finance include, in particular, the right to expropriate assets of the financial",

The exercise of this power may significantly impact the rights of the owners or holders of these assets, securities and/or financial instruments.\n\nThere is a risk that the possible exercise of powers, or any anticipated exercise of powers, by DNB or the Ministry of Finance could have a material adverse effect on the performance by the failing institution, including Aegon, of its obligations (of payment or otherwise) under contracts of any form, including the expropriation, write-off, write-down or conversion of securities such as shares and debt obligations issued by the failing institution. The R&R Act and the regime of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive are described in the section 'Regulation and supervision' of Aegon's Integrated Annual Report 2021.\n\n## Legal and Compliance\n\nThe outcome of legal and arbitration proceedings and regulatory investigations and actions may adversely affect Aegon's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nAegon faces significant risks of litigation as well as regulatory exams and investigations and actions relating to its and its subsidiaries' businesses. Aegon is also subject to compliance with regulations applicable to it as a corporate entity.\n\nInsurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities are routinely the subject of litigation, investigation and regulatory activity by various governmental and enforcement authorities, individual claimants, and policyholder advocate groups in the jurisdictions in which Aegon does business, including the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. These actions may involve issues including, but not limited to, employment or distribution relationships; operational and internal controls and processes; investment returns; sales practices; claims payments and practices; transparency and adequacy of product disclosures including regarding initial costs, ongoing costs, and costs due on policy surrender as well as changes to costs over time; environmental and climate change related matters; competition and antitrust matters; data privacy; information security; and intellectual property.\n\nAegon entities are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including EU, US and UK laws and regulations and these require Aegon to develop and implement customer identification and risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report suspicious activity, and maintain certain records. Further, Aegon entities are required to adhere to certain economic and trade sanctions programs, including EU, US, UK and UN programs, that prohibit or restrict transactions with suspected persons, governments, and in certain circumstances, geographies. Changes in, or violations of, any of these laws or regulations may require additional compliance procedures, or result in enforcement proceedings, sanctions or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, financial condition and result of operations.\n\nAegon entities are subject to anti-bribery legislation in the EU, the US and the UK and other jurisdictions. Any violations of these or other anti-bribery laws by Aegon, its employees, subsidiaries or local agents, could have a material adverse effect on its businesses and reputation and result in substantial financial penalties or other sanctions.\n\nGovernment and regulatory investigations may result in the institution of administrative, injunctive, or other proceedings and/ or the imposition of monetary fines, penalties and/or disgorgement as well as other remedies, sanctions, damages and restitutionary amounts. Regulators may also seek changes to the way Aegon operates. In some cases, Aegon subsidiaries have modified business practices in response to inquiries.\n\nCustomers of certain of Aegon's products bear significant investment risks with respect to those products which are affected by fluctuations in equity markets as well as interest rate movements. When investment returns disappoint, are volatile, or change due to changes in the market or other relevant conditions, customers may threaten or bring litigation against Aegon.\n\nThe existence of potential claims may remain unknown for long periods of time after the events giving rise to such claims. Determining the likelihood of exposure to Aegon and the extent of any such exposure may not be possible for long periods of time after Aegon becomes aware of such potential claims. Litigation exposure as well may develop over long periods of time; once litigation is initiated, it may be protracted and subject to multiple levels of appeal, which can lead to significant costs of defense, distraction, and other constraints.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts under enhanced liability legal theories or claims of bad faith, which can result in tort, punitive and/or statutory damages. Damages alleged/uni00A0may not be quantifiable or supportable or may have no relationship to economic losses or final awards. As a result, Aegon cannot predict the effect of litigation, investigations or other actions on its business.",

        "page_content": "Separate from financial loss, litigation, regulatory action, legislative changes or changes in public opinion may require Aegon to change its business practices, which could have a material adverse impact on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Disputes and investigations initiated by governmental entities and private parties may lead to orders or settlements, including payments or changes to business practices, even if Aegon believes the underlying claims are without merit.\n\nSeveral US insurers, including Aegon subsidiaries, have been named in class actions as well as individual litigations relating to increases in monthly deduction rates (''MDR'') on universal life products. Plaintiffs generally allege that the increases were made to recoup past losses rather than to cover the future costs of providing insurance coverage. Aegon's subsidiary in the US has settled two such class actions in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The settlement in the first of these cases, approved in January 2019, arose from increases implemented in 2015 and 2016. Over 99% of affected policyholders participated in that settlement. While less than 1% of policyholders opted out of the settlement, they represented approximately 43% of the value of the settlement fund. In the second case, Aegon's subsidiary agreed to settle a class action lawsuit arising out of MDR increases in 2017 and 2018. The court approved that settlement on September 16, 2020. Opt-outs in this case represent less than 7% of the value of the settlement fund. The settlement fund was reduced proportionally for opt outs. In 2021, settlements were reached with some of the optout parties from both settled class actions. The remaining opt-out cases and disputes are ongoing, and Aegon continues to hold a provision for the remaining opt-outs from the settlements that were approved by the court in 2019 and 2020. If this provision for these cases proves to be insufficient, then these cases could have an adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nIn addition, insurance companies and their affiliated regulated entities may face lawsuits that threaten their business models. For example, several US-based Aegon subsidiaries are defendants in a class action alleging that the business model improperly characterizes distributors as independent contractors instead of employees. Depending on the outcome, this lawsuit, along with similar claims against Transamerica subsidiaries and other companies, as well as regulatory action, could necessitate a change in the business model and/or could result in a significant settlement or judgment.\n\nIn the Netherlands, unit linked products (beleggingsverzekeringen) have been controversial and the target of litigation since 2005. Allegations include excessive cost, unfair terms, inadequate disclosure, and failure to perform as illustrated. Consumer groups have formed to address these issues and initiate mass claims against insurers. Regulators as well as the Dutch Parliament have been involved ever since, with the principal goal of achieving an equitable resolution. Aegon has made improvements across its product lines, including after settlements reached in 2009 with Stichting Woekerpolis and Stichting Verliespolis. Aegon also decided to reduce future policy costs for the large majority of its unit-linked portfolio. Some of the unit linked products are still involved in ongoing litigation. In September 2014, the consumer interest group Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl filed a claim against Aegon in court. The claim related to a range of unit linked products that Aegon sold in the past, including Aegon products involved in the earlier litigation. In June 2017 (and revised in December 2017), the court issued a verdict which upheld the principle that disclosures must be evaluated according to the standards at the time when the relevant products were placed in-force. Most of the claims of Vereniging Woekerpolis. nl were dismissed under this standard, although the court found that Aegon did not adequately disclose certain charges on a limited set of policies. The district court did not decide on the reasonableness of the cost levels and whether the previous compensation arrangements provide sufficient compensation. This court decision has been appealed by both parties. The Court of Appeal has stayed the class action proceedings during the preliminary proceedings at the Supreme Court in another class action of Vereniging Woekerpolis.nl against another insurance company. On February 11, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in these preliminary proceedings. The answers to the preliminary questions regarding transparency and consent about costs and cost levels are a (re)confirmation of the EU Court ruling in a previous case against another Dutch insurance company. The legal debate will now continue at the level of the Court of Appeal, Aegon expects the uncertainty about the possible impact to continue for the foreseeable future. Aegon expects the claims and litigation, whether collective or on an individual basis and in court or through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, on unit linked products to continue for the foreseeable future. Developments in similar cases against other Dutch insurers currently before regulators and courts may also affect Aegon.\n\nLawsuits have also been brought against providers of securities leasing products (aandelenlease producten). Although sales of securities leasing products ended more than a decade ago, litigation relating to these products has resurfaced./uni00A0\n\nIn December 2020, Aegon reached an agreement on a settlement with Leaseproces B.V. for claims regarding Vliegwiel and Sprintplan customers represented by Leaseproces. Execution of the settlement is expected to be finalized in 2022. There are still individual claims pending.\n\nThere can be no assurances that these matters will not ultimately result in a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, results of operations, competitive position, reputation, and financial condition.

The primary purpose of such regulation is to protect clients of these operating companies (e.g. policyholders), rather than holders of Aegon shares, capital securities and debt instruments. Changes in existing laws and regulations may affect the way in which Aegon conducts its businesses, including its relationship with distributors of its products and other third parties and the structure of its relationship with employees. These changes may evolve over time and be open to interpretation through judicial and enforcement action. Such changes may also affect/uni00A0the profitability of its businesses and the products it offers. Additionally, the laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may impose greater restrictions on Aegon's financial flexibility and operations or may result in higher costs to operate than currently is the case, including but not limited to financial and accounting requirements; information security, data privacy, transfer, storage, and usage requirements; modeling and other actuarial requirements and standards; investments, reserves, and financial management.\n\nAegon may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to its businesses and legal entities. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws and regulations may result in restrictions on Aegon's ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which Aegon operates and may result in fines and other sanctions, which may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nCertain key regulatory proposals that could materially impact Aegon's financial condition and results of operations include the European Commission's proposal for amendments to the Solvency II framework, following the Solvency II 2020 review and the European Commission's proposal for an Insurance Recovery & Resolution Directive. Both proposals serve (inter alia) as the implementation of the IAIS Holistic Framework for Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector in the European Union and to some extent the IAIS Common Framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups ('ComFrame').\n\nRegulatory changes include preventive and corrective supervisory measures that aim to address macro-prudential concerns, referred to in the Holistic Framework for Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector, as adopted by the IAIS in November 2019 and recently in the European Commission's proposal to amend the Solvency II Directive in the context of the Solvency II 2020 review, which includes macro-prudential tools, as well as in the European Commissions' proposal for an Insurance Recovery & Resolution Directive./uni00A0\n\nIn addition, regulatory changes may include measures that are addressed specifically to certain types of insurers or groups, in particular larger and internationally active groups. ComFrame, which was adopted in November 2019 by the IAIS, establishes minimum supervisory standards and guidance on the effective group-wide supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) and builds on the IAIS Insurance Core Principles (a set of principles that is applicable to all insurers). Therefore, IAIGs may be subject to additional standards that other insurers or other insurance groups are not subject to. In Europe, such additional standards would be introduced through the Solvency II framework.\n\nAegon was designated a Global Systemically Important Insurer ('G-SII')/uni00A0by the FSB in 2015. The FSB, in consultation with the IAIS, has decided to suspend G-SII identification as from the beginning of 2020 and in November 2022 will, based on the initial years of implementation of the holistic framework, review the need either to discontinue or re-establish an annual identification of G-SIIs. On May 12, 2020, DNB announced, in line with expectations due to Aegon's former designation as a G-SII, that it has identified Aegon as one of the two IAIGs in the Netherlands, based on the size and international activities of the Aegon group. Although generally large insurance groups are subject to a high level of supervisory scrutiny by DNB, thus far no requirements have been introduced in the Netherlands or by DNB that have specifically been targeted at IAIGs.\n\nThe implementation of ComFrame and the holistic framework, as well as other requirements aimed to address macro-prudential or concerns or concerns related to its capacity as internationally active group, may cause Aegon to engage in transactions that affect capital or constrain Aegon's ability to pay dividends or repurchase its own shares. Furthermore, such requirements may constrain Aegon's ability to provide guarantees and increase the cost to Aegon of offering certain products resulting in price increases, leading to the discontinuance of offering of certain products or reducing the amount of risk Aegon takes on. Aegon may consider structural and other business alternatives in light of requirements or standards applicable with respect to systemic entities or activities, of which the impact on shareholders cannot be predicted.",

        "page_content": "As referred to above, the Solvency II 2020 review covers a broad range of topics of the Solvency II framework. Aegon, at Group level is, and Aegon's EU insurance subsidiaries are, subject to the Solvency II framework. If the European Commission's Directive proposal is taken over by the European co-legislators without material changes, and depending on the scope of further amendments to the Solvency II Delegated Regulation, the related technical standards and EIOPA guidelines (that might be necessary as a consequence of changes to the Solvency II Directive), the amendments to the Solvency II framework may have a significant impact on the activities, profitability and financial condition of Aegon and Aegon's subsidiaries in the European Union.\n\nIn the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) adopted in 2010 has been challenged in whole or in part since its adoption. Changes to the PPACA and to other laws and regulations impacting the US health insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on Aegon's financial condition, results of operations, and competitive position. The extent to which employers or individuals may discontinue their purchase of supplemental health insurance products as a result of any such changes may significantly impact Transamerica's supplemental health insurance products business. The extent of any such changes or the corresponding impact on Transamerica's supplemental health insurance business cannot be determined at this time.\n\nOn June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (Regulation BI), a new rule requiring broker-dealers and investment advisers to recommend only those financial products to their customers that are in their customers' best interest, and to clearly identify any potential conflicts of interest and financial incentives the broker-dealer may have in connection with the sale of such products. In addition, since the Department of Labor ('DOL')/uni00A0Fiduciary Rule was vacated in July 2018, several states have moved forward with developing their own similar rules and proposals, which in some instances substantially broaden the standard of care traditionally owed by broker-dealers and/or insurance agents to their clients. The Biden Administration and the DOL have indicated an interest in revisiting fiduciary-related issues but have not yet made any proposals.\n\nThe foregoing regulations and proposed regulations, along with any future regulations by the federal government and/or states that impose new, heightened, conflicting or differing standards of care or restrictions on broker-dealers, insurance agents, or advisers, could have a material impact on annuity sales and, as applicable, life insurance sales.\n\nChanges in pension and employee benefit regulation, social security regulation, financial services regulation, taxation and the regulation of securities products and transactions, and regulation of employee workplace standards may adversely affect Aegon's ability to sell new policies or claims exposure on existing policies.\n\nThe introduction of state-run retirement programs for private-sector employees in the United States could directly compete with private-market retirement plans. More than 30 US states have considered legislation that would establish state-run plans but fewer than 10 states have enacted legislation, and among those, even fewer have implemented them. Federal ERISA law raises questions as to whether such plans are pre-empted by ERISA.\n\nIn general, changes in laws and regulations may materially increase Aegon's direct and indirect compliance costs and other ongoing business expenses and have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\n\n## Aegon may not be able to meet evolving ESG standards and requirements, or may fail to meet its sustainability and ESG-related goals and targets.\n\nIncreasingly, companies, including insurance companies, asset managers and banks are expected and/or required to disclose the extent to which their activities and products, including their investments and the activities of the companies they invest in, meet ESG standards. These requirements and standards are continuously and rapidly evolving and have not yet crystalized. While Aegon strives to meet applicable ESG standards to the best of its abilities, it may not be successful in doing so, due to the dynamic nature and evolution of these standards and might not be able to anticipate in all respects the further evolution of such standards. This may have an impact on its reputation, products and sales, as well as on its activities and investments, including long term investments./uni00A0Aegon may face additional costs in the event it's efforts do not meet expectations. Aegon has adopted certain sustainability and ESGrelated goals, targets and metrics, including greenhouse gas emissions reduction and diversity and inclusion targets and other sustainability initiatives. If Aegon cannot meet these goals fully or on time, the Company may face reputational damage, litigation or unexpected costs.\n\n## Tax risks may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, profits, capital position, and financial condition.\n\nAegon is subject to the substance and interpretation of tax laws in all countries in which Aegon operates or invests. The majority of tax risks relate to both Aegon's products and its businesses, that would materialize due to (i) changes in tax laws, (ii) changes",

        "page_content": "in interpretation of tax laws, (iii) later jurisprudence or case law, or (iv) the introduction of new taxes or tax laws. These tax risks include for example the risk of changes in tax rates, changes in loss carry-over rules and changes in customer taxation rules.\n\nTax risks also include the risk of consequences arising from failure to comply with procedures required by tax authorities. Failure to manage tax compliance risks could potentially leads to inaccurate, incomplete, or untimely tax returns. Materialization of those risks would lead to non-compliance, and potentially increased tax charges, penalties, and interest. Failure to manage reporting risks may lead to tax positions in financial reporting that do not represent a true and fair view.\n\nMost of Aegon's insurance products enjoy certain policyholder tax advantages. This permits, for example, the build-up of earnings on gross premium amounts with deferred taxation, if any, when the accumulated earnings are actually paid to Aegon's customers. Legislators have, from time to time, considered legislation that may make Aegon's products less attractive to consumers, including legislation that would reduce or eliminate this deferral of taxation. This may have an impact on insurance products and sales.\n\nOverall, tax risks may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, profits, capital position, and financial condition.\n\n## Judgments of US courts may not be enforceable against Aegon in Dutch courts.\n\nThere is no treaty between the United States and the Netherlands providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Judgments of US courts, including those predicated on the civil liability provisions of the US federal securities laws, may not be enforceable in Dutch courts. Therefore, Aegon's investors that obtain a judgment against Aegon in the United States may not be able to require Aegon to pay the amount of the judgment unless a competent court in the Netherlands gives binding effect to the judgment, or, if possible, the US investor has brought a successful original action in a Dutch court. Therefore, investors are required to undertake more action in order to enforce a US court judgment than in relation to any US counterparty.\n\n## Aegon may not manage risks associated with the reform and replacement of benchmark rates effectively.\n\nAegon recognizes that the reform of Interbank Offered Rates ('IBORs')/uni00A0and any transition to replacement rates entail risks for all it's businesses across it's assets and liabilities. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 The EUR 2 billion syndicated revolving credit facility and the USD 2 billion LOC facility have been updated in order to prepare for the cessation of the relevant benchmark rates;\n- \u00b7 Financial risks, arising from any changes in the valuation of financial instruments linked to benchmark rates, such as derivatives and floating rate notes, issued by, or invested in by Aegon;\n- \u00b7 Pricing risks, as changes to benchmark indices could impact pricing mechanisms on some funding instruments or investments;\n- \u00b7 Operational risks, due to the potential requirement to adapt informational technology systems, trade reporting infrastructure and operational processes; and\n- \u00b7 Conduct risks, relating to communication regarding potential impact on Aegon's customers, and engagement during the transition period.\n\nThe United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the 'FCA'), which regulates London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), has announced that the publication of LIBOR on the current basis would cease and no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 (in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and one-week and two-month USD settings) and immediately after June 30, 2023 (in the case of all remaining USD settings). Despite this deferral in regard to USD, the FCA has confirmed that use of USD LIBOR will not be permitted in most new contracts after December 31, 2021 and while the FCA is requiring the LIBOR administrator to publish one-, three- and six-month sterling and Japanese yen LIBOR rates for a limited time following December 31, 2021 using a synthetic methodology, such synthetic LIBOR rates are also only permitted for legacy use. If the methods of calculating LIBOR change from their current form while Aegon continues to rely on LIBOR, or if Aegon adopts alternative benchmarks for it's current or future debt, interest rates on it's debt obligations may be adversely affected.\n\nVarious supranational institutions, central banks, regulators, benchmark administrators and industry working groups play a role in the benchmark reform and the preparation for the replacement of IBORs./uni00A0Although a lot of work has been done, there is still significant uncertainty around liquidity development, and mechanisms for implementation, including the change of methods of calculating LIBOR from its original form,/uni00A0application of spread adjustments to the alternative reference rates. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to determine whether, or to what extent, any such changes would affect Aegon. However, the implementation of alternative reference rates may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's business, financial condition, customers, and operations.",

Third parties may infringe on or misappropriate Aegon's intellectual property, and it is possible that third parties may claim that Aegon has infringed on or misappropriated their intellectual property rights. Any resulting proceedings in which Aegon would have to enforce and protect its intellectual property or defend itself against a claim of infringement of a third party's intellectual property, may require significant effort and resources and may not prove successful. As a result of any proceeding in which Aegon would have to enforce and protect its intellectual property, Aegon may lose intellectual property protection, which may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations, financial condition and Aegon's ability to compete and pursue future business opportunities. As a result of any proceeding in which Aegon would have to defend itself against a claim of infringement of a third-party's intellectual property, Aegon may be required to pay damages and provide injunctive relief, which may have a material adverse effect on Aegon's businesses, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks relating to Aegon's common shares\n\n## Aegon's share price could be volatile and could drop unexpectedly, and investors may not be able to resell Aegon's common shares at or above the price paid.\n\nThe price at which Aegon's common shares trade is influenced by many factors, some of which are specific to Aegon and Aegon's operations, and some of which are related to the insurance industry and equity markets in general. As a result of these factors, investors may not be able to resell their common shares at or above the price paid for them. In particular, the following factors,\n\nin addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a material impact on the market price of Aegon's common shares:\n\n- \u00b7 Investor perception of Aegon as a company;\n- \u00b7 Actual or anticipated fluctuations in Aegon's results of operations;\n- \u00b7 Announcements of intended acquisitions, disposals (and related approvals or refusals from governmental or regulatory authorities) or financings, or speculation about such acquisitions, disposals (and related approvals or refusals from governmental or regulatory authorities) or financings;\n- \u00b7 Changes in Aegon's dividend policy, which may result from changes in Aegon's cash flow and capital position;\n- \u00b7 Offering of additional shares by Aegon or sales of blocks of Aegon's shares by significant shareholders, including Vereniging Aegon;\n- \u00b7 A downgrade or rumored downgrade of Aegon's credit or financial strength ratings, including placement on credit watch;\n- \u00b7 Potential litigation or regulatory actions involving Aegon or the insurance industry in general;\n- \u00b7 Changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities research analysts;\n- \u00b7 Fluctuations in capital markets, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity markets;\n- \u00b7 The performance of other companies in the insurance sector;\n- \u00b7 Regulatory developments in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and other countries in which Aegon operates;\n- \u00b7 International political and economic conditions, including the effects of terrorist attacks, military operations and other developments stemming from such events, and the uncertainty related to these developments;\n- \u00b7 News or analyst reports related to markets or industries in which Aegon operates; and\n- \u00b7 General insurance market conditions.\n\n## Aegon and its significant shareholders may offer additional common shares in the future, and these and other sales may adversely affect the market price of the outstanding common shares.\n\nAegon may decide to offer additional common shares in the future, for example, to strengthen Aegon's capital position in response to regulatory changes or to support an acquisition.\n\nAn additional offering of common shares by Aegon, the restructuring of Aegon's share capital, the sales of common shares by significant shareholders, or the public perception that an offering or such sales may occur, may have an adverse effect on the market price of Aegon's common shares.\n\n## Vereniging Aegon, Aegon's major shareholder, holds a large percentage of the voting shares and therefore has significant influence over Aegon's corporate actions.\n\nVereniging Aegon holds 32.6% of Aegon's voting shares.

        "page_content": "Following the 1983 Amended Merger Agreement between Aegon N.V. and Vereniging Aegon, Vereniging Aegon has a call option on common shares B, which Vereniging Aegon may exercise to keep or restore its total stake at 32.6%, irrespective of the circumstances which cause the total shareholding to be or become lower than 32.6%.\n\nAs a matter of Dutch corporate law, common shares and common shares B offer equal full voting rights, as they have equal nominal values (EUR 0.12). The financial rights attached to a common share B are 1/40 of the financial rights attached to a common share. The Voting Rights Agreement between Aegon N.V. and Vereniging Aegon ensures that under normal circumstances, i.e. except in the event of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon will no longer be able to exercise more votes than is proportionate to the financial rights represented by its shares. This means that in the absence of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon will cast one vote for every common share it holds and one vote only for every 40 common shares B. It is at the sole discretion of Vereniging Aegon if a Special Cause has occurred. A Special Cause includes the acquisition of a 15% interest in Aegon N.V., a tender offer for Aegon N.V. shares or a proposed business combination by any person or group or persons, whether individually or as a group, other than in a transaction approved by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In the event of a Special Cause, Vereniging Aegon's voting rights will increase to 32.6% for up to six months. Consequently, Vereniging Aegon may have substantial influence on the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval.\n\n## Currency fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of Aegon's common shares and the value of any cash distributions made.\n\nSince Aegon's common shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam are quoted in euros and Aegon's common shares listed on NYSE New York are quoted in US dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and the US dollar may affect the value of Aegon's common shares. In addition, Aegon declares cash dividends in euros, but pays cash dividends, if any, on Aegon's New York registry Shares in US dollars based on an exchange rate set the business day following the shareholder meeting approving the dividend. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may affect the US dollar value of any cash dividends paid.\n\n## Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities (or other securities that permit or require Aegon to satisfy its obligations by issuing common shares) that Aegon may issue could influence the market price for Aegon's common shares.\n\nIn April 2019, Aegon issued EUR 500 million Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities ('PCCS'). Upon the occurrence of a conversion trigger event the PCCS will be converted into common shares of the Company at the prevailing conversion price. A conversion trigger event shall occur if at any time: (i) the amount of eligible own funds items eligible to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement is equal to or less than 75% of the Solvency Capital Requirement; (ii) the amount of own fund items eligible to cover the Minimum Capital Requirement is equal to or less than the Minimum Capital Requirement; (iii) in case the Minimum Capital Requirement is an event, such event occurs; or (iv) a breach of the Solvency Capital Requirement has occurred and such breach has not been remedied within a period of three months from the date on which the breach was first observed. The conversion price was set at EUR 2.994 per common share and will be adjusted upon occurrence of dilutive events like stock splits, extraordinary dividends or stock dividends, rights issues and others. A reduction of the conversion price will result in an increase in the number of common shares to be issued.\n\nThe PCCS and other convertible securities may influence the market for Aegon's common shares. For example, the price of Aegon's common shares may become more volatile and may be depressed by the issue of common shares upon conversion of the PCCS and/or any convertible securities or by the acceleration by investors of any convertible securities (or other such securities) that Aegon may have issued. Negative price developments may also result from hedging or arbitrage trading activity by holders of such convertible securities that may develop involving such convertible securities (or other such securities) and Aegon's common shares. Any such developments may negatively affect the value of Aegon's common shares.",

Our value creation approach is introduced in detail under the section 'Aegon in 2021/ Our strategy and value creation' (pages 16-34). We use the six capitals (financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and relationship, and natural) as defined by the <IR> Framework to communicate how our strategy, governance, and performance create and protect value in the short, medium, and long term for our key stakeholder groups. Accordingly, the section 'Value Created' (page 382) is organized based on the value Aegon creates for its main stakeholder groups, namely its customers, employees, business partners, investors and society.\n\nThis non-financial information part of the IAR also contains information related to our commitments to various global and sector-specific sustainability initiatives such as the UN Global Compact (UNGC), the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI), as well as information required by regulatory authorities such as the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n## Reporting process for non-financial data\n\nThe non-financial metrics detailed in this section of the IAR cover the full calendar year 2021, unless otherwise stated. Explanatory notes and definitions are provided as footnotes to the accompanying stakeholder tables under the section 'Value created' (page 382).\n\nThe aggregated data has been reviewed by dedicated subject matter experts at Aegon and approved by Aegon's Management and Supervisory Boards before publication.\n\nThe non-financial information in this report has not been subject to external audit or review.\n\nIn 2021, Aegon initiated a process to enhance its sustainability reporting, with the aim to ensure Aegon's ability to adapt to changing mandatory and voluntary reporting requirements.\n\nThis entails integrating financial and non-financial data collection and reporting processes to leverage the expertise of the Group Finance function. This will ensure our readiness for limited assurance on non-financial reporting as required from 2023 under the forthcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) of the European Union. For more information on CSRD, please refer to section 'Regulation and compliance' (pages 357-362).\n\n## Reporting scope\n\nThe scope of non-financial data reported in this section is all entities over which Aegon has management control. Divested businesses (of which closings are finalized by year end), or joint ventures and associates are excluded from the scope unless otherwise stated. The table 'Reporting scope by operating segment' provides an overview of the scope of non-financial data included in this section of the report, for each of our operating segments. In some cases, the scope does not apply to certain operating segments, and this is indicated in the table.\n\nWhile the data presented covers the operating segments illustrated in the table below, the data collection for our 'Operational footprint' focuses on our largest operations, namely in the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Based on this data (which covers approximately 81% of our employees), by means of extrapolation, we report on our operational footprint covering all our operating segments.\n\n## Defining content\n\nThis section of the IAR contains non-financial information that is deemed important either to Aegon's stakeholders or to Aegon. To determine the content that is disclosed in this section of the IAR, Aegon applies the principle of 'materiality'. The <IR> Framework defines materiality as 'A matter is material if it could substantively affect the organization's ability to create value in the short, medium or long term'.\n\nNon-financial information disclosed in this section of the report focuses on information related to topics Aegon believes have, or will have, a significant long-term impact on its profitability, operations, strategy, reputation, brand, customer loyalty and recruitment; and as well as on the environment and society at large. In determining materiality, we take into account numerous wide-ranging factors of significance for Aegon and its stakeholders. Another input for identifying material topics are the stakeholder expectations raised through various communication channels. Moreover, we take into account topics that have gained prominence in the reporting year as well as material environment, social and governance (ESG) topics that we disclose to various sustainability performance benchmarks (page 393).",

We have identified climate change and inclusion and diversity as two strategic sustainability priorities that are particularly critical issues, and they will guide our sustainability agenda in the years to come.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\nIn line with our company strategy, we have identified key performance indicators to measure our non-financial performance, two of which align directly with the priority themes.\n\n| Key performance indicators   | Stakeholder group supported   | Description and purpose                                                                                                                      |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Customer Satisfaction 1)     | Customers                     | To ensure customer satisfaction in each of our core markets  (measured in NPS) is in line with or above the average of those of  our peers.  |\n| Employee Engagement 2)       | Employees                     | To ensure a 70% employee engagement score for 2022, measured  through our Global Employee Survey.                                            |\n| Gender Diversity 3)          | Employees                     | To ensure 36% female representation amongst our senior  management for 2022.                                                                 |\n| Net-Zero Emissions 4)        | Society                       | To ensure at least 25% reduction in weighted average carbon  intensity of our corporate fixed income and listed equity  investments by 2025. |\n\n- \u00b7 NL: In partnership with Ipsos, the aggregated gap to market average score has been calculated as a weighted average of the gaps to market average of the various lines of business in active markets in the Netherlands. Weights are based on the number of contracts in each business line.\n- \u00b7 UK: In partnership with Respondi, the required market sample size was obtained from a group of panel participants. The Aegon score was taken from Aegon UK's own NPS survey using the same questionnaire. The gap to market score is calculated as the difference between the Aegon NPS and the average NPS of all active brands in the market as established by the external research partner.\n- \u00b7 US: In partnership with Qualtrics, the required sample size was collected through an external consumer panel for both the Life and Retirement businesses. The aggregated gap to market average is calculated by weighting the gaps to market average for Life and Retirement. Weights are based on the number of contracts for each product.\n\nWith regards to the definition of \"peers\" for each core market:\n\n- \u00b7 In the Netherlands, the competitive set used per line of business for the survey consisted of 25 brands (life), 37 brands (pension schemes), 22 brands (savings), 30 brands (P&C), 27 brands (mortgages)\n- \u00b7 In the UK, the competitive set used for the survey consisted of 10 brands (pension providing peers)\n- \u00b7 In the United States the competitive set per line of business used for the survey consisted of 25 brands (life) and 19 brands (retirement)\n- 2  Employee engagement is measured on a five-point scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree), and it is the average score of four statements:\n- \u00b7 'The company motivates me to go beyond expectations'\n- \u00b7 'I am proud to work for this company'\n- \u00b7 'I see myself still working at this company in two years' time'\n- \u00b7 'I would recommend this company as a great place to work'\n- All employees, including those in joint ventures, participate on a voluntary basis. New hires employed for under three months do not participate. In 2021, three engagement surveys were conducted throughout the year (Q1, Q2 and Q3), where the participation rate for the most recent one was 77%.\n- 3  In this context, senior management includes our Management Board and extends up to two levels below the Management Board (depending on the number of employees in each business or country unit).\n- 4  Aegon will set targets on its General Account investments in line with membership requirements of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, following five-year increments of increasing ambition toward achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

We have internal policies, procedures and frameworks setting out how decisions should be made in areas such as procurement, investment, tax, product development, remuneration and information security. Aegon also has a Code of Conduct, which applies to all employees worldwide. The aim of these policies and procedures is to protect stakeholders by ensuring we are aware of all relevant financial and non-financial factors in our decisionmaking. We monitor implementation and take remedial action where necessary to ensure full compliance.\n\nThe Aegon website includes a dedicated library for our ESG policies.The following table demonstrates the incorporation of sustainability themes into Aegon's decision-making processes through specific policies and statements, and provides an overview of the outcomes and our performance against the indicators underpinning them.\n\nThe following table shows how various sustainability topics are incorporated into Aegon's decision-making processes, as well as relevant policies and statements and the outcomes as a result of the actions taken.\n\n| Topics                       | Policy / Statement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Indicators  (used to monitor compliance  and/or outcomes)                                                           | Outcome / Performance 2021                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business conduct  and ethics | Code of Conduct Externally published document prescribing  a/uni00A0mandatory set of conditions for how Aegon  sound judgment in reaching ethical business  decisions in the long-term interests of our  mandatory for all employees).

This includes the identification and mitigation of aspects of economic activities that erode non-financial value, as well as the identification of, and capitalization on, opportunities to create value.\n\nReflecting this understanding, there is a clear and increasing global trend of capital allocation toward economic activities that manage non-financial value most effectively.\n\nAround the world, governments are passing regulation to drive transparency in the non-financial value aspects of any given economic activity, for better-informed risk assessment and decision-making in the allocation of financial capital. For example, the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) is driving more transparency regarding how financial market participants and financial advisors integrate sustainability risks into their investment decisions or insurance advice. Financial market participants should disclose information on those procedures and descriptions and the impact of sustainability risks on the performance of the financial products. To do so they need sustainability-related information about their investees (companies). This is why the European Union has been developing two other key pieces of legislation, namely the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the EU Taxonomy. The CSRD and EU Taxonomy aim to ensure that investees report on these topics, so financial institutions can use this information in return. The 2021 reporting year is the first step in the implementation of the EU Taxonomy. For more information on the EU Taxonomy please refer to the section 'EU Taxonomy Regulation' on page 359.\n\n## EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD)\n\nNon-financial reporting has been a regulatory requirement for Aegon since the implementation of EU Directive 2014/95/ EU on non-financial reporting, hereafter referred to as the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive, for the 2018 reporting year. The NFRD requirements, applicable to Aegon N.V. are included in article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU (Accounting Directive). In the Netherlands, article 29a of the Accounting Directive is implemented in Dutch law, on the basis of article 391 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code in the Decree on the contents of the management report ( Besluit inhoud bestuursverslag ), in the Decree on the establishment of further provisions on the content of the Annual Report ( Besluit tot vaststelling van nadere voorschriften omtrent de inhoud van het jaarverslag ) and in the Decree on the publication of non-financial information ( Besluit bekendmaking niet-financi\u00eble informatie ).\n\nThe NFRD requires 'large companies' such as Aegon to disclose information regarding the way they operate and manage social and environmental challenges. More specifically, it requires companies to report on social, employee and environmental matters, human rights, bribery and anti-corruption, as well as information on board diversity. Information on board diversity is included in the diversity section of Aegon's Corporate Governance Statement (page 17).\n\nOn the basis of the above-mentioned Decrees, Aegon is required to publish non-financial information in a (consolidated) non-financial statement. To this end, the table below details the disclosures required, additionally referencing the corresponding requirement of the NFRD itself and the corresponding requirements in the Dutch decrees.",

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation has been adopted by the EU in 2021 and is one of the cornerstones of the EU Action plan on financing sustainable growth. The EU taxonomy is a classification system to define environmentally sustainable economic activities, based on the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Substantially contributing to one of the six EU environmental objectives:\n- - Climate change mitigation\n- - Climate change adaptation\n- - Sustainable use and protection of water and\n\nmarine resources\n\n- - Circular economy\n- - Pollution prevention and control\n- - Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n- \u00b7 Doing no harm to any of the other objectives, and\n- \u00b7 Meeting minimum safeguards, including OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n\nFor each of the six environmental objectives, delegated acts are being developed at EU level. Thus far, one delegated act for two objectives, climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation, has been finalized and is in effect. The delegated acts concerning the other four environmental objectives are expected to be published by the EU during 2022. Related eligibility disclosures are expected to follow in our IAR 2022.\n\n## Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nArticle 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires undertakings to report how and to what extent the undertaking's activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable. The requirements are applicable for undertakings which are subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information in accordance with the NFRD, such as Aegon N.V. The information should be included in the non-financial statement or consolidated non-financial statement information.\n\nArticle 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation aims to ensure that large public-interest entities (such as Aegon) report on these topics, so financial institutions and other stakeholders can use this information in return. The 2021 reporting year is the first step in the implementation of article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n## EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n\nFrom January 1, 2024, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is expected to replace the NFRD and as mentioned under section 'Reporting process for non-financial data' on page 350, at Aegon we are preparing internally for this change. The CSRD will require companies, including Aegon N.V., to include in their management report information necessary to understand their impacts on sustainability matters, and how sustainability matters affect their development, performance and position, including the information that they are required to disclose pursuant to article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is linked to the CSRD. While the EU Taxonomy is currently focused on environmental objectives only, the CSRD will set sustainability standards based on a broader, ESG+, definition. We expect that the CSRD will adopt an integrated perspective to reporting and that disclosures should cover key performance indicators around ESG matters and other 'intangibles' or value creators.\n\n## Disclosure of EU Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and investments\n\nIn the IAR 2021, Aegon must disclose the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and investments related to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation only. When estimates and proxies are used, disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation may not be classified as 'mandatory' and should be classified as 'voluntary'.\n\nTo assess the eligibility of our investments, we are often dependent on the information provided by our investees. In many cases, this information is not yet available. Therefore, we have used alternative methods and estimates which we describe below under 'Assumptions and data limitations'. These investments are included in the voluntary disclosures. Only for our underwriting activities and investments in mortgage loans and real estate is actual information currently available to assess eligibility. Therefore, these investments and activities form the mandatory disclosures. The distinction between 'mandatory' and 'voluntary' disclosures is explicitly mentioned in the EU Taxonomy tables below.\n\n'Eligible' means that an economic activity is described in one of the delegated acts as mentioned above, irrespective of whether that economic activity meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down in those delegated acts to qualify as sustainable. 'Alignment' means that an eligible economic activity meets the technical screening criteria to qualify as sustainable. Aegon N.V. needs to disclose the alignment of its economic activities in its IAR 2023.\n\n## Scope of assets and activities covered by the EU Taxonomy disclosures\n\nAegon's EU Taxonomy performance indicators are split between underwriting activities and on-balance investments.\n\n## Investments\n\nTo calculate the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible investments, the total of covered investments is used as the denominator, which includes General Account investments, investments in accounts of policyholders, derivatives and real estate for own use. The total covered assets in proportion to the total balance sheet is 82% (EUR 385 billion out of EUR 469 billion).",

        "page_content": "We also include in the covered assets, on a voluntary basis, investments in undertakings that are not obliged to publish nonfinancial information, unless the data is not available to assess Taxonomy-eligibility. This includes investments in companies established outside the EU.\n\n## Own activities\n\nThe underwriting disclosure includes an assessment of all nonlife business as prescribed by the EU Taxonomy. Non-life business only relates to the EU Climate Change Adaptation objective, as these products can significantly contribute to the protection of policyholders for the negative impact of climate change, but do not contribute to the Climate Change Mitigation objective.\n\nWe have only classified non-life activities as eligible when there is a reference in the policy conditions to one or more of the climate-related perils as defined by the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act (such as storm, flood, cold wave/frost, or drought). We have assessed that this is applicable to our motor vehicle, other motor and property insurance. As a consequence, we have classified our medical expense, income protection and worker's compensation insurance products as non-eligible.\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation allows different methods to measure the total premium of eligible products. The total premium of eligible products can be calculated at line of business level, product level or coverage level. Aegon takes a product-level approach, which means that the total gross written premium of all eligible products is taken into account.\n\n## Assumptions and data limitations\n\nTo determine the eligibility of our investments in 2021 we used publicly available sector information (referred to as NACE codes), collected by an external data vendor to map the investments in shares, debt securities and part of our private loans to the EU Taxonomy. We have measured eligible investments for the full carrying amount. In the alignment phase in 2023 we will use actual information from the underlying companies to assess the alignment percentage, which will likely be lower than 100% of the IFRS value for most investments.\n\nOur mortgage and real estate portfolio are classified as 100% eligible in line with the EU Taxonomy. We expect that not all properties will meet the screening criteria in 2023, which is in large part based on the energy label information of the underlying properties. As a result, we expect that the actual alignment of our mortgage and real estate portfolio in 2023 will also be lower than 100%.\n\nThe eligibility assessment of our investment funds is more difficult since we are dependent on external asset managers to provide relevant sustainability information of the underlying companies. For 2021 we have a data limitation to assess the eligibility of our investment funds. As a result we have classified these investments as non-eligible. This mainly impacts the eligibility of Investments for account of policyholders.\n\nFor our 2021 disclosures we do not make a distinction between the two climate objectives Climate Change Mitigation and Climate Change Adaptation. For investments the distinction becomes relevant in the alignment phase as the screening criteria for Mitigation are different than those for Adaptation. In the eligibility phase these categories are very similar and the information to make a distinction is not yet available. As mentioned above, non-life activities are all related to Climate/uni00A0Change Adaptation.",

Mitigating climate change, including the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is a major global challenge. Aegon believes that governments, companies, and investors have a responsibility to mitigate climate change and its impacts, and facilitate a transition to a climate-resilient economy.\n\nThe present disclosure builds on earlier disclosures made since 2017. It is made on behalf of Aegon N.V., an integrated diversified international financial services group, as both an asset owner and an asset manager.\n\nSimilar to previous years, it follows the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD)'s four-pillar framework to facilitate disclosure. Aegon strives to continuously enhance its reporting and business practices and welcomes feedback from stakeholders on the appropriateness and relevance of this disclosure.\n\n## Governance\n\nSet up by the Corporate Sustainability team, Aegon's sustainability approach is overseen by the Global Sustainability Board (GSB). The GSB is a senior management committee established in December 2021, replacing the former Responsible Business & Investment Committee (RBIC), to enhance overall governance and oversight of our company-wide approach to sustainability. The GSB meets quarterly and advises the Management and Executive Boards on Aegon's strategic sustainability agenda, including two priority themes: climate change and inclusion & diversity. It is chaired by the CEO of Transamerica (who is also a member of Aegon's Management Board) and consists of seniorlevel representatives from across the company.\n\nThe GSB is supported in its mission by local sustainability boards that translate the global sustainability agenda into actions within local business units and provide market-relevant feedback.\n\nWith respect to climate change, the GSB is also supported by the Net-Zero Working Group (NZWG). The NZWG is tasked with undertaking the required analysis and coordination of actions on Aegon's General Account investments in support of our 2050 net-zero commitment and obligations under the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance. It draws on staff-level representation from across the company to generate insight and recommendations for the GSB on potential management actions.\n\nAdditional climate oversight is provided by the Group Risk & Capital Committee (GRCC), which oversees the Financial Risk function's climate scenarios that analyze the potential climate impacts on our accounts. There is also the Non-Financial\n\nRisk Committee (NFRC) which oversees the Operational Risk function's annual climate risk assessment that identifies possible physical and transition risks that could impact Aegon.\n\n## Case study: Transamerica Climate Risk Working Group\n\nTransamerica has established a local cross-functional Climate Risk Working Group (CRWG) to assist in climate change risk oversight, determining activities necessary to comply with related regulatory requirements, and achieving organizational goals. The CRWG supports the Americas' Operational Risk Committee (AORC) and is responsible for reporting climate risk-related activities to not only the AORC but also the Transamerica Board Risk Committee, which has oversight of the implementation of the Enterprise Risk Management Framework including climate risk. As Transamerica's oversight of the risks and opportunities related to climate change matures the CRWG will continue to integrate its work into the relevant committees.\n\n## Strategy\n\nAt Aegon we have embedded sustainability as a central pillar within our company strategy. Aegon is committed to a responsible way of doing business and seeks to meet the increasing expectations of multiple stakeholders - investors, but also customers, employees, business partners, and the wider community. Through these engagements, Aegon has established two thematic sustainability priorities for our strategy: inclusion and diversity, and climate change. Both themes support our corporate purpose. As the effects of climate change become increasingly palpable, the need for action has never been more urgent, or more universal. Only then can people live their best lives.\n\nAs an insurance company, Aegon can support the transition to a climate-resilient economy and a net-zero world using both sides of its balance sheet. We finance the upside through our responsible investment activities, while mitigating the downside through integrating ESG into our risk management processes and the savings and protection solutions we provide. The influence, both positive and negative, we can have as an investor is particularly significant.\n\nWe have committed to transitioning our General Account investment portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. To-date we have set a reduction target in the weighted average carbon intensity of our corporate fixed income and listed equity investments; by 25% for 2025 against a 2019 baseline. We will look to further substantiate this commitment over the coming years with additional science-based targets. Albeit at a smaller scale, Aegon is also committed to reducing GHG emissions from our direct operations. Finally, we aspire to further integrate climate considerations in our day-to-day processes, such as procurement.",

        "page_content": "## Risks\n\nAegon undertakes a Business Environment Scan (BES) to identify macro-economic opportunities and challenges that are expected to have a high likelihood of occurring and a high impact on our business. The most recent BES included consideration of climate change and the loss of biodiversity. While the exposure of direct physical risks from environmental catastrophes and loss of biodiversity is expected to be limited for Aegon, we expect to be exposed to regulatory risks associated with new and emerging market requirements. As a result, we seek to further embed climate and environmental considerations in our business and investment decisions - both to avoid damaging the planet and to safeguard our reputation. See discussion of the Business Environment Scan for further detail (page 10).\n\nFor our life insurance business, most of our liabilities are exposed to mortality and morbidity rates, both the current levels and the uncertainty around how these will develop relative to our assumptions over the coming decades. An important driver when assessing the value of our liabilities is how past trends in longevity are extrapolated into the future. Climate change plays a role in the development of future mortality and morbidity rates, just like other factors - including the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, medical advancements, limits to human biology, and changes in lifestyle. The relationship between mortality and morbidity and climate change is complex, and the nature of the impact can also vary geographically. Furthermore, it is expected that climate change will have a relatively lower impact on longevity and health of the insured population compared with the general population, as this group is more affluent and is more likely to be able to better adapt to changing conditions. Taking all this into consideration, Aegon follows widely adopted industry methods where the extrapolation of future longevity is performed based on past experiences of mortality and morbidity rates, without separately modelling each of the underlying drivers such as climate change. With this approach the changing circumstances are gradually introduced into our assumptions.\n\nIn contrast, our investments are exposed to both physical and transition risks. While we expect the transition risks associated with policy and market actions intended to mitigate climate change to be most salient in the near term, the value of our holdings can reasonably be expected to be influenced by both these risks in the longer term. However, previous scenario analysis has shown that our relatively high allocation to fixed income, including government bonds, should limit our overall exposure.\n\nFor our property and casualty (P&C) business, we expect a more direct impact from climate change through, for example, higher claim frequencies arising from an increase in extreme weather events. However, prices for P&C insurance can be adjusted periodically. Prices are determined by closely monitoring past claim frequencies and adjusting the premiums over time while maintaining an adequate level of expected profitability.\n\n## Opportunities\n\nAs an investor, Aegon has an important role to play in supporting the climate transition. By making climate-smart investment choices, we can contribute to a cleaner, healthier environment and provide our clients with opportunities to minimize their own climate impacts. Climate change continues to be a focus of our investment strategy and is guided by our Responsible Investment Policy.\n\n## Case study: Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance\n\nIn November 2021, Aegon N.V. joined the NetZero Asset Owner Alliance, an UN-convened group of institutional investors committed to transitioning their portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Through the analysis conducted by its business units, Aegon N.V. defined a specific, actionable target for 2025 and will continue to set targets in five-year intervals in line with the Alliance's principles.\n\n## Case study: Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative\n\nIn November 2021, Aegon Asset Management joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a group of international asset managers committed to supporting investing aligned with net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. This commitment requires Aegon Asset Management to work in partnership with asset owner clients on decarbonization goals consistent with an ambition to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 across all assets under management, and set interim targets at five-year intervals for the share of assets managed in-line with net-zero principles.\n\n## Risk management Identification and management\n\nClimate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope, and severity of potential impacts. 2021 saw no material changes to the overall climate risk identification, assessment, and evaluation processes described in previous years' disclosures.",

        "page_content": "## Case study: Global General Account scenario analysis\n\nAegon worked with Ortec Finance to perform an extensive and systematic climate risk assessment for the General and Separate Account assets of all business units within Aegon. The analysis investigated three plausible climate pathways (orderly, disorderly and failed transitions) to explore potential future climate policies, interventions, and consequences of the world failing to mitigate climate change. These pathways are in line with the industry standard IPCC and Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) emission and climate scenarios.\n\nThe employed climate model translates transition (i.e. policy & technological changes) and physical risks (i.e. gradual impact & extreme weather events) associated with climate change to produce a climate change adjusted economic and financial outlook. The model outcomes enable Aegon to identify portfolio weak spots - in terms of asset type, geography and sector - to aid decision making in responding to climate risk.\n\nModelling results indicate resilience of the Aegon General Account portfolio allocation to key systemic climate risk drivers across all modelled climate scenarios. High allocation of fixed income assets is the key driver that limits the cumulative climate-related impact on returns over a 40-year horizon. Continuing to monitor developments in climate science, policy, technology and consumer sentiment will remain critical for understanding and adapting to the future.\n\nThe results provide an initial directional signal; however, climate-related risks are dynamic in nature. Transition risks are expected to dominate in the near to medium term (certainly to 2030) if society is to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement while physical risks will materialize at any time as global temperatures continue to rise. As a result, continuing to monitor developments in climate science, policy, technology and consumer sentiment is critical for understanding and adapting to the future.\n\n## Short-term climate-induced GDP losses for EU & US /uni00A0\u2265\u0171\u0151\u0144\u017b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term climate-induced GDP losses for EU & US /uni00A0\u2265\u0171\u0151\u0144\u017b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate impact on nominal investment return /uni00A0\u2265\u0171\u0151\u0144\u017b\u0142\u015e\u0171\u2264\u017bGLYPH<22>\u2264GLYPH<21>\u0144GLYPH<20>\u0171\u0151\u0142GLYPH<19>\u0171GLYPH<18>\u2264\u0142GLYPH<19>\u2264GLYPH<17>\u2264GLYPH<16>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<14>GLYPH<15>\u0151\u0144\u017b\u0142\u015e\u0171GLYPH<13>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview of Climate Scenarios Considered\n\n| Paris Orderly Transition                                                 | Paris Disorderly Transition                                              | Failed Transition                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Orderly transition pathway Net Zero by 2070                              | Disorderly transition pathway Net Zero by 2070                           | Business-as-usual (only currently  committed transition efforts)      |\n| CO 2  emissions ~ RCP2.6  Locked-in physical impacts of   1.6\u00b0C  by 2100 | CO 2  emissions ~ RCP2.6  Locked-in physical impacts of   1.6\u00b0C  by 2100 | CO 2  emissions ~ RCP8.5  Dramatic physical impacts of   4\u00b0C  by 2100 |",

        "page_content": "## Case study: Operational climate risk assessment\n\nAegon performs a regular operational assessment of its exposure to climate risk. The assessment uses research and position papers from renowned institutions as input and is executed in cooperation with subject matter experts from Aegon's risk, asset management and sustainability functions. In 2021, Aegon updated and enriched its assessment by incorporating findings from local climate risk assessments executed by Aegon's country units and developments captured in the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report. The risk assessment identifies the relevant risks for the company and assesses severity per risk in terms of likelihood and impact and its manageability in terms of the speed of materialization and the possibilities for mitigation. The assessment concludes with recommendations and considerations to be taken forward and is included as part of our Own Risk Solvency Assessment (ORSA).\n\n## Active ownership\n\n## Engagement with corporates\n\nAs an institutional investor, Aegon expects investee companies to work toward reducing their environmental impact. We engage with the companies we invest in both individually and collectively through networks to encourage better climate-related risk practices, including emissions measurement, disclosure, target setting and reporting in line with TCFD recommendations.\n\nAegon and its business units are active members or participants in several collaborative initiatives targeting climate action, including but not limited to: Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), and Climate Action 100+ (CA100+).\n\nFor further details on Aegon's active ownership activities, see the Responsible Investment and Active Ownership reports published by Aegon Asset Management.\n\n## Engagement with policymakers\n\nAegon acknowledges the importance and necessity of government action in addressing climate change. Engagement with policymakers is critical to shaping our investment environment, and we work independently and in collaboration with industry groups to engage on key climate issues.\n\nAt the European level, Aegon supports the goals of the EU/uni00A0strategy for financing the transition to a sustainable economy and recognizes the important role financial actors play in the\n\ntransition. Aegon has engaged with officials and contributed to/uni00A0consultations on the corresponding sustainable taxonomy and/uni00A0ESG disclosure regulations, the incorporation of sustainability risks into the Solvency II regulatory regime, and the development of standards for the reporting of non-financial information. Aegon has also continued to advocate for action to complete the/uni00A0Capital Markets Union to unlock capital from institutional and/uni00A0cross-border investors to fund sustainable transition projects in Europe.\n\nIn the United States, Aegon has engaged with policymakers at both the federal and state levels to ensure appropriate climate-related regulation. Aegon has supported regulatory measures that appropriately differentiate between the climate exposures of life insurers and property-casualty insurers. At both the federal and state levels, Aegon has supported TCFD-based disclosure standards that would provide uniform and consistent information to stakeholders, while minimizing the potential for duplication and redundancy. Aegon expects that these efforts will support the transition to a more sustainable economy.\n\n## Metrics and targets Own operations\n\nAegon measures and reports annually on its operational carbon footprint. Our main operations (the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and AAM) have been carbon neutral since 2016 by reducing their facility-level emissions and supporting offset projects. In 2019, we extended the scope of our offsetting to cover all of our wholly-owned operations. An/uni00A0overview of our total operational emissions can be found on page 392, Value Created (Society/Operational Footprint).\n\nIn line with our net-zero commitment announced in November 2021, Aegon has set a supporting target to reduce the carbon footprint of its operational activities by 25% by 2025, compared to the 2019 baseline. The target includes the consumption of natural gas and electricity. In 2021, the carbon footprint of Aegon's operational activities was 54% lower than 2019. While some of these reductions can be traced to our initiatives to stimulate hybrid working - which for instance led to the closing of several offices in Iowa in 2021 - there has also been a temporary benefit from fewer employees in the office due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we expect to reverse over time. Through implementing our hybrid working policy and other initiatives, we will work towards achieving our target. Aegon will also look towards expanding the scope of measurement of our greenhouse gas emissions and explore setting further targets against these in the future.",

The chart below provides an indication of active weight by region against both the absolute footprint and weighted average carbon intensity (WACI).\n\n## Active contribution by region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Methodology\n\nCorporate fixed income and listed equity metrics were calculated following the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) guidelines and include scope 1 and 2 emissions. For sovereign assets, Aegon follows a 'whole economy' approach based on country-level emissions and GDP. Weighted Average Carbon Intensity (WACI) was calculated in line with the TCFD's recommendations. Carbon risk for corporate issuers is measured using the Sustainalytics Carbon Risk Rating, while climate vulnerability for sovereign issues is measured using the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) Country Index. Target figures are set in line with Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance guidance.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAegon will seek to continue to improve its climate change strategy, governance, and approach to risk and opportunity measurement and implementation in the coming years. For example, in 2022 we expect to further enhance our 2025 targets to meet Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance membership requirements. As the company's experience with climate issues grows, Aegon will look to increase the breadth of disclosures and further incorporate climate considerations across the business as appropriate.",

We will embed in our decision-making environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues relevant to the insurance business.\n\nAs of December 2021, Aegon replaced its Responsible Business and Investment Committee (RBIC) with a Global Sustainability Board (GSB) that interfaces with Local Sustainability Boards in the business units. This step was taken to further integrate ESG topics across our organization. The GSB consists of relevant Management Board members, Local Sustainability Board Chairs and senior management. They discuss ESG matters related to the business and investing on a quarterly basis, and provide advice to Aegon's Executive Board. Additionally, as per our Executive Board's Remuneration Policy, at least 50% of a member's variable compensation must be determined by non-financial performance indicators, where at least one must be ESG-related. Moreover, a significant risk or compliance incident related to ESG may result in a malus adjustment or claw-back of a member's variable compensation.\n\nIn November 2021, Aegon signed up to the UN Global Compact and the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance. In support of this, Aegon's Responsible Investment Policy was updated in January 2022. All of our public ESG policies and frameworks are available at www.aegon.com.\n\nESG risks are covered by Aegon's risk universe. Risk management regularly interacts and cooperates on ESG risks, including climate risk. This is covered in more detail in the Sustainability section and the TCFD section of this report. Of note for 2021, were the climate scenarios run on our accounts to refine our understanding of our exposure to climate risk.\n\nWe are working on expanding our offering of products and services that factor in ESG criteria. In 2021, we enhanced our customer propositions in the Netherlands by introducing a new 'green' mortgage to help people pay for sustainable home improvements. Aegon Asset Management (AAM) and Aegon UK partnered with the Global Ethical Finance Initiative (GEFI) to introduce the new Aegon Global Sustainable Sovereign Bond Fund. Aegon UK also acquired Pension Geeks, a business specializing in connecting people with their finances through innovative engagement techniques, communication, and events.\n\nFrom a general investment perspective, ESG integration and active ownership are principles we follow across all decisions and portfolios. AAM is a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment.\n\nFor more information, please see: Business Environment Scan - page 10; Sustainability - pages 20-23; Sharing value with our stakeholders - pages 26-32; Policies and Procedures - pages 353-356;\n\nEnterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework - pages 73-77;\n\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures - pages 372-378.\n\nCONTINUED >\n\n## UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI)\n\nAegon is one of the founding signatories of the UNEP FI's Principles for Sustainable Insurance. The aim of the PSI is to make sure sustainability becomes 'business as usual'. The PSI comprises four basic principles. As a signatory, Aegon reports annually on the actions taken to implement the PSI's four principles, as shown in the following table.",

We will work together with governments,  regulators and other key stakeholders to promote  widespread action across society on ESG issues. | Aegon has a dedicated Global Government & Public Affairs department, whose aim is to  support regulators and lawmakers. We advocate worldwide for people to have access to  insurance and financial services, for people to be aware of opportunities for flexible  employment in old age and for governments to plan and provide for their citizens in an age  of increasing longevity. Aegon also encourages financial literacy around the world and  engages with individuals and policymakers in service of helping people to achieve wealth  and health wherever we can. Aegon is active in many international projects that aim to  fulfill this goal; for example, an Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD) working group on the future of work, and the Living, Learning, and Earning Longer  initiative led by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Within Aegon, our Silver Starters  program (developed jointly with the Leyden Academy on Vitality and Ageing) provides  online coaching to entrepreneurs aged 50 and over to promote lifelong learning and |\n| 4.

        "page_content": "## International Responsible Business Conduct (IRBC) Agreement in the insurance sector\n\nIn 2018, Aegon stated its intent to support the spirit and objectives of the Dutch International Responsible Business Conduct Agreement in the insurance sector (also known as 'the covenant'). By doing so, Aegon will attempt to act, where possible, in accordance with the objectives and undertakings agreed in the covenant and will be receptive to commitment, cooperation, and knowledge-sharing during the implementation of the covenant. The covenant is a collaborative initiative of the Dutch government, non-governmental organizations, and Dutch insurers.\n\nThe objective of the covenant is to prevent, mitigate, and/or remediate adverse impacts on stakeholders and the environment that are caused or contributed to by Aegon's investee companies The covenant asks insurance companies to apply investment policies and practices in accordance with the processes and principles of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nAegon N.V.'s Responsible Investment Policy draws heavily on the aforementioned Principles and Guidelines. To stipulate the relevance hereof, Aegon became a signatory to the UN Global Compact (UNGC) in November 2021. The Policy is instrumental to Aegon's investment practices as executed by Aegon Asset Management (Aegon AM), the company's global asset manager responsible for managing most of Aegon's investments.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, Aegon AM conducted a global investment screening to identify investee companies that allegedly breach the Principles and Guidelines, as well as the wider UNGC Principles (or are at risk of doing so). In addition, our screening exercise looked specifically at companies' supply chain oversight, biodiversity controversies, access-to-medicine programs, and labor rights controversies. Applying these findings, we set the prioritization for our engagement activity, which in 2021 saw Aegon AM initiate or continue engagements with over 60 companies.\n\nIn most cases, Aegon AM continues the process of engagement until we believe that the portfolio company is aligned with our policies, although exclusion ultimately remains an option. More information on the active ownership approach and practices on behalf of Aegon and other clients, see the Responsible Investment and Active Ownership reports published by Aegon AM.\n\nWith biodiversity being the IRBC's annual theme for 2021, Aegon AM actively participated in a series of dedicated collaborative engagements and in drafting a thematic framework. The framework brings together relevant information, international legislation and regulations, tips, and other support that insurers can use in relation to biodiversity. The engagements were geared toward reducing deforestation risks and providing relevant input and learnings. Together with signatories of the covenant including NGOs, Aegon AM supported engagement efforts with three major listed food companies processing, amongst others, meat and dairy products. With soy often being used as feed for cattle and with tropical forests in parts of Brazil being cleared for both soy production and use as pasture for grazing cattle, the selected companies were considered to be at risk of contributing to deforestation via their supply chain. Engagement focused on supply chain oversight regarding deforestation, sustainable use of soy, alternative sourcing, and the use of viable alternative protein sources. This included locally-sourced animal feed, nature-inclusive farming, and considerations on a different protein product selection, such as plant-based products.\n\nAs in previous years, good health and wellbeing (SDG 3) continues to be one of our focal topics. The continued ill-effects of the COVID-19 outbreak confirmed our decision to address access to adequate health services and improve access to medicine. To avoid situations in which health emergencies push people into bankruptcy or poverty, we believe it is crucial to strive for universal health coverage and sustainable financing for health. It is also the case that, in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant part of the global population still lacks sufficient and equitable access to vaccines. Based on the IRBC's 2020 annual theme, Aegon AM continued to emphasize access-to-medicine programs in its collaborative engagement and voting efforts, where considered to be effective.\n\nMitigating climate change (SDG 13) remains another focus area for Aegon. Please refer to the TCFD section for discussion of our actions and progress through 2021.",

Joint ventures are excluded. Responsible investment products and services may vary regionally. We have evaluated our approach to measuring assets under management (AuM) that follow exclusionary strategies, and have decided to narrow the definition thereof to make it more relevant. Although the Aegon N.V. Responsible Investment Policy and its mandated exclusions apply to all General Account assets of Aegon N.V. entities, we added a relevancy standard to our process to determine whether certain General Account asset classes should be counted in AuM subject to exclusions, given the applicability of the Aegon N.V. exclusion list to that asset class. The removal of asset classes such as commercial mortgage loans and US structured securities drove the decrease. Based on this evaluation, we re-stated 2020 figures.\n- 2  Utilize negative screening to avoid certain sectors, companies or practices based on specific criteria. Covers proprietary investments of Aegon Asset Management and funds of third party clients which are also aligned to those same criteria.\n- 3  Seek to outperform by emphasizing positive screening of issuers with better or improving ESG profiles relative to sector peers.\n- 4  Focus on issuers whose activities or practices are aligned with sustainability themes in an effort to generate competitive returns over the long term.\n- 5  Pursue financial returns alongside measurable positive social and/or environmental impact.\n- 6  With regards to engagement, through our investment exposure, and where appropriate, we look to build a constructive dialogue with the companies and bodies either bilaterally or as part of an investor consortium, as we promote responsible business practices. With regards to voting, for Aegon AM's relevant investment strategies that incorporate equities, we seek to execute votes in alignment with our engagement objectives and clients' best interests, often in favor of shareholder resolutions.\n- 7  Source Aegon AM as of December 31, 2021. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. Themes are divided according to the main issue. At times, there is more than one theme for an engagement. A small number of engagements were outsourced and therefore not included in this dataset.\n\nCONTINUED >",

received in tax. Part of the explanation for this is that certain tax-deductible items are not recognized in the Company's profit & loss statement but directly in equity. Additionally payments and refunds for prior years can impact the amounts paid or received in the current year. Furthermore, the 2021 US tax liability will be satisfied entirely by losses carryforwards and tax credits, including low income housing tax credits.\n- 2  Cash donations refer to charitable donations to charities and other non-profit organizations, done in accordance with the Aegon N.V. Charitable Donations Standards.\n- 3  Volunteering value is calculated using an average hourly employee expenses rate based total employment costs.\n\nCONTINUED >",
