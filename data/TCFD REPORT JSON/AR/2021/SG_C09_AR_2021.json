        "page_content": "## CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nThe Group returned to profitability with a net profit of $97.7 million and registered a 24.5% increase in revenue to $2.6 billion for FY 2021. Revenue contribution was led by the robust sales performance of our property development  segment,  which contributed 48% to total revenue. Our hotel operations segment marked a turnaround, with revenue from all regions - particularly in the US and Europe showing a strong increase in 2H 2021.\n\nWhilst the COVID-19 pandemic persists and geopolitical tensions present uncertainties, the resumption of travel, opening of borders and an overall resolution to push ahead to open economies provide cause for a positive global outlook. The Group's hotel operations segment is poised for a long-awaited rebound, boosted by imminent pent-up demand for tourism and corporate travel.\n\nIn 2022, the Board and Management will  swiftly  execute  our G rowth, E nhancement and T ransformation ( GET ) strategy and deliver on our commitment to enhancing shareholder value.\n\nWe  will  continue  reviewing  and optimising our hospitality portfolio through operational improvements, portfolio  restructuring,  asset repositioning and strategic divestments to extract value. We will be agile and opportunistic in redeploying our capital to acquire assets in resilient sectors to  enhance  growth  and  generate sustainable returns for shareholders.\n\nWith the Group's solid underlying fundamentals,  a  geographically diversified portfolio and a healthy balance sheet, we will continue to chart our post- COVID-19 corporate recovery.\n\nApart from hotel divestments, the Group can  also  benefit  from  the  sale  of M&C's interest in other commercial assets that have been held for longterm  investment,  such  as  Tanglin Shopping Centre. Through King's Tanglin Shopping Pte Ltd, M&C's wholly-owned subsidiary, we acquired our interest in the property in 1981 and currently own about 34.6% of share value and 60.2% of strata area. A public tender for the collective sale of Tanglin Shopping Centre closed on 22 February 2022 and received a top bid of $868 million, a premium of 10% over the reserve price. Upon completion of the transaction, we  will  realise  a  significant  capital gain from our investment.\n\n## Repositioning and Enhancements\n\nWe have also taken steps to reposition our assets to improve their performance and returns. In 2021, we expanded the footprint of our lifestyle hotel brand, M Social, with the debut of two properties in the US and Europe - M Social Hotel Times Square New York (M Social NY) and M Social Hotel Paris Opera (M Social Paris). Previously the Novotel New York Times Square, M Social NY opened in May 2021 and the property has turned in a strong performance and has been GOP positive. In September 2021, the former Millennium Hotel Paris Opera opened  following  a  rebranding  as M Social Paris, marking the first M Social property in Europe. We will continue the rollout of the M Social brand, with a second outpost in Europe planned in London's Knightsbridge and other markets like Phuket and Suzhou.\n\nThe Group continues to progress with other refurbishment works to enhance our assets and prepare them for the imminent recovery in the global hospitality sector.\n\n## New Developments\n\nIn Sunnyvale, California, the headquarters of many technology companies, we completed  Phase  1  -  a  250-unit residential development, which is over 80% leased. This asset is part of our Group's Private Rented Sector (PRS) portfolio, contributing to our recurring income stream. The remaining phase is the 263-room M Social Sunnyvale hotel.\n\nThe Group will also be completing the 295-room M Social Suzhou in 2023. Located in the heart of Suzhou Industrial Park and adjacent to the beautiful Jinji Lake, it will be our fifth M Social hotel in the world.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nThe Proposed Distribution in specie of units in CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) will reward CDL shareholders for their steadfast support of our Group and result in the accounting deconsolidation of CDLHT from the Group. With the deconsolidation, the Group would have the potential to book gains on any future sale of assets to CDLHT should the transaction value exceed the carrying book value of the assets. The Group will continue to be CDLHT's largest unitholder and its committed sponsor following the exercise.\n\nIn  addition  to  our  hotel  operations, our strong residential launch pipeline in  Singapore  and  overseas,  asset enhancements and redevelopment plans of our existing properties, and our fund management aspirations will be drivers of our growth plans. Our Group CEO has elaborated on our GET strategy in his statement.\n\nSince 2010, the Group embarked on our strategic diversification push to build our overseas property development platforms, complementing our core Singapore market. Today, we have an enviable global portfolio with total assets amounting to $23.9 billion, with 45% of the assets in Singapore and the remaining spread across our key overseas markets - China, the UK, Japan and Australia. Going forward, we are committed to renewing, optimising and transforming our asset portfolio to unlock latent value.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group has cash reserves of $2.2 billion and total cash and available undrawn committed bank facilities totalling $3.9 billion. Complemented by our capital recycling efforts, we have adequate firepower for expansion. The Group will exercise discipline in our investments and temper our growth ambitions with prudence to maintain a strong liquidity position.\n\n## REVITALISING OUR GROWTH STORY\n\n2022 started with the optimism of a global economic recovery, with many countries easing international travel restrictions and  streamlining  border  controls. Despite the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which remains unpredictable, we stay focused on repositioning and growing our business, pushing ahead on our path towards full financial recovery.\n\nOne of our Group's key engines for growth is our hospitality arm. Since the 1970s, we have amassed a portfolio of valuable assets through strategic acquisitions and geographical expansion. Many of these assets have been held at book value for decades. Today, our Group is a sizeable hotel owner and operator, with over 130 hotels and more than 40,000 rooms worldwide.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, the hospitality industry has been among the sectors hardest hit. Our prescient move to privatise our hotel arm, Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) in November 2019 placed us in a strong position to restructure the business and steer it decisively through the operational challenges. It also enabled us greater flexibility in unlocking the deep value of M&C's portfolio at the right time.\n\n## Divestments\n\nIn  December,  we  announced  the divestment of Millennium Hilton Seoul and its adjoining land for KRW 1.1 trillion ($1.25 billion). I led the acquisition of this asset in the late 1990s, and since then, we have steadfastly invested in the hotel, driven optimal performance and extracted good value from the property. I have always believed that this would be an asset that could provide tremendous value to shareholders at the right time and at the right price. The successful divestment of this property (which was completed on 24 February 2022), at a significant premium to book value, will enable the Group to realise a substantial gain estimated at $528.8 million.\n\nThe sale of the Seoul assets marks the Group's third hotel divestment since the M&C privatisation and the most significant hotel divestment to date. The previous two M&C hotel divestments completed were Millennium Hotel Cincinnati and Copthorne Hotel Birmingham.\n\n## APPRECIATION\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our shareholders, customers, business associates and partners for your unwavering support.\n\nWe bade farewell to two Independent Non-Executive Directors during the year, Mr Tan Poay Seng who retired at the 2021 AGM, and Ms Jenny Lim Yin Nee. We also welcomed our new Independent Non-Executive Director, Mrs Wong Ai Ai, who brings fresh insights and strong legal expertise. To my fellow Directors, I am grateful for your invaluable stewardship,  counsel  and  guidance as we strive to unleash our Group's fullest potential.\n\nTo our shareholders, thank you for your confidence in our Group and for journeying with us through the challenging period. For FY 2021, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 8.0 cents per share and a special final dividend of 1.0 cent per share. Additionally, the Board proposes to reward shareholders with  a  special  distribution in  specie of 144,300,000 stapled securities in CDLHT on a pro rata basis, estimated to be valued at 19.1 cents per share. Together with the special interim dividend of 3.0 cents per share declared in mid2021, the total full-year distribution to shareholders is expected to be 31.1 cents per share 1 .\n\nFinally, to the management and staff, thank you for your steadfast dedication and diligence. The resilience and tenacity you have shown in navigating the business challenges truly reflect the Group's spirit and core values.\n\nWe successfully weathered one of the worst storms in our past 59 years. Together, we achieved a remarkable turnaround in our financial performance and built strength and resilience from the  many  lessons  learnt.  With  the Group's solid underlying fundamentals, a geographically diversified portfolio and a healthy balance sheet, we will continue to chart our growth trajectory with renewed vigour and revitalised perspectives.\n\nKwek Leng Beng Executive Chairman",

We battled numerous challenges to overcome the disruption from the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the stringent cooling measures in China's property market. Embracing the resilient spirit that is core to our DNA, we navigated the headwinds resolutely and returned to profitability.\n\nThe  Group  is  well-positioned  to redeploy capital to higher growth assets and expand our diversified portfolio.  Revitalised  by  the  new perspectives we have gained over the past two years, along with the improving macroeconomic conditions and a brighter outlook, we resume our growth journey with renewed confidence, backed by resiliency and strong fundamentals.\n\nDespite the turbulent conditions we faced in 2021, the Group continues to  execute  on  our GET ( G rowth, E nhancement and T ransformation) strategy to renew and reposition our business, sharpen our value proposition and expand our asset portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## REVITALISED\n\n## GROWTH\n\nBuild a development pipeline and recurring income streams\n\n## ENHANCEMENT\n\nEnhance asset portfolio and drive operational efficiency\n\n## TRANSFORMATION\n\nTransform via strategic investments, new platforms and innovation\n\nAsset  rejuvenation  and  portfolio enhancement are key pillars of our GET strategy. The Group forged ahead with  several  of  such  initiatives  for 2021, including Asset Enhancement Initiatives (AEIs) as well as redevelopment opportunities  that  will  allow  us  to unlock asset value and capitalise on incentive schemes.\n\nIn December, the Group announced our plans for our Central Mall properties into a large-scale mixed-use project following the acquisition of Central Square. The enlarged site, comprising office, retail, hospitality and potentially a residential component, will be redeveloped under the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)'s Strategic Development Incentive Scheme. This exciting rejuvenation complements the revitalisation of the Singapore River planning area and is anticipated to yield a significant GFA uplift.\n\nWe also continued to progress with our redevelopment plans for our mature freehold  asset  at  80  Anson  Road (former Fuji Xerox Towers) under the URA CBD Incentive Scheme. Demolition works have started and construction is expected to begin in late 2022. The development is the first to achieve the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy (SLE) certification, with SLE certification for the residential, serviced apartments, office and retail categories.\n\nApart  from  these  two  large-scale redevelopment projects, the Group has also embarked on AEIs to reposition and refresh our asset portfolio. In 2021, we commenced an AEI for our mall located at Orchard Road, Palais Renaissance, to upgrade the common areas and increase its F&B provision, which is expected to fully complete by 1H 2022. With the AEI, committed occupancy for the retail space has improved to above 90%. Over in the UK, AEIs at both Aldgate House and 125 Old Broad Street are underway and these initiatives are expected to bolster rental rates. In Thailand, we will embark on a major AEI of the Jungceylon retail complex in Patong, Phuket, to increase the net lettable area with exciting new-to-market concepts and a refreshed trade mix.\n\n## Forging Ahead with Transformation\n\nSince  we  privatised  Millennium  & Copthorne Hotels Limited (M&C) in\n\n## Building a Solid Development Pipeline\n\nIn  2021,  we  completed  a  series  of strategic acquisitions and investments. In Singapore, we secured two land sites - located at Northumberland Road and Tengah Garden Walk - in 1H 2021 through the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme with our joint venture (JV) partner MCL Land. In November, we also entered into an off-market agreement to acquire a residential development parcel at 798 and 800 Upper Bukit Timah Road. With the completion of this transaction in 1H 2022, along with a recent GLS site acquisition at Jalan Tembusu in January 2022 and our other existing development sites, we have built a significant launch pipeline of around 2,350 units.\n\nIn the UK, we expanded our Private Rented Sector (PRS) portfolio with the acquisition of a 250-year leasehold site in Birmingham's vibrant Paradise precinct, on which we will develop The Octagon, an iconic 49-storey residential tower with 370 units, that will be the world's tallest  pure  octagonal  residential skyscraper when completed in 2025. Our other PRS project in the UK, the 665-unit The Junction in Leeds, will be completing in phases commencing in late 2022.\n\nOver in Australia, we replenished our landbank with the acquisition of Kenmore Treetops, a 97-unit residential JV project in  Brisbane,  with  Brisbane-based developer Metro Group.\n\nTo ensure a stable launch pipeline and optimal  inventory levels, the Group will continue to actively replenish our landbank through the GLS programme or selective private acquisitions. We will also  enhance  our  recurring  income portfolio, focusing on the Living Sector comprising asset classes such as the PRS, senior housing, workers' dormitories and student accommodations, which offer  income  stability  and  strong growth potential.\n\n## Rejuvenating our Asset Portfolio\n\nRecent macroeconomic events, especially the pandemic and the ongoing Ukraine crisis, are fitting reminders that we cannot be overly reliant on a specific geography or asset class. We must continue to build a diversified portfolio, which will enable us to tap on various sustainable income streams to weather cyclical headwinds.\n\n2019, we have undertaken a holistic review of our entire hospitality portfolio. Our ongoing portfolio review is centred on a three-pronged approach: capital recycling to streamline the portfolio and unlock value through opportunistic divestments, portfolio restructuring and asset repositioning to improve performance, and driving operational efficiency through the reorganisation of structures and processes.\n\nOur  capital  recycling  focus,  as demonstrated by the divestment of Millennium Hilton Seoul for KRW 1.1 trillion ($1.25 billion) in 2021, and more recently, of our interest in the stratatitled Tanglin Shopping Centre through a collective sale tender that closed in  February  2022,  allows  us  to unlock the deep value of these two investment assets, which have been held for several decades.\n\nThe Proposed Distribution in specie of CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) units to our shareholders is another positive outcome of the strategic review of our hospitality portfolio. Its completion would reward shareholders for their support and result in an accounting deconsolidation of CDLHT from the Group. Apart from strengthening our balance  sheet,  the  Group  will  also be well-positioned to unlock value from our hospitality portfolio through future value-accretive transactions with CDLHT. Shareholders will also have the opportunity to participate in the growth of the hospitality sector, which is on the cusp of a strong postpandemic recovery.\n\n## EMERGING STRONGER\n\nIn 2021, we made the difficult decision to divest our entire equity interest in Sincere Property Group. This was to mitigate the Group from being engaged in a long, drawn out bankruptcy reorganisation of Sincere Property Group and we will continue to actively pursue our rights as a creditor.\n\nBarring further disruptions from the pandemic,  we  look  forward  to  the workforce gradually returning to the office in 2022. Collaboration at the office still plays a pivotal role in nurturing stronger teamwork and enhanced productivity, and allows for more effective mentorship and knowledge growth.\n\nSince the start of 2022, geopolitical conflicts have cast a shadow on global recovery.  These  events  are  a  stark reminder that the future is marked with unpredictability and the business environment is also changing rapidly. We must be better prepared for unforeseen events and strengthen our resilience.\n\n## APPRECIATION\n\nOn behalf of Senior Management, I wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our shareholders, customers, business associates  and  partners  for  your unwavering support throughout the turbulent year. We are also grateful to our Board of Directors for their guidance and counsel.\n\nTo our valued employees, I am humbled by your loyalty and resilience in pushing through  the  storm.  Your  steadfast commitment has been integral to our growth and recovery plans.\n\nWe have a renewed focus to revitalise our business. Together, we will push forward to bring our plans to fruition, with the aim of delivering excellence and maximising value for all our stakeholders.\n\n## Sherman Kwek\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer",

Further details of these policies are described in the segment entitled 'Corporate Values and Conduct of Business' at the end of this report.\n\n## Board Orientation and Training (Provision 1.2)\n\nEach newly appointed Director receives a formal letter, setting out his general duties and obligations as a Director pursuant to the relevant legislations and regulations. The new Director will also receive an electronic induction pack containing information and documents relating to the roles, duties and responsibilities of a director (and where applicable, as a member of the Committees), the Group's principal businesses, the Company's Board processes and corporate governance practices, relevant Company policies and procedures as well as a board meeting calendar for the year with a brief of the routine agenda for each meeting of the Board and where applicable, the Committees.\n\nThe  Company  also  conducts  a comprehensive induction programme for newly appointed Directors and for existing Directors pursuant to their appointments to any of the Committees, which seeks to familiarise Directors with the Group's principal businesses, the Company's governance practices and processes, internal controls and risk management systems, their responsibilities as directors and in the case of appointments to any of the Committees, the roles and areas of responsibilities of such Committees. The induction programme includes meetings with various key executives of the Management to allow the new Directors to be acquainted with the Management team and to facilitate their independent access to the Management team in\n\nfuture. The programme also includes briefings by the Management team on key areas of the Company's operations.\n\nFor a first-time Director who has no prior experience as a director of a listed company, in addition to the induction as detailed above, he or she will be required to also attend certain specific modules of the Listed Entity Director ('LED') Programme conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors ('SID') in order to acquire relevant knowledge of what is expected of a listed company director, this being a mandatory requirement under Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited ('SGX-ST') Listing Rules ('the Mandatory Training'). Completion of the LED Programme, which focuses on comprehensive training of company directors on compliance, regulatory and corporate governance matters, should provide the first-time Director with a broad understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company under the requirements of the Companies Act 1967, the Listing Manual and the 2018 Code. A first-time director need not attend the Mandatory Training if the NC, in assessing the relevant experience of the director, is satisfied that he/she possesses relevant experience comparable to that of a person who has served as a director of an issuer listed on SGX-ST. Where such an assessment is made by the NC, the reasons are disclosed in the announcement made on the appointment of the director.\n\nThe Directors are also provided with updates and/or briefings from time to time by professional advisers, auditors, the Management and the Company Secretaries in areas such as directors' duties and responsibilities, corporate governance practices, relevant legislations and regulations, risk management and financial reporting standards. The Directors are also regularly kept informed by the Company Secretaries of the availability of relevant courses, conferences and seminars including those conducted by the SID, and the Directors are encouraged to attend such training at the Company's expense. The NC and the Board are kept\n\ninformed of the trainings attended by the Directors during the year. As part of the NC's annual assessment of the skill sets of the Board and the Committees, the NC will also recommend further training for the Directors in specific areas, if so required, to supplement the regular updates/ briefings provided to the Directors from time to time.\n\nDuring the year, some of the trainings attended by the Directors included the ACRA-SGX-SID Audit Committee Seminar 2021, SID Directors Conference 2021, SID Corporate Governance Roundup 2021, SGX Regulatory Symposium, SID AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series, SGX Sustainability  Reporting  Review 2021, INSEAD International Directors Programme, briefings and seminars organised by SID, audit professionals and other consultants in relation to audit committee matters, remuneration committee matters, risk management and sustainability matters.\n\nIn addition, in-house seminars were also organised in 2021 and conducted by invited external speakers on the following topics:\n\n- \u00b7   Insights from latest reports on corporate governance, sustainability and climate reporting\n- \u00b7   Summary on SGX's proposals on sustainability reporting and climaterelated reporting and how listed companies can brace themselves for mandatory climate-related reporting\n- \u00b7    Sustainability and the rising expectation of Boards to play a bigger role in driving ESG\n- \u00b7   Internal audit and external assurance for sustainability reports; necessity of materiality assessments\n- \u00b7   Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) reporting and climate change scenario planning\n- \u00b7   Geopolitics\n- \u00b7   Data ethics and advanced analytics and artificial intelligence\n\nMembers of the ARC were also provided with regular briefings from the Company's external auditors on applicable Accounting Standards and Tax Updates during the year.\n\nIn addition to the training courses/programmes and briefing updates, Directors are also at liberty to approach Management should they require any further information or clarification concerning the Company's operations.\n\n75% of the Board attended various training seminars and workshops in 2021\n\nAccounted for more than 234.75 training hours in aggregate\n\n## Board Approval (Provision 1.3)\n\nKey matters which are specifically reserved for approval by the Board include the decisions over the strategic direction, plans and performance objectives of the Group (including its risk appetite); the Group's financial objectives and annual budget; decisions to commence, discontinue or modify significantly any business activity or to enter into or withdraw from a particular market sector which have or may have material impact on the profitability or performance of the Group; corporate or financial restructuring; decisions over new borrowings or amendments to the terms and conditions of existing borrowings; adoption of key corporate policies and corporate governance practices and any other matters which require the Board's approval as prescribed under the relevant legislations and regulations as well as the provisions of the Company's Constitution. All issuance of the Group's financial results requires the approval of the Board, including decisions with regard to the Company's dividend policy and payouts.\n\nAligned with the Group's strategy to develop growth platforms in Singapore and key international markets, the Board has put in place an approval matrix with established authority limits in connection with the Group's investments and divestments, including funds and corporate holdings. The approval matrix is revised and updated when necessary, in line with the Group's strategic objectives.\n\n=\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement is fully apprised of such matters which require the approval of the Board or the Committees. For operational efficiency, the Company also has a structured approval limits matrix which sets out the delegated authority to various levels of Management to approve operating expenditure up to pre-determined limits.\n\n## Delegation by the Board (Provision 1.4)\n\nThe primary functions of the Board are either carried out directly by the Board or delegated to the Committees with clear written terms of reference setting out their compositions, authorities and duties, including reporting back to the Board. The Committees established by the Board are the ARC, the NC, the RC and the BSC, all collectively referred to hereafter as the 'Committees'.\n\nEach Committee reports key matters to the Board at Board Meetings and submit its report at least once on an annual basis.\n\nAll terms of reference for the Committees  are approved by the Board and reviewed annually to ensure their continued relevance, taking into account the changes in the governance and regulatory environment.\n\nThe delegation of authority by the Board to the Committees enables the Board to achieve operational efficiency by empowering these Committees to decide, review and make recommendations on matters within their respective written terms of reference and/or limits of delegated authority, without abdicating the Board's overall responsibility.\n\nThe Board Committee, which was established to assist the Board in approving routine and operational matters, including inter alia banking matters such as opening, closing and maintenance of banking accounts, operational matters relating to property development activities, was disbanded with effect from 3 May 2021. Approval of matters previously delegated to the Board Committee has now come under the direct purview of the Management and/or the Board, as appropriate.\n\nPlease refer to the sections on Principles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 in this report for further information on the activities of the NC, RC and ARC. Information on the activities of the BSC can be found under the 'Sustainability' segment towards the end of this report.\n\n## Board  and  Board  Committees Meetings (Provision 1.5)\n\nMeetings of the Board and Committees are held regularly, with the Board meeting no less than four times a year. Four Board meetings were held in 2021. At the regular Board meetings, the Board agenda includes updates by the Management on the Group's strategic initiatives and implementation status, updates on the Group's investments and developments, and the review of the Group's financial and operational performance. Of the four scheduled meetings, two are half-yearly Board meetings mainly to review and approve the Group's financial results, and two are scheduled primarily for the Board to focus on the review of the Company's strategic direction, including specific business strategies, business segmental",

Meetings of the IDs are convened as often as may be warranted by circumstances. The IDs also meet regularly under the various Committees and the Lead ID is a member of some of these Committees.\n\nThe proposed meetings for the Board and all Committees for each new calendar year are set out in a schedule of meetings, which is notified to all Board members before the start of that calendar year. Additional meetings are convened as and when circumstances warrant.\n\nRecords of all such meetings, including discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken, are maintained by the Company Secretaries. The Company's Constitution allows for the meetings of its Board and the Committees to be held via teleconferencing and videoconferencing. The Board and the Committees may also make decisions by way of circulating written resolutions.\n\nThe attendance (including via electronic means) of the Directors at the Annual General Meeting of the Company ('AGM') and meetings of the Board and the Committees, as well as the frequency of such meetings in 2021, is disclosed in the table below. Directors who were unable to attend any meetings of the Board or the Committees, were provided with the meeting materials and encouraged to raise discussion points or queries\n\nwith the Board Chairman or respective Committee chairman or the Management. Nonetheless, the Board is of the view that the contribution of each Director should not be focused solely on his/her attendance at meetings of the Board and/or the Committees. A Director's contribution should also extend beyond the confines of the formal environment of such meetings, through the sharing of views, advice, experience and strategic networks which would further the interests of the Company. The Directors, whether individually or collectively, also engage with the Management, heads of the Group's business units and departments and the Group's external consultants in order to better understand the challenges faced by the Group and the input of the Directors, through such engagements, provide invaluable perspective to the Management.\n\n## Directors' Attendance (including via

Directors, including Mr Kwek Leng Beng (the Chairman of the Board), Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny (then chairman of the ARC and the RC), Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok (then chairman of the NC) and Mr Sherman Kwek Eik Tse (the Group CEO/the chairman of the BSC), were in attendance at the AGM in 2021 together with the key management personnel and the Company's external auditors. The AGM was held via electronic means.\n- (3) Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok was unable to attend the IDs' Meeting as he had prior engagement.\n- (5) Mr Chong Yoon Chou was appointed as a member of the NC on 3 May 2021.\n- (4) Mr Daniel Marie Ghislain Desbaillets was appointed as a member of the RC on 3 May 2021.\n- (6) Ms Chan Swee Liang Carolina was appointed as a member of the ARC on 3 May 2021.\n- (8) Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny resigned as a Director on 3 May 2021. Consequent to her resignation, she also ceased as the Lead ID and chairman of both the ARC and the RC.\n- (7) Mr Tan Poay Seng retired as a Director on 30 April 2021. Consequent to his retirement, he also ceased to be a member of the BSC.\n\n## Directors' Multiple Board Representations and Time Commitments (Provision 1.5)\n\nWhen considering the re-nomination of Directors for re-election, the NC considers the competing time commitments faced by Directors with multiple board representations and/ or other principal commitments. An analysis of the directorships (which includes directorships by groups and executive appointments) held by the Directors is reviewed annually by the NC. Each Director is also required to confirm annually to the NC as to whether he or she has any issue with competing time commitments which may impact his or her ability to provide sufficient time and attention to his or her duties as a Director of the Company. Based on the analysis, the Directors' annual confirmation and the Directors' commitments and contributions to the Company which are also evident in their level of attendance and participation at Committee and IDs' meetings, the NC is satisfied that all Directors are able to carry out and have been adequately carrying out their duties as a Director of the Company.\n\nThe NC noted that, including the directorship held in the Company, the number of listed company board representations currently held by each of the Directors ranged from one to two in number and those held by Mr Kwek Leng Beng are on the boards of the related companies of the Company. The NC has recommended that the maximum number of listed company board representations which each Director of the Company may hold be set at six, with a view to providing a guide to address potential competing time commitments that may be faced by Directors serving on multiple listed company boards. The NC may review this guideline from time to time and will also consider the circumstances of individual Directors or potential candidates with multiple listed company directorships above the recommended number to determine their capacity to participate and contribute effectively to the Board.\n\nA policy has also been put in place for Directors to consult the Board Chairman or the chairman of the NC with regard to accepting any new listed company board appointment or principal commitment and notifying the Board of any changes in their external appointments. This would allow the Director to review his or her time commitments with the proposed new appointment and in the case of an ID, to also ensure that his or her independence would not be affected.\n\n## Complete, Adequate and Timely Information (Provision 1.6)\n\nPrior to each meeting, members of the Board and the Committees are provided with the meeting agenda and the relevant papers submitted by the Management, containing complete, adequate and timely information to enable full deliberation on the issues to be considered at the respective meetings. The Management is in attendance at such meetings, whilst the Company's auditors and professional advisers who can provide additional insight into the matters for discussion are invited as required to attend the relevant meetings. The Management also provides all Directors with monthly updates on the Company's financial performance including an analysis of the same, with material variances between the comparative periods disclosed and explained. Where the Board's or a Committee's approval is sought, relevant background and explanatory information on the specific matter are provided to enable Directors to understand the issues and to request for further information, as necessary.\n\nDraft agendas for Board and Committee meetings are circulated in advance to the Board Chairman and the Committee chairman respectively, for them to review and suggest items for the agenda. The Board and the Committees are also furnished routine reports, where applicable, from the Management. The chairman of the ARC, NC, RC and BSC provides an annual report of the respective Committees' activities during the year under review to the Board. The minutes of\n\nmeetings of the Committees are circulated to all Board members.\n\n## Access to Management, Company Secretaries and Independent Professional Advice (Provision 1.7)\n\nAll Directors have direct and independent access to the Management. To facilitate this access, all Directors are provided the contact details of the key management personnel and other senior management team members. The contact details of the heads of internal audit and risk management are also provided to the ARC.\n\nThe Directors, whether as a group or individually, are entitled to take independent professional advice at the expense of the Company, in furtherance of their duties and where circumstances warrant the same. The Company has in place internal guidelines allowing the Directors to seek such independent professional advice.\n\nThe Company Secretaries, whose appointment and removal are subject to the Board's approval, attend all meetings of the Board and the Committees to provide guidance for Board procedures to be followed. The Company Secretaries, together with the Management, also ensure that the Company complies with applicable statutory and regulatory rules. Together with the Management, the Company Secretaries also advise the Board Chairman, the Board and the Committees on corporate governance matters and assist to implement and strengthen corporate governance practices and processes, including ensuring good information flow within the Board and the Committees and between the Directors and Management, facilitating the induction for newly appointed Directors and newly appointed Committee members, and assisting in the continuing training and development programme for the Directors. On an ongoing basis, the Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance\n\n## Board Independence (Provisions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3)\n\nThe Board currently comprises nine members. All members of the Board, except for the Board Chairman, the Group CEO and Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok, are IDs. Based on the NC's recommendation, the Board has determined six of them, being more than half of the Board, to be independent ('6 IDs'), thus providing for a strong and independent element on the Board capable of exercising objective judgement on the corporate affairs of the Company. No individual or small group of individuals dominate the Board's decision-making. No alternate Directors have been appointed in respect of any of the Directors.\n\nWhen reviewing the independence of the 6 IDs, the NC has considered the applicable Listing Rule 210(5)(d) and the guidelines for independence set out in Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code. As part of the consideration, the NC also took into account the 6 IDs' other directorships, annual declarations regarding their independence, disclosures of interest in transactions in which they have a direct/ indirect interest, their ability to avoid any apparent conflicts of interests especially by abstaining from deliberation on such transactions and their ability to maintain objectivity in their conduct as Directors of the Company.\n\nMr Ong Lian Jin Colin, an ID, is a director of Summervale Properties Pte. Ltd. ('Summervale') which had entered into an Asset Management and Marketing Agreement with Trentwell Management Pte Ltd ('Trentwell'), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for Trentwell to manage and market Summervale's residential units at Nouvel 18. Mr Ong is not involved in the daily operations of and does not hold any executive position in Summervale or its holding company,\n\nGreen 18 Pte. Ltd. other than being a board member of both companies and a shareholder of Green 18 Pte. Ltd. holding less than 5% shareholding. The Board has concurred with the NC's determination that Mr Ong's independence is not affected by this relationship between Trentwell and Summervale.\n\nIn accordance with Listing Rule 210(5) (d), none of the 6 IDs are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations. None of the 6 IDs have immediate family members who are currently employed or have been employed at any time during the past three financial years by the Company or any of its related corporations, and whose remuneration is determined by the RC. For purposes of determining independence, the 6 IDs have also provided confirmation that they are not related to the Directors or to any shareholders holding 5% interest in the Company. The NC is satisfied that there is no other relationship which could affect their independence. The Directors undertook a review of their independence, with each ID abstaining from participating in his/her own review by the Board and had concurred with the NC's determination of the independence of the 6 IDs.\n\nPursuant to Listing Rule 210(5)(d)(iii), Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok who has served the Board for more than nine years has ceased to be independent with effect from 1 January 2022. The Company did not seek the requisite approval for Mr Yeo's continued appointment as an ID at the 2021 AGM of the Company. Notwithstanding the Company's earlier announcement of Mr Yeo's intention to step down from the Board before 31 December 2021, the NC, upon further consideration, had recommended and the Board had concurred, with Mr Yeo abstaining from the recommendation,\n\nthat Mr Yeo remain on the Board to maintain a balance of experienced and new IDs on the Board. Mr Yeo consented to the appointment and in this regard, he has been re-designated from an Independent non-Executive Director to a non-Independent non-Executive Director ('NED') with effect from 1 January 2022.\n\n## Board Composition, Size and Diversity (Provision 2.4)\n\n## Board Diversity Pledge\n\nThe Board welcomes the push for greater diversity in the boardroom which can provide a more diverse approach to business decisionmaking and the Company had, on 28 August 2015, supported the Board Diversity Pledge initiated by SID and SGX-ST where the Company pledged its commitment to promote 'diversity as a key attribute of a well-functioning and effective Board' and shared the view 'that a diverse Board will enhance decision-making by harnessing the variety of skills, industry and business experiences, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and nationalities, tenure of service, and other distinguishing qualities of the members of the Board.'\n\nThe NC reviews the size and composition mix of the Board and the Committees annually. At the recommendation of the NC, the Board adopted a formal Board Diversity Policy in 2017, setting out its policy and framework for promoting diversity on the Board. The Board Diversity Policy is available on the Company's corporate website. The Board recognises that a diverse Board is an important element which will better support the Company's achievement of its strategic objectives for sustainable development by enhancing the decision-making process of the Board through the perspectives derived from the various skills, business experience, industry discipline, gender, age, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and nationalities, tenure of service and other distinguishing qualities of the Directors.\n\nWhen reviewing and assessing the composition of the Board and making recommendations to the Board for the appointment of Directors, the NC will consider all aspects of diversity in order to arrive at an optimum balanced composition of the Board.\n\nThe Board has adopted the NC's initial recommended target to achieve a level of at least 20% female representation on its Board by 2020. With Mrs Carol Fong and\n\n## Board Composition, Diversity and Balance\n\n## Independence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGender Diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMrs Wong Ai Ai on the Board currently, it has continued to achieve its target of 20% female representation. Mrs Wong Ai Ai has also been appointed as a member of the NC.\n\nThe NC noted the recommendation of the Council for Board Diversity for listed companies to have 25% female representation on their boards by 2025 and 30% by 2030. In this regard, the NC will try to ensure that:\n\n- (a)  if external search consultants are used to search for candidates for Board appointments, the brief will include a requirement to present female candidates;\n- (b)  when seeking to identify a new Director for appointment to the Board, the NC will request female candidates to be fielded for consideration;\n- (c)  female representation on the Board be continually improved over time based on the set objectives of the Board; and\n- (d)  at least one female Director continues to be appointed to the NC.\n\nThe final decision on the selection of Directors will be based on merits against objective criteria that complement and\n\nexpand the skills and experience of the Board as a whole, and having regard to the overall balance and effectiveness of a diverse Board.\n\nThe Board currently comprises business leaders and professionals with real estate, hospitality, financial (including audit, accounting, tax and investment), legal, risk management, fund management and business management qualifications and backgrounds. When reviewing candidates for future Board appointment, the NC will be considering candidates from other disciplines such as  information technology and digital transformation, in order to provide more diverse viewpoints and introduce additional skill sets to the Board.\n\nThe Board has two female members, and Directors with ages ranging from the mid40s to early-80s, who have served on the Board for different tenures. The members of the Board with their combined business, management and professional experience, knowledge and expertise, provide the core competencies to allow for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group's business and direction. Further information on the individual Directors' background, experience and skills can be found in the 'Board of Directors' section in the Annual Report 2021 ('AR').\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board will however continue to review opportunities to refresh the Board with a view to expanding the skills, experience and diversity of the Board as a whole.\n\n## NEDs' Participation (Provision 2.5)\n\nNEDs are encouraged to participate actively at Board meetings in the development of the Company's strategic plans and direction, and in the review and monitoring of Management's performance against targets. To facilitate this, they are kept informed of the Company's businesses and performance through monthly reports from the Management and have unrestricted access to the Management. They also sit on various Committees established by the Board to provide unbiased and independent views, constructive input and the independent review and monitoring of performance of the Company and Management. One meeting of the IDs, chaired by the Lead ID, was held in 2021 without the presence of Management. The IDs would also confer among themselves without the presence of Management as and when the need arises. The Lead ID collates the feedback from the IDs and communicates the same to the Board and/or the Board Chairman as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Roles of the Executive Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer (Provisions 3.1 and 3.2)\n\nThe roles of Chairman of the Board and the Group CEO are separate to ensure a clear division of responsibilities and increased accountability.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, is also the Executive Board Chairman. Mr Kwek Leng Beng plays an instrumental role in providing the Company with strong leadership and vision, leading the Board in its review of the Group's strategies for sustainable growth. As the Board Chairman with written terms of reference approved by the Board, Mr Kwek Leng Beng also promotes and leads the Group in its commitment to achieve and maintain high standards of corporate governance. He bears primary responsibility for the workings of the Board, by ensuring effectiveness in all aspects of its role including setting the agenda for Board meetings with input from Management, ensuring sufficient allocation of time for thorough discussion of key agenda items at Board meetings, promoting an open environment within the Boardroom for constructive debate, encouraging the NEDs to speak freely and contribute effectively, and exercising control over the quality, quantity and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management. At AGMs and other shareholders' meetings, he plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, the Board and Management.\n\nAs Executive Board Chairman, he is the most senior executive in the Company\n\nbe resolved or are inappropriate to raise through the normal communication channels of the Board Chairman or the Management. No query or request on any matter which requires the Lead ID's attention was received from shareholders in 2021. Under the chairmanship of the Lead ID, a meeting of the IDs was convened in 2021 without the presence of Management or the Board Chairman, and the views expressed by the IDs at these meetings were communicated by the Lead ID to the Board Chairman and the Management, as appropriate.\n\n## Principle 4: Board Membership\n\n## NC Composition and Role (Provisions 4.1 and 4.2)\n\nFour out of the five members of the NC, including the NC chairman, are independent Directors. The Lead ID is one of the independent members of the NC.\n\nThe NC's responsibilities as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are to examine Board size, review all Board and Committees composition and membership, board succession plans for the Directors (including the Board Chairman and the Group CEO) and the key management personnel ('KMP') who are not Directors, determine each Director's independence annually and as and when circumstances require, evaluate performance of the Board, Committees and the individual Directors, review appointments and re-appointment of Directors (including alternate directors, if any) and the reasons for resignations of Directors, review appointments and the reasons for resignations and terminations of the KMP who are not Directors, review and confirm the induction programmes for newly appointed Directors and for existing Directors in respect of their appointments to any of the Committees and review the training and continuous professional development programme for the Directors. The Company has identified the Group CEO, who is also a Director, the Group Chief Operating Officer ('Group COO'), the Group General Manager ('Group GM'), the Group Chief Investment Officer ('Group CIO') and the Group Chief Financial Officer ('Group\n\nand bears overall executive responsibility for the Group's business. Mr Kwek Leng Beng is assisted by the Group CEO, Mr Sherman Kwek. The Group CEO leads the members of the Management team and is responsible for implementing and reviewing the business direction and strategies for the Group as endorsed by the Board, and for operational performance  and  organisational excellence. He is the elder son of the Executive Board Chairman.\n\nThe Board has considered Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Board Chairman and the strengths he brings to such a role by virtue of his stature and experience. Through the establishment of various Committees with power and authority to perform key functions without the undue influence from the Board Chairman, and the putting in place of internal controls for proper accountability and to allow for effective oversight by the Board of the Company's business, the Board ensures that there is an appropriate balance of power which allows the Board to exercise objective decision-making in the best interests of the Company. The Board is of the view that Mr Kwek Leng Beng's role as an Executive Board Chairman would continue to facilitate the Group's decision-making and implementation process without diminishing the capacity of the Board for independent decision-making.\n\n## Lead Independent Director (Provision 3.3)\n\nCognisant that the Board Chairman is an Executive Director and thus not independent, the Board has designated a Lead ID who serves as a sounding board for the Board Chairman and as an intermediary between the NEDs/IDs and the Board Chairman. The current Lead ID is Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip who was appointed to the role on 3 May 2021.\n\nThe role of the Lead ID is set out in the written terms of reference for the Lead ID, which have been approved by the Board. The Lead ID is available to shareholders should they have concerns which cannot\n\nCFO'), who are the most senior members of the Management team, as its KMP.\n\nFour NC meetings were held in 2021. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all NC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the NC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('NC SelfAssessment Checklist'). The NC SelfAssessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the NC under its terms of reference and considered also the contributions of NC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at NC meetings.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the NC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## Nomination of Directors and Determination of Independence (Provisions 4.3 and 4.4)\n\nThe NC reviews annually the nomination of the relevant Directors for re-election as well as the independence of Directors. When considering the nomination of Directors for re-election, the NC takes into account their contribution to the effectiveness of the Board (which includes their participation and candour at Board and Committee meetings) as well as their time commitment especially for Directors who have multiple board representations and/or other principal commitments, and also reviews their independence having regard to the provisions in the applicable Listing Rule 210(5)(d) and Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code. The recommendation of the NC on the annual nomination of the Directors for re-election is submitted to the Board for decision and thereafter tabled at the AGM of the Company for consideration and approval by shareholders.\n\nThe Constitution of the Company provides that not less than one-third of the\n\nDirectors for the time being, shall retire as Directors at each AGM. All new Directors appointed by the Board shall hold office until the next AGM and are eligible for re-election at the said AGM.\n\nIn accordance with the Constitution of the Company, Mr Kwek Leng Beng, Mr Sherman Kwek Eik Tse and Mr Ong Lian Jin Colin are due to retire by rotation at the 59th Annual General Meeting ('2022 AGM'), and being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election at the 2022 AGM. Mrs Wong Ai Ai who was appointed by the Board prior to the 2022 AGM ('New Director'), will also retire and has offered herself for election at the 2022 AGM. The NC has considered their contribution and performance and recommended to the Board to nominate their re-election/ election at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Criteria and Process for Nomination and Selection of New Directors (Provision 4.3)\n\nThe NC interviews shortlisted candidates before  formally  considering  and recommending them for appointment to the Board and where applicable, to the Committees. Searches for potential candidates generally take into account recommendations from the Directors and various other sources, including candidates who may be suggested by SID, the Council for Board Diversity and other relevant organisations. Should it be necessary, the NC may consider the use of external search firms to find appropriate candidates. Shortlisted candidates would be required to furnish their curriculum vitae containing information on their academic/professional qualification, work experience, employment history and experience (if any) as directors of listed companies.\n\nIn reviewing and recommending to the Board any new Director appointments, the NC considers:\n\n- (a)  the candidate's track record, experience and capabilities or such other factors including age and gender, as may be determined by the NC to be relevant and which would contribute to the Board's collective skill set;",

Board renewal is a continuous process and in this regard, the NC reviews annually the composition of the Board and Committees, which includes size and mix, and recommends to the Board the selection and appointment of new Directors, whether in addition to the existing Board members or as replacement of retiring Board members, with a view to identifying any gaps in the Board's skill sets taking into account the Group's strategy and business operations. The Board will be able to function smoothly notwithstanding any resignation or retirement of any Director\n\ngiven the present number of members and mix of competencies on the Board.\n\n## Board Development (Provision 4.5)\n\nThe NC reviews the training and development of the Directors to ensure that Directors receive appropriate development on a continuing basis, to perform their roles on the Board and where applicable, the Committees. The Directors are provided with updates and/or briefings to assist them to properly discharge their duties. The briefings are conducted either internally with invited speakers, or externally, at the Company's expense. A separate programme is established for new Directors, details of which together with details of the internal briefing and updates provided to the Directors in 2021 are set out in the paragraph under the subject heading 'Board Orientation and Training' in this report.\n\nThe Board is kept apprised twice yearly on the list of training programmes attended by the Directors during the year.\n\nPrinciple 5: Board Performance\n\n## Board Evaluation Process (Provision 5.1)\n\nThe Company has in place a formal process for assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the various Committees and the contribution by each Director towards the effectiveness of the Board and the Committees. No external facilitator has been used. The NC assesses the Board's performance as a whole annually, using objective and appropriate criteria which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board. When assessing the overall Board performance, the NC takes into consideration the feedback from individual Directors on areas relating to the Board's role on strategy and performance, the Board's process and governance (including oversight on internal controls and risk management), the Board's competencies and effectiveness and the effectiveness of the Board Chairman. The results of the overall evaluation of the Board by the NC, including its recommendation, if any, for improvements, are presented to the Board.\n\nThe NC also undertook an evaluation of the performance of the Committees with the assistance of self-assessment checklists  completed  by  these Committees.\n\nThe annual evaluation process for the Board Chairman's and the individual Director's performance comprises two parts: (a) review of background information concerning the Director including his attendance records at Board, Committee and IDs' (where applicable) meetings; and (b) NC's evaluation based on certain assessment parameters, which were recommended by the NC and approved by the Board.\n\nWhen deliberating on the performance of a particular Director who is also a member of the NC, that member abstains from the discussions in order to avoid any conflict of interests.\n\nThe results of the individual evaluation of the Directors are also used by the NC, in its consultation with the Board Chairman (who is also a member of the NC), to review, where appropriate, the composition of the Board and Committees, and to support its proposals, if any, for appointment of new members and its recommendations for the reelection of retiring Directors. The Board Chairman, as a member of the NC, is fully apprised of the results of the performance evaluation for the individual Directors and would take into consideration such evaluation and act as appropriate on the recommendations of the NC. Comments from the Directors, if any, concerning the Board as a whole and the general performance of the Directors, are also presented to the Board.\n\n## Board Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\n\nThe qualitative criteria used by the NC to evaluate the Board covers six key areas relating to Board composition, Board independence, Board's review of  the  Company's  strategy  and performance, Board's oversight on the Company's governance, including risk management and internal controls, and\n\nthe effectiveness of the Board Chairman and Board processes.\n\nThe quantitative criteria used to evaluate the overall Board performance comprises performance indicators which include a comparison of the Group's performance (including segmental performance) for the financial period under review against the Group's performance for the corresponding period in previous years, and other indicators such as the Company's share price performance over a historical period.\n\n## Individual Director Evaluation Criteria (Provision 5.2)\n\nFactors taken into account in the assessment of a Director's performance include their abilities and competencies, their objectivity and the level of participation at Board and Committee meetings including their knowledge and contribution to Board processes and the business strategies and performance of the Group. The performance evaluation of each Director is taken into account in the NC's consideration with regard to their re-election as Director.\n\n## REMUNERATION MATTERS\n\n## Principle 6: Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies\n\n## RC Composition and Role (Provisions 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4)\n\nThe RC comprises four NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the RC, are independent. The RC's principal responsibilities, as set out in its written terms of reference approved by the Board, are to review and recommend for the endorsement of the Board a framework of remuneration for the Directors, including the specific remuneration packages of the Executive Directors ('EDs') and the KMP. Further, in consultation with the NC and the Management, the RC also considers the talent management framework so as to align with its review of the overall remuneration framework.\n\nThe Company has in place a remuneration framework (which covers all aspects of\n\nremuneration) for the NEDs, EDs and KMP. On an annual basis, the RC reviews and recommends the specific remuneration packages for the EDs and the KMP, including the annual increments and year-end variable bonuses, for approval by the Board. The RC also considers the termination terms in the contracts of employment of the KMP to ensure that they are not unfair or unreasonable.\n\nIn 2021, Willis Towers Watson, external remuneration consultants, provided benchmark data on the remuneration for top executives in regional listed real estate companies of comparable size to the Company as well as the benchmark data for top listed companies in Singapore across all industries to help the RC in its consideration and proposal of the appropriate level of remuneration for the Company's KMP to attract, retain and motivate for sustained performance and value creation. The Company has no relationship with the appointed remuneration consultants other than their engagement to provide such benchmark data, which could affect the said consultants' independence.\n\nThe Company Secretaries maintain records of all RC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and decisions taken. Three meetings of the RC were held in 2021.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the RC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('RC SelfAssessment Checklist'). The RC SelfAssessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the RC under its terms of reference and considered also the contribution of RC members to the deliberation and decision-making process at RC meetings.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the RC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.\n\n## Principle 7: Level and Mix of Remuneration of Directors and KMP (Provisions 7.1, 7.2 and 7.3)\n\nThe Company's remuneration policy for Directors comprises the following distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 to ensure that the procedure for determining remuneration for Directors is formal and transparent;\n- \u00b7  to ensure that the level of remuneration is sufficient (without being excessive) to attract and retain Directors to exercise oversight responsibility over the Company; and\n- \u00b7  to ensure that no Director is involved in deciding on his own remuneration.\n\nIn reviewing the remuneration packages of the EDs and the KMP, the RC, with the assistance of external remuneration consultants, considers the level of remuneration based on the Company's remuneration policy which comprises the following distinct objectives:\n\n- \u00b7  to reward employees for achieving corporate and individual performance targets in a fair and equitable way; and\n- \u00b7  to ensure that the remuneration reflects employees' duties and responsibilities.\n\nThe Company advocates a performancebased remuneration system that is flexible and responsive to the market, and the performance of the Group's business units and individual employees. In designing the compensation structure, the Company seeks to ensure that the level and mix of remuneration is competitive, relevant and appropriate in finding a balance between the current and longterm objectives of the Company. In its review of the KMP's remuneration, the RC links the KMP's incentive plans against the key performance indicators as measured by the pre-set targets of the GET (Growth, Enhancement and Transformation) strategy.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nBased on the Remuneration Framework, the remuneration packages for the EDs and KMP comprise a fixed component (which includes a 13th month Annual Wage Supplement) and a variable component (which currently comprises short-term incentives in the form of variable bonuses) and, where applicable, fixed allowances and benefits-in-kind determined by the Company's Human Resource policies which apply to all employees. When determining the fixed and variable components for a KMP, the KMP's individual performance is taken into consideration and remuneration recommendations are reviewed in the light of any guidance from the National Wages Council, competitive market practices and information gathered from market surveys conducted by the Company's Human Resource department with input from external remuneration consultants.\n\nThis is further reviewed along with the Group's performance, taking into consideration specific key performance indicators (involving financial and nonfinancial indicators) tracked over time using the Company's balanced scorecard system that sets out the targets to be achieved by the Company based on its\n\nshort and long-term objectives, which are cascaded down to the various business units. The Company exercises its discretion and independent judgement in ensuring that the amount and mix of compensation are aligned with the interests of shareholders and promote the long-term success of the Company. The overall level of remuneration is not considered to be at a level which is likely to promote behaviour contrary to the Group's risk profile.\n\nThe Company currently does not discourage Directors from holding shares in the Company but note that there is no requirement under the Company's Constitution for Directors to hold shares in order to be qualified to act as a Director.\n\nWhen reviewing the structure and level of Directors' fees, which comprise base director's fee and additional fees for services rendered on Committees and fee for the Lead ID, the RC takes into consideration the Directors' respective roles and responsibilities in the Board and Committees and the changes in the business, corporate governance practices and regulatory rules. The RC also compares the Company's fee\n\nstructure against industry practices annually. Other factors taken into consideration in the fee review include the frequency of Board and Committee meetings, corporate performance for the financial year under review as well as the corporate and economic outlook in the new financial year, and the interval since the last fee review. The RC is mindful that the remuneration for IDs should not be excessive so as to compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise their independence. No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.\n\nEach of the Directors receives a base Director's fee. The Lead ID also receives an additional fee to reflect his expanded responsibility. Directors who serve on the various Committees  also receive additional fees in respect of each Committee that they serve on, with the chairmen of the Committees  receiving a higher fee in respect of their service as chairmen of the respective Committees. Attendance fee is payable for attendance in person or via teleconference or video conference at each meeting of the Board, IDs or Committee in consultation with  the  RC  and  the  respective Committee chairmen.\n\nThe structure of the fees payable to Directors of the Company for FY 2021 is as follows:\n\n| Appointment                                                    | Per annum       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Board of Directors -

Having considered the highly competitive human resource environment for personnel with the requisite knowledge, expertise and experience in the Company's business activities, such disclosure of specific remuneration information may give rise to recruitment and talent retention issues. There would be negative impact to the Company if members of the experienced and qualified senior management team are poached, which may affect the\n\nability to both nurture a sustainable talent pool and ensure the smooth continuity in leadership critical for the achievement of the strategic objectives of the Company. The Company believes that shareholders' interest will not be prejudiced as a result of such nondisclosure of the remuneration for each of the Company's KMP, excluding the Group CEO, and with the Company's disclosure on the aggregate remuneration of the KMP, shareholders are provided an insight into the level of remuneration paid to the KMP.",

When such long-term incentive scheme is established in due course with the assistance of external advisers, the Company will consider the inclusion of claw-back provisions within the scheme which would give the right to the Company to reclaim incentive components from participants in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial results or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Company.\n\n## ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT\n\n## Principle 9: Risk Management and Internal Controls\n\nThe Company maintains an adequate and effective system of internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls) and risk management systems to safeguard stakeholders'  interests  and  the Group's assets. The Board has overall responsibility for the governance of risk, including determining the risk strategy, risk appetite and risk limits, as well as the risk policies.\n\n## Oversight of Risk Management (Provision 9.1)\n\nThe ARC assists the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibility of overseeing the Company's risk management framework and policies for the Group and ensuring that Management maintains a sound system of internal controls and risk management.\n\nThe  Company's  Enterprise  Risk Management ('ERM') Framework is implemented under the supervision of the Risk Management Committee ('RMC'), chaired by the Group CEO and comprising the Senior Management team, key functional leaders and heads of business divisions.\n\nThe ARC receives regular reports on the risk management activities of the Company and progress on the ERM framework. Key risks including Tier 1 risks are reviewed and refreshed to ensure that relevant emerging risks are being considered and included for proper assessment, monitoring and reporting as appropriate. Based on the reports of the RMC, the ARC is satisfied that significant risks identified are assessed, managed and monitored adequately within the Group's ERM Framework. The ERM Framework includes a periodic review of the risk appetite statements and risk appetite and tolerance limits for these key risks, which statements and limits are considered and endorsed by the ARC and the Board.\n\nHaving regard to the risks to which the Group is exposed, the likelihood of such risks occurring and the risk tolerance accepted by the Group, an internal controls structure has been designed and put in place by the Management to provide reasonable assurance against material financial misstatements, for the safeguarding of assets, for the maintenance of proper accounting records, on the reliability, relevance and integrity of the information (including financial information).\n\nThe Group's approach to risk management is set out in the 'Risk Management' section on pages 57 to 62 of this AR.\n\nAs part of the internal and external audit programmes, the internal and external auditors report to the ARC any audit findings relating to internal controls, and the ARC reviews the adequacy of the actions taken by Management to address the recommendations of the internal and external auditors.\n\nThe ARC also receives regular reports, briefings and updates from the RMC, the Chief Technology Officer, the internal and external auditors and the Management team during its meetings to help the ARC to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's material internal controls that address the Group's financial, operational, compliance and IT controls.\n\n## Assurances from the Key Management Personnel (Provision 9.2)\n\nIn relation to Provision 9.2 of the 2018 Code and Listing Rule 1207(10), the ARC received:\n\n- (i) written assurance from the Group CEO and the Group CFO that the Group's financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances; and\n- (ii)  written assurance from the KMP that the Group's risk management and internal controls systems in place were adequate and effective to address the principal risks (including financial, operational, compliance and IT risks) within the current scope of the Group's business operations for FY 2021.\n\nThe above written assurances on the Group's internal controls and risk management systems are provided half yearly and are supported by similar written assurances provided by the heads of the Group's key operating divisions/ functions and key operating subsidiaries.\n\nThe  process  of  reviewing  and strengthening the Group's control environment is an evolving process. When controls should be enhanced, the Board and Management take action to rectify and strengthen the internal controls and risk management systems. The Board and Management will continue to devote resources and expertise towards improving the internal policies and procedures to maintain a high level of governance and internal\n\ncontrols. However, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against poor judgement in decision-making, human errors, losses, fraud and other irregularities.\n\nBased on the work performed by Internal Auditors, the external auditors and the periodic reports from the RMC and Management, as well as the written assurances from the KMP to support the opinion to be given by the ARC and the Board, the Board with the concurrence of the ARC, is of the opinion that the internal controls and risk management systems in place as at 31 December 2021 are adequate and effective to address principal risks (including financial, operational, compliance and IT risks) within the current scope of the Group's business operations.\n\n## Principle 10: Audit & Risk Committee\n\n## Composition of the ARC (Provisions 10.2 and 10.3)\n\nThe ARC comprises three NEDs, all of whom including the chairman of the ARC are independent. During the year, Ms Lim Yin Nee Jenny ceased as the chairman of the ARC following her resignation from the Board on 3 May 2021. Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip and Mrs Carol Fong were appointed the chairman and member of the ARC, respectively, on 3 May 2021. The chairman of the ARC, Mr Lee, possesses the relevant audit, accounting and related financial management and risk management expertise and experience, whilst the remaining members of the ARC, Mr Chong Yoon Chou and Mrs Fong each has financial and risk management experience as well as experience in investment banking and the financial markets respectively.\n\nWith the current composition, the ARC is of the opinion that it has the relevant accounting and related financial management expertise and experience to discharge its functions within its\n\nwritten terms of reference which has been approved by the Board.\n\nBased on the terms of reference of the ARC, a former partner or director of the Company's existing auditing firm or auditing corporation should not act as a member of the ARC: (a) within a period of two years commencing on the date of his or her ceasing to be a partner of the auditing firm or director of the auditing corporation; and in any case, (b) for as long as he or she has any financial interest in the auditing firm or auditing corporation. Mr Lee ceased as a partner of KPMG LLP ('KPMG'), the Company's existing auditors, in September 2018 and does not have any financial interest in KPMG. The remaining ARC members do not have any relationship with KPMG.\n\n## Powers and Duties of the ARC (Provision 10.1)\n\nThe ARC is authorised by the Board to review or investigate any matters it deems appropriate within its terms of reference and has direct and unrestricted access to the external and internal auditors. It may invite any Director, Management, officer or employee of the Company to attend its meetings. It is also authorised to engage any firm of accountants, lawyers or other professionals as it sees fit to provide independent counsel and advice to assist in the review or investigation on such matters within its terms of reference as it deems appropriate at the Company's expense.\n\nThe principal responsibility of the ARC is to assist the Board in maintaining a high standard of corporate governance, particularly by providing an independent review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's financial reporting process (including reviewing the accounting policies and practices of the Company and the Group on a consolidated basis) and key internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance, IT and risk management controls. Other duties within its written terms of reference include:\n\n- \u00b7  to review with Management and, where appropriate, with the external auditors the significant financial reporting issues and judgements so as to ensure the integrity of the half yearly and full year financial statements of the Group to be issued by the Company before their submission to the Board and any other announcements relating to the Group's financial performance;\n- \u00b7 to review annually the scope and results of the external audit and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors, and in this regard to also review the nature and extent of any non-audit services provided by the external auditors to the Group;\n- \u00b7 to make recommendations to the Board on the nomination for the appointment, re-appointment and removal of external auditors, and to approve the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors;\n- \u00b7  to assess the role and effectiveness of the internal audit ('IA') function in the overall context of the Group's internal controls and risk management systems, and to consider the results of their review and evaluation of the Group's internal controls, including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls, and risk management policies and systems;\n- \u00b7  to approve the appointment, resignation or dismissal of the Head of IA;\n- \u00b7  to  review  interested  person transactions falling within the scope of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual; and\n- \u00b7  to oversee the establishment and operation of the Company's whistleblowing policy and arrangements put in place for raising concerns about possible improprieties on matters of financial reporting or any other matters.",

The Head of IA's primary reporting line is to the ARC. The appointment, resignation and dismissal of the Head of IA is reviewed and/or approved by the ARC. The ARC also provides input on the annual performance appraisal of the Head of IA and reviews his compensation within the compensation policies of the Company. The ARC meets the Head of IA at least once annually without the presence of Management. The Head of IA has unfettered access to the ARC, the Board and Management as well as the Group's documents, records, properties and personnel relevant for the performance of audits.\n\nIA operates within the framework stated in its IA Charter which is approved and reviewed by the ARC on an annual basis. The standards of the IA Charter are consistent with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), an international professional association with global headquarters in United States of America.\n\nThe Head of IA, Mr Benson Seah, is a Certified Internal Auditor and a member of various professional bodies, with over 20 years of experience. He has been with the Company since June 2019. All his team members have the relevant qualifications and experience and are members of The Institute of Internal Auditors of Singapore and/or members of relevant professional bodies. The  IA function is a corporate member of the Institute of Internal Auditors Singapore (IIAS), an affiliate of the IIA. Processes are in place to ensure that the professional competence of the IA staff is maintained and upgraded through  continuing  professional education programmes which comprised technical and non-technical training for the development of the IA staff.\n\n## Role and Activities of IA\n\nThe primary role of IA is to assist the Board to evaluate the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls\n\nand risk management processes of the Company, reviewing the internal controls of the Company to ensure prompt and accurate recording of transactions and proper safeguarding of assets and reviewing the Company's compliance with the relevant laws, regulations and policies of the Company.\n\nThe ARC approved the annual IA plan and received regular reports during 2021 on the progress of the audit work under the IA plan. All IA reports are given to the ARC, the KMP and the Heads of the relevant business divisions, with a summary report of IA results presented at the ARC meetings. IA observations on internal control, operational and human lapses and recommendations to address them were also reviewed and discussed at ARC meetings. The ARC was satisfied that recommendations made were dealt with by the Management in a timely and appropriate manner, with outstanding exceptions or recommendations being closely monitored and reported back to the ARC.\n\nThe ARC reviewed the effectiveness and adequacy of the IA function including its resources through a review of the IA activities on a regular basis as well as its annual assessment of the IA function. The assessment was facilitated through the use of an evaluation framework which covers IA organisation, resources and continuing training, audit plans work scope, quality of reports and recommendations, IA Charter and IA internal control assessment. Based on the assessment conducted for 2021, the ARC is satisfied with the quality and effectiveness of the IA function and that the IA function is currently adequately resourced and has appropriate independent standing within the Group to perform its functions effectively.\n\n## Provision 10.5\n\nThe ARC held nine meetings during the year and carried out its duties as set out within its terms of reference. The Company Secretaries maintain records of all ARC meetings including records of discussions on key deliberations and\n\ndecisions taken. The ARC meets with the internal and external auditors, each separately without the presence of Management, annually.\n\nThe ARC members keep themselves abreast of changes to accounting standards, risks and other issues which may have a material impact on financial statements. These included the following trainings attended in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 ACRA-SGX-SID Audit Committee Seminar 2021: Enterprise Resilience and Risk Management\n- \u00b7  AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series: An Insider Guide to Cryptocurrency and Blockchain\n- \u00b7 AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series:The Insolvency and Restructuring Regime in Singapore - Changes and Consolidation\n- \u00b7  AC Chapter Pit-Stop Series: Valuation - Addressing Challenges in Uncertain Economic Times\n- \u00b7  Future of Assurance: Digital Risks\n- \u00b7 Roadmap to Mandatory Climaterelated Disclosures\n- \u00b7  Looking  Beyond  the  Pandemic: Important Role of the AC\n- \u00b7  SID Climate Governance Singapore Launch\n- \u00b7  SID Directors Conference 2021: Asia's Renaissance - The new era of Recovery and Reopening\n\nFor the financial year under review, the ARC conducted a self-assessment of its own effectiveness in the discharge of its roles and responsibilities, which was facilitated through the use of a self-assessment checklist ('ARC SelfAssessment Checklist').\n\nThe ARC Self-Assessment Checklist covered, inter alia , the responsibilities of the ARC under its terms of reference, and also considered the contribution of ARC members to the ARC's deliberation and decision-making process.\n\nBased on the self-assessment, the ARC is of the view that it has fulfilled its responsibilities and discharged its duties as set out in its terms of reference.",

In determining the independence of KPMG, the ARC reviewed all aspects of the Group's relationships with them including the policies, processes and safeguards adopted by the Group and KPMG to protect and preserve audit independence.\n\nThe ARC also considered the nature and volume of the provision of the non-audit services in 2021 and the corresponding fees and noted that the fees for non-audit services had not exceeded 50% of the aggregate amount of all fees paid/payable to KPMG in 2021. Based on the review, the ARC is of the opinion that KPMG is, and is perceived to be, independent for the purpose of the Group's statutory financial audit.\n\nDetails of the fees paid and/or payable by the Group in respect of audit and non-audit services for FY 2021 are set out below:\n\n|                           | $'million   |\n|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Audit fees paid to:       |             |\n| - auditors of the Company | 3.6         |\n| - other auditors          | 3.4         |\n| Non-audit fees paid to:   |             |\n| - auditors of the Company | 1.8         |\n| - other auditors          | 3.4         |\n\nIn  reviewing the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment for the financial year ending 31 December 2022, the ARC had considered the adequacy of the resources and experience of KPMG and the audit engagement partners assigned to the audit, the size and complexity of the audit exercise for the Group, and the number and experience of the supervisory and professional staff assigned to the Group's audit through a review of the curriculum vitae of the KPMG audit team. The ARC had also considered the quality of discussions with the findings raised\n\nby KPMG, including the Audit Quality Indicators presented.\n\nKPMG has confirmed that they are registered with ACRA. The Company is thus in compliance with Rule 712 and Rule 715 (read with Rule 716) of the Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of its auditors.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the ARC has recommended to the Board the nomination of KPMG for re-appointment as external auditors at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Whistle-blowing Policy (Provision 10.1(f))\n\nCDL has in place a whistle-blowing policy and procedure where employees of the Company can raise in confidence, whether anonymously or otherwise, concerns on possible improprieties relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal controls and auditing matters or other matters without fear of reprisals in any form. The ARC has the responsibility of overseeing this policy which is properly administered with the assistance of the Head of IA. Under these procedures, arrangements are in place for independent investigation of such matters raised and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken.\n\nThe Company is committed to maintaining procedures for the confidential submission of reports and the identity of the whistleblower concerned will not be disclosed if so requested by the whistle-blower who lodged the report. Investigations of such reports will be handled on a confidential basis to the extent permissible or deemed appropriate under the circumstances and involve persons who need to be involved in order to properly carry out the investigation and will, on a best efforts basis, be carried out in a timely manner.\n\nIn order to facilitate and encourage the reporting of such matters, the whistleblowing policy, together with the dedicated whistle-blowing communication channels (email and postal address as well as toll-free telephone contact numbers in various countries) are available on the Company's website and intranet and are easily accessible by all employees.\n\nThe whistle-blowing policy and procedures are reviewed by the ARC from time to time to ensure that they remain current.\n\nFor more information on the said policy and procedures, please refer to the Company's website at www.cdl.com.sg.\n\n## INTERESTED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Company had obtained shareholders' approval at its Annual General Meeting held on 30 April 2021  ('2021 AGM') for the Company, its subsidiaries and its associated companies not listed on SGX-ST or an approved exchange, over which the Company, its subsidiaries and/or interested persons have control, to enter into transactions within the categories of Interested Person Transactions set out in the Company's Letter to Shareholders dated 15 April 2021 ('Letter to Shareholders'), with such persons within the class or classes of Interested Persons as described in the Letter to Shareholders, provided that such transactions are entered into in accordance with the review procedures set out in the Letter to Shareholders (the 'IPT Mandate'). The IPT Mandate is subject to annual renewal by the shareholders. Given that such Interested Person Transactions are expected to occur with some degree of frequency and may arise at any time, and to allow the Group to undertake such transactions in an expeditious manner, shareholders' approval will be sought at the 2022 AGM for the renewal of the IPT Mandate.\n\nThe  ARC  has  confirmed  that  an independent financial adviser's opinion is not required for the renewal of the IPT Mandate as the methods or procedures for determining the transaction prices of the IPTs conducted under the IPT Mandate have remained appropriate since shareholders approved the renewal of the IPT Mandate at the 2021 AGM, and the methods or procedures continue to be sufficient to ensure that these IPTs will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority shareholders.\n\nParticulars of interested person transactions required to be disclosed under Rule 907 of the Listing Manual are as follows:\n\n| Name of                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                    | Aggregate value of all interested  person transactions in FY 2021  (excluding transactions less  than $100,000 and transactions  conducted under the IPT Mandate  pursuant to Rule 920) $'000   | Aggregate value of all interested  person transactions conducted in  FY 2021 under the IPT Mandate  pursuant to Rule 920 (excluding                  | transactions less than $100,000)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Interested Person                                           | Nature of relationship                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                      | $'000                              |\n| Subsidiaries  of Hong Leong  Investment  Holdings Pte.

To facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights, the Company ensures that all material information relating to the Company and its financial performance is disclosed in an accurate and timely manner via SGXNET and uploaded at the Company's corporate website.\n\n## General Meetings\n\n## (Provisions 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3)\n\nAll shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy. The rules for the appointment of proxies, including information that voting will be conducted by way of poll, are set out in the notice of general meetings. In accordance with the Constitution of the Company, shareholders who are not relevant intermediaries may appoint not more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings in their absence, and shareholders who are relevant intermediaries may appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings. The proxy forms must be deposited at such place or places specified in the notice or document accompanying the notice convening the general meetings at least seventy-two hours before the time set for the general meetings.\n\nThe Company provides for separate resolutions at general meetings on each substantial issue, including treating the re-election of each Director as a separate subject matter. Detailed information on each item in the AGM agenda is provided in the explanatory notes to the notice of AGM in the AR.\n\nAt general meetings of the Company, shareholders are given the opportunity to communicate their views and are encouraged to ask the Directors and the Management questions regarding matters affecting the Company.\n\n## 2021 AGM and 2022 AGM\n\nIn view of the COVID-19 situation, the 2021 AGM was convened and held by electronic means on 30 April 2021 pursuant to the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Companies, Variable Capital Companies, Business Trusts, Unit Trusts and Debenture Holders) Order 2020 (the 'Order').\n\nAlternative arrangements relating to attendance at the 2021 AGM via electronic means (including arrangements by which the meeting can be electronically accessed via 'live' audio-visual webcast or 'live' audio only stream), submission of questions to the Chairman of the Meeting in advance of the 2021 AGM, addressing of substantial and relevant questions prior to the AGM and voting by appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as proxy at the AGM, were put in place for the 2021 AGM. In addition, arrangements were made for 'live' submission of questions for the 2021 AGM.\n\nThe Board Chairman and the chairmen of the ARC, NC, RC and BSC, together with the KMP (who are not Directors) were present on site at the 2021 AGM. The other Directors and the external auditors attended the 2021 AGM virtually.\n\nIn view of the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the Company will be convening the 2022 AGM via electronic means pursuant to the Order. Alternative arrangements have been put in place to allow shareholders to participate at the 2022 AGM by:\n\n- (i) observing and/or listening to AGM proceedings via 'live' audio-visual\n- webcast or 'live' audio-only stream; (ii) submitting questions to the Chairman of the AGM in advance of, or 'live' at, the AGM; and/or\n- (iii) (a) voting at the AGM 'live' via electronic means; (b) appointing a proxy(ies) (other than the Chairman of the AGM) to vote 'live' via electronic means on their behalf at the AGM; or (c) appointing the Chairman of the AGM as proxy to vote on their behalf at the AGM.\n\nDetails of the steps for pre-registration, submission of questions and voting at the 2022 AGM are set out in a separate announcement to be released on SGXNET together with the Notice of AGM. In view of the constantly evolving COVID-19 situation in Singapore, the Company may be required to change its arrangements for the 2022 AGM at short notice. Shareholders should check the Company's corporate website or the SGX website for the latest updates on the status of the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Voting at General Meetings (Provision 11.4)\n\nShareholders are given the opportunity to vote at general meetings either in person or in absentia by way of appointed proxy (proxies). However, as the authentication of shareholder identity information and other related integrity issues still remain a concern, the Company has decided, for the time being, not to implement voting in absentia by electronic means.\n\nPursuant to Listing Rule 730A(2), all resolutions to be proposed at general meetings and at any adjournment thereof shall be put to the vote by way of poll.\n\nIn support of greater transparency and to allow for a more efficient voting system, the Company has been conducting electronic poll voting instead of voting by show of hands since the 2012 AGM up to the 2019 AGM. With electronic poll voting, shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting will be entitled to vote on a 'one-share, one-vote' basis. The voting results of all votes cast in respect of each resolution will also be instantaneously displayed on screen at the meeting. The detailed results setting out the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages will be announced via SGXNET after the AGM. An external firm is appointed as scrutineers for the AGM voting process, which is independent of the firm appointed to undertake the electronic poll voting process.\n\nFor the 2021 AGM which was held by electronic means, shareholders were able to vote by appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as proxy to vote on their behalf. Proxy forms submitted by shareholders were independently verified by the independent scrutineers. Results of the valid votes submitted, showing the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages, were announced by the Chairman at the AGM and thereafter, via SGXNET.\n\n## Minutes of General Meetings (Provision 11.5)\n\nThe Company also maintains minutes of its general meetings, which include the key comments and queries raised by shareholders and the responses from the Board, Management and/or the external auditors. The minutes of the general meetings are available on the Company's corporate website, and the Company will also furnish the general meeting minutes to any shareholder upon request.\n\n## Dividend Policy (Provision 11.6)\n\nThe Company has formalised its dividend policy which aims to provide a return to shareholders at least once a year through the payment of dividends, after taking into account the Group's financial performance, short and long-term capital requirements, future investment plans, general global and business economic conditions and any regulatory factors. The Board endeavours to maintain a balance between meeting shareholders' expectations and prudent capital management with a sustainable dividend policy. The Board will review the dividend policy from time to time and reserves the right to modify, amend and update the policy.\n\n## Principle 12: Engagement with Shareholders\n\nThe Company notifies its investors in advance of the date of release of its financial results via SGXNET. For FY 2021, results for the half year were released via SGXNET within 45 days of the end of 30 June 2021 whilst the full year results were released within 60 days from the financial year end. In\n\npresenting the Group's financial results, the Board aims to provide investors with a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and financial position with a commentary at the date of the announcement of the significant trends and competitive conditions of the industry in which it operates.\n\nFor the financial year under review, the Group CEO and the Group CFO provided assurance to the ARC and the Board on the integrity of the half year unaudited financial statements and the Board in turn provided a negative assurance confirmation in respect of the unaudited financial statements for the half year in accordance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Company ensures that investors are notified of all material information in an accurate and timely manner. Should there be an inadvertent disclosure made to a select group, the Company will release the same information as promptly as possible via SGXNET. The financial statements and other presentation materials presented at the Company's general meetings, including material and price-sensitive information, are disseminated and publicly released via SGXNET on a timely basis.\n\nIn 2021, the following documents were made available to shareholders solely by electronic means via publication on the (i) Company's corporate website and (ii) SGXNET:\n\n- \u00b7  Notice of the Company's 2021 AGM;\n- \u00b7  Proxy Form for 2021 AGM;\n- \u00b7  Annual Report 2020 (and updated shareholding statistics as at 16 March 2021); and\n- \u00b7  Letter to Shareholders dated 15 April 2021, in relation to the proposed renewal of the (a) share purchase mandate; and (b) IPT mandate for interested person transactions.\n\n## Shareholder Communication (Provision 12.1)\n\nShareholders and investors can contact the Company or access information on the Company at its website at www.cdl.com.sg which has a dedicated\n\n'Investor Relations' link that provides, inter alia , information on the Board of Directors, Management team, the Company's Corporate  Governance  Reports, Sustainability Reports, Annual Reports, Corporate Policies, Announcements, Press Releases and Financial Results as released by the Company on SGXNET, and other information which may be relevant to investors. In addition, the Company leverages on other communication platforms such as its online newsroom (www.cdl.com.sg/newsroom) and social media channels (LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram) to provide latest updates on the Group's business and performance milestones. Investors can subscribe to email alerts on the CDL website or follow its social media channels to receive updates on its latest news.\n\nFrom time to time, the Board Chairman and the Company's Management hold briefings with analysts and the media to coincide with the release of the Group's half-year and full-year financial results. Media presentation slides are also released on SGXNET and on the Company's website. A live video webcast was arranged for investors at the analysts/media briefing for the full year 2021 results in February 2022. In addition, the Management takes an active role in investor relations, meeting local and foreign fund managers regularly as well as participating in investor roadshows and conferences both locally and overseas. The Head, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications, is responsible for managing the Group's investor relations programmes, including the communications with the financial community, research analysts and relevant stakeholders.\n\n## Investor Relations Policy (Provisions 12.2 and 12.3)\n\nThe Company is committed to building investor confidence and trust through effective open, two-way communication with shareholders and the investment community. The Company's Investor Relations (IR) Policy, available on the CDL corporate website (www.cdl.com. sg), sets out the process and mechanism",

The IR Policy outlines the principles and framework in which the Company communicates and engages with investors, analysts and other IR stakeholders to provide balanced, clear and pertinent information. To provide investors with a better understanding of the Group's business and growth drivers, regular updates on the Group's strategies, operations and financial performance are available across multiple platforms.\n\nFurther information on the Company's investor relations policy and activities can be found on pages 63 and 64 of the AR.\n\n## Principle 13: Engagement with Stakeholders\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSince 2014, the Company started conducting materiality assessments annually, which is facilitated by a third party, to determine the key economic, environmental, social and governance ('EESG') issues that are important to the Company's stakeholders.  These issues are foundational to the Company's annual sustainability reporting. Corresponding EESG targets, metrics, initiatives, and progress are reviewed by the Management team, reported to the BSC and the Board for approval, before they are published annually in the Company's Integrated Sustainability Report ('ISR').\n\nDue to COVID-19, the Company conducted more comprehensive materiality assessments both in 2020 and 2021, to be in closer alignment with the shifting priorities and expectations of its stakeholders.\n\nThe process started with an extensive macro scanning exercise to determine the list of material risks and opportunities relevant to CDL's stakeholders and business  for  sustained  growth. Engagement with internal and external stakeholders, including the BSC, was then conducted through online surveys\n\nor interviews. Through interviews with selected management staff, regulators, industry and sustainability experts, tenants and suppliers, the Company obtained additional insights into working towards its net zero carbon commitment and strategically addressing risks and opportunities for its businesses, while continuing to deliver long-term value for its stakeholders. The preliminary material issues were validated by the Company's Senior Management and approved by the BSC thereafter.\n\nWith the fast-changing business landscape and externalities, the materiality assessment is critical to help the Company to sharpen its sustainability strategy and focus resources on areas that are deemed most material to its business.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, CDL publishes an online Sustainability Report on its microsite at www.cdlsustainability.com. This voluntary initiative that started in July 2017 updates stakeholders of CDL's progress towards key goals and targets set under its Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint, and sets benchmarks for the transparency and timeliness of ESG disclosures to investors and stakeholders.\n\nThe BSC assists the Board in the review and consideration of the Company's sustainability issues and approach to sustainability reporting. The BSC comprises four Directors, with the Group CEO in the chair and three other IDs. The BSC's terms of reference sets out, inter alia , the objectives, roles and responsibilities of the BSC. It also includes the BSC's purview over matters relating to the Company's ESG strategy, ESG targets, the sustainability reporting framework and also the Company's policies, practices and performance on its material ESG factors which are significant and contribute to the Company's performance, business activities, and/or reputation as a global corporate citizen.\n\nThe annual ISR is dedicated to reporting on CDL's sustainability efforts and\n\nperformance that address the social and environmental impacts pertinent to the Company's stakeholders and business. Over the years, CDL's robust sustainability reporting has evolved into a unique blended model using the Global Reporting Initiative ('GRI') Standards as its core since 2008. To address the diverse expectations of stakeholders, CDL embraced CDP since 2010, Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark since 2013, the Value Reporting Foundation's Integrated Reporting Framework since 2015, Sustainable Development Goals ('SDG') Reporting since 2016, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') framework since 2017 and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ('SASB') Standards for Real Estate Sector since 2020. CDL's ISRs are available on both its corporate website and the dedicated sustainability microsite. To enhance data credibility and instill confidence in readers, external assurance of its report started since 2009. ISR 2022's external audit has been further elevated in its scope against the GRI Standards, SASB Standards, as well as the TCFD and Climate Disclosure Standards Board ('CDSB') frameworks.\n\nFurther information on the Company's approach to stakeholder engagement and its materiality assessment can be found on pages 65 to 78 of the AR.\n\n## CORPORATE VALUES AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS\n\nThe  Board  and  Management  are committed to conducting business with integrity and consistent with high standards of business ethics, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. The Company has in place an internal code of business and ethical conduct crystallising the Company's business principles and practices with respect to matters which may have ethical implications.\n\nThe code, which provides a communicable and understandable framework for employees to observe the Company's\n\nprinciples such as honesty, integrity, responsibility and accountability at all levels of the organisation and in the conduct of the Company's business in their relationships with customers, suppliers and amongst employees, is available on the Company's intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.\n\nThe code provides guidance on issues such as:\n\n- \u00b7  conflicts of interest and the appropriate disclosures to be made;\n- \u00b7  the  Company's  stance  against corruption and bribery;\n- \u00b7  compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those relating to the protection of the environment and the conservation of energy and natural resources;\n- \u00b7  compliance with the Company's policies and procedures, including those on internal controls and accounting;\n- \u00b7 safeguarding and proper use of the Company's assets, confidential information and intellectual property rights, including the respect of the intellectual property rights of third parties; and\n- \u00b7  competition and fair dealing in the conduct of the Company's business, in its relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and towards its employees.\n\nIn line with the Board's commitment to maintain high ethical standards which are integral to its corporate identity and business, the Company has the following three key corporate policies in place:\n\n- (i) Anti-Corruption Policy & Guidelines which sets out the responsibilities of the Group companies and of each employee in observing and upholding CDL's 'zero-tolerance' position against all forms of corruption, bribery and extortion and provides information and guidance to employees on how\n\nto recognise, address, resolve, avoid and prevent instances of corruption, bribery and extortion which may arise in the course of their work.\n\n- (ii)  Fraud Policy & Guidelines which provides guidance on actions which may constitute fraudulent conduct and highlights the importance of the implementation, maintenance and compliance with the internal controls framework of the Group and its policies and procedures.\n- (iii) Competition Policy & Guidelines which states the Company's policy to compete fairly and ethically in the conduct of business in all its markets and provides direction and guidance to employees in their relationships and communications with competitors and customers.\n\nThese policies are available on the Company's corporate website, intranet and have also been disseminated to officers and employees of the Group's key subsidiaries. These policies have been translated into Mandarin and Thai for dissemination to employees of the Group in China and Thailand.\n\nThe  Company's  policy  on  how  it manages and protects personal data in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements are set out in the CDL Personal Data Policy.\n\nThe Company has also set out the following  sustainability  policies which are available on the Company's corporate website:\n\n## \u00b7 Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS) Policy\n\nEstablished in 2003, the EHS Policy sets the strategic direction for all departments and employees towards creating a 'Safe & Green' corporate culture by adhering to regulatory compliance, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring a safe, fair and inclusive workplace.\n\n## \u00b7 Human Rights Policy\n\nSets out the Company's commitment in upholding fundamental principles of human and workplace rights in places where the Company operates. Beyond compliance to the local government's policies and regulations in protecting human rights, CDL is committed to respecting human rights in all aspects of its stakeholder engagement such as equitable employment practices, non-discrimination, welfare and fair  compensation,  as  well  as workplace health and safety within its developments.\n\n## \u00b7 Climate Change Policy\n\nIn line with CDL's sustainability strategy and commitment to its ethos of 'Conserving as We Construct' since 1995, the Company is dedicated to climate action and achieving low carbon operations. CDL became the first real estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to sign the World Green Building Council's ('WorldGBC') Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment in February 2021. This is a global pledge to achieve net zero operational carbon by 2030, covering new and existing whollyowned assets under CDL's direct management and operational control. In November 2021, during COP26, CDL extended its pledge towards a net zero whole life carbon emissions approach. Through this expanded commitment, the Company pledged to achieve maximum reduction of embodied carbon in new developments, compensating for any remaining residual operational and upfront embodied emissions via offsetting for new developments by 2030 and advocating for all buildings to be net zero carbon by 2050. In 2018, CDL was the first real estate company in Singapore to set Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi')-validated carbon reduction targets based on a 2\u00b0C warmer scenario with 2007 baseline year. CDL renewed its SBTi-validated targets in December 2021 by aligning with a more stringent 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenario and 2016 baseline year.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## \u00b7 Green Building Policy\n\nCDL is committed to incorporating decarbonisation,  innovation, inclusivity, health and well-being into the design and operation of its buildings. To provide a safe, healthy and inclusive environment for its employees, customers and workers, it is crucial to proactively adopt smart and sustainable building technologies. The 3S Framework built on the three thrusts - Smart, Sustainable and Super Low Carbon will drive CDL's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint and environmental impact in line with CDL's net zero whole life carbon buildings commitment and the Singapore Green Plan 2030.\n\n## \u00b7 Biodiversity Policy\n\nCDL supports Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision towards higher living standards while co-existing with flora and fauna. The Company aims to minimise and mitigate the impacts of its developments on natural habitats\n\nand to protect wildlife biodiversity. The policy complements Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision and takes reference from national frameworks, such as the new Biodiversity Impact Assessment guidelines set by URA and NParks.\n\n## \u00b7 Sustainable Investment Principles ('SIP')\n\nAs a responsible developer with a longstanding ESG commitment, the Company is focused on taking proactive action in assessing potential portfolio risks and opportunities for sustainable investment decisions via globally aligned principles set out in the policy. The SIP is formulated in line with the Glasgow Climate Pact, and aligned with the global best practices laid out in the UN SDGs, UN Principles for Responsible Investment, TCFD and UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative. It also complements CDL's existing ESG policies and guidelines, including the Climate Change Policy, EHS Policy, Green Building Policy, Biodiversity Policy and Human Rights Policy.\n\n## INTERNAL CODE ON DEALINGS IN SECURITIES\n\nThe Company has in place an internal code on securities trading which sets out the implications of insider trading and provides guidance and internal regulation with regard to dealings in the Company's securities by its Directors and employees. These guidelines prohibit dealing in the Company's securities (a) on short-term considerations, (b) while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive information in relation to such securities, and (c) during the 'closed period', which will be one month before the date of announcement of the Company's half year and full-year financial results, and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results. The Directors and employees of the Company are notified in advance of the commencement of each 'closed period' relating to dealing in the Company's securities. The internal code on securities trading is available on the Company's intranet and is easily accessible by all employees.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## MANAGING RISKS TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTIES AND MAXIMISE OPPORTUNITIES\n\nManaging risk is an integral part of the Group's business and we continually strive towards best risk management practices. Relevant and material risk issues are brought up to the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) and the Board to keep them informed in a timely manner. Through the ARC, the Board advises Management on the formulation and implementation of the risk management framework, policies, and procedures to mitigate the risks identified where required. The Group's risk management framework provides the principles and guidance for the Group's risk management activities.\n\n## CDL'S ERM Framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring the year, the Group's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function implemented several initiatives targeted at strengthening risk management practices which are key elements to our risk management framework. Some of the notable initiatives include:\n\n- \u00b7  Conducting customised compliance training sessions covering anti-money laundering / counter-terrorism financing, cyber threat and data privacy, to raise the level of awareness and understanding, as well as improve the capabilities of our first line of defence against such risks.\n- \u00b7 Enhancing data handling and protection policies, and using technology tools to improve processes to ensure policy enforcement.\n- \u00b7 Completing a Group-wide risk transfer strategy review, which involves reviewing the Group's key risk exposures and optimising our global insurance structure for coverage consistency to achieve economies of scale.\n- \u00b7  Updating the control self-assessment programme, with the assessment targeting risk drivers of identified key risks, to facilitate early identification of control gaps and areas for improvement.\n- \u00b7  Proactive monitoring of developments related to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and adjusting our business continuity plans and measures accordingly to minimise any operational disruptions.\n\nThe Group's ERM Framework and initiatives are also rolled out to subsidiary companies and affiliates to ensure that risk management practices are aligned, and all material risk factors are duly considered and adequately addressed. The Group's ERM function facilitates the alignment process and provides guidance through training and knowledge-sharing sessions to raise employees' risk awareness and embrace the Group's risk culture.\n\n## RISK STRATEGY\n\nOur risk strategy is based on the belief that risk management is the responsibility of all employees and that it must be integrated into strategy formulation, capital allocation, decision making, and day-to-day operations. The fostering of strong and sustainable 'self-driven' risk culture is guided by defined principles that underpin the ERM operating model.\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\n- \u00b7  Line managers are to own risks and be accountable.\n- \u00b7  Risk management activities are to hinge not only on processes and systems, but equally on a right mindset and attitude.\n- \u00b7  Risk management is to be benchmarked against global best practices.\n\n## RISK CULTURE\n\nEffective risk management requires a strong 'risk awareness' culture to reinforce 'doing the right thing'. Our Management is fully committed to fostering a strong risk-centric culture through setting the appropriate tone at the top and demonstrating strong support for risk management. Our governance structure ensures appropriate oversight and accountability for effective management of risks throughout the Group and is further supported by risk management principles that are embedded in all our decision-making and business processes.\n\n## RISK APPETITE\n\nThe risk appetite was set to define the extent of risks the Group is able and willing to take on to achieve our strategic and business objectives. The purpose of establishing a risk appetite framework is not to limit risk-taking, but to ensure that the Group's risk profile remains within tolerable boundaries as opportunities are maximised. The risk appetite statements, along with the accompanying risk tolerance limits in both quantitative and/or qualitative terms, are reviewed annually.",

        "page_content": "## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Board has approved the following risk appetite statements:\n\n- \u00b7  The Group will continue to focus on business activities in identified core markets. Apart from the core markets, the Group shall otherwise not be overly exposed to any other single country.\n- \u00b7  The Group is prepared to undertake new investment and innovation initiatives commensurate to expected returns, and/or are in line with the Group's core strength and strategic objectives. From acquisition to divestment, all investments undertaken should not have potential loss exposure that could significantly threaten the Group's going concern assumption.\n- \u00b7  The Group will avoid any situations and/or actions that may result in negative impact on our reputation and branding. Should such situations arise, they will be managed aggressively to preserve our reputation and brand image.\n- \u00b7  The Group will maintain adequate liquid assets to cover planned cash outflows and shall not take speculative positions on interest rates and foreign exchange.\n- \u00b7  The Group strives to maintain a 'zero-tolerance' position in relation to environmental, health and safety breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, as well as criminally dishonest acts such as fraud, corruption, bribery and extortion.\n- \u00b7  The Group will minimise operational and IT risks, subject to cost-benefit trade-off.\n\nThe Management Risk Committee monitors the Group risk profiles and regulatory compliance status on a quarterly basis.\n\n## RISK GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Group's risk governance structure comprises three lines of defence that illustrates how specific duties related to risk and controls are assigned and coordinated within the Group, to facilitate timely risk identification, escalation, and provision of Board assurance.\n\n## First Line of Defence - Risk Owners -\n\nThe line managers of respective business and support functions are accountable and responsible for implementing and executing effective controls to manage the risks arising from their business activities. This includes establishing adequate managerial and supervisory controls to ensure compliance with policies, risk appetite, threshold limits and effective risk controls, and to highlight gaps, inadequacy of processes and unexpected risk events.\n\n## Second Line of Defence - ERM & Internal Audit -\n\nThe ERM function is responsible for designing, implementing and improving the risk management framework as part of the ERM and control assurance programme. The Internal Audit department provides independent assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk management framework. Both functions are also responsible for the independent review and monitoring of the Group's risk profile and for highlighting any significant gaps and risk issues to the Management Risk Committee.\n\n## Third Line of Defence - Board Oversight -\n\nThe Board is responsible for the governance of risk across the Group, while ensuring that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) assists the Board in carrying out the Board's responsibility of overseeing the Group's risk management framework and policies. The Management Risk Committee surfaces significant risk issues for discussion with the ARC and the Board, to keep them fully informed in a timely and accurate manner. All ARC members, including the Chairman of the ARC, are independent non-executive directors.\n\n## RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group adopts an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process that enables systematic identification and prioritisation of all material risks. An integral part of the process towards effective risk management is continuous communication and consultation with internal and external stakeholders. This enables the Group to understand the importance of risk management, to appreciate the decisions that are taken within the Group, and to implement the best policies and practices necessary for the benefit of the Group.\n\n## Strategic Risk\n\n## MATERIAL RISKS TO THE GROUP\n\nThe Group categorises its risk profiles into four key areas: Strategic, Treasury and Financial, Operational and Compliance, and Information Technology. The Group is committed to mitigating risk exposure through appropriate risk management strategies and adequate internal controls. Close monitoring and control processes, including the use of appropriate key risk and key performance indicators, are implemented to ensure that the risk profiles are managed within the Group's risk appetite and tolerance limits.\n\nA large part of the Group's strategic risks comprise market-driven forces, evolving business landscapes, changing customer demands and disruptive innovations. The Group remains vulnerable to uncertainties in the major economies, the looming impact of COVID-19, implications from geopolitical developments, keen competition and competitive pressure in the real estate and hospitality industry.\n\n## Market and Competition\n\nGiven the geographical diversity of our business, the Group is exposed to various levels of event risks in major economies, as well as in key financial and property markets. The Group's principal business operations, comprising property development, property investment and hotel operations, face significant competition across the diverse markets in which they operate. The failure to compete effectively in terms of price, market positioning, product quality and levels of service could adversely affect the Group's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Brand and Reputation\n\nThe Group's reputation is one of its most valuable assets, playing a major part in the continued success of the business. The assessment of reputational risk is constantly evolving and dependent on numerous factors at any given point in time. It may therefore not be possible to define all circumstances which may pose reputational risk, or to set  out  all  the  considerations  which should be applied as part of the decisionmaking process.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nThe Group recognises that climate risks are business risks. A focal issue of the Paris Agreement and Singapore Green Plan 2030, climate change is one of the long-term key global risks that can potentially impact the Group's assets, revenue, operations, supply chain, product design, stakeholder engagement, and investor communication. Aside from physical risks arising from climate change, regulatory transition risks can result in stricter emission standards, increased carbon tax and water pricing, and stricter building design requirements. The Group prioritises ESG communication and reporting to proactively manage rising stakeholder  capitalism,  investor  and consumer activism. In the face of climate change, climate-proofing its buildings for a low-carbon future is key to the Group's growth strategy.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Monitoring macroeconomic trends, market conditions and developments, and formulating responses and pre-emptive strategies accordingly.\n- b) Leveraging on our market analytics and project delivery expertise to introduce quality products and innovative solutions to meet evolving consumer demands.\n- c) Strengthening our brand and competitiveness through product differentiation, market positioning, operational efficiency, transformation through innovation and creating new revenue generating platforms, as well as leveraging on a portfolio of distribution channel partners.\n- d) Diversifying of portfolio across geographies, focusing on core markets and cities where the Group has operational scale, and where underlying economic fundamentals are more robust.\n- e) Distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our lodging products and services by focusing on delivering a seamless customer experience, including our Loyalty Programme, direct booking channels, and consumerfacing technology platforms and services, from those offered by others.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Undertaking active monitoring of both traditional and social media platforms, aggressively responding to and managing any undesirable situation(s) that may arise.\n- b) Raising the profile of our brands through marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships to build brand equity.\n- c) Focusing on a customer-centric approach, and monitoring customer satisfaction closely through surveys, gathering of feedback, inspections and other forms of engagement.\n- d) Establishing brand standards that are designed to maintain a level of product consistency based on the brand collection to which a hotel belongs, whilst allowing flexibility in order to maintain the personality of the property.\n- e) Striving to avoid any situations and/or actions that could result in a negative impact on our reputation and brand.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Pledging net zero whole life carbon for CDL's new developments and major renovations over which we have direct operational and management control in Singapore by 2030, in accordance with World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment.\n- b) Implementing robust climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to accelerate efforts towards a lowcarbon business model, such as setting carbon emissions reduction targets validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for a 1.5 o C warmer scenario.\n- c) Pushing the envelope in innovative green building technologies to enhance the resilience of our assets against physical and transition risks posed by climate change. Having set up the Green Building and Technology Application team under the Sustainability portfolio in 2020, the Group remains committed to exploring new frontiers in innovation and sustainable investing.\n- d) Disclosing CDL's management of climate-related risks using internationally recognised frameworks/ assessments, such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) and CDP.\n- e) Conducting climate change scenario analyses as a means of testing the Group's strategic resilience against different plausible and science-based climate scenarios (4 o C vs 2 o C (2018) and 2 o C vs 1.5 o C (2019/2020)). Commencing the third climate change scenario analysis in December 2021, taking into account COP26 outcomes and the prolonged impact of COVID-19.\n- f) Monitoring supply chain risks to better prepare for the increasing physical and social challenges impacting the Group's supplies of materials and workers.\n- g) Raising the bar on proactive, transparent and prompt ESG communication and reporting via digital platforms.",

We have established policies, guidelines and control procedures to manage and report exposure of such risks.\n\n## Market Concentration\n\nThe risk of a significant loss as a result of the poor performance of a single exposure (or group of related exposures).\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe Group's ability to meet short-term financial obligations.\n\n## Interest Rate\n\nThe interest rate risk carried by the Group relates primarily to interest-bearing financial assets and debt obligations.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations arising from sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currency of the Group's entities.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Monitoring and maintaining our geographical and asset concentration exposure in accordance with our risk appetite and tolerance.\n- b) Active management to ensure that our portfolio of assets, investments and businesses are diversified against the systemic risks of operating in a specific geography.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Monitoring and maintaining a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities.\n- b) Having in place Medium-Term Note (MTN) programmes to provide a further avenue to support planned growth and investment opportunities.\n- c) Maintaining a healthy gearing ratio.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Maintaining a balanced debt portfolio with both fixed and floating rates of interest.\n- b) Leveraging on interest rate derivatives to hedge against interest rate exposure for specific underlying debt obligations after considering prevailing market conditions.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Pursuing 'natural hedges' by matching receipts and payments and making asset purchases and borrowings in matching currencies, where possible.\n- b) Leveraging on forward foreign exchange contracts or cross-currency swaps to manage foreign exchange exposures.\n- c) Monitoring foreign exchange risk on a continual basis.\n\nFor more information on the Group's Financial Risk Management, please refer to the Financial Risk Management section on page 217 of this annual report.\n\n## Operational and Compliance Risk\n\nThe Group's operations are exposed to a variety of operational risks relating to project management, environmental, health and safety (EHS), human capital, data privacy, legal and compliance management.\n\n## Project Management\n\nThe Group continues to remain vigilant against project risks such as schedule delay, cost overrun, quality, contractor's capability and performance, as well as contract disputes, that will affect our reputation and sales.\n\n## Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\n\nThe Group is committed to be a socially and environmentally responsible organisation that advocates for a 'Safe and Green' corporate culture. In this regard, it is paramount  that  the  Group  maintains high environmental, health and safety standards across the Group, particularly at the operational level.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs  we  seek  new  avenues  of  growth, a key differentiator alongside access to innovation will be the ability to attract and retain talent, including new skills and capabilities to stay future-ready. The loss of some or all our key executives or the inability to attract or retain the right people, could materially and adversely affect our business in the medium to long-term.\n\n## Data Privacy\n\nThe Group recognises that data privacy breaches may undermine customer confidence and result in litigation from customers and/ or regulatory fines and penalties.\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subjected to applicable laws and regulations of the markets in which we operate, such as anti-bribery, corruption, money laundering, terrorism financing, competition and data privacy, along with all other laws and regulations applicable to licensing and conducting of sales, leasing, construction, property development, asset management and hotel operations.\n\nIn addition, various aspects of hotel operations are required to achieve compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ('PCI-DSS'), and failure to do so could result in penalties and/or withdrawal of credit card payment facilities.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Allocating appropriate attention to technically challenging and high-value projects.\n- b) Adopting a systematic assessment and monitoring process to identify and manage the key risks for each project. The Group adopts a rigorous project management process to ensure that project cost, quality and time objectives are met, and also has in place stringent pre-qualification and tendering procedures to appoint well-qualified vendors. Regular site visits are also conducted to closely monitor the progress of projects and manage potential risks of delays, poor workmanship and cost overruns.\n- c) Benchmarking our quality assurance processes against industry standards. We voluntarily subscribe to the BCA Construction Quality Assessment System (CONQUAS) and Quality Mark (QM) Assessment System.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Continuing the longstanding commitment to EHS since the implementation of the CDL EHS Policy in 2003.\n- b) Maintaining an integrated ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS) across all key operations in Singapore, to manage the environmental impact of our operations and the safety, health and well-being of employees, workers, homebuyers, tenants and building users. The hotel operations, where possible, also align policies and procedures with the requirements of best practice accredited systems.\n- c) Monitoring contractors' on-site EHS performance through an independent audit tool - CDL 5-Star EHS Assessment System.\n- d) Maintaining robust EHS practices for our managed assets to provide safe, conducive and eco-friendly environments for building users.\n- e) Practising responsible supply chain sourcing as part of our commitment to reduce the Group's environmental footprint.\n- f) Cultivating an EHS-centric culture amongst internal and external stakeholders through periodic workshops and trainings as well as regular communications to ensure that they are kept updated on EHS best practices.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Benchmarking and reviewing the competitiveness of our remuneration package on a periodic basis.\n- b) Investing in human capital development of our existing workforce, as well as current and emerging capabilities through professional hires and targeted recruitment.\n- c) Setting up an Enterprise Innovation Committee (EIC) to promote cross-department engagement, empowering employees to be innovative and share their ideas through in-house programmes to yield a capable and more agile workforce in support of business goals.\n- d) Conducting Employee Engagement Surveys, to help enhance existing policies, better address employee concerns, and introduce targeted initiatives to make CDL a better workplace.\n- e) Rolling out leadership development programmes to groom talent and establish succession planning for key positions.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Adopting a pragmatic 'Data-light, Data-tight' approach in our business conduct.\n- b) Adopting a risk-based approach to data protection.\n- c) Conducting awareness training to ensure that employees who directly and/or indirectly handle personal data in the course of their work are cognisant of data protection principles and are equipped with the right knowledge to carry out good data protection practices in their day-to-day activities.\n- d) Ensuring compliance with data protection requirements by our data processors.\n\nFor more information on how we manage personal data, please refer to our data privacy policy on our websites.

The Group currently benchmarks our practices against SS ISO 37001 to ensure that gaps are minimised, and our practices are in accordance with industry standards.\n- b) Conducting training sessions and adopting e-learning modules to raise awareness and train employees on ways to avoid or prevent non-compliant behaviour. An annual e-declaration exercise is to be completed by all employees, to acknowledge that they have read and understood, and agree to abide by, the Group's policies.\n- c) Maintaining effective whistleblowing reporting and communication channels for employees, contractors, customers and stakeholders of the Group to report any unethical, fraudulent or corrupt practices, in good faith, without fear of retaliation, for investigation and action subject to applicable laws.\n- d) Establishing platforms and channels to proactively monitor and identify applicable laws and regulatory obligations and embed compliance into policies and operating procedures.\n- e) Aligning our policies and procedures as reasonable and practical with the requirements of best practices accredited frameworks, systems and industry standards.",

Our IR Policy, also available on the CDL website (www.cdl.com.sg), outlines the principles and framework in which we communicate and engage with our shareholders and the investment community.\n\n## OPEN COMMUNICATION\n\nWe believe in timely and clear disclosure of pertinent information to provide investors with a better understanding of the Group's strategic and material developments through regular updates on our strategies, operations and financial performance that are available across multiple platforms.\n\nThe Group's financial results, investor presentations, annual and sustainability reports, media statements and other material announcements are disseminated on SGXNet (sgx.com) and published on our website's 'Investor Relations' section. In  addition,  our  website  and  social media channels (LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram) highlight the latest updates\n\non the Group's business milestones. Investors can subscribe to email alerts on the CDL website or follow our social media channels.\n\n## PROACTIVE ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe CDL senior management and IR team regularly engage with the investment community through various platforms such as Annual General Meeting (AGM), post-results luncheons, conferences, meetings and site visits. To update the market on our financial performance and maintain our reach, we hold biannual results briefings covering analysts and media. Investors can also attend these briefings via 'live' webcasts.\n\nWith the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, our investor meetings in 2021 largely took a virtual form, including our AGM in June and 1H 2021 financial results briefing in August.\n\nThroughout the year, we connected with over 100 investors via virtual meetings and conference calls to help them better understand how we are aligning our\n\n## Investor Type^\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Geographic Distribution^\n\n3.5\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- * Including shares held by brokers and undisclosed holdings.\n\nExcludes treasury shares\n\n- ^ As at 31 December 2021.\n\nstrategic priorities to enhance and unlock shareholder value. In tandem with the global climate change agenda, we saw an increased emphasis on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) investing. In 2021, our management participated in 11 ESG conferences organised by brokers to share our integrated sustainability strategy with the investment community.\n\nApart from facilitating corporate access for investors, the IR team also maintains regular communication with over 20 sellside equity research analysts that cover our stock. We also hosted virtual tours of our residential showflats to investors.\n\nWhile CDL had ceased quarterly reporting since the amendments to Rule 705(2) of the Listing Manual of Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited in February 2020, the Group continued to provide regular quarterly updates on our business performance and operations. This proactive approach remains a critical aspect in our IR engagement, as we recognise that investors are seeking better disclosure amidst the turbulent year and recalibrating their investment strategies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEquity markets remained volatile as pandemic recovery and inflationary concerns weighed down market sentiment. The Government's announcement of property cooling measures at year-end also resulted in trading volatility and impact. CDL's share price closed at $6.81 on 31 December 2021 - a 14.6% dip for the year.\n\nConsidering the total proposed cash dividend of 12.0 cents per share and the proposed distribution in specie of CDLHT units 1 , the total dividend distribution to shareholders is expected to be 31.1 cents 1 per share for FY 2021, representing a dividend payout of 333%.\n\n- 1 Refers  to  the  proposed  distribution in  specie of  144,300,000  stapled securities in CDLHT on a pro rata basis, estimated to be valued at 19.1 cents per share.\n\nWe manage this risk by:\n\n- a) Maintaining an IT security framework to address evolving IT security threats such as hacking, malware, mobile threats and loss of data. Measures and considerations have also been taken to safeguard against loss of information, data security, and prolonged service disruption of critical IT systems.\n- b) Dedicating IT expertise to keep abreast of the latest developments, innovation and threats in technology and assessing their impact and risks.\n- c) Conducting Vulnerability and Penetration Testing (VAPT) and guided self-assessments to identify IT security gaps.\n- d) Leveraging on threat intelligence and advanced security analytics to detect potential breaches.\n- e) Conducting training, including assessment exercises, to educate and heighten our users' awareness to cyber threats.\n- f) Maintaining a cyber threat incident response protocol and disaster recovery plan. The Group carries out disaster recovery plan testing at least once annually.",

The world shares the same focus on recovery and building resilience. Sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) have come to the fore of mainstream political and business agendas.\n\nRiding  on  the  Company's  strong foundation in sustainability built over two decades, CDL navigated the winds of change towards a 'new normal' and accelerated action towards a net zero future. The timely pledge to the World Green Building Council's (WorldGBC) Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment was  an  ambitious  but  necessary move to be future-ready for greater regulatory and investor expectations for businesses to step up their ESG initiatives.\n\nAmidst  global  uncertainties  and challenges, CDL has remained committed to integrating ESG into its core business. This has enabled CDL to pre-empt and mitigate enterprise risks, contributing to the long-term success and financial capital of the Company. Titled 'Zero in on Future Value', CDL's Integrated Sustainability Report 2022 details the Company's strategy with concrete actions taken in 2021 and a clearly defined pathway towards its net zero goals.\n\n## 2021 IN REVIEW\n\n- - ZERO IN ON FUTURE VALUE\n\n## Standing Together with Stakeholders through COVID-19\n\nMany of CDL's tenants in Singapore and overseas have continued to be adversely impacted by COVID-19, particularly during Singapore's Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), which saw a tightening of measures. CDL continued to work directly with them to navigate the operational challenges. This included providing rental, operational and  marketing  support  to  tenants adversely impacted by stricter measures. Since the beginning of the pandemic, CDL has committed more than $40 million in property tax and rental rebates.\n\n## Creating Safe and Healthy Spaces\n\nWith increased demands for safety and wellness by its building users, CDL implemented robust safety measures across  its  managed  properties, complementing  the  Singapore government's COVID-19 guidelines.\n\nBesides conducting regular compliance checks on Safe Management Measures (SMM) across its properties, CDL has also stepped up on its use of technology and conducted pilot studies to testbed sustainability solutions. These include a smart battery to replace diesel-powered generators, an autonomous robotic floor cleaner, and micro-climate control solutions to optimise air-conditioning, increasing energy efficiency and thermal comfort in buildings. These innovations have  helped  increase  operational efficiency and minimise exposure risk for building occupants.\n\n## More Robust ESG Policies and Guidelines for Greater Alignment along the Value Chain\n\nCDL's Human Rights Policy, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy, and Supplier Code of Conduct were enhanced in 2021 to align with the heightened standards and expectations of organisational practices within the Company and its suppliers. Building upon CDL's long-established EHS Policy and Green Procurement Guidelines, the Company formalised a Green Building Policy to provide greener, safer, healthier and more inclusive environments for its building users.\n\nCDL also strengthened its longstanding commitment to biodiversity protection and urban greenery. Since 2010, CDL has voluntarily conducted Biodiversity Impact Assessments (BIA) on greenfield sites before construction. To advance biodiversity  protection  and  urban greenery at its sites and buildings, a Biodiversity Policy, expanding on its BIA practices, was formulated in 2020. The policy complements Singapore's 'City in Nature' vision established in 2021. In 2016, CDL piloted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study for the Forest Woods residential development.\n\nBased on this pilot, CDL is exploring possibilities of applying the EIA for future developments.\n\nEmbodied carbon is increasingly a priority for decarbonisation. CDL has been actively engaging and empowering its supply chain partners such as suppliers and vendors to lower its carbon footprint. CDL was included in the 2021 CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard for the second consecutive year, placing CDL in the top 8% of companies assessed by CDP for supplier engagement on climate change.\n\n## Continued Recognition by Prominent Sustainability Rankings and Awards\n\nFrom aligning with global agendas to the Company's recognition as a thought leader, CDL continues to be a driving force in the sustainability landscape. CDL's corporate sustainability efforts have been affirmed by leading global sustainability ratings and rankings:\n\n- \u00b7  Global  100  Most  Sustainable Corporations in the World by Corporate Knights: Ranked fifth overall in 2022 and maintaining  its  ranking  as  the world's most sustainable real estate management  and  development company for the fourth consecutive year; only Singapore company listed for 13 consecutive years\n- \u00b7  CDP: Only company in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong to maintain double 'A's for climate change (since 2018) and water security (since 2019)\n- \u00b7  MSCI ESG Research: Maintained 'AAA' rating since 2010\n- \u00b7  Global  Real  Estate  Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) 2021: Global Sector Leader (Diversified - Office/Retail) and Overall Regional Sector Leader (Diversified - Office/Retail)\n\nCDL is also one of 45 companies and the only Singapore company to receive His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales' Terra Carta Seal. This Seal is part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative and recognises sustainability leaders in the private sector with globally recognised and credible net zero roadmaps.",

CDL's top material issues in 2021 spotlight stakeholder impact and partnerships. With COP26 and the push for game-changing policies and multilateral collaboration, engaging, educating and empowering people has become pivotal for a more climate-resilient future. Designed and built by CDL with industry partners, the Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA) is the first ground-up initiative and zeroenergy facility in Singapore dedicated to capacity building and thought leadership for climate action.\n\nSince its opening on 5 June 2017 to end2021, the SSA has reached out to over 100 partners, including government agencies, industries, businesses and NGOs, and hosted more than 630 sustainabilityrelated  training  programmes  and advocacy events, involving close to 22,300 attendees. Due to COVID-19, the SSA has gone virtual since April 2020 but has continued promoting sustainable\n\npractices and lifestyles, reaching out through various workshops and forums in Singapore and beyond. In 2021, both hybrid and Virtual SSA platforms reached out to thousands of local and international participants through post-event views on CDL's YouTube channel.\n\n## LONGSTANDING & UNWAVERING LEADERSHIP COMMITMENT\n\nCDL has established the longest history of having a dedicated Sustainability portfolio amongst Singapore companies, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) since 2014. The CSO reports directly to the Board Sustainability Committee (BSC), which comprises three independent directors and CDL's Group CEO. The BSC has direct advisory supervision on CDL's sustainability strategy, material ESG issues, work plans, performance targets and sustainability reporting. It convenes meetings at least twice annually to discuss CDL's sustainability plans and review its performance. Throughout the year, the CSO updates the BSC on CDL's ESG performance and initiatives, as well as global and local ESG trends through\n\nquarterly sustainability reports and emails, with additional meetings when necessary. CDL's sustainability governance structure, practices and disclosures, which have been in place for years, are in line with SGX's mandate on climate and board diversity disclosures.\n\nTo  achieve  effective  integration  of sustainability throughout the Company, the  CSO  chairs  the  Sustainability Committee,  which  comprises members  across  all  departments and  operational  units.  Heads  of Departments  (HODs)  and  their  line managers are held accountable for their ESG performances, which are captured in their annual performance appraisal that is linked to their remuneration and promotion. In addition to the annual sustainability reporting, CDL publishes an online quarterly sustainability report at  www.cdlsustainability.com.  This voluntary disclosure, since July 2017, has set benchmarks for the transparency and timeliness of ESG disclosures to investors and stakeholders.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF TOP 17 MATERIAL ESG ISSUES\n\nTo  address  changing  stakeholder expectations and to future-proof its business,  CDL  started  conducting materiality assessments since 2014. In 2021, CDL conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment with key internal and external stakeholders.

Stakeholder Impact  and Partnerships Supporting SDGs: | Building goodwill in the community provides   CDL with a strong social license to operate.  Through working with like-minded partners,   CDL has pioneered and developed partnerships   that multiply its outreach and impact on   climate action and UN SDGs.                        | Together with NParks, CDL launched a climate exhibition themed 'Change the Present,  Save the Future' at the CDL Green Gallery. Held in support of the Ministry of Sustainability  and the Environment's (MSE) Climate Action Week 2021, it amplified the call to action in  support of global and national climate efforts.

In 2016, CDL piloted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) study for its                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| TCFD Pillars:                                            | This is aligned with CDL's commitment to adopt nature-based solutions (e.g. biophilic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| G, S, RM                                                 | building design) to promote the integration of the built environment with nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## CDL's Value Creation Model Aligned with 14 UN SDGs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * CDL has pledged to achieve net zero operational carbon by 2030, covering new and existing wholly-owned assets under our direct management and operational control.

Under the company-wide Sustainability Committee, the Environment Sub-Committee identifies significant environmental aspects and manages impact that results from CDL's corporate operations, property development and facilities management activities. The Company continually tracks its material environmental aspects, which include carbon emissions, energy use, water use, waste, and resource management. Under Property Development, the finalised energy use intensity for the completed project, The Tapestry, has marginally missed the interim 2021 target. Moving forward, CDL has started piloting a smart energy storage system to replace the traditional diesel-powered generator to reduce its carbon footprint. The following charts detail CDL's environmental performance of its operations in Singapore excluding hotel properties, unless otherwise stated. Figures stated in charts may not add up due to the rounding of decimals.\n\nFor any clarifications required for performance data, please refer to CDL Integrated Sustainability Report 2022.\n\n## Total Carbon Emissions from CDL's Operations in Singapore: Corporate Office, Managed Buildings and Construction Sites (Tonnes CO 2 e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total Carbon Emissions from CDL's Operations in Singapore and Six Key Subsidiaries (Tonnes CO 2 e)\n\n<!-- image -->",

As an affirmation of  CDL's  proactive  human  resource policies and practices, CDL was named 'Employer of Choice 2021' by HRD Asia, and also one of the 'Best Companies to Work for in Asia' by HR Asia Awards Singapore 2021.\n\nAs one of Singapore's earliest corporate signatories to pledge support to the UN Global Compact, CDL has been upholding the principles on human rights and labour in its human resource practices. In addition, CDL has been a signatory of the Employers' Pledge of Fair Employment Practices with the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices since 2008.\n\n## Occupational Health and Safety\n\nThe occupational health and well-being of CDL employees, as well as workers at construction sites and managed properties, is vital for CDL's long-term business viability. There were zero fatalities and no occupational diseases across CDL's core operations in the year under review.\n\nIts overall minor injury rate is well below the industry average for 2021, based on figures provided by the Ministry of\n\nManpower. While the minor injury rate in CDL's Corporate Office and Property Development  remained  below  the industry average, the minor injury rate in Asset Management exceeded the industry average. Similarly, CDL's overall major injury rate exceeded the industry average mainly due to a single injury that occurred at the Whistler Grand construction site.\n\nCorrective actions for both minor and major  incidents  were  immediately implemented, and learnings from all incidents were actively shared with the respective managers, EHS working committees and contractors. CDL takes a serious stance on occupational health and safety and is committed to continual improvement of safety practices.\n\n## Job Creation and Employment\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, CDL has a total of 408 employees for its core operations headquartered in Singapore, where most of its business in property development and asset management is based, excluding hotel properties.\n\n## Employee Retention\n\nCDL's successful employee engagement is evident from its employees' length of service. The average tenure of the CDL Corporate Office's employees is about 8.7 years and more than 51% of its employees have been with the Company for over five years. The CDL Corporate Office's employee resignation rate of 14.0% continued to remain significantly lower\n\n## Total Number of Employees at CDL's Corporate Office\n\n415\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee Turnover Rate (%) at CDL's Corporate Office\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *   Computation of annual employee turnover is based on cumulative monthly attrition rate derived from the number of resignations for the month / headcount for the month.\n- +   Extrapolated from MOM's website as Q4 2021 national resignation rate was not available at the time of publication.\n\nthan the national average of 19.2% in 2021. CDL experienced an involuntary turnover rate of about 4.7%, of which 1.7% is due to retirement.\n\n## Training and Development\n\nIn 2021, CDL invested over $480,000 in training and development for its Corporate Office. More than 14,000 training hours were clocked. An average of five training days was achieved across the workforce. Due to WFH arrangements, CDL expanded its suite of online learning offerings for its workforce.",

Its recruitment process adheres to strict guidelines on non-discrimination and fair treatment, regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, or age. Women made up a significant 69% of CDL Corporate Office's workforce and 47% of HODs. The internal Diversity and Inclusion Task Force was formed in 2017 to promote diversity and inclusion within the workplace and the wider community.\n\n## Gender Diversity at CDL's Corporate Office\n\nFull-time Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Employee  Categories   at CDL's   Corporate Office   | Mean Salary  of Female  Employees to Male  Employees (%) 3   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Executive                                            | 90%                                                          |\n| Non-management                                       | 102%  (Females  were paid higher  than males)                |\n| Management                                           | 89%                                                          |\n\n## Community Investments\n\nCDL's community outreach initiatives are aligned with SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). The Company has been actively initiating and providing sustained support to programmes that deliver lasting and positive impact, focusing on these key areas:\n\n- \u00b7  Thought Leadership on Climate Action and Sustainable Development\n- \u00b7  Women Empowerment\n- \u00b7  Youth Engagement and Development\n- \u00b7  Community Outreach\n- \u00b7  Charity Initiatives\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 4 Climate change: IPCC report is 'code red for humanity'. BBC, 9 August 2021.\n\n## Employee Volunteerism\n\nSince 1999, CDL's dedicated employeeled volunteering body, City Sunshine Club (CSC), has been actively reaching out to the less fortunate and underprivileged, providing an avenue for CDL employees to serve the community. CSC organises monthly food distribution drives where CDL employees distribute household necessities to the low-income elderly living in rental flats. During festive seasons, CSC collaborates with the North West Community Development Council (NWCDC) by distributing festive packs to families staying in one-room rental  flats  and  organises  festive celebrations for terminally-ill patients and beneficiaries at Assisi Hospice and Arc Children's Centre.\n\nNotwithstanding the restrictions and strict adherence to social distancing and safety measures, CDL's employees managed to achieve a participation rate of 28.9% and clocked more than 350 volunteer manhours in 2021.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nThe world is in a climate emergency. In early 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel  on  Climate  Change's  6th Assessment  Report  was  deemed  a 'code red for humanity'. 4 Embracing sustainability is no longer a choice. COP26 gave renewed hope and urgency for global collaboration to galvanise change for a 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenario.\n\nAt CDL, sustainability has been integral to its business strategy and has sharpened its competitive advantage for the past two decades. With the support of multiple stakeholders, CDL will continue to step up its climate action and advance the transition to a low-carbon future.\n\n## Zeroing in on Future Value\n\nCDL is well placed to navigate the everevolving sustainability advancements globally and locally. Its ESG strategy and  firm  commitment  to  its  ethos\n\n- 3 Calculated as the mean salary of female employees over the mean salary of male employees.\n\nof  'Conserving  as  We  Construct', established in 1995, has positioned it well in the race to zero. The Company remains committed to achieving three deliverables:  'Decarbonisation', 'Digitalisation  &  Innovation'  and 'Disclosure and Communication'.\n\n## Decarbonisation - Commitment to Green Buildings and a Low-Carbon Economy\n\nAmbitious goals are effective drivers for action. As a demonstration of its commitment, CDL became the first real estate conglomerate in Southeast Asia to sign the WorldGBC Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment in February 2021. This is a global pledge to achieve net zero operational carbon by 2030, covering new and existing wholly-owned assets under its direct management and operational control.  In  November  2021,  during COP26, CDL extended its pledge towards a net zero whole life carbon emissions approach.  Through  this  expanded commitment, CDL pledged to achieve maximum reduction of embodied carbon in new developments, compensating for any remaining residual operational and upfront embodied emissions via offsetting for new developments by 2030 and for all buildings to be net zero carbon by 2050.\n\nCDL has also aligned itself with more ambitious carbon emissions reduction targets that have been successfully assessed and validated by SBTi in 2021, in line with a 1.5\u00b0C warmer scenario. CDL was the first Singapore real estate company to validate its targets by SBTi for a 2\u00b0C warmer scenario in 2018. CDL was also the only Singapore real estate company amongst 19 pioneering companies to participate in Climate Impact X's pilot auction of high-quality carbon credits.\n\nWhilst CDL has made good progress over the past two decades, there is always  room  to  do  more.  CDL  will embrace change, transform its business, and champion innovative solutions to future-proof its business and create\n\nvalue for its stakeholders. Racing to net zero as one will remain the cornerstone for its sustainability strategy in this decade of action.\n\n## Digitalisation & Innovation - Sustainable Technologies for a Green Revolution\n\nInnovation has been one of CDL's top ESG issues since 2017. In 2021, it was once again ranked as one of the top three material issues. In the past year, the Company has prioritised and intensified its search and application of viable green technology solutions, whilst tapping on cross-sector partnerships. CDL's strategic R&D partnership with the NUS College of Design and Engineering, formerly known as NUS School of Design and Environment, to develop smart home innovations continues to deliver impactful results. CDL piloted the Acoustic Friendly Ventilation Window at Irwell Hill Residences in 2021. This provides four times better ventilation as compared to an open conventional window, and reduces environment noise four times more than usual.\n\nCDL is well placed to accelerate Singapore's national sustainability agenda. From encouraging Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption to greening the city, its first foray into setting EV chargers in its property since 2009 has given it a head start in expanding the deployment of similar energy-efficient technologies and practices.\n\nTo further complement CDL's net zero goal for its buildings by 2030, CDL introduced its Smart, Sustainable and Super Low Carbon (3S) Green Building framework in 2020. This was established to expand CDL's green procurement guidelines and is aligned with BCA's SLE programme requirements, as well as international standards for advancing health and wellbeing in buildings. In 2021, CDL updated the 3S Green Building Framework to include embodied carbon management, in alignment with WorldGBC's expanded Net Zero Carbon Commitment.\n\nInnovation in new technology and R&D is vital not only to achieving net zero carbon emissions for its buildings, but also for the long-term resilience of businesses\n\nand communities. CDL will continue to revolutionise sustainable building technologies in support of the national vision for a smarter, greener and more liveable Singapore.\n\n## Disclosures - Unlocking Financial Value with Global Growth of ESG Investing\n\nAs the demand for green financing grows in the acceleration towards climate action, companies with strong ESG performance will gain easier access to ESG investment funds and sustainable finance. In September 2021, CDL became a proud signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), an investor initiative in partnership with UNEP Finance Initiative and the UN Global Compact. As of November 2021, the PRI's total AUM was worth more than US$121 trillion, signalling a rapidly accelerating transition towards sustainable assets.\n\nAs an extension of its commitment towards sustainable investments, the CDL Sustainable Investment Principles (SIP) were developed to steward responsible capital  allocation  and  investments decision-making. The SIP is aligned with the Glasgow Climate Pact, UN SDGs and several other global best practices and frameworks such as UN PRI, TCFD, UNEP FI. It also integrates CDL's existing ESG policies and guidelines, including the Climate Change Policy, EHS Policy, Green Building Policy, Biodiversity Policy and Human Rights Policy.\n\nSince issuing its first green bond in 2017, CDL has amassed more than $3 billion of sustainable finance in various green loans, a green revolving credit facility, and a sustainability-linked loan. In April 2021, CDL's South Beach Consortium secured a five-year green loan totalling $1.22 billion - one of Singapore's largest green loans to date. In August 2021, CDL and its JV partner secured green loans amounting to $847 million for the financing of two upcoming developments at Piccadilly Grand and Tengah Garden Walk. As a green developer, CDL's strong sustainability track record enabled the Company to tap the fast-growing sustainable financing pool to benefit its JV projects, sharing its\n\ngreen vision of a low-carbon future with like-minded partners.\n\nFor its successful R&D and pilot of DigiHUB, CDL also secured a discount for the SDG Innovation Loan provided by DBS Bank Ltd., making it the first Singapore entity to achieve a discount on a sustainability-linked loan through the adoption of an innovative project that supports the UN SDGs on a largescale basis.\n\n## Creating  Greater  Impact  through Partnerships and Thought Leadership\n\nBuilding a sustainable future requires the collaboration of a larger ecosystem and value chain. Through the years, CDL has multiplied its impact by investing its time and resources into thought leadership and partnerships.\n\nIn 2021, CDL actively hosted, moderated and participated in a record 104 speaking engagements from global forums to webinars, in partnership with esteemed institutions. CDL's Chief Sustainability Officer represented both the Singapore private sector and CDL at COP26, where she joined leaders from different key markets to speak on the Built Environment Leaders Panel, hosted by the COP26 organising committee. CDL also supported a series of programmes by Singapore Youth for Climate Action, aimed at turning climate anxiety into positive action.\n\nThe SSA has been a key platform for CDL's advocacy work in climate action aligned with the UN SDGs. Some of its key initiatives included The Conscious Festival by Green is the New Black, Sustainable Fashion 2.0, the second instalment of My Tree House's Eco-Storytelling Contest, and its Youth4Climate Concert 2021.\n\nActive collaboration with the public sector continues to be critical in CDL's sustainability drive, as seen through its 'Change the Present, Save the Future' exhibition in support of MSE's Climate Action Week 2021 and the Singapore Green Plan 2030.",

The Company recognises the urgency of climate change and its threat to the survival of humanity and is fully aware of its crucial role in contributing to the global race to zero.\n\nPlease refer to CDL Integrated Sustainability Report 2022 and www.cdlsustainability.com for the complete set of information.\n\nAs Singapore's real estate pioneer and green building leader, CDL takes pride in its tenacity in aligning its business with global and national goals to mitigate the negative impact of climate change. With CDL's Future Value 2030 Sustainability Blueprint as the bedrock of its ambitious ESG goals and strategies, CDL is well placed to accelerate its net zero goals for a low-carbon built environment.\n\n## Integrating UN SDGs has added purpose for a more balanced triple bottom line for CDL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group reported a return to profitability with a net attributable profit after tax and non-controlling interest (PATMI) of $97.7 million for FY 2021 (FY 2020: net loss after tax and non-controlling interest of $1.9  billion).  Revenue  for  FY  2021 increased by 24.5% to $2.6 billion (FY 2020: $2.1 billion). For FY 2021, the property development segment contributed 48% to total revenue, propelled by strong performing Singapore projects such as Whistler Grand, Amber Park, The Tapestry and Irwell Hill Residences, as well as overseas projects, including Shenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park, and contribution from New Zealand land sales.\n\nThe Group recorded a pre-tax profit of $227.7 million for FY 2021 (excluding the losses from Sincere Property Group (Sincere Property) in 2020, FY 2020: pre-tax loss of $14 million). For FY 2021, the property development segment continued to be the main contributor to the Group's pre-tax profit.\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\nRevenue increased by $288.5 million to $1,254.4 million (FY 2020: $965.9 million) for FY 2021. This segment reported a pre-tax gain of $244.7 million (FY 2020: pre-tax loss of $739.8 million) for FY 2021.\n\nProjects that contributed to both revenue and profit in FY 2021 include Whistler Grand,  Amber  Park,  The  Tapestry, Irwell Hill Residences, Haus on Handy, Shenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park  and  Hongqiao  Royal  Lake, Shanghai, as well as New Zealand land sales. In accordance with the Group's policy of equity accounting for the results of its joint ventures, whilst revenue from joint venture developments such as South Beach Residences, Boulevard 88, The  Jovell  and  Sengkang  Grand Residences had not been consolidated into the Group's total revenue, the Group's share of profit arising from these joint venture developments had been included in pre-tax profit.\n\nThe increase in revenue for FY 2021 was attributable to revenue contribution from Shenzhen Longgang, which the Group acquired in February 2021, and higher progressive contribution from Amber Park, due to higher percentage of completion achieved and units sold.\n\nThe substantial pre-tax loss recognised for FY 2020 was due to losses attributable to the Group's investment in Sincere Property.  Excluding  the  impact  of Sincere Property, this segment would have reported a pre-tax gain of $219.8 million for FY 2020. Pre-tax profit for FY 2021 were also boosted by contribution from Shenzhen Longgang, along with the negative goodwill recognised by the Group on its acquisition.\n\n## HOTEL OPERATIONS\n\nRevenue for this segment increased by $232.7 million to $873.1 million (FY 2020: $640.4 million) for FY 2021. This segment reported a lower pre-tax loss of $71.0 million (FY 2020: $573.4 million) for FY 2021.\n\nExcluding the impact of Sincere Property, this segment would have reported a pre-tax loss of $466.8 million for FY 2020.\n\nThe  increase  in  revenue  and  lower pre-tax loss is attributable to the recovery of the hospitality sector, backed by improved occupancy and room rates achieved by the Group's hotel portfolio, as governments gradually ease COVID-19 restrictions. Other than the improved hotel  performance,  the  reversal  of impairment losses made by the Group of $96.4 million (FY 2020: impairment loss of $87.0 million) on its hotel properties during the year also contributed to the lower pre-tax loss this year.\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\nRevenue for this segment decreased by $20.3 million to $341.1 million (FY 2020: $361.4 million) for FY 2021. This segment reported a pre-tax gain of $24.3 million (FY 2020: pre-tax loss of $575.0 million) for FY 2021.\n\nThe decrease in revenue for FY 2021 was largely due to lower contribution from Jungceylon mall, Patong, Phuket, which was closed for a large part of the year, Fuji Xerox Towers which had been vacated for redevelopment and Novotel Brisbane which was divested by the Group in October 2020.\n\nThe substantial pre-tax loss recognised for FY 2020 was due to losses attributable to the Group's investment in Sincere Property.  Excluding  the  impact  of Sincere Property, this segment would have reported a pre-tax gain of $135.8 million for FY 2020.\n\nExcluding the loss attributable to Sincere Property, pre-tax profit for this segment for FY 2021 declined mainly due to lower divestment gains recognised. In 2021, the Group recognised a divestment gain of $5.7 million on divestment of Mille Malle. In 2020, the Group recognised a gain of $107.9 million on the sale of Novotel Clarke Quay (held through CDLHT Group) to a joint venture consortium and a gain of $9.4 million on the divestment of Novotel Brisbane.\n\n## OTHERS\n\nRevenue, comprising mainly income from building maintenance contracts, project management, club operations, laundry services and dividend income, increased by  $16.5  million  to  $157.1  million (FY 2020: $140.6 million) for FY 2021. The increase for FY 2021 was due to higher project management fees earned.\n\nPre-tax profit decreased by $67.7 million to $29.7 million (FY 2020: $97.4 million) for FY 2021.\n\nDespite the increase in revenue, pretax profit for FY 2021 decreased mainly due to the absence of a $23.5 million divestment gain on Sceptre Hospitality Resources which was recognised by the Group in FY 2020 and higher fair value loss recognised on the remeasurement of certain quoted securities held by the Group.",

However,  most businesses  had  advanced  on  their digitalisation and automation journeys since 2020 and were able to adapt to the disruption more swiftly.\n\nThe Group was no exception and navigated the business and operational challenges adroitly, with all business segments delivering a resilient performance for the year.\n\n## PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT\n\n## Singapore\n\nProperty sales momentum was resilient in 2021, driven by sustained pent-up demand with many homebuyers seeking better homes and supported by a low interest rate environment.\n\nFor FY 2021, the Group and its joint venture (JV) associates sold 2,185 units including Executive Condominiums (ECs), with a total sales value of $4.3 billion - the highest annual property sales achieved in the Group's history (FY 2020: 1,318 units with a total sales value of $1.8 billion). The robust sales performance for the year was largely attributed to the Group's successful launch of two high-profile projects and sustained steady sales of its existing inventory.\n\nHealthy sales were also achieved for its existing inventory, with Piermont Grand EC and Whistler Grand - launched in 2019 and 2018 respectively - now fully sold.\n\nIn April, the Group launched its 540unit Irwell Hill Residences, located near the upcoming Great World MRT station.\n\nTo date, 418 units (77%) have been sold at an average selling price (ASP) of over $2,670 per square foot (psf) # .\n\nIn November, the Group and its JV partner  CapitaLand  Development launched the 696-unit CanningHill Piers, the  residential  component  of  its mega  integrated  project  located along the Singapore River. The mixeduse development, directly linked to Fort Canning MRT station, comprises CanningHill Square with F&B and retail outlets, a 475-room Moxy Hotel and a 192-unit Somerset Serviced Residence. The response was overwhelming with 538 units (77%) snapped up over the launch weekend, achieving sales value of $1.18 billion, making CanningHill Piers the best-selling project launch in the Central Area for 2021. The 8,956 sq ft Super Penthouse - the project's sole penthouse unit - was sold for $48 million ($5,360 psf). To date, 595 units (86%) have been sold at an ASP of over $2,990 psf # .\n\nIn February, The Tapestry, the Group's fully sold 861-unit project at Tampines Avenue  10  obtained  its  Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP). Construction activities in most project sites have gradually improved with the Government's aid to bring in migrant workers more expeditiously amid the severe labour shortage in the sector.\n\nTo replenish its landbank, the Group participated  in  Government  Land Sales (GLS) and private tenders. Apart from the two GLS sites acquired in 1H 2021 with its JV partner MCL Land at Northumberland  Road  and  Tengah Garden Walk, the Group entered into an off-market agreement to acquire a 179,007 sq ft residential development parcel at 798 and 800 Upper Bukit Timah Road for $126.3 million. The transaction is expected to complete in 1H 2022. Subject to planning approval, the site will be redeveloped into two 24-storey blocks with over 400 units.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Healthy Sales for Existing Inventory of Projects Launched in 2019 and 2020\n\n| Project                     | Location          | Launched       |   Total Units |   Units Sold | ASP Achieved   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Boulevard 88 *              | Orchard Boulevard | March 2019     |           154 |          127 | >$3,770 psf    |\n| Amber Park *                | Amber Road        | May 2019       |           592 |          524 | >$2,465 psf    |\n| Haus on Handy               | Handy Road        | July 2019      |           188 |           51 | >$2,800 psf    |\n| Piermont Grand EC *         | Sumang Walk       | July 2019      |           820 |          820 | $1,109 psf     |\n| Nouvel 18 +                 | Anderson Road     | July 2019      |           156 |          122 | >$3,330 psf    |\n| Sengkang Grand Residences * | Sengkang Central  | November 2019  |           680 |          655 | >$1,725 psf    |\n| Penrose *                   | Sims Drive        | September 2020 |           566 |          543 | >$1,600 psf    |\n\n- * JV project\n- + Divested project marketed by CDL\n- # As of 20 February 2022\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n## Revenue by Business Segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Profit Before Tax by Business Segment*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EBITDA by Business Segment\n\n10\n\n%\n\nHotel Operations\n\nOthers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n228\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## OPERATIONS AND MARKET REVIEW\n\nOn 16 December 2021, the Government introduced property cooling measures to temper the rising residential property prices and high transaction volumes that could potentially run ahead of market fundamentals. Residential property prices registered an increase of 10.6% in 2021, while transaction volume rose over 30% to 13,027 units year-on-year. Alongside the tightening measures, the Government also boosted supply by increasing the GLS programme for 1H 2022 with five confirmed sites which will yield more than 2,880 units (including ECs), an increase of 39% over 2H 2021.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the measures, sales are still healthy, though some homebuyers may take more time to assess the situation before committing to a purchase. However, with limited supply of new units in the market, buying interest is expected to remain.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL\n\n## Australia\n\nDespite tight COVID-19 restrictions domestically, the Group's residential portfolio continued to see positive uptake. In  New  South  Wales,  the  Group's collaboration with Waterbrook Lifestyle for a retirement village project in Bowral has exchanged contracts on all the 77 townhouses launched.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- # As of 20 February 2022\n\nThe Marker, a JV project comprising 198 residential units located in West Melbourne, has pre-sold 81% of its apartments. The Group's mixed-use JV development named Fitzroy Fitzroy in Melbourne, launched in October 2021, has pre-sold 24% of its 62 apartments and townhouses.\n\nThe 215-unit Brickworks Park located in the prestigious Alderley suburb of North Brisbane has sold 82% of its 151 units released to date # . In December 2021, the Group entered into a JV with Brisbane-based developer Metro Group to acquire Kenmore Treetops, located in the leafy suburb of Kenmore. The project will comprise 97 units and is slated for launch in 2022.\n\n## Japan\n\nThe Group continues to hold its sizeable freehold land site in Shirokane, Tokyo, acquired in 2014. Land values have appreciated substantially in Japan and the Group can develop or divest this prime site at the appropriate time to maximise value.\n\n## UK\n\n2021 saw the strongest year in real estate price increase in the UK since the Global Financial Crisis. The strong housing demand was driven by the pandemicfuelled desire for more space as well as the stamp duty holiday, which resulted in high levels of sales activity. Rental growth and demand remain strong.\n\nAs more buyers return to the capital, the Group expects the sales for its two prime London developments in Belgravia and Chelsea to pick up in 2022. Marketing activities are ongoing for Teddington Riverside, the Group's 239unit development in Southwest London, with more than 43% of the units currently occupied.\n\nThe Group is on track to submit its revised planning application based on a hybrid scheme for the former Stag Brewery site in Mortlake in 1H 2022, even as it progresses with plans for its other three development projects in London - namely Ransomes Wharf, Development House and 28 Pavilion Road.\n\n## China\n\nWith the Chinese Government's continued deleveraging efforts, residential price growth slowed in 2021 due to weaker demand. In FY 2021, the Group continued to sell down its existing inventory, with most projects substantially sold.\n\nHong Leong City Center (HLCC), a mixeduse development in Suzhou Industrial Park, has sold 1,670 (92%) of its 1,813 residential and retail units to date # . HLCC's Grade A office tower is now 94% occupied while HLCC mall's occupancy is currently at 87%, and the 295-room five-star M Social Suzhou hotel is expected to open in 2023.\n\nIn Chongqing, the completed 126-unit Eling Palace has sold 115 units (91%) to date # . In Shanghai, Hongqiao Royal Lake, a luxury development in Qingpu District, has sold 71 out of the 85 villas (84%) to date # .\n\nIn September 2021, the Group announced the  divestment  of  its  50.01%  joint controlling interest in Sincere Property Group (Sincere Property) to mitigate being engaged in a long drawn bankruptcy reorganisation  of  Sincere  Property. Concurrently, the Group entered into an agreement for the transfer of 15.4% interest in Shenzhen Tusincere Technology Park Development Co, Ltd., (Shenzhen Tusincere) from Sincere Property as partial repayment for an outstanding loan. Shenzhen Tusincere is the holding company with a 65% equity interest in the Shenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park asset. Shenzhen Tusincere is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group and the Group holds a 65% effective stake in the asset, with direct control over the project's management.\n\nFollowing the above transactions and based on the estimated fair value of Shenzhen Tusincere, the Group's current financial exposure to Sincere Property is reduced to $82 million. The Group has no stake in Sincere Property and will continue to protect its rights as a creditor in relation to the repayment of outstanding loans extended by the Group.\n\n## INVESTMENT PROPERTIES\n\n## Singapore\n\nDespite a challenging economic backdrop, the committed occupancy of the Group's Singapore  office  portfolio  remained resilient at 93.3%, above the island-wide occupancy of 87.2%. Republic Plaza, the Group's flagship Grade A office building, achieved a healthy committed occupancy of 96.4% and registered positive rental reversion in Q4 2021. The tight CBD office supply situation coupled with the improved business outlook are expected to support rental rate growth in the near term.\n\nThe Group's retail portfolio was also resilient, with committed occupancy at 93.8%, above the national average of 91.9%. The pandemic has given rise to new lifestyle trends such as athleisure, focusing on wellness and active living. To leverage this growth trend, City Square Mall has rejuvenated its tenant mix and will welcome an athleisure cluster by Q2 2022, which includes an integrated golf flagship store occupying more than 15,000 sq ft under MST Golf Super Store, together with Puma and Adidas.\n\nIn line with its focus to unlock value from its asset portfolio, the Group has progressed on its redevelopment plans for its two mature assets in the CBD, 80 Anson Road (former Fuji Xerox Towers) and Central Mall.\n\nThe  80  Anson  Road  site  is  being re-developed  under  the  Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) CBD Incentive  Scheme,  with  Provisional Permission for a 25% uplift in gross floor area (GFA) to approximately 655,000 sq ft obtained in May 2021. The project\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwill comprise a 46-storey mixed-use integrated development with office, retail, serviced apartments and 256 apartments for sale. This project is the first integrated development to achieve the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy (SLE) certification, with SLE certification for the residential, serviced apartments, office and retail categories. Demolition works have commenced and construction is expected to begin in end-2022.\n\nIn December 2021, the Group announced its redevelopment plans for its Central Mall properties into a large-scale mixeduse development following the acquisition of  Central  Square  for  a  purchase consideration  of  $315  million.  The enlarged site will be redeveloped under URA's Strategic Development Incentive Scheme into a mixed-use development comprising office, retail, hospitality and potentially a residential component. Through the scheme, the redevelopment will yield a significant GFA uplift of about 67% to approximately 735,500 sq ft and transform the precinct into a new and vibrant lifestyle hub.\n\nApart from its redevelopment projects, the Group has also embarked on AEIs to reposition and refresh its asset portfolio. In Q2 2021, the Group commenced on an AEI for Palais Renaissance to upgrade the common areas and increase its F&B\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprovision. By the end of 2021, more than 90% of the AEI works have been completed, with a unique alfresco dining area created at level 1. With the AEI, committed occupancy for the retail space has improved to above 90%.\n\n## International\n\nLeasing  of  the  Group's  overseas investment properties remained resilient despite lockdowns, imposed COVID-19 restrictions and uncertainties over the Omicron variant infections.\n\n## China\n\nIn Shanghai, Hong Leong Plaza Hongqiao has leased 76% of its space for serviced apartments, a confinement centre and corporate office use, sustaining stable recurring income as majority of the leases tenures are over 10 years. At Hong Leong Hongqiao Center, the committed occupancy of the office and retail space is maintained at 93%, above the average occupancy level in the Hongqiao area.\n\nShenzhen Longgang Tusincere Tech Park, a large-scale mixed-use business park development in Shenzhen, of which the Group now owns 65% effective equity interest, has contracted a total of 341 units since March 2021 (post the Group's acquisition) with a sales value of RMB 910.7 million ($193.6 million). After the deduction of contracted sales from the previous period terminated mainly by a third-party office sales agent in August 2021, the net contracted sales value achieved since March 2021 was RMB 611.7 million ($130.0 million).\n\nIn  2021,  the  construction  of  three blocks under Phase 2 of the project was completed and the office units in Block 22, along with the apartments in Block 20, were successfully handed over.",

        "page_content": "## OPERATIONS AND MARKET REVIEW\n\n## UK\n\nIn 2021, Aldgate House and 125 Old Broad Street remain well occupied with stable rent collections. New leases are being entered into alongside ongoing discussions with existing tenants on potential lease renewals and new space requirements. AEIs at both properties are underway to enhance tenant welfare and these initiatives are expected to bolster rental rates. The office market is expected to strengthen in 2022 as pandemic restrictions ease.\n\nIn 2019, the Group expanded into the Private Rented Sector (PRS) segment and now has three projects in the UK with a pipeline of over 1,300 units. This  includes  a  352-unit  forwardfunded project in Manchester acquired by CDLHT in August 2021.\n\nThe Group's first PRS project in the UK, The Junction in Leeds, is currently under construction and will complete in phases starting from mid-2022. The project comprises 665 PRS units and 24,000 sq ft of commercial space within the site's attractive heritage arches beneath a viaduct.\n\nIn December 2021, the Group acquired a 250-year leasehold PRS site in the heart of Birmingham's Paradise precinct. The 16,760 sq ft site will be developed into The Octagon, an iconic 155-metre tower with 370 units, at an estimated total development cost (including land cost of \u00a36.5 million) of around \u00a3110 million ($200 million). Completion of the development is expected in 2025 and The Octagon will be the  world's  tallest  pure  octagonal residential skyscraper.\n\nThe PRS segment continues to outperform many other asset classes despite market volatility stemming from the pandemic. In anticipation of housing supply shortages and elevated property prices, the PRS is projected to be in high demand for renters looking for high-quality and professionally-managed homes.\n\n## Japan\n\nThe Group has five PRS projects located in Osaka and Yokohama with 242 units, with another two PRS projects totalling 207 units in Yokohama pending sale completion.\n\nThe Osaka and Yokohama projects enjoy stable rent and strong occupancy of above 90%. In October 2021, the Group entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA)  for  two  PRS  projects  -  Tobe Residence (117 residential and 1 retail unit) and LOC's Yokohama Bayside (89 residential units) - in Yokohama City for JPY 4.9 billion ($60.5 million). The transactions are expected to complete in Q2 2022.\n\n## Others\n\nIn the US, the Group has completed Phase 1 of its redevelopment project in Sunnyvale, California, with the 250-unit residential development ready for lease. The apartments capitalise on Sunnyvale's strategic location as the headquarters of many technology companies. Leasing activity has commenced with a strong take up of over 70% as of end 2021.\n\nIn Thailand, the Group will embark on a major AEI of its Jungceylon retail complex in Patong, Phuket to increase the net lettable  area  with  new-to-market concepts and a refreshed experiential trade mix. The enhancement works will be completed in phases, with the reopening of the first phase planned in Q4 2022.\n\n## FUND MANAGEMENT\n\nWith improving sentiments of the UK commercial market, the Group continues to pursue its plan for a Singapore-listed REIT with UK office properties.\n\nThe  Group  remains  focused  on achieving its US$5 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) by 2023. In addition to the proposed UK REIT initiative, the Group also has stakes in other fund management platforms.\n\nIt has a 50% interest in the manager of  Singapore-listed  IREIT  Global and currently holds 21% of the total issued units. This pan-European REIT has an AUM of \u20ac889.7 million as at 31 December 2021. Following the special distribution in specie of 144,300,000 stapled securities in CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT) on a pro rata basis to shareholders, the Group will continue to hold approximately 27% interest in CDLHT, one of Asia's leading hospitality trusts  with  an  AUM  of  about  $2.9 billion as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## HOSPITALITY\n\nWhile  the  operating  challenges  of COVID-19 continued to be felt in 2021 as  international  travel  restrictions were still largely in place, the Group's hospitality business progressed on its road to recovery.\n\nIn constant currency, global revenue per available room (RevPAR) for FY 2021 increased 48.6% to $78.9 (FY 2020: $53.1). Global room occupancy increased 12.4% to 51.0% (FY 2020: 38.6%) while global gross operating profit (GOP) margins registered an increase of 18.1% points to 21.8%.\n\nFor Asia, RevPAR for FY 2021 increased 17.6% to $64.6 (FY 2020: $55.4), while Australasia increased 1.4% to $73.9 (FY 2020: $72.9). Europe and the US regions with strong domestic markets - showed the strongest performance improvements, with RevPAR jumps of 128.7% (to $78.9) and 72.3% (to $98.4) respectively. This recovery trend is expected to continue in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, the Group continued to make progress  on  its  hotel  repositioning initiatives. The M Social Hotel Times Square New York opened in May 2021 with a strong performance and the property has been GOP positive since. Formerly the Novotel New York Times Square, this reflagged property marks the first M Social hotel in the US.\n\nIn Europe, the Group debuted its first M Social in the continent with the M Social Hotel Paris Opera, which opened in September 2021. The Group will continue its rollout of the M Social brand with a second European outpost planned for Spring 2023 in London's Knightsbridge. Situated on majestic Sloan Street, one of the most enviable addresses in the capital,  the  222-room  hotel  brings guests right into the heart of London's most exclusive experiences, such as shopping at Harrods and strolling in leafy Hyde Park.\n\nIn  Singapore,  the  Group  plans  to complete  the  refurbishments  of Studio M which started in 2020 but was subsequently suspended due to the pandemic. The first phase comprising 146 rooms has been completed and the remaining rooms will complete in Q2 2022. Grand Copthorne Waterfront is planning to commence the refurbishment of its guest rooms and its meeting and events facilities towards the end of 2022, with completion expected in 1H 2023. The Group will also be exploring the refurbishment for Millennium Resort Patong Phuket, in tandem with the AEI works at the adjoining Jungceylon mall.\n\nIn  New  Zealand,  Kingsgate  Hotel Greymouth was closed in April 2021 for refurbishment. It will be rebranded to the Copthorne Hotel Greymouth when it reopens in 1H 2022, while refurbishments for two levels of guestrooms at Millennium Hotel Queenstown are ongoing.\n\nThe Group will also be completing M Social Suzhou in 2023, located in the heart of Suzhou Industrial Park and adjacent to the beautiful Jinji Lake. The 295-room hotel integrates the traditional local characteristics of Suzhou, combining a modern and creative fashionable design with oriental beauty.\n\nThe Group will continue to review and optimise its hospitality portfolio by refurbishing its properties, evaluating alternative uses for its sites and executing\n\ndivestments where appropriate, including being an active sponsor to CDLHT. As an operator, the Group will harness technology and innovation to address labour shortages, improve operational efficiencies and focus on the customer experience and brand promise.\n\n## GROUP DIVESTMENTS\n\nOn 10 December 2021, the Group signed a SPA with an entity managed by IGIS Asset Management to divest the Millennium Hilton Seoul and the adjoining land site for KRW 1.1 trillion (approximately $1.25 billion). A deposit of KRW 110 billion was received upon signing and the sale was completed on 24 February 2022 with the balance payment of KRW 990 billion (approximately $1.13 billion) received. The Group expects to recognise a total estimated gain on disposal of $528.83 million, net of taxes and related transaction costs.\n\nThe sale of the Seoul assets marks the Group's third hotel divestment of the M&C portfolio since its privatisation and its largest hotel divestment to date.  The  previous  two  M&C  hotel divestments completed were Millennium Hotel  Cincinnati  and  Copthorne Hotel Birmingham.\n\nThe Group terminated the SPA with Ivory Properties Group Berhad for Copthorne Orchid Hotel & Resort Penang, due to the buyer's failure to pay the balance consideration when the remedy period expired on 17 December 2021. The buyer forfeited the deposit and extension fees paid.\n\nIn December 2021, a public tender was launched for the collective sale of Tanglin Shopping Centre, with a guide price of $828 million. Through King's Tanglin Shopping  Pte  Ltd,  a  wholly-owned subsidiary of M&C, the Group owns about 34.6% of Share Value and 60.2% of Strata Area in the strata-titled development. The tender closed on 22 February 2022 and received a top bid of $868 million (or $2,769 psf ppr), at a premium of 10% over the reserve price.\n\nThe Group has held its interest in this freehold office-cum-shopping complex for long-term investment since 1981, as part of its investment properties portfolio. This collective sale exercise will enable the Group to unlock value and realise a significant capital gain from its investment. The sale is subject to approval of Strata Titles Board and other conditions.\n\n## GETTING REVITALISED\n\nMoving into 2022, financial markets met with impact from the geopolitical crisis while climate change considerations continue to permeate policy agendas around the world. Notwithstanding the evolving macroeconomic concerns and challenges, there are still reasons to be optimistic in the year ahead with the promise of global economic reopenings and recovery.\n\nThe Group will continue to progress with  its  Growth,  Enhancement  and Transformation (GET) strategy to expand, unlock value and transform for the future - and emerge stronger from the aftermath of the COVID-19 disruptions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In accordance with the M&C Group's accounting policy on share-based payment transactions, the fair value of share options and long-term incentive awards is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and long-term incentive awards. There was no charge to the statement of profit or loss for current year.\n\nThe M&C Group has applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements from 1 January 2005 except for arrangements granted before 7 November 2002.\n\nThere were no options granted by M&C during 2021 in line with the recommended final cash offer (Final Offer) made by the Company in 2019 and any outstanding options are to close out per the final vesting dates.\n\n## (i) Annual Bonus Plan\n\nUnder the Annual Bonus Plan, deferred share awards were granted annually to selected employees of the M&C Group.

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n## REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the accompanying financial statements of City Developments Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies as set out on pages 110 to 269.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements ' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Valuation of hotel assets\n\n(Refer to note 4 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Group has significant hotel assets classified as property, plant and equipment which are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are subject to an annual assessment for impairment indicators. In undertaking the impairment assessment, the Group takes into consideration several factors, including the economic outlook, the quantum of available headroom from previous valuations undertaken (where applicable) and the trading performance of the properties. The identified properties are then subjected to a detailed impairment review whereby their recoverable amounts are estimated.\n\nThe Group uses a combination of internal and external valuations to estimate the recoverable amount of its properties identified as at risk of being impaired, which is determined to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use of these properties. The valuations are sensitive to key assumptions applied and a change in the assumptions may have an impact on the recoverable amounts.\n\nThe valuation reports obtained from the external valuers for certain hotels also have highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement. Consequently, less certainty and a higher degree of caution should be attached to these valuations than would normally be the case. Values may change more rapidly and significantly than during standard market conditions. Due to the uncertainties that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuers have also recommended to keep the valuation of these properties under frequent review.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures included challenging the Group's assessment of the properties at risk of being impaired. These include comparing the actual asset performance to previous forecasts and to market data, and assessing the quantum of available headroom from previous valuations. For a sample of properties selected for a detailed impairment review, we considered the valuation methods used against those applied by valuers for similar property types. We evaluated the key assumptions applied in the valuations, particularly those assumptions relating to occupancy rates, average room rate growth, discount rates, terminal rates and capitalisation rates, by comparing them to available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors.\n\n## Our findings\n\nThe Group has a structured process in identifying hotel assets with impairment indicators. We found that the valuation methods used were in line with generally accepted market practices and the key assumptions applied were generally comparable to currently observable market data, taking into consideration the uncertainties arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Valuation of development properties\n\n(Refer to note 12 to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Group has significant residential development properties held for sale in Singapore, China and the United Kingdom (UK). Development properties held for sale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable values. The determination of the estimated net realisable value is highly dependent on the Group's expectations of future selling prices of unsold development properties.\n\nIn estimating the future selling prices of unsold development properties, the Group has taken into account real estate price trend information, local market conditions, its development plans and sale strategies for the properties and selling prices estimated by external valuers when necessary.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe focused our work on development properties with low margins.\n\nIn assessing the reasonableness of the Group's estimated future selling prices for its development projects, we considered recently transacted prices of units under development sold and/or prices of comparable properties located in the vicinity of the development projects, taking into account the prevailing market trends and the Group's development and selling plans for the properties. Where applicable, we made enquiries of the external valuers to understand the approach adopted in estimating the future selling prices of the development properties.",

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n## Our findings\n\nIn making its estimates of future selling prices, the Group takes into account market data including the macroeconomic factors and real estate price trends of the markets in which the properties are located, its development plans and sales strategies for the properties and the selling prices for certain development projects provided by the independent external valuers. The Group performs a regular review of its estimates of future selling prices of development projects and revises them when necessary.\n\nWe found the Group's estimated future selling prices, which are used in determining the net realisable values and the resultant allowance for foreseeable losses on its development projects, have taken into consideration currently available market data and prevailing market conditions.\n\n## Other information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report. Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.\n\nWe have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act, SFRS(I)s and IFRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nMEMBERS OF THE COMPANY CITY DEVELOPMENTS LIMITED\n\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulations precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Lo Mun Wai.\n\n## KPMG LLP\n\nPublic Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\nSingapore 21 March 2022",

Ltd., a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\n## 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)s) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). SFRS(I)s, issued by the Accounting Standards Council (ASC), comprises standards and interpretations that are equivalents to IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). All references to SFRS(I)s and IFRSs are subsequently referred to as SFRS(I) in the financial statements.

Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.\n\nInformation about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is described in the following notes:\n\nNote 3.1(i)\n\nAccounting for acquisitions as business combinations or asset acquisitions\n\nNotes 3.1(iv), 43 and 44 Assessment of ability to control or exert significant influence over partly owned investments\n\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year is described in the following notes:\n\nNote 3.19\n\nEstimation of provisions for current and deferred taxation\n\nNotes 4 and 5\n\nMeasurement of recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment, and investment properties\n\nNote 7 and 41\n\nMeasurement of recoverable amounts of investments in subsidiaries and expected credit losses on balances with subsidiaries\n\nNote 9\n\nMeasurement  of  expected  credit  losses  on  amounts  owing  by  HCP  Chongqing  Property Development Co., Ltd and its subsidiaries\n\nNote 10\n\nMeasurement of expected credit losses on financial assets - unquoted debt investment at amortised cost\n\nNote 12\n\nMeasurement of realisable amounts of development properties\n\nNote 25\n\nValuation of defined benefit obligations\n\nNote 28\n\nEstimate of provision relating to sale of Millennium Hilton Seoul\n\n## Measurement of fair values\n\nA number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This includes a team that regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments and reports to the Group Chief Financial Officer who has overall responsibility for all significant fair value measurements. If third party information, such as broker quotes or independent valuers' report, is used to measure fair values, then the team assesses and documents the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of SFRS(I), including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified.\n\nSignificant valuation issues are reported to the Group's Audit & Risk Committee and Board of Directors.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 2.4 Use of estimates and judgements (cont'd)\n\nWhen measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2:\n\ninputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\n- \u00b7 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nIf the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).\n\nThe Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\nFurther information about assumptions made in measuring fair values is included in the following notes:\n\nNote 5\n\nInvestment properties\n\nNote 25\n\nShare-based payment arrangements\n\nNote 39\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries\n\nNote 41\n\nFinancial instruments\n\n## 2.5 Changes in accounting polices\n\n## Amendments to standards and interpretations\n\nThe Group has applied Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39 and SFRS(I) 7, SFRS(I) 4 and SFRS(I) 16) for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 January 2021.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Group has early adopted COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendment to SFRS(I) 16) which is effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2021 with earlier application permitted.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform - Phase 2 amendments\n\nThe Group applied the Phase 2 amendments retrospectively. However, in accordance with the exceptions permitted in the Phase 2 amendments, the Group has elected not to restate comparatives for the prior periods to reflect the application of these amendments. Since the Group had no transactions for which the benchmark rate had been replaced with an alternative benchmark rate as at 31 December 2020, there is no impact on opening equity balances as a result of retrospective application.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

These reliefs relate to modifications of financial instruments and lease contracts or hedging relationships triggered by a replacement of a benchmark interest rate in a contract with a new alternative benchmark rate.\n\nIf the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changes as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, then the Group updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- \u00b7 the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nIf changes are made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, then the Group first updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform. Subsequently, the Group applies the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.\n\nThe amendments also provide an exception to use a revised discount rate that reflects the change in interest rate when remeasuring a lease liability because of a lease modification that is required by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nFinally, the Phase 2 amendments provide a series of temporary exceptions from certain hedge accounting requirements when a change required by interest rate benchmark reform occurs to a hedged item and/or hedging instrument that permit the hedge relationship to be continued without interruption. The Group applies the following reliefs as and when uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group amends the designation of a hedging relationship to reflect changes that are required by the reform without discontinuing the hedging relationship; and\n- \u00b7 when a hedged item in a cash flow hedge is amended to reflect the changes that are required by the reform, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows are determined.\n\nWhere uncertainty persists in the timing or amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument, the Group continues to apply the existing accounting policies disclosed in note 3.6(vi). Related disclosures about risks, financial assets and financial liabilities indexed to inter-bank lending rates (IBOR) and hedge accounting are set out in note 41.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 2.5 Changes in accounting polices (cont'd)\n\nCOVID-19 - Related rent concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendment to SFRS(I) 16)\n\nThe amendment to SFRS(I) 16, issued in March 2021, extends the practical expedient introduced by COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions (the 2020 amendments) by one year to allow lessees not to account for rent concessions as lease modifications if they occur as a direct consequence of COVID-19 and meet all of the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 the revised consideration is substantially the same as or less than the original consideration;\n- \u00b7 the reduction in lease payments relates to payments due on or before 30 June 2022; and\n- \u00b7 no other substantive changes have been made to the terms of the lease.\n\nThe Group has elected to apply this practical expedient to all property leases.\n\nThe application of the above amendments to standards and interpretations did not have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities, except as explained in note 2.5, which addresses changes in accounting policies.\n\n## 3.1 Basis of consolidation\n\n## (i) Business combinations\n\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.\n\nThe Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\n## Acquisitions from 1 January 2017\n\nFor acquisitions from 1 January 2017, the Group measures goodwill at the date of acquisition as:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus\n- \u00b7 the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests (NCI) in the acquiree; plus\n- \u00b7 if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree,\n\nover the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen  share-based  payment  awards  (replacement  awards)  are  exchanged  for  awards  held  by  the  acquiree's employees (acquiree's awards) and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer's replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree's awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service.\n\nFor non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation, the Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure them at fair value, or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are measured at acquisition-date fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another standard.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity investments, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\nChanges in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the adjustment to non-controlling interests and the fair value of consideration paid is recognised directly in equity and presented as part of equity attributable to owners of the Company.\n\n## Acquisitions before 1 January 2017\n\nAs part of transition to SFRS(I), the Group elected not to restate those business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to SFRS(I), i.e. 1 January 2017. Goodwill arising from acquisitions before 1 January 2017 has been carried forward from the previous FRS framework as at the date of transition.\n\n## (ii) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nThe accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.1 Basis of consolidation (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Loss of control\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.\n\n## (iv) Investments in associates and joint ventures (equity-accounted investees)\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over their financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI) of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses exceeds its investment in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest, together with any long-term interests that, in substance, form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\n## (v) Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control whereby the Group has rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to an arrangement. The Group accounts for each of its assets, liabilities and transactions, including its share of those held or incurred jointly, in relation to the joint operation.\n\nThe Group is a 51% (2020: 51%) partner in Hong Realty (Private) Limited - Pasir Ris Joint Venture (the Pasir Ris Joint Venture), a joint arrangement formed with two fellow subsidiaries, whose principal activity is that of a property developer and the place of business is in Singapore. The Group is also a 20% (2020: 20%) partner in Park Court Aoyama The Tower, a joint arrangement formed with a third party, whose principal activity is that of a property developer and the place of business is in Japan. The Group has classified both joint arrangements as joint operations as the joint venture partners control the joint arrangements collectively and the joint arrangements are not structured through separate legal vehicles.\n\n## (vi) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investee are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n## (vii) Subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures in the separate financial statements\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated in the Company's statement of financial position at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end of the year.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currencies at the exchange rates at the dates that the fair values were determined. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss. However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in OCI:\n\n- \u00b7 differences arising on the translation of monetary items that in substance form part of the Group's net investment in a foreign operation;\n- \u00b7 an investment in equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI);\n- \u00b7 a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; or\n- \u00b7 qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective.\n\n## (ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign currency differences are recognised in OCI. However, if the foreign operation is a non wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the non-controlling interests. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the foreign currency translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of the Group's net investment in the foreign operation are recognised in OCI, and are presented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.3 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nItems  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost,  which  includes  capitalised  borrowing  costs,  less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the cost of materials and direct labour;\n- \u00b7 any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use;\n- \u00b7 when the Group has an obligation to remove the asset or restore the site, an estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located; and\n- \u00b7 capitalised borrowing costs.\n\nPurchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised net in profit or loss.\n\n## (ii) Subsequent costs\n\nThe cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.\n\nDepreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.\n\nDepreciation is recognised from the date that the property, plant and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.\n\nNo depreciation is provided on freehold land (including 999-year leasehold land). For freehold and leasehold properties under development and renovation-in-progress, no depreciation is provided until these items have been completed.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

No residual values are ascribed to surface, finishes and services of hotel buildings and right-of-use assets in respect of leases where the Group is a lessee.\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date.\n\n## 3.4 Investment properties\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nInvestment properties are properties held either to earn rental income or capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes.\n\nInvestment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment properties. Costs of self-constructed investment properties include costs of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the investment properties to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs.\n\nGains and losses on disposal of investment properties (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amounts of the investment properties) are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (ii) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an investment property. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.\n\nNo depreciation is provided on freehold land (including 999-year leasehold land) included in the investment properties.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.4 Investment properties (cont'd)\n\n## (ii) Depreciation (cont'd)\n\nThe estimated useful lives for the current and comparative years are as follows:\n\nFreehold and leasehold properties\n\n- - 50 years, or lease term if shorter\n\nLeasehold land\n\n- - Lease term ranging from 50 to 96 years\n\nFurniture, fittings, plant and equipment and improvements - 3 to 20 years\n\nDepreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each reporting date.\n\n## 3.5 Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of property, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\n\nThe Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term, unless the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option. In that case, the right-of-use asset will be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset, which is determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nThe Group determines the lessee's incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources and makes certain adjustments to reflect the terms of the lease and type of the asset leased.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, where the basis for determining future lease payments changes as required by interest rate benchmark reform (see note 2.5), the Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the revised lease payments using the revised discount rate that reflects the change to an alternative benchmark interest rate.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the definition of investment property in 'property, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets and shortterm leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## COVID-19-related rent concessions\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient allowing it not to assess whether eligible rent concessions that are a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are lease modifications. The Group applies the practical expedient consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances. For rent concessions in leases to which the Group chooses not to apply the practical expedient, or that do not qualify for the practical expedient, the Group assesses whether there is a lease modification.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.5 Leases (cont'd)\n\n## As a lessor\n\nAt inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nTo classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\n\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies SFRS(I) 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n\nThe Group applies the derecognition and impairment requirements in SFRS(I) 9 to the net investment in the lease (see note 3.11(i)). The Group further regularly reviews estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.\n\nThe Group recognises lease payments received from investment property under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'revenue'.\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments\n\n## (i) Recognition and initial measurement\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nTrade receivables and debt investments issued are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, or minus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.\n\n## Financial assets at FVTPL\n\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI as described above are measured at FVTPL. On initial recognition, the Group may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI or at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n## (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont'd)\n\n## Financial assets: Business model assessment\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;\n- \u00b7 how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;\n- \u00b7 the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed;\n- \u00b7 how managers of the business are compensated e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected; and\n- \u00b7 the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.\n\nTransfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.\n\nFinancial assets that are held for trading or are managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest\n\nFor the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;\n- \u00b7 terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;\n- \u00b7 prepayment and extension features; and\n- \u00b7 terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses\n\n## Financial assets at FVTPL\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Debt investments at FVOCI\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Equity investments at FVOCI\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Non-derivative financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held for trading or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognised in profit or loss. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nOther financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method.  Interest  expense  and  foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n\n## (iii) Derecognition\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which either substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred, or the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nTransferred assets are not derecognised when the Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred assets.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or when they expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iv) Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (v) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and bank deposits. For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, restricted cash is excluded whilst bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.\n\nDerivatives are initially measured at fair value and any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships. At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

In determining whether a previously designated forecast transaction in a discontinued cash flow hedge is still expected to occur, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark cash flows designated as a hedge will not be altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe Group will cease to apply the specific policy for assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument (i) to a hedged item or hedging instrument when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the contractual cash flows of the respective item or instrument or (ii) when the hedging relationship is discontinued. For its highly probable assessment of the hedged item, the Group will no longer apply the specific policy when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform about the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based future cash flows of the hedged item is no longer present, or when the hedging relationship is discontinued.\n\nPhase 2 amendments: Replacement of benchmark interest rates - when there is no longer uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument changes as a result of interest rate benchmark reform and therefore there is no longer uncertainty arising about the cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument, the Group amends the hedge documentation of that hedging relationship to reflect the change(s) required by interest rate benchmark reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- \u00b7 the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nFor this purpose, the hedge designation is amended only to make one or more of the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 designating an alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk;\n- \u00b7 updating the description of hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged; or\n- \u00b7 updating the description of the hedging instrument.\n- 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n- 3.6 Financial instruments (cont'd)\n- (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (cont'd)\n\n## Hedges directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform (cont'd)\n\nPhase 2 amendments: Replacement of benchmark interest rates - when there is no longer uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform (cont'd)\n\nThe Group amends the description of the hedging instrument only if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 it makes a change required by interest rate benchmark reform by changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedging instrument or using another approach that is economically equivalent to changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the original hedging instrument; and\n- \u00b7 the original hedging instrument is not derecognised.\n\nThe Group amends the formal hedge documentation by the end of the reporting period during which a change required by interest rate benchmark reform is made to the hedged risk, hedged item or hedging instrument. These amendments in the formal hedge documentation do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedging relationship or the designation of a new hedging relationship.\n\nIf changes are made in addition to those changes required by interest rate benchmark reform described above, then the Group first considers whether those additional changes result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship. If the additional changes do not result in discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship, then the Group amends the formal hedge documentation for changes required by interest rate benchmark reform as mentioned above.\n\nWhen the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash flows had been based is changed as required by interest rate benchmark reform, for the purpose of determining whether the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur, the Group deems that the hedging reserve recognised in OCI for that hedging relationship is based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows will be based.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nThe amount accumulated in the hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\nIf the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging reserve remains in equity until it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss.\n\nIf the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative or foreign exchange gains and losses on the non-derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nThe Group's non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares are classified as equity, because they bear discretionary dividends, do not contain any obligations to deliver cash or other financial assets and do not require settlement in a variable number of the Group's equity instruments. Dividends thereon are recognised as distributions within equity.\n\n## 3.7 Development properties\n\nDevelopment properties are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes acquisition costs, development expenditure, capitalised borrowing costs (applicable to construction of a development for which revenue is to be recognised at a point in time) and other costs directly attributable to the development activities.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. The write-down to net realisable value is presented as allowance for foreseeable losses.\n\n## 3.8 Contract costs\n\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract for the sale of a development property are capitalised as contract costs only if (a) these costs relate directly to a contract or an anticipated contract which the Group can specifically identify; (b) these costs generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and (c) these costs are expected to be recovered. Otherwise, such costs are recognised as an expense immediately.\n\nCapitalised contract costs are subsequently amortised on a systematic basis as the Group recognises the related revenue on the contract. An impairment loss is recognised in the profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of capitalised contract costs exceeds the expected remaining consideration less any directly related costs not yet recognised as expenses.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.9 Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets primarily relate to the Group's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on construction of development properties. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Group invoices the customer.\n\nContract liabilities primarily relate to:\n\n- \u00b7 advance consideration received from customers; and\n- \u00b7 progress billings issued in excess of the Group's rights to the consideration.\n\n## 3.10  Consumable stocks\n\nConsumable stocks comprise principally food and beverage and other hotel related consumable supplies. Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined based on the weighted average cost method and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the stocks, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and cost necessary to make the sale.\n\n## 3.11  Impairment\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets and contract assets\n\nThe Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 debt investments measured at FVOCI;\n- \u00b7 contract assets (as defined in SFRS(I) 15); and\n- \u00b7 lease receivables.\n\nLoss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 12-month ECL: these are ECL that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or\n- \u00b7 Lifetime ECL: these are ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument or contract asset.\n\n## Simplified approach\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to provide for ECL for all trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets. The simplified approach requires the loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL at initial recognition.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.\n\nIf credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECL.\n\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\n## Measurement of ECLs\n\nECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\n## Credit-impaired financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt investments at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n\nEvidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default;\n- \u00b7 the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.11  Impairment (cont'd)\n\n## (i) Non-derivative financial assets and contract assets (cont'd)\n\n## Presentation of ECL in the statement of financial position\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost and contract assets are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.\n\n## Write-off\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## (ii) Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of an associate or joint venture is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with the requirements for non-financial assets. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and only to the extent that the recoverable amount increases.\n\n## (iii) Non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than development properties, contract costs, contract assets, consumable stocks and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets' recoverable amounts are estimated. For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date, and as and when indicators of impairment are identified. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe Group's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nGoodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate or a joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate or a joint venture may be impaired.\n\n## 3.12  Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are highly probable to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Thereafter, the assets, or disposal group, classified as held for sale are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.\n\nAny impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to financial assets and deferred tax assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the profit or loss. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and investment property once classified as held for sale are not depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once classified as held for sale or distribution.\n\n## 3.13  Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.13  Employee benefits (cont'd)\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised immediately as an expense in profit or loss.\n\nThe Group recognises remeasurement gains or losses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Group determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/(asset), taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability/(asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (iii) Other long-term service benefits\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than defined contribution and defined benefit plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (iv) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (v) Share-based payment transactions\n\nThe grant date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employees as measured at the date of modification.\n\nWhere an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.\n\n## 3.14  Provisions\n\nA provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.\n\n## Levies\n\nA provision for levies is recognised when the condition that triggers the payment of the levy as specified in the relevant legislation is met. If a levy obligation is subject to a minimum activity threshold so that the obligating event is reaching a minimum activity, then a provision is recognised when that minimum activity threshold is reached.\n\n## 3.15  Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantees are financial instruments issued by the Group that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for the loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to meet payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantees contracts are accounted for as insurance contracts. A provision is recognised based on the Group's estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the reporting date. The provision is assessed by reviewing individual claims and tested for adequacy by comparing the amount recognised and the amount that would be required to settle the guarantee contract.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.16  Revenue recognition\n\n## (i) Development properties for sale\n\nThe Group develops and sells residential and mixed development projects to customers through fixed-price contracts. Revenue is recognised when the control over a development property has been transferred to the customer. At contract inception, the Group assesses whether the Group transfers control of the residential project over time or at a point in time by determining if (a) its performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group; and (b) the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nWhere a development property has no alternative use for the Group due to contractual restriction, and the Group has enforceable rights to payment for performance completed to date arising from the contractual terms, revenue is recognised over time by reference to the Group's progress towards completing the construction of the development property. The measure of progress is determined based on the stage of completion of construction certified by quantity surveyors. Costs incurred that are not related to the contract or that do not contribute towards satisfying a performance obligation are excluded from the measure of progress and instead are expensed as incurred.\n\nIn respect of contracts where the Group does not have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, revenue is recognised only when the completed property is delivered to the customer and the customer has accepted it in accordance with the sales contract.\n\nUnder certain payment schemes, the time when payments are made by the buyer and the transfer of control of the property to the buyer do not coincide and where the difference between the timing of receipt of the payments and the satisfaction of a performance obligation is 12 months or more, the Group adjusts the transaction price with its customer and recognises a financing component. In adjusting for the financing component, the Group uses a discount rate that would reflect that of a separate financing transaction between the Group and its customer at contract inception. A finance income or finance expense will be recognised depending on the arrangement. The Group has elected to apply the practical expedient not to adjust the transaction price for the existence of significant financing component when the period between the transfer of control of goods or services to a customer and the payment date is 12 months or less.\n\nRevenue is measured at the transaction price agreed under the contract entered into with customers. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress towards completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.\n\nThe customer is invoiced based on a payment schedule which is typically triggered upon achievement of specified construction milestones. If the value of the goods transferred by the Group exceeds the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the value of the goods transferred, a contract liability is recognised. The accounting policy for contract assets and contract liabilities is set out in note 3.9.\n\n## (ii) Rental income\n\nRental income (net of any lease incentives) is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals, which include gross turnover rental, are recognised as income in the accounting period in which it is earned and the amount can be reliably measured.\n\n## (iii) Hotel income\n\nRevenue from hotel operations is recognised at the point when the accommodation and related services are rendered.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised, unless the conditions for receiving the grant are met after the related expenses have been recognised. In this case, the grant is recognised when it becomes receivable.\n\n## 3.18  Finance income and costs\n\nThe Group's finance income and costs include:\n\n- \u00b7 interest income on amounts owing by fellow subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, debt investment and funds invested;\n- \u00b7 interest expense on borrowings, financial derivatives and lease liabilities;\n- \u00b7 amortisation of transaction costs on borrowings capitalised;\n- \u00b7 the fair value gains or losses on financial derivatives;\n- \u00b7 the net gains or losses on financial assets at FVTPL;\n- \u00b7 the foreign currency gains or losses on financial assets and financial liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 unwinding of discount on non-current liabilities.\n\nInterest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\nThe 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:\n\n- \u00b7 the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or\n- \u00b7 the amortised cost of the financial liability.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.18  Finance income and costs (cont'd)\n\nIn calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.\n\nBorrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\n## 3.19  Tax\n\nTax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets .\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised for:\n\n- \u00b7 temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u00b7 taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nThe measurement of deferred taxes reflects the consequences that follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.\n\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, including interpretations of tax law and prior experience. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. New information may become available that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.\n\n## 3.20  Earnings per share\n\nThe Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the dilutive effect arising from the conversion of the non-redeemable convertible non-cumulative preference shares.\n\n## 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## 3.21  Segment reporting\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors and Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the Group's Board of Directors and Group CEO include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly tax assets and liabilities.\n\n## 3.22  New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nA number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2021 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the new standards and amendments to standards on its financial statements.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

Where indicators of impairment were identified, the recoverable amounts were estimated based on internal or external valuations undertaken by the Group. The cash generating units (CGU) are individual hotels.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the individual hotels, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value-in-use, were predominantly determined using the fair value less costs to sell approach and were estimated using the discounted cash flow and income capitalisation methods (2020: discounted cash flow method). Under these  methodologies,  the  fair  value  measurement  reflects  current  market  expectations  about  an  efficient third party operator's future cash flows. The discounted cash flows method involves estimating each hotel's future cash flows and discounting the cash flows with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value, taking into consideration the assumptions in respect of revenue growth (principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth) and major expense items for each hotel. The future cash flows are based on assumptions about competitive growth rates for hotels in that area, as well as the internal business plan for the hotel in the relevant market. These plans and forecasts include management's most recent view of trading prospects for the hotel in the relevant market. The income capitalisation method capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates.\n\nWhere appropriate, the Group sought guidance on the fair values of the hotels from independent external valuers with appropriate professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the properties being valued. In relying on the valuation reports, the Group has exercised its judgement and is satisfied that the valuation method and estimates are reflective of current market conditions. The valuation reports obtained from the external valuers of certain hotels have highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement. Consequently, less certainty and a higher degree of caution should be attached to these valuations than would normally be the case. Values may change more rapidly and significantly than during standard market conditions. Due to the uncertainties that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuers have also recommended to keep the valuation of these properties under frequent review.\n\nIn 2021, the Group recognised a net reversal of impairment loss of $95,375,000 on its hotel properties, comprising reversal of impairment losses of $96,317,000 on five hotels in United States of America (US), two hotels in Europe, and four hotels in Asia, net of impairment losses made of $942,000 in respect of a club and a restaurant in Asia. The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances of certain hotel properties, following the progressive recovery of the hospitality sector in the countries in which these hotels are located. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the properties on which impairment losses were reversed or impaired during the year were $743,871,000 as at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn 2020, the Group recognised a net impairment loss of $87,517,000 on its hotel properties, comprising impairment losses of $111,330,000 on eight hotels in United States of America (US), four hotels in Europe, and two hotels in Asia, net of impairment losses reversed of $23,813,000 in respect of two hotels in US, five hotels in Europe, and a hotel in Asia. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the properties on which impairment losses were recognised during the year were $1,041,634,000 as at 31 December 2020. The impairment losses were a result of the challenging operating performance of these hotels and the subdued outlook for these hotels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances of certain hotel properties since the last external valuations performed. The estimated total recoverable amounts of the hotel properties on which impairment losses were reversed during the year were $365,413,000 as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation technique used.\n\nImpairment losses recognised or reversed were included in 'other operating expenses' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and the hotel operations segment.",

An increase in occupancy rate and/or average room rate growth in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in discount rate, terminal rate or capitalisation rate in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## 5.

INVESTMENT PROPERTIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n- (a) Investment properties comprise commercial, residential, hotel and industrial properties that are leased to external customers. Generally, each of the leases is fixed for a period of 1 to 29 years (2020: 1 to 29 years), and subsequent renewals are negotiated at prevailing market rates and terms.\n- (b) During the year, the Group transferred two hotel properties located in Australia held by CDHLT to property, plant and equipment, when CDHLT became both the owner and operator of the properties. In addition, the Group transferred an industrial warehouse to non-current assets held for sale (note 6). In 2020, the Group's transfers from development properties to investment properties related to two office buildings in Shanghai which were completed and commenced leasing activities during the year.\n- (c) As at 31 December 2021, investment properties of the Group with a total carrying amount of $1,861,453,000 (2020: $1,464,268,000) were mortgaged to certain financial institutions to secure credit facilities (refer to notes 22 and 23 for more details of the facilities).\n- (d) The  Group  undertook  its  annual  review  of  the  carrying  amounts  of  investment  properties  for  indicators  of impairment. Where indicators of impairment were identified, the recoverable amounts were estimated based on internal or external valuations undertaken. The cash generating units (CGU) are individual properties.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the investment properties, being the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and valuein-use, were predominantly determined using the fair value less costs to sell approach, and were estimated using the discounted cash flow and income capitalisation methods (2020: discounted cash flow method).\n\nBased on the impairment assessment undertaken in 2021, the Group reversed an impairment loss of $3,416,000 on one hotel in Maldives and one hotel in Italy, both of which are held by CDLHT. The impairment losses reversed during the year mainly arose from the improved trading performances, following the progressive recovery of the hospitality sector in the countries in which these hotels are located. In 2020, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $12,035,000 on one hotel in the Maldives and one hotel in Italy, both of which are held by CDLHT. The impairment loss was a result of the challenging operating performance of these hotels and the subdued outlook for these hotels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impairment loss reversed or recognised was recognised in 'other operating expenses' and the investment properties segment.\n\nThe key assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amounts are set out below:\n\n|                          | Maldives       | Italy          |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Occupancy rate           |                |                |\n| 2021                     | 54.4% to 67.2% | 75.0% to 81.0% |\n| 2020                     | 28.0% to 67.0% | 50.0% to 82.0% |\n| Average room rate growth |                |                |\n| 2021                     | 1.8%           | 2.7%           |\n| 2020                     | 3.7%           | 2.3%           |\n| Discount rate            |                |                |\n| 2021                     | 11.8%          | 5.3% to 6.3%   |\n| 2020                     | 12.0%          | 6.8%           |\n| Terminal rates           |                |                |\n| 2021                     | 8.8%           | 4.0% to 5.0%   |\n| 2020                     | 9.0%           | 4.9%           |\n| Capitalisation rate      |                |                |\n| 2021                     | 8.5%           | N/A            |\n| 2020                     | N/A            | N/A            |\n\n## 5. INVESTMENT PROPERTIES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\nThe forecasts cover a five to ten years period, and cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate ranging between 1.2% and 2.0% (2020: 1.8% and 3.0%), which is based upon the expected trading growth for each hotel and inflation in the country in which the hotel is located.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group's impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used. An increase in occupancy rate and/or average room rate growth in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in discount rate, terminal rate or capitalisation rate in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## (e) Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair values for a majority of the Group's investment properties are determined by independent external valuers who have appropriate recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. The fair values of certain investment properties located in Singapore are based on in-house valuations conducted by a licensed valuer who is also an officer of the Company. The internal valuer has appropriate recognised professional qualifications and experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued.\n\nThe fair values of the investment properties were estimated using the discounted cash flow, income capitalisation, direct comparison, standardised land value adjustment and residual methods. The discounted cash flow method involves the estimation and projection of an income stream over a period and discounting the income stream with an internal rate of return to arrive at the market value. The income capitalisation method capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenue multipliers or single-year capitalisation rates. The direct comparison method involves an analysis of comparable sales of similar properties and adjusting the transacted prices to those reflective of the investment properties of the Group. The standardised land value adjustment method considers the price of standard land in the current situation of development and utilisation, under normal market conditions within legal maximum use term as at a special date, that is assessed and approved by the local government. The residual method involves deducting the estimated cost to complete as of valuation date and other relevant costs from gross development value of the proposed development assuming satisfactory completion and accounting for developer's profit.\n\nIn relying on the valuation reports, the Group has exercised its judgement and is satisfied that the valuation methods and estimates are reflective of current market conditions. The valuation reports obtained from the external valuers of certain investment properties have highlighted that the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement. Consequently, less certainty and a higher degree of caution should be attached to these valuations than would normally be the case. Values may change more rapidly and significantly than during standard market conditions. Due to the uncertainties that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuers have also recommended to keep the valuation of these properties under frequent review.\n\nThe fair value disclosure for the investment properties for the Group and the Company of $9,945,537,000 (2020: $8,901,489,000) and $1,662,892,000 (2020: $1,114,435,000) respectively has been categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.",

Based on the assessment, the Company recognised an impairment loss of $17,270,000 (2020: $1,727,000) on its investments in three wholly-owned subsidiaries, following a decline in their financial position. The recoverable amounts of the subsidiaries were estimated taking into consideration the fair values of the underlying assets and the liabilities of the companies. The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nThe non-trade amounts owing by and to subsidiaries are unsecured. In respect of interest-bearing amounts owing by and to subsidiaries, interest was charged at rates ranging from 0.39% to 4.18% (2020: 0.32% to 3.95%) per annum and at rates ranging from 1.00% to 3.00% (2020: 2.74% to 3.00%) per annum respectively.\n\nThe non-trade balances with subsidiaries that are presented as receivable or repayable within one year are receivable or repayable on demand. The non-trade amounts owing by subsidiaries receivable after one year are loans to subsidiaries for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. These amounts are, in substance, a part of the Company's net investments in subsidiaries.\n\nInformation about the Company's exposure to credit risk on the amounts owing by subsidiaries is included in note 41.",

As at the reporting date, the aggregate carrying amount of these investments were $764.5 million (2020: $690.7 million) and the fair values based on the published price quotation (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was $612.7 million (2020: $554.9 million). In respect of one associate whose carrying and fair values were $632.0 million (2020: $575.0 million) and $456.7 million (2020: $427.4 million) respectively, management had assessed the recoverable amount of the investment and determined that as its net asset value based on the latest available audited financial statements of the associate is higher than the carrying amount as at the reporting date, no impairment loss for this investment is considered necessary.\n\nDuring the year, the Group assessed the carrying amount of its investments in associates for indicators of impairment. Based on the assessment, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $12,125,000 (2020: $Nil) on its investments in certain associates as a result of their weak financial performance. The recoverable amount was estimated taking into account the fair values of the underlying assets and the liabilities of the associates. The fair value measurement was categorised as a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as it is derived from unobservable inputs.\n\nThe movements in impairment losses in respect of investments in associates are as follows:\n\n|                            | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                            | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| At 1 January               | 3,000      | 3,000      | -          | -          |\n| Impairment loss recognised | 12,125     | -          | -          | -          |\n| Translation difference     | 274        | -          | -          | -          |\n| At 31 December             | 15,399     | 3,000      | -          | -          |\n\nImpairment loss recognised was included in 'Share of after-tax profit of associates' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n## Immaterial associates\n\nThe Group has interests in a number of individually immaterial associates. The following table summarises, in aggregate, the Group's share of profit and other comprehensive income of these immaterial associates that are accounted for using the equity method:\n\n|                                                                    | Group      | Group      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                    | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Carrying amount of interests in individually immaterial associates | 816,979    | 707,699    |\n| Group's share of:                                                  |            |            |\n| - profit from continuing operations                                | 30,713     | 37,976     |\n| - other comprehensive income                                       | 25,570     | 13,192     |\n| - total comprehensive income                                       | 56,283     | 51,168     |\n\n## Financial guarantee\n\nA wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group had entered into a deed of guarantee in favour of Sunbright Holdings Limited (Sunbright), an associate of the Group, in relation to the residential properties owned by Sunbright. The maximum exposure of the Group under the deed of guarantee at the reporting date is approximately $20.2 million (2020: $24.2 million).\n\nManagement do not consider it probable that a claim will be made against the Group under the financial guarantee.",

In 2020, the Group's material joint venture related to HCP. As at 31 December 2020, the Group's investment in HCP was fully impaired. HCP was disposed of during 2021 for an aggregate consideration of US$1.\n\nHCP was an unlisted joint venture in which the Group had joint control via an investor rights agreement and a 63.75% ownership interest. HCP, which is incorporated in Cayman Islands, is an investment holding company that holds an indirect 80.01% equity interest in Chongqing Sincere Yuanchuang Industrial Co., Ltd ('Sincere Property') and its subsidiaries ('Sincere Property Group'), a real estate developer in the People's Republic of China (PRC). As at 31 December 2020, approximately 13.1% and 48.9% of the shares held by HCP Group in Sincere Property Group were pledged to the Group and other parties, respectively. This investment offered the Group the opportunity to partner with Sincere Property Group and to acquire a meaningful stake in platform which would allow a sizeable expansion of the Group's footprint in the PRC.",

As at 31 December 2020, the fair value of this call option was nil. As part of the Group's disposal of its interest in HCP during 2021, the deed for the aforesaid call option was terminated.\n\nHCP was structured as a separate vehicle and the Group had residual interest in its net assets. In 2020, the Group had classified its interest in HCP as a joint venture, which was equity accounted. Following the Group's disposal of its investment in HCP during 2021, the Group lost joint control over HCP and it ceased to be a joint venture of the Group.\n\n## Investment in and balances with HCP Group\n\n## (i) Accounting for acquisition of HCP Group\n\nIn April 2020, the Group acquired an equity interest of 63.75% in HCP for an aggregate consideration of approximately $0.9 billion. The Group accounted for the acquisition of HCP as a business combination, which required the purchase price to be allocated to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent liabilities (purchase price allocation or 'PPA').\n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities, which involved significant judgement and estimates, had been determined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The  fair  values  of  the  underlying  properties  held  by  HCP  Group  were  determined  based  on  external independent valuations undertaken.\n- A significant portion of the purchase price was allocated to HCP Group's underlying property portfolio comprising development properties, property, plant and equipment and investment properties, based on the valuation amounts in the independent valuation reports. The valuation of development properties was critically dependent upon the estimated future selling prices. The valuation of property, plant and equipment and investment properties involved significant judgement in determining both the valuation methods to be used and the key assumptions to be applied. The valuations were sensitive to the key assumptions applied and a change in assumptions might have a significant impact on the valuations.\n- \u00b7 The  fair  values  of  the  amounts  due  from  related  parties  of  HCP  Group  were  estimated,  taking  into consideration the repayment patterns and the settlement arrangements agreed between the HCP Group and its related parties.\n- \u00b7 The fair values of contingent liabilities relating to financial guarantees issued by HCP Group for credit facilities granted to the related parties of HCP Group involved making estimates of the guarantees being invoked.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of a put option granted by HCP Group to a non-controlling shareholder of Sincere Property Group (the 'Put Option') for the latter to sell its 19.99% of shares in Sincere Property Group was estimated based on the present value of the exercise price of the put option.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of indemnities provided by the joint venture partner and its related parties in relation to the liabilities associated with the Put Option and contingent liabilities arising from the guarantees issued by Sincere Property Group to the joint venture partner and its related parties, was estimated to be nil, having considered the Group's ability to recover these indemnity assets.\n\n## 9 INVESTMENTS IN AND BALANCES WITH JOINT VENTURES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## (i) Accounting for acquisition of HCP Group (cont'd)\n\n## Measurement of fair values\n\nThe valuation techniques used for measuring the fair values of the underlying significant assets and liabilities were as follows:\n\n| Assets acquired and liabilities assumed                 | Valuation technique                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment and investment properties | Direct comparison, discounted cash flow, income capitalisation, cost  and residual methods:  The direct comparison method involved the  analysis of comparable sales of similar assets and adjusting the  sale  prices  to  that  reflective  of  the  properties.

The residual method involved deducting the estimated  cost to complete as of valuation date and other relevant costs from  gross development value of the proposed development assuming  satisfactory completion and accounting for developer profit.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Amounts due from related parties                        | Discounted cash flow method:  The fair value was estimated as the  present value of the expected future payments, discounted at the  market rate of interest at the acquisition date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Interest-bearing borrowings                             | Discounted cash flow method:  The fair value was estimated as the  present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted  at the market rates of interest at the acquisition date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Contingent liabilities - financial guarantees issued    | Probability  adjusted  expected  value  method:   The  fair  value  was  estimated based on the exposure amount that the HCP Group is  obliged to pay in the event of a default by the entity for the financial  guarantee was issued, adjusted for the probability of default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Put Option                                              | Discounted cash flow method:  The fair value was estimated as the  present value of the expected future payments, discounted at the  market rate of interest at the acquisition date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

The valuation reports obtained from external valuer of the properties had highlighted that as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving rise to an unprecedented set of circumstances on which to base a judgement, less certainty and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to the valuations than would normally be the case. Due to the uncertainties that the pandemic may have on the real estate market, the external valuer had recommended to keep the valuations of these properties under frequent review.\n\nThe fair value measurements were categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used.\n\nThe PPA exercise indicated that the Group's cost of investment in HCP of $0.9 billion represented goodwill. Impairment of the Group's investment in HCP in 2020 is set out in note (ii) below.\n\n## (ii) Impairment of the equity investment in HCP Group\n\n## 2021\n\nThe impairment loss previously recognised was fully utilised in 2021, following the Group's disposal of its interest in HCP.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, subsequent to the Group's acquisition of the equity investment in HCP Group, the Group identified indicators of impairment on the investment arising from the challenging macro-economic environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the credit tightening measures imposed on China's real estate sector and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group. The Group assessed the recoverable amount of the investment using the fair value less costs to sell approach which was based on the financial position of the HCP Group, which took into consideration the fair values of the joint venture's underlying assets and liabilities. Based on the assessment undertaken, the recoverable amount was estimated to be nil. After equity accounting for the Group's share of HCP Group's share of loss of $75.8 million, an impairment loss of $806.4 million was recognised. The impairment loss was included as part of 'Share of after-tax profit/(loss) of joint ventures' in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, and in the property development ($435.4 million), hotel operations ($48.4 million) and investment properties ($322.6 million) segments.\n\nAs the Group's cost of investment in HCP Cayman had been reduced to nil, the Group had discontinued equity accounting for further losses of HCP Group as the Group had no obligation to fund HCP Group's operations or make payments on behalf of HCP Group (other than the financial guarantee that the Group had issued in relation to a loan undertaken by HCP Group for which a provision had been made for the full guarantee amount (refer to 'Financial guarantee issued' below)).\n\n## 9 INVESTMENTS IN AND BALANCES WITH JOINT VENTURES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## (ii) Impairment of the equity investment in HCP Group (cont'd)\n\nThe fair value measurement was categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs in the valuation technique used.\n\n| Valuation technique                                                                                                                                               | Significant  unobservable  inputs   | Inter-relationship between key  unobservable  inputs  and  fair  value measurement     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The fair value is calculated using the net asset value (NAV) of  the investee entity adjusted for the fair value of the underlying  properties, where applicable. | NAV                                 | The estimated fair value would  increase/(decrease)  if  the  NAV  was higher/(lower). |\n\n## (iii) Impairment of amounts owing by HCP Group\n\n## 2021\n\nDuring 2021, as part of the Group's disposal of its interest in HCP, the Group had entered into various agreements with the HCP Group whereby it was agreed that (i) an amount owing by the Group to HCP Group of $263.7 million would be set off against the amounts owing by HCP Group; and (ii) the collateral held by the Group in respect of the amounts owing by HCP Group, which relate to shares in an investment holding company that holds an equity interest in a property-owning entity which had been pledged by HCP Group to the Group, in respect of the amounts owing by HCP Group, would be transferred to the Group, as settlement of $54.1 million (RMB260.0 million) of the amounts owing by HCP Group. The above arrangements resulted in a utilisation of $8.2 million (RMB39.2 million) impairment loss previously recognised in the current year (note 9(d)).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, after the offset arrangements, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $395.1 million (classified under other receivables in note 15) and amounts owing to HCP Group of $50.3 miliion (note 30).\n\nIn  October  2021,  the  Chongqing  No.  5  Intermediate  People's  Court  accepted  the  bankruptcy  reorganisation application by a creditor against Sincere Property and a bankruptcy administrator was subsequently appointed. In addition, a local credit rating agency downgraded Sincere Property's credit rating and its existing domestic corporate bonds as Sincere Property was unable to redeem its corporate bonds that matured in 2021.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group assessed that the amounts owing by HCP Group continue to be credit-impaired. The Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into account the latest developments of Sincere Property Group based on publicly available information as described above, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group, following regulatory tightening and systematic changes on financing imposed on China's real estate sector.\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a loss given default ('LGD') of up to 95% which was estimated based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group estimated that no additional impairment is required on the amounts owing by HCP Group, other than an impairment loss of $6.1 million on the interest income recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group during the year. At 31 December 2021, the carrying value of the amount owing by HCP Group was $63.9 million (net of impairment loss of $331.2 million), which is classified as other receivables (note 15).",

Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL on the amounts owing by HCP Group recognised. The ECL on the amounts owing by HCP Group is also sensitive to the assumptions used. A decrease in the LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in the LGD in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## 2020\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $683.6 million and amounts owing to HCP Group of $264.3 million. The Group undertook an impairment assessment of the amounts owing from HCP Group. The Group assessed that the amounts owing by HCP Group were credit-impaired, having considered past repayment trends, the debt maturity profile of Sincere Property Group, the default risk on the amounts owing by Sincere Property Group and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group determined the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into account the adjusted financial position of Sincere Property Group (taking into account the estimated recoverable amounts of the properties held by Sincere Property Group and its associates and joint ventures, and potential additional costs to be incurred on borrowings of Sincere Property Group), the debt profile of Sincere Property Group, the value of collateral that the Group held and certain amounts owing by the Group to HCP Group.\n\nThe key parameters applied in estimating the ECL recognised included assuming a discount of up to 50% on the properties held by Sincere Property Group and the carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures and  additional  costs  including  potential  penalty  interest  of  approximately  30%  on  borrowings.  The  discount assumptions used to estimate the difference between the fair value of the underlying properties and the expected sales price under a forced sale scenario are based on market data available. The Group also considered the value of the collateral held, which related to shares in a property-owing entity which had been pledged by HCP Group to the Group, based on the recently transacted price of the shares.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $323.9 million on the amounts owing by HCP Group. At 31 December 2020, the Group had amounts owing by HCP Group of $$359.7 million (net of impairment loss recognised) and amounts owing to HCP Group of $264.3 million.\n\nChanges to circumstances and estimates may impact the amount of expected credit losses recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group. The expected credit losses on the amounts owing by HCP Group can be sensitive to the assumptions used. An increase in the discount adjustment on the properties held by the Group and the carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures and additional costs including potential penalty interest on borrowings in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount. A lower discount adjustment on the properties held by HCP Group and the carrying values of investments in associate and joint ventures and lower additional costs including potential penalty interest on borrowings in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount.\n\n## 9 INVESTMENTS IN AND BALANCES WITH JOINT VENTURES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## (iv) Financial information of HCP Group\n\n|                                                                      | Group 2020 $'000   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Group's interest in net assets of investee at beginning of the year: | -                  |\n| Investment during the year                                           | 882,141            |\n| Share of after-tax loss                                              |                    |\n| - share of total comprehensive income                                | (75,770)           |\n| - impairment of goodwill                                             | (806,371)          |\n|                                                                      | (882,141)          |\n| Carrying amount of interest in investee at end of the year           | -                  |\n\n## 2021\n\nAs the Group's investment in HCP was fully impaired as at 31 December 2020, the Group had discontinued equity accounting for the results of HCP Group in 2020. The investment in HCP was disposed of in September 2021.\n\n## 2020\n\nIn 2020, the challenging macro-economic environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the credit tightening measures imposed on China's real estate sector and the ongoing uncertainties had disrupted and negatively impacted HCP Group's operations and performance. Furthermore, weak market conditions had derailed the intended divestment plan for some of HCP Group's properties to reduce its debt, exacerbating the liquidity challenges that it faces. Subsequent to 31 December 2020, the credit ratings of certain of HCP Group's bonds were downgraded and the HCP Group did not repay the principal amounts of certain bonds on their maturities. Arising from these key events and the evolving developments within the HCP Group up to the date of the Group's issuance of the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2020, management considered that the financial information of HCP Group as at 31 December 2020, prepared based on information then available, did not faithfully represent HCP Group's financial position and would not be relevant to users of these financial statements.\n\nThe main business activities of HCP Group relate to the real estate business derived primarily from Sincere Property Group, which is an issuer of several domestic corporate bonds listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. As long as the listed bonds of Sincere Property Group remained outstanding, Sincere Property Group was required to abide by the regulations of China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Under the regulations of CSRC, any material information in relation to Sincere Property Group needs to be announced by Sincere Property Group in China no later than the announcement of the same elsewhere in the world, failing which Sincere Property Group and its controlling equity holder(s) could be liable under PRC laws. Sincere Property Group, which was required to announce its annual financial statements within 4 months from each financial year end was expected to announce its financial results for year ended 31 December 2020 in late April 2021. Accordingly, before Sincere Property Group announced its 2020 financial information in China, the Group was unable to disclose any financial information of HCP Group in its financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.\n\nAs a result of the above and the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the matters highlighted, the summarised financial information of HCP Group as at 31 December 2020 and the Group's unrecognised share of losses, commitments and contingent liabilities in relation to the HCP Group were not presented in the Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020.",

Furthermore, the Group had pledged an investment property with a carrying value of $359.8 million under a second mortgage to the bank.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group had considered that the probability that the financial guarantee would be invoked and recognised a provision for the full amount of the guarantee (note 28), taking into consideration the available financial information of HCP Group, Sincere Property Group not repaying the principal amounts of certain bonds on their maturities post 31 December 2020, the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group and legal advice received.\n\n## Immaterial joint ventures\n\nThe Group has interests in a number of individually immaterial joint ventures.

Ltd. (Summervale) for Nouvel 18, a 156-unit luxury freehold residential development on Anderson Road, Singapore. In October 2016, the Group established its third Profit Participation Securities (PPS) by entering into an investment agreement, and an asset management and marketing agreement with an unrelated party, Green 18 Pte. Ltd. (Green 18), to exit its entire interest in Summervale. As part of the investment agreement, the Group subscribed for a note of $140 million issued by Summervale. According to the asset management and marketing agreement, Summervale appointed Trentwell Management Pte. Ltd. (Trentwell), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, as the asset manager and marketing agent of Summervale to manage and lease out Nouvel 18, as well as to market and divest units in Nouvel 18 for a period of five years (with an option to extend to seven years). The option for extension of the duration of the asset management and marketing agreement for a further 2-year period has been exercised with effect from 20 October 2021.\n- (ii) $32,923,000 (2020: $34,390,000) relating to the Group's investment in property-linked notes issued for the development of a luxury retirement village in New South Wales, Australia.\n- (iii) $10,724,000 as at 31 December 2020 relating to a convertible loan granted to a joint venture. The convertible loan was repaid during 2021.\n- (c) Unquoted debt investment at amortised cost with gross carrying amount of $311,512,000 (US$230 million) (2020: $305,394,000 (US$230 million)) relates to the Group's investment in a US$ bond issued by Sincere Property Group. The bond bore interest at 10% (2020: 10%) per annum up till the effective date of commencement of Sincere Property's bankruptcy reorganisation on 14 October 2021. The bond which has a maturity date of 27 June 2022, may be redeemed by the holder on or before 27 June 2021. During 2021, the Group exercised its put option and issued a put notice to the issuer for full repayment. As at 31 December 2021, the bond remained unpaid. An impairment loss of $288,000,000 was recognised on the bond during 2020. There is no additional impairment recognised on the bond during the year. The Group has no collateral in respect of this investment.\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment for debt investments at amortised cost during the year was as follows:\n\n|                            | Lifetime ECL credit-impaired 2021 $'000   | Lifetime ECL credit-impaired 2020 $'000   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Balance as at 1 January    | 288,000                                   | -                                         |\n| Impairment loss recognised | -                                         | 288,000                                   |\n| Translation differences    | 5,769                                     | -                                         |\n| Balance as at 31 December  | 293,769                                   | 288,000                                   |\n\nThe impairment loss recognised in 2020 was included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.\n\n## 10 FINANCIAL ASSETS /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\nThe Group undertook an impairment assessment of the investment in the bond.\n\n## 2021\n\nHaving considered that Sincere Property has entered into bankruptcy reorganisation and its credit rating and domestic corporate bonds were downgraded by a local credit rating agency during 2021 (see note 9), the Group assessed that the investment in the bond continued to be credit-impaired.\n\n- At 31 December 2021, the Group assessed the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into account the latest developments of Sincere Property Group based on publicly available information as described in note 9, prevailing market conditions and price trends of corporate bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and face similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group, following regulatory tightening and systematic changes on financing imposed on China's real estate sector.\n\nThe key parameter applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised include assuming a LGD of approximately 90% which was based on the range of decline in trading prices of bonds issued by other China real estate developers with credit ratings similar to that of Sincere Property Group and faced similar debt and liquidity challenges as those faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group assessed that no additional impairment is required on the investment in the bond. At 31 December 2021, the carrying value of the bond was $17.7 million (net of impairment loss).\n\nAs the bankruptcy reorganisation for Sincere Property Group is ongoing, its outcome is uncertain and evolving. Changes to circumstances and estimates may impact the ECL recognised on the investment in the bond. The ECL on the investment in the bond is also sensitive to the assumptions used. A decrease in LGD in isolation would result in a higher recoverable amount. An increase in LGD in isolation would result in a lower recoverable amount.\n\n## 2020\n\nThe Group assessed that the investment in the bond was credit-impaired, having considered past repayment trends, the debt maturity profile of Sincere Property Group, the default risk on the amounts owing by Sincere Property Group and the liquidity challenges faced by Sincere Property Group.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group determined the lifetime ECL to be recognised, taking into account the adjusted financial  position  of  Sincere  Property  Group  (taking  into  account  the  estimated  recoverable  amounts  of  the properties held by Sincere Property Group and its associates and joint ventures, and potential additional costs to be incurred on borrowings of Sincere Property Group) and the debt profile of the Sincere Property Group.\n\nThe key parameters applied in estimating the ECL to be recognised included assuming a discount of up to 50% on the properties held by Sincere Property Group and the carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures and additional costs including potential penalty interest of approximately 30% on borrowings. The discount assumptions used to estimate the difference between the fair value of the underlying properties and the expected sales price under a forced sale scenario were based on the market data available.\n\nBased on the assessment undertaken, the Group recognised an impairment loss of $288 million on the investment in the bond. At 31 December 2020, the carrying value of the bond was $17.4 million (net of impairment loss).",

To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares or other financial instruments.\n\nThe Group monitors capital using a net debt equity ratio, which is defined as net borrowings divided by total capital employed.\n\n|                                                            | Note   | 2021 $'000   | 2020 $'000   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|--------------|\n| Gross borrowings                                           |        | 11,422,435   | 11,825,845   |\n| Cash and bank balances (including restricted cash and cash |        |              |              |\n| and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale)     | 17     | (2,190,961)  | (3,237,149)  |\n| Net debt                                                   |        | 9,231,474    | 8,588,696    |\n| Total capital employed                                     |        | 9,332,029    | 9,242,457    |\n| Net debt equity ratio                                      |        | 0.99         | 0.93         |\n\nNo changes were made to the above objectives, policies and processes during the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe Group derives income from its investments in the PRC. The conversion of the Chinese Renminbi is subject to the rules and regulations of foreign exchange control promulgated by the PRC government.\n\nThe Group has a subsidiary, CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (H-REIT), which is part of CDL Hospitality Trusts (CDLHT), a stapled group comprising H-REIT and CDL Hospitality Business Trust (HBT), a business trust. H-REIT is subject to the aggregate leverage limit as defined in the Property Funds Appendix of the Code on Collective Investment Schemes (CIS Code) issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The CIS Code stipulates that the total borrowings and deferred payments (together the Aggregate Leverage) of a property fund should not exceed 50.0% (2020: 50.0%) of its Deposited Property under a single-tier leverage limit provided.\n\nFor this financial year, H-REIT has a credit rating of BB+ (2020: BB+) from Fitch Ratings. The Aggregate Leverage of H-REIT as at 31 December 2021 was 39.1% (2020: 36.2%) of H-REIT's Deposited Property. This complied with the aggregate leverage limit as described above.\n\nThe Group has a subsidiary, CDL Real Estate Asset Managers Pte. Ltd. (CREAM), which is subject to maintain at least $250,000 of base capital at all times pursuant to the Securities and Futures (Financial and Margin Requirements for Holders of Capital Markets Services Licenses) Regulations (Rg13) of the Securities and Futures Act (Cap. 289). The Monetary Authority of Singapore defines base capital as the sum of all paid-up capital, reserve funds, any unappropriated profit or loss in the latest audited accounts, and less any interim loss in the latest accounts of the company. CREAM has complied with the capital requirements during the current and prior year.\n\nExcept for the above, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.\n\n## 19 RESERVES\n\n|                                      | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                      | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Capital reserve                      | 290,920    | 284,030    | 63,743     | 63,743     |\n| Fair value reserve                   | 997        | (2,421)    | (30,358)   | (33,150)   |\n| Hedging reserve                      | (1,532)    | (6,642)    | -          | (448)      |\n| Other reserves                       | 23,952     | 23,927     | -          | -          |\n| Share option reserve                 | 15,423     | 15,318     | -          | -          |\n| Foreign currency translation reserve | (140,411)  | (79,696)   | -          | -          |\n| Accumulated profits                  | 6,232,814  | 6,276,295  | 4,307,624  | 4,427,888  |\n|                                      | 6,422,163  | 6,510,811  | 4,341,009  | 4,458,033  |\n\nThe capital reserve comprises mainly:\n\n- (a) negative goodwill on the consolidation of subsidiaries which arose prior to 1 January 2017 under the previous accounting standards adopted;\n- (b) issue expenses; and\n- (c) reserves arising from the Group's acquisition of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries.\n\nThe fair value reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of equity instruments designated at FVOCI.\n\nThe hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net changes in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred (net of tax).\n\nOther reserves comprise mainly reserves set aside by certain subsidiaries in compliance with the relevant regulations in the People's Republic of China and share of other reserves of associates and joint ventures.\n\nThe share option reserve comprises the cumulative value of employee services received for the issue of share options of a subsidiary and a joint venture.\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve comprises mainly:\n\n- (a) foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currencies are different from the presentation currency of the Company;\n- (b) the gain or loss on financial instruments used to hedge the Group's net investment in foreign operations that are determined to be effective hedges; and\n- (c) exchange differences on monetary items which form part of the Group's net investment in foreign operations, provided certain conditions are met.",

The most significant funds are described below:\n\n## 25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\nUnited Kingdom (UK)\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a pension scheme for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993. The plan operates a funded defined benefit arrangement together with a defined contribution plan, both with different categories of membership. The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time, rights to a guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) under the defined contribution scheme also ceased. The plan entitles a retired employee to receive an annual pension payment.\n\nThe contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2020 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2021. The contributions of the Group during the year were about 11% (2020: 11%) of pensionable salary.\n\nAs the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.\n\n## South Korea\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in South Korea. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2021. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries.\n\n## Taiwan\n\nThe Group makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan. The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2021. The contributions of the Group were no less than 6% (2020: 6%) of the employees' earnings. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and the rate of increase in salaries.\n\nThe defined benefit plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separated from the Group. The boards of the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants.\n\nThese defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market investment risk.\n\nThe above plans are substantially funded by the Group's subsidiaries. The funding requirements are based on pension funds' actuarial measurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plans.",

The present values of the schemes' liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following table summarises how the impact on the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period would have increased/(decreased) as a result of a change in one of the relevant actuarial assumptions by one percent, holding other assumptions consistent.\n\n| Defined benefit obligation   | Defined benefit obligation   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| 1 percent                    | 1 percent                    |\n| increase                     | decrease                     |\n| $'000                        | $'000                        |\n\n## Group\n\n2021\n\n| Rate of salary increase   | 1,389    | (1,272)   |\n|---------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| 2020                      |          |           |\n| Discount rate             | (23,130) | 28,312    |\n| Rate of salary increase   | 1,806    | (1,664)   |\n\nDiscount rate\n\n(21,686)\n\n27,650\n\n## 26 LEASE LIABILITIES\n\n|                   | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                   | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Lease liabilities | 265,327    | 252,041    | 15,922     | 20,002     |\n| Non-current       | 246,003    | 237,854    | 9,600      | 14,152     |\n| Current           | 19,324     | 14,187     | 6,322      | 5,850      |\n|                   | 265,327    | 252,041    | 15,922     | 20,002     |\n\nThe incremental borrowing rates of the Group's and the Company's lease liabilities ranges from 0.90 % to 14.55% (2020: 0.90% to 14.55%) per annum during the year.\n\nInformation about the Group's and the Company's exposure to foreign currency and liquidity risk is included in note 41.\n\n## 27 OTHER LIABILITIES\n\n|                                                             |      | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                             | Note | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Deferred income                                             |      | 122,124    | 122,713    | -          | -          |\n| Rental deposits                                             |      | 49,653     | 59,381     | 8,041      | 7,445      |\n| Non-current retention sums payable                          |      | 26,625     | 29,032     | -          | -          |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                            | 41   | 1,295      | 14,552     | 346        | 845        |\n| Miscellaneous (principally deposits  received and payables) |      | 18,213     | 17,921     | -          | -          |\n|                                                             |      | 217,910    | 243,599    | 8,387      | 8,290      |\n\nDeferred income includes the following:\n\n- (i) $7,030,000 (2020: $7,030,000) relating to the deferred gain on the sale of cash flows as disclosed in footnote (a) of note 44;\n- (ii) $6,635,000 (2020: $6,635,000) relating to the deferred gain arising from the Group's exit of its entire interest in Summervale, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group in October 2016.

For certain leases, the Group is restricted from entering into any sub-lease arrangements.\n\nThe leases for hotel properties were entered into many years ago as combined leases of land and buildings.\n\nThe Group also leases IT equipment and motor vehicles under a number of leases.\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2021 $'000   | 2020 $'000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                                                     | 10,240       | 8,962        |\n| Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets presented in 'revenue'                                | 3,250        | 1,676        |\n| Expenses relating to short-term leases                                                            | 2,992        | 2,377        |\n| Expenses relating to leases of low-value assets, excluding short-term leases  of low-value assets | 138          | 426          |\n\n## Amounts recognised in statement of cash flows\n\n|                               | 2021 $'000   | 2020 $'000   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Payment of lease liabilities  | 21,087       | 21,059       |\n| Interest expense              | 10,240       | 8,962        |\n| Total cash outflow for leases | 31,327       | 30,021       |\n\n35\n\n## DIVIDENDS\n\n|                                                                                | Company       | Company       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                                | 2021 $'000    | 2020 $'000    |\n| Final tax exempt (one-tier) ordinary dividend paid of 8.0 cents                |               |               |\n| (2020: 8.0 cents) per ordinary share in respect of the previous financial year | 72,552        | 72,552        |\n| Special final tax exempt (one-tier) ordinary dividend paid of 4.0 cents        |               |               |\n| (2020: 6.0 cents) per ordinary share in respect of the previous financial year | 36,276        | 54,414        |\n| Special interim tax exempt (one-tier) ordinary dividend paid of 3.0 cents      |               |               |\n| (2020: Nil cents) per ordinary share in respect of the current financial year  | 27,207        | -             |\n| Non-cumulative tax exempt (one-tier) preference dividend paid of 1.93 cents    |               |               |\n| (2020: 1.94 cents) per preference share                                        | 6,399         | 6,417         |\n| Non-cumulative tax exempt (one-tier) preference dividend paid of 1.97 cents    |               |               |\n| (2020: 1.96 cents) per preference share                                        | 6,505 148,939 | 6,487 139,870 |\n\nAfter the respective reporting dates, the directors proposed the following ordinary dividends, which have not been provided for:\n\n|                                                                                                          | Company    | Company    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                                                          | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Final tax exempt (one-tier) ordinary dividend of 8.0 cents   (2020: 8.0 cents) per ordinary share        | 72,552     | 72,552     |\n| Special final tax exempt (one-tier) ordinary dividend of 1.0 cents  (2020: 4.0 cents) per ordinary share | 9,069      | 36,276     |\n|                                                                                                          | 81,621     | 108,828    |",

Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant changes in circumstances within its control.\n\nThe Group has estimated that the potential future lease payments, should it exercise the extension option, would result in an increase in lease liability of $43.6 million (2020: $41.6 million).\n\n## Leases as lessor\n\nThe Group leases out its investment properties consisting of its owned properties as well as leased properties (see note 5). All leases are classified as operating leases from a lessor perspective.\n\n## Operating lease\n\nThe Group and the Company lease out some of their investment properties and development properties. The Group has classified these leases as operating leases, because they do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets. Note 5 sets out information about the operating leases of investment properties.\n\nRental income from investment properties and property subleases recognised by the Group during 2021 was $329,454,000 (2020: $348,906,000).\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis of lease rental receivables, showing the undiscounted lease payments to be received after the reporting date.\n\n|                      | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                      | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Less than one year   | 280,299    | 292,113    | 49,726     | 47,328     |\n| One to two years     | 204,207    | 224,177    | 33,138     | 30,434     |\n| Two to three years   | 147,205    | 149,880    | 17,158     | 16,904     |\n| Three to four years  | 104,056    | 106,910    | 3,489      | 6,376      |\n| Four to five years   | 79,376     | 89,320     | 681        | 678        |\n| More than five years | 272,436    | 348,620    | -          | -          |\n| Total                | 1,087,579  | 1,211,020  | 104,192    | 101,720    |\n\nContingent rents, generally determined based on a percentage of tenants' revenue, of $6,851,000 (2020: $6,666,000) has been recognised as revenue by the Group, in profit or loss during the year.\n\n## 36 LEASES /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\nIncluded in the non-cancellable operating lease rental receivables above are commitments with related parties which are set out below.\n\n|                                         | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                         | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Non-cancellable operating lease rentals |            |            |            |            |\n| receivable from:                        |            |            |            |            |\n| - associates                            | 30,752     | -          | -          | -          |\n| - joint ventures                        | 134        | 39,182     | -          | -          |\n| - a fellow subsidiary                   | 967        | 270        | 966        | 270        |\n| - subsidiaries                          | -          | -          | 3,117      | 3,299      |\n|                                         | 31,853     | 39,452     | 4,083      | 3,569      |\n\n## 37 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITY\n\n## (I) Commitments\n\nThe Group and the Company have the following commitments as at the reporting date:\n\n|                                                                                        | Group      | Group      | Company 2020   | Company 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                                                        | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000     | $'000          |\n| Development expenditure contracted but not  provided for in the financial statements   | 1,221,021  | 677,935    | -              | -              |\n| Capital expenditure contracted but not provided  for in the financial statements       | 192,097    | 66,093     | -              | -              |\n| Commitments in respect of purchase of  properties for which deposits have been paid    | 286,475    | 55,240     | -              | -              |\n| Commitments in respect of investments in a joint  venture and associates               | 70,956     | 105,223    | -              | -              |\n| Commitments in respect of capital contribution  to investments in financial assets in: |            |            |                |                |\n| - related parties                                                                      | 36,118     | 63,499     | -              | -              |\n| - third parties                                                                        | 14,362     | 18,521     | -              | -              |\n\n## (II) Contingent liability\n\nA subsidiary of the Group in China, whose principal activities are the trading of development properties and leasing activities, would in the ordinary course of business act as guarantors for the bank loans taken by the buyers to finance the purchase of properties developed by this subsidiary, covering the period from loan contract date to the property delivery date.

Management is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's risk management policies. Management reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Group has a system of controls in place to maintain an acceptable balance between the cost of risks occurring and the cost of managing the risks. Management continually monitors the Group's risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial years, the Group's policy that no derivatives shall be undertaken for speculative purposes except for its use as hedging instruments where appropriate and cost efficient.\n\n## (i) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group's receivables from customers and debt investments.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group had gross amounts owing by HCP Group of $395.1 million (2020: $683.6 million) (note 9) and subscribed for bonds of $311.5 million (2020: $305.4 million) (note 10) issued by Sincere Property Group. Impairment losses of $331.2 million (note 9 and 15) (2020: $323.9 million (note 9)) and $293.8 million (2020: $288.0 million) (note 10) have been recognised on the amounts owing by HCP Group and the bonds, respectively. In addition, the amounts owing by subsidiaries and joint ventures represent 92% (2020: 88%) of the Company's financial assets. Except as disclosed, there is no significant concentration of credit risk for the Group and the Company. The carrying amounts of financial assets and contract assets represent the Group's and the Company's maximum exposures to credit risk, before taking into account any collateral held.",

Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount. The Group does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets.\n\nThe Group limits its exposure to credit risk from trade receivables by collecting deposits as collateral, where possible. For trade receivables and contract assets relating to sale of development properties, if a purchaser defaults on payments, the Group may enforce payments via legal proceedings or if the purchaser is assessed to be insolvent, the Group may take possession of the units, retain a portion of the sales consideration, and resell the property.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  the  Group  considers  the  trade  history  of  the  customers  with  the  Group, aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.\n\n## Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables and contract assets at the reporting date by business segment is set out below:\n\n|                       | Group      | Group      | Company    | Company    |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                       | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 | 2021 $'000 | 2020 $'000 |\n| Property development  | 1,813,907  | 1,944,732  | 5,146,585  | 5,326,041  |\n| Hotel operations      | 179,976    | 131,053    | 1,635,335  | 1,579,703  |\n| Investment properties | 102,646    | 95,749     | 1,734,717  | 1,674,929  |\n| Others                | 112,034    | 60,680     | 3,911,800  | 3,757,528  |\n|                       | 2,208,563  | 2,232,214  | 12,428,437 | 12,338,201 |\n\n## Expected credit loss assessment on trade receivables\n\nThe Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from individual customers, which comprise a very large number of small balances.\n\nLoss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over the past 3 years (2020: 3 years). These rates are adjusted to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historic data has been collected, current conditions and the Group's view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. The exposure to credit risk and ECL for trade receivables as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 is insignificant.\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## (i) Credit risk (cont'd)\n\nThe following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables as at reporting date:\n\n|                            | Group                        | Group                            | Company                      | Company                          |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                            | Gross carrying  amount $'000 | Impairment  loss allowance $'000 | Gross carrying  amount $'000 | Impairment  loss allowance $'000 |\n| 2021                       |                              |                                  |                              |                                  |\n| Current (not past due)     | 99,892                       | 15                               | 15                           | 11                               |\n| 1 - 30 days past due       | 29,166                       | 557                              | 628                          | 44                               |\n| 31 - 60 days past due      | 4,816                        | 95                               | 118                          | 10                               |\n| 61 - 90 days past due      | 3,446                        | 30                               | 21                           | 3                                |\n| More than 90 days past due | 47,007                       | 16,328                           | 528                          | 67                               |\n|                            | 184,327                      | 17,025                           | 1,310                        | 135                              |\n| 2020                       |                              |                                  |                              |                                  |\n| Current (not past due)     | 92,607                       | 515                              | 92                           | -                                |\n| 1 - 30 days past due       | 21,781                       | 961                              | 672                          | 311                              |\n| 31 - 60 days past due      | 12,395                       | 1,062                            | 588                          | 142                              |\n| 61 - 90 days past due      | 5,394                        | 553                              | 50                           | 27                               |\n| More than 90 days past due | 40,108                       | 22,121                           | 1,112                        | 236                              |\n|                            | 172,285                      | 25,212                           | 2,514                        | 716                              |\n\n## Movements in allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables\n\nThe movements in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade and other receivables (excluding amounts owing by subsidiaries (note 7) and joint ventures (note 9)) during the year are as follows:\n\n|                                               | Group  Lifetime ECL   | Group  Lifetime ECL   | Company  Lifetime ECL   | Company  Lifetime ECL   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                               | 2021 $'000            | 2020 $'000            | 2021 $'000              | 2020 $'000              |\n| Allowance for impairment on trade receivables |                       |                       |                         |                         |\n| At 1 January                                  | 25,212                | 14,301                | 716                     | 7                       |\n| Impairment loss (reversed)/  recognised       | (2,448)               | 11,222                | (431)                   | 709                     |\n| Impairment loss utilised                      | (5,796)               | (798)                 | (150)                   | -                       |\n| Translation differences on  consolidation     | 57                    | 487                   | -                       | -                       |\n| At 31 December                                | 17,025                | 25,212                | 135                     | 716                     |\n\nImpairment losses (reversed)/recognised on trade receivables were included in 'other operating expenses'.",

In addition, the Company held non-trade receivables from its subsidiaries which were lent to the subsidiaries to meet their funding requirements. Impairment on these balances has been measured on the 12-month and lifetime expected loss basis. Except as disclosed in note 9, the Group uses an approach that is based on an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default, including but not limited to, financial statements of the entities, and applying credit judgement. The amount of allowance on the non-trade amounts due from associates was negligible.

The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The amount of the allowance on cash and cash equivalents as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 was negligible.\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents and credit facilities deemed adequate by management to finance the Group's operations and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group has provided financial guarantees to a lender to an associate (note 8). As at 31 December 2020, the Group had provided financial guarantees to an associate (note 8) and a joint venture (notes 9(v) and 28). The Group has contractual commitments to incur capital expenditure on its property, plant and equipment and investment properties, purchase properties and to invest in joint ventures, associates and investees (see note 37).\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk (cont'd)\n\nThe  following  are  the  remaining  contractual  maturities  of  financial  liabilities.

The cash inflows/(outflows) disclosed represent the  contractual  undiscounted  cash  flows  relating  to  derivative  financial  liabilities  held  for  risk  management purposes and which are usually not closed out prior to contractual maturity. The disclosure shows net cash flow amounts for derivatives that are net cash-settled and gross cash inflow and outflow amounts for derivatives that have simultaneous gross cash settlement e.g. forward exchange contracts. Net-settled derivative financial assets are included in the maturity analyses as they are held to hedge the cash flow variability of the Group's floating rate loans.\n\nThe interest payments on variable interest rate loans and bonds and notes in the table above reflect market forward interest rates at the period end and these amounts may change as market interest rates changes. It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.\n\n## (iii) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices, will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe  Group's  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  relates  primarily  to  its  interest-bearing  financial  assets  and  debt obligations. The Group adopts a policy of managing its interest rate exposure by maintaining a debt portfolio with both fixed and floating interest rates.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost of variable rate borrowings is considered to outweigh the benefits of their flexibility, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional or par amounts. If a hedging relationship is directly affected by uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, then the Group assumes for this purpose that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nHedging  relationships  that  are  impacted  by  interest  rate  benchmark  reform  may  experience  ineffectiveness because of the uncertainty about when and how replacement may occur for the relevant hedged item and hedging instrument due to the interest rate benchmark reform transition.

The Group has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group's main IBOR exposure at 31 December 2021 was indexed to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR. These benchmark rates will lose representativeness or discontinue and be replaced with alternative interest rates benchmarks in US and Singapore with effect from 1 July 2023.\n\nManagement monitors and manages the Group's transition to alternative rates. Management evaluates the extent to which contracts reference IBOR cash flows, whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of interest rate benchmark reform and how to manage communication about interest rate benchmark reform with counterparties.\n\n## Non-derivative financial liabilities\n\nThe Group's IBOR exposures to non-derivative financial liabilities as at 31 December 2021 were secured and unsecured borrowings indexed to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR. The Group is in the process of communicating with counterparties to progressively transition non-derivative financial liabilities which are indexed to the affected interest rate benchmarks to alternative risk-free rates.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group holds interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps for risk management purposes. The interest rate swap and cross currency swaps have floating legs that are indexed to USD LIBOR and SGD SOR. The Group's derivative instruments are governed by contracts based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)'s master agreements. The Group is in the process of communicating with counterparties to progressively transition derivative instruments which are indexed to the affected interest rate benchmarks to alternative riskfree rates.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group has evaluated the extent to which its cash flow hedging relationships are subject to uncertainty driven by interest rate benchmark reform as at 31 December 2021. The Group's hedged items and hedging instruments continue to be indexed to IBOR benchmark rates which are USD LIBOR. These benchmark rates are quoted each day and the IBOR cash flows are exchanged with its counterparties as usual.\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n- (iii) Market risk (cont'd)\n\nInterest rate risk (cont'd)\n\n## Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks (cont'd)\n\n## Hedge accounting (cont'd)\n\nThe Group's USD LIBOR cash flow hedging relationships extend beyond the anticipated cessation dates of the respective rates. The Group continues to apply the amendments to SFRS(I) 9 issued in December 2020 (Phase 1) to those hedging relationships directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. The Group is in the process of communicating with counterparties on all indexed exposures and the relevant hedging instruments and hedged items have not been amended to transition from USD LIBOR.\n\nHedging relationships impacted by interest rate benchmark reform may experience ineffectiveness attributable to market participants' expectations of when and how the shift from the existing IBOR benchmark rate to an alternative benchmark interest rate will occur for the relevant hedged items and hedging instruments. This transition may also occur at different times for the hedged item and hedging instrument, which may lead to hedge ineffectiveness. The Group has measured its hedging instruments indexed to USD LIBOR using available quoted market rates for USD LIBOR-based instruments of the same tenor and similar maturity and has measured the cumulative change in the present value of hedged cash flows attributable to changes in USD LIBOR on a similar basis.\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS",

The Group considers that a contract is not yet transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate when interest under the contract is indexed to a benchmark rate that is still subject to interest rate benchmark reform, even if it includes a fallback clause that deals with the cessation of the existing IBOR (referred to as an 'unreformed contract').\n\nThe following table shows the total amounts of unreformed contracts and those with appropriate fallback language at 31 December 2021. The amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are shown at their carrying amounts and derivatives are shown at their nominal amounts.\n\n|                       | USD LIBOR                                    | USD LIBOR                                       | SGD SOR                                      | SGD SOR                                         |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                       | Total amount  of unreformed  contracts $'000 | Amount with  appropriate  fallback clause $'000 | Total amount  of unreformed  contracts $'000 | Amount with  appropriate  fallback clause $'000 |\n| Group                 |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| 31 December 2021      |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| Financial liabilities |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| Bank loans            | 213,359                                      | -                                               | -                                            | -                                               |\n| Term loans            | 822,880                                      | 417,398                                         | 2,672,760                                    | 90,247                                          |\n| Derivative            |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| Cross currency swaps  | 157,327                                      | -                                               | 146,450                                      | -                                               |\n| Interest rate swaps   | 88,036                                       | -                                               | -                                            | -                                               |\n| Company               |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| 31 December 2021      |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| Financial liabilities |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| Term loans            | 41,764                                       | -                                               | 2,025,666                                    | -                                               |\n| Derivative            |                                              |                                                 |                                              |                                                 |\n| Cross currency swaps  | -                                            | -                                               | 146,450                                      | -                                               |\n\nThe Group's exposure to USD LIBOR designated in hedging relationships is $288,000,000 nominal amount as at 31 December 2021, representing the principal amount of the Group's USD denominated debts maturing in 2022 to 2023 used to hedge the net investments in foreign operations.\n\n## Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments\n\nThe Group has fixed rate debt instruments measured at FVTPL. A change in interest rates at the reporting date would not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## 41 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS /parenleft.capCONT'D/parenright.cap\n\n## (iii) Market risk (cont'd)\n\nInterest rate risk (cont'd)\n\n## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments\n\nAn increase of 100 basis points in interest rates on the variable rate instruments held by the Group and the Company at the reporting date would have increased/(decreased) profit or loss (before any tax effect) by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant and does not take into account the effect of qualifying borrowing costs allowed for capitalisation.\n\n|                                             | Group                   | Group                  | Company          | Company          |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                             | 31 December  2021 $'000 | 31 December 2020 $'000 | 31 December 2021 | 31 December 2020 |\n|                                             |                         |                        | $'000            | $'000            |\n| 100 bp increase                             |                         |                        |                  |                  |\n| (Reduction)/Increase in profit   before tax | (59,458)                | (69,863)               | (7,328)          | (19,823)         |\n\nA 100bp decrease in interest rates at the reporting date would have had an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the United States Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Hong Kong Dollar, Australian Dollar, Sterling Pound, Renminbi, Japanese Yen, Euro, Thai Baht and New Zealand Dollar.\n\nThe Group has a decentralised approach to the management of foreign currency risk. The Group manages its foreign currency exposure by adopting a natural hedge policy of matching receipts and payments, and asset purchases and borrowings, in the currency of the relevant entity, where possible. Entities in the Group may have different approaches to the identification and management of this risk. Entities in the Group may borrow in currencies other than their functional currencies to fund investments that are denominated in their borrowing currencies. In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group's policy is to ensure that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances. Where feasible, the Group may put in place certain financial derivative instruments including forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to minimise the Group's exposure to movements in exchange rates on firm commitments and specific transactions.\n\nThe Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nIn these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u00b7 The effect of the counterparty and the Group's own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates; and\n- \u00b7 Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.",

The risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsidiaries and the Company's functional currency, which causes the amount of the net investments to vary in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The hedged risk in the net investment hedges is the risk of a weakening of the United States Dollar, Euro, Renminbi, Japanese Yen and Sterling Pound against Singapore Dollar that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of the Group's net investments in subsidiaries. An economic relationship exists between the hedged net investment and hedging instrument due to the shared foreign currency risk exposure.\n\nThe Group uses a mixture of foreign currency-denominated debt, forward exchange contracts and cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments. When the hedging instrument is foreign currency-denominated debt, the Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the carrying amount of the debt that are attributable to a change in the spot rate with past changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movement in spot rate (the offset method). The Group's policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal.",

The Group ensures that the foreign currency in which the hedging instrument is denominated is the same as the functional currency of the net investment. This qualitative assessment is supplemented quantitatively using the hypothetical derivative method for the purposes of assessing hedge effectiveness. The Group assesses effectiveness by comparing past changes in the fair value of the derivative with changes in the fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The hypothetical derivative is constructed to have the same critical terms as the net investment designated as the hedged item and a fair value of zero at inception. The Group's policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the nominal amount of the foreign exchange or cross-currency swap leg of the derivative.\n\nThe Group held the following instruments to hedge exposures to changes in foreign currencies:\n\n|                              | Line item in the statement                             | Changes in   ineffectiveness              | Hedge                         | Line item in  profit or loss that   | Amount                                                 |                       |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Notional   Carrying amount - | of financial position where  the hedging instrument is | the value of                              | recognised in  profit or loss | includes hedge                      | reclassified from  reserve to profit  foreign exchange | Hedged                |\n| amount Assets/ (Liabilities) | included                                               | the hedging instrument  recognised in OCI |                               | ineffectiveness                     | or loss                                                | rate Year of maturity |\n| $'000                        |                                                        | $'000                                     | $'000                         |                                     | $'000                                                  |                       |\n\n## Group\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\n## 2021\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\n-  Borrowings to hedge net\n\ninvestments in foreign operations\n\n-  Cross-currency swaps to hedge net\n\ninvestments in foreign operations\n\nRMB74,190,000\n\n(347)\n\n2020\n\nForeign exchange risk\n\n-  Borrowings to hedge net\n\ninvestments in foreign operations\n\n-  Cross-currency swaps to hedge net\n\ninvestments in foreign operations\n\nRMB74,190,000\n\n(444)\n\n-  Forward exchange contracts to\n\nhedge net investments in foreign\n\noperations\n\nRMB220,000,000\n\n213\n\n$721,426,000\n\nequivalent\n\n(721,426)\n\n$642,665,000\n\nequivalent\n\n(642,665)\n\nFINANCIALS FINANCIALS\n\nInterest-bearing\n\nborrowings\n\n(2,288)\n\n-\n\nNot applicable\n\n-\n\nNot applicable\n\n2022 to 2025\n\nOther\n\nliabilities\n\n(331)\n\n(16)\n\nFinance costs\n\n-\n\nSGD/RMB 4.81\n\n2023\n\nInterest-bearing\n\nborrowings\n\n9,080\n\n109\n\nFinance costs\n\n-\n\nNot applicable\n\n2021 to 2025\n\nTrade and other\n\npayables\n\n(628)\n\n-\n\nNot applicable\n\n-\n\nSGD/RMB 5.09\n\n2021\n\nTrade and other\n\nreceivables\n\n213\n\n-\n\nNot applicable\n\n-\n\nSGD/RMB 4.90\n\n2021",

The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n\nProperty development\n\n- develops and purchases properties for sale\n\nHotel operations - owns and manages hotels\n\nInvestment properties - develops and purchases investment properties for lease\n\nOthers comprises mainly investment in shares, management and consultancy services, and provision of laundry services. None of these segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2021 and 2020.\n\nInformation regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\n\n## Information about reportable segments\n\n|                                                                      | Property development $'000   | Hotel  operations $'000   | Investment properties $'000   | Total $'000   | Others $'000   | Total $'000   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| 2021                                                                 |                              |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| Total revenue                                                        |                              |                           |                               |               |                |               |\n| (including inter- segment revenue)                                   | 1,254,470                    | 883,784                   | 407,155                       | 2,545,409     | 193,959        | 2,739,368     |\n| Inter-segment  revenue                                               | -                            | (10,666)                  | (66,037)                      | (76,703)      | (36,812)       | (113,515)     |\n| External revenue                                                     | 1,254,470                    | 873,118                   | 341,118                       | 2,468,706     | 157,147        | 2,625,853     |\n| Profit from operating  activities                                    | 203,917                      | 16,299                    | 89,551                        | 309,767       | 12,105         | 321,872       |\n| Share of after-tax  profit/(loss) of  associates and joint  ventures | 114,606                      | (36,578)                  | (5,297)                       | 72,731        | 34,761         | 107,492       |\n| Finance income                                                       | 22,443                       | 3,153                     | 4,342                         | 29,938        | 6,268          | 36,206        |\n| Finance costs                                                        | (96,201)                     | (53,922)                  | (64,285)                      | (214,408)     | (23,415)       | (237,823)     |\n| Net finance costs                                                    | (73,758)                     | (50,769)                  | (59,943)                      | (184,470)     | (17,147)       | (201,617)     |\n| Reportable segment  profit/(loss) before  tax                        | 244,765                      | (71,048)*                 | 24,311                        | 198,028       | 29,719         | 227,747       |\n| Depreciation and  amortisation                                       | 3,895                        | 131,337                   | 115,925                       | 251,157       | 26,388         | 277,545       |",

Please refer to note (a) under note 44 of the financial statements.\n- (b) Phuket Square Co., Ltd and Krungthep Rimnam Limited are considered subsidiaries of the Group as the Group is exposed to variable returns from the companies and has the ability to affect those returns through the management's control over the relevant activities of the companies.\n- (c) CDL Hospitality Trusts is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (H-REIT), a real estate investment trust, and CDL Hospitality Business Trust (HBT), a business trust. H-REIT has an investment strategy of investing directly or indirectly, in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate which is primarily used for hospitality, hospitality-related and other accommodation and/or lodging purposes, whether wholly or partially, and real-estate related assets in relation to the foregoing.\n- HBT is a business trust which currently acts as master lessee, asset owner and hotel operator. HBT may also undertake certain hospitality, hospitality-related and other accommodation and/or lodging development projects, acquisition and investments which may not be suitable for H-REIT.\n\nAlthough the Group owns less than half of the ownership interest and voting power of H-REIT and HBT, management has determined that the Group has control over H-REIT and HBT. The activities of H-REIT and HBT are managed by the Group's subsidiaries, M&C REIT Management Limited (H-REIT Manager) and M&C Business Trust Management Limited (HBT Trustee-Manager) respectively. H-REIT Manager has decision-making authority over H-REIT, subject to oversight by the trustee of H-REIT. HBT Trustee-Manager has dual responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the HBT unitholders and decision-making authority over HBT.

Ltd. (Cityview), the Group has determined that it does not have control over Cityview upon the sale of cash flows in Cityview in 2014 as described below.  The Group has significant influence in Cityview through Sunbright Holdings Limited (Sunbright).  Accordingly, Cityview is classified as an associate of the Group.\n- i. Sale and purchase agreement\n- On 15 December 2014, Baynes Investment Pte. Ltd. (Baynes), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, sold the Dividends (as defined in the sale and purchase agreement) in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cityview, to Sunbright.\n- ii. Profit participation securities\n- On 22 December 2014, the Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria Holdings Limited (Astoria), subscribed for 37.5% interest in a capital instrument called profit participation securities (PPS) issued by Sunbright. The PPS has a tenor of 5 years and will expire upon final payment of the cash flows arising from the Dividends. The PPS carries a fixed payout amount (the Fixed Payout) at the rate of 5% per annum, which is payable on a semi-annual basis or, at the election of the PPS holders, payable upfront in one lump sum on the date of issue of the PPS.\n\nAstoria, together with other investors (the Third Party Investors), (collectively, the PPS Holders), elected to receive the Fixed Payout upfront and the total Fixed Payout of $187.5 million was offset against the consideration payable by the PPS holders for the subscription of the PPS.\n\nThe Group will receive from Sunbright the cash flows purchased from Baynes (after satisfying certain senior ranking liabilities, including capital contributions from the Third Party Investors) in accordance with a pre-agreed order of priority as set out under the terms of the PPS.\n\nIn addition, shares of Baynes with a carrying value of $1,502,000 (2020: $1,502,000) was pledged to Sunbright.\n\n## iii. Investment Committees\n\n- On 22 December 2014, the Group entered into an Investors' Agreement with the Third Party Investors and Sunbright. Under the Investors' Agreement, the management of the affairs of Sunbright and its subsidiaries are delegated to the Investment Committees where the Group has the right to appoint 5 out of 12 members. Taken as a whole, the Group does not have power over the relevant activities of Cityview.\n- The Group has determined that it has significant influence over Sunbright because of its representation on the Investment Committees. Accordingly, Sunbright is considered an associate of the Group.\n- In April 2019, the Group, through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Astoria, acquired the remaining PPS units in the nonresidential component of Sunbright, which holds W Hotel and Quayside Isle (Non-Residential Component) (note 39). Following the acquisition, the Group has power over the relevant activities of the Non-Residential Component, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group.\n- (b) Although the Group holds more than 50% ownership interest in Emerging Markets Affordable Housing Fund Pte. Ltd. (the Fund), pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in the Fund, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the Fund. Accordingly, the Fund is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- (c) In 2020, the Group through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sonic Investments Pte. Ltd., acquired a 63.75% equity interest in HCP Chongqing Property Development Co., Ltd (HCP), which owns 80.01% equity interest in Sincere Property Group.\n- Although the Group held more than 50% ownership interest in HCP, pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in HCP, joint control was exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of HCP. Accordingly, HCP was accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- During 2021, the Group disposed of its entire 63.75% equity interest in HCP (note 9).\n- (d) Although the Group holds less than 50% voting interest in the IREIT Manager, pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in the IREIT Manager, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of the IREIT Manager. Accordingly, the IREIT Manager is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n- (e) Although the Group holds more than 50% ownership interest in South Beach Consortium Pte. Ltd. (South Beach), pursuant to a contractual agreement between the Group and its joint venture partner in South Beach, joint control is exercised by both parties over the relevant activities of South Beach. Accordingly, South Beach is accounted for as a joint venture of the Group.\n\nExcept as disclosed in note 9, the Group does not consider the above associates and joint ventures to be individually material to the Group under the context of SFRS(I) 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities .",

The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its Shares, and the impact on the Company's financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on whether the Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits of the Company, the aggregate number of Shares purchased or acquired, the consideration paid at the relevant time and whether the Shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled.\n\nBased on the existing number of issued Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares of the Company as at 3 March 2022 (the 'Latest Practicable Date') (disregarding the Ordinary Shares held in treasury), the exercise in full of the Share Purchase Mandate would result in the purchase of 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares (representing 10% of the total number of issued Ordinary Shares of the Company, disregarding the Ordinary Shares held in treasury) and 33,087,425 Preference Shares (representing 10% of the total number of issued Preference Shares of the Company).\n\nIn the case of Market Purchases and Off-Market Purchases by the Company and assuming that the Company purchases or acquires 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price of $7.46 for one Ordinary Share (being the price equivalent to 105% of the Average Closing Price as at the Latest Practicable Date) and 33,087,425 Preference Shares at the Maximum Price of $1.10 for one Preference Share (being the price equivalent to 105% of the Average Closing Price as at the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required for the purchase or acquisition of 90,690,133 Ordinary Shares and 33,087,425 Preference Shares is approximately $676.50 million and $36.40 million respectively.\n\nThe financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such Shares pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 based on these assumptions are set out in paragraph 3.5 of Annexure I of the Letter to Shareholders.\n\n- 9. Ordinary Resolution 9 of the Special Business above, if passed, will renew the IPT Mandate which was last approved by shareholders on 30 April 2021, to facilitate the Company, its subsidiaries and its associated companies to enter into interested person transactions, the details of which are set out in Annexure II and Appendix A of the Letter to Shareholders. The IPT Mandate will continue in force until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company, unless previously revoked or varied at a general meeting.\n- 10. Ordinary Resolution 10 of the Special Business above, if passed, will empower the Directors of the Company to distribute 144,300,000 CDLHT Units held by the Company to the Entitled Shareholders, by way of a dividend in specie on a pro rata basis to all Entitled Shareholders as at the Record Date, fractional entitlements to be disregarded, on and subject to the terms of Annexure III of the Letter to Shareholders.\n\n## Voting restriction pursuant to Rule 921(7) of the Listing Manual of SGX-ST\n\nHong Leong Investment Holdings Pte. Ltd. and its subsidiaries, the Directors of the Company and their associates, who are also shareholders of the Company and being Interested Persons under the IPT Mandate, are required to abstain from voting at the Meeting in respect of the Ordinary Resolution 9 in relation to the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate.\n\n## MEETING NOTES:\n\n- 1.
