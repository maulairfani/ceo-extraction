        "page_content": "## Highlights\n\nFinancial performance reflected improved global economic conditions, and we continued to/uni00A0make progress against our four strategic pillars.\n\n## Financial performance (vs 2020)\n\n- -Reported profit after tax up $8.6bn to $14.7bn and reported profit before tax up $10.1bn to $18.9bn. The increase was driven by a net release of expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges ('ECL') and a higher share of profit from our associates. Adjusted profit before tax up/uni00A079% to $21.9bn.\n- -All regions were profitable in 2021, notably HSBC UK Bank plc, where reported profit before tax increased by $4.5bn to $4.8bn. Our Asia operations contributed $12.2bn to reported profit before tax and all other regions reported a material recovery in profitability, reflecting favourable ECL movements.\n- -Reported revenue down 2% to $49.6bn, primarily reflecting the impact of lower global interest rates and a decrease in revenue in Markets and Securities Services ('MSS') compared with a strong comparative period. Notwithstanding these factors, we saw revenue growth in areas of strategic focus, including Wealth, in part due to favourable market impacts in life insurance\n\n## Strategic progress\n\n- -In/uni00A0our wealth business in Asia, we attracted net new invested assets of $36bn in 2021. We also announced acquisitions in Singapore and India to develop our wealth capabilities across the/uni00A0region.\n- - Our cost-reduction programme continues to/uni00A0progress with $2.2bn of cost savings recognised in 2021. Since the start of the programme in 2020, we have delivered savings of $3.3bn, with costs to achieve of $3.6bn.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe carry good business momentum into 2022 in most areas and expect mid-single-digit lending growth over the year. However, we expect a weaker Wealth performance in Asia in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWe expect ECL charges to normalise towards 30bps of average loans in 2022, based on current consensus economic forecasts and default experience, noting we retain $0.6bn of/uni00A0Covid-19-related allowances as at the end of/uni00A02021. Uncertainty remains given recent developments in China's commercial real estate sector, while inflationary pressures persist in many of our markets.\n\nmanufacturing, and Global Trade and Receivables Finance ('GTRF'). Adjusted revenue down 3% to $50.1bn.\n\n- -Net interest margin ('NIM') of 1.20%, down 12 basis points ('bps') from 2020, with stabilisation in the second half of 2021.\n- -Reported ECL were a net release of $0.9bn, compared with an $8.8bn charge in 2020, reflecting an improvement in economic conditions relative to 2020, and better than expected levels of credit performance. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognised a net ECL charge of $450m, which included an increase in allowances to reflect recent developments in China's commercial real estate sector.\n- -Reported operating expenses broadly unchanged at $34.6bn. Adjusted operating expenses down 1% to $32.1bn, despite inflationary pressures, as the impact of our cost-saving initiatives and a reduction in the UK bank levy charge absorbed higher performance-related pay and continued growth in technology investment.\n- - In line with our climate change resolution, we/uni00A0published our thermal coal phaseout policy and have set on-balance sheet financed emission targets for our oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors.\n- - In 2021, we continued to support our customers in the transition to net zero and a sustainable future. Since 1 January 2020, we have provided and facilitated $126.7bn towards our ambition of $750bn to $1tn/uni00A0by 2030.\n\nWe continue to target 2022 adjusted operating expenses in line with 2021, despite inflationary pressures, with cost to achieve spend of $3.4bn expected to generate over $2bn of cost savings in 2022. In 2023, we intend to manage growth in adjusted operating expenses to within a range of 0% to 2%, compared with 2022 (on an IFRS 4 basis), with cost savings of/uni00A0at least $0.5bn from actions taken in 2022 helping to o/ffset inflation.\n\nWe expect mid-single-digit RWA growth in 2022 through a combination of business growth, acquisitions and regulatory changes, partly o/ffset by additional RWA savings. This\n\n- -Customer lending balances in 2021 up/uni00A0$8bn on a reported basis and $23bn on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by growth in mortgage balances, mainly in the UK and Hong Kong.\n- -Common equity tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio of 15.8%, down 0.1 percentage points. Capital generation was more than o/ffset by dividends, the up to $2bn share buy-back announced in October, foreign exchange movements and other deductions. Risk-weighted assets ('RWAs') reduced despite new Pillar 1 requirements for structural foreign exchange, reflecting actions under our transformation programme.\n- -The Board has approved a second interim dividend of $0.18 per share, making a total for 2021 of $0.25 per share. We also intend to initiate a further share buy-back of up to $1bn, to commence after the existing up to $2bn buy-back has/uni00A0concluded.\n- - We continued the transformation of our US/uni00A0business and HSBC Bank plc, our UK non-ring-fenced bank and Europe, reducing costs and RWAs. Furthermore, we announced the exit of mass market retail in the US, and the planned sale of our retail operations in France. During 2022, we expect to recognise a pre-tax loss, excluding transaction costs, of around $2.7bn upon the classification of our France retail operations as 'held for sale'.\n\ngrowth, together with capital returns are expected to normalise our CET1 position to be/uni00A0within our 14% to 14.5% target operating range during 2022.\n\nOur net interest income outlook is now significantly more positive. If policy rates were to follow the current implied market consensus, we would expect to deliver a RoTE of at least 10% for 2023, one year ahead of our previous expectations.\n\nWe continue to target dividends within our 40% to 55% dividend payout ratio range.",

While/uni00A0Covid-19 vaccines were rolled out/uni00A0globally,/uni00A0some countries dealt with very/uni00A0significant outbreaks and many more operated under various restrictions at di/fferent points. As in 2020, this took a/uni00A0huge toll on our customers, our people,/uni00A0the communities we serve and/uni00A0our shareholders.\n\nMy colleagues once again demonstrated their resilience, their professionalism and, above all, their exceptional commitment to serving our customers. Our purpose as an organisation is to open up a world of opportunity. Our people have brought this to life in the way they have supported our customers and each other. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them warmly for everything they have done, and continue to do.\n\nESG was another major theme of 2021. The pandemic has exposed the fragility of the planet and society as a whole. It has also created a catalyst for change and highlighted the associated commercial opportunities. Businesses, governments, regulators and\n\ninvestors all continued along their ESG journeys in 2021, as public awareness grew and activism around climate change in particular increased. HSBC has long understood that good ESG performance goes hand-in-hand with good financial performance, and it is now abundantly clear that the action businesses take on sustainability is an important lens through which they are being viewed and assessed by/uni00A0their stakeholders.\n\n## Progress\n\nHSBC delivered a good financial performance in 2021. Reported profit before tax was $18.9bn, an increase of $10.1bn as compared with 2020, while adjusted profit before tax was $21.9bn, up 79%. All of our regions were profitable in 2021, supported by the global economic recovery, demonstrating the value of our global network. There was also good growth in focus areas such as Asia wealth and/uni00A0trade. In line with the dividend policy announced in February 2021, the Board approved a second interim dividend for 2021 of $0.18, meaning the full year dividends for 2021 are $0.25.\n\nGood progress has been made in executing our strategic plan. A number of key milestones were reached in 2021 - including resolving the future of our retail businesses in France and the US, the organic build-out of HSBC Personal Wealth Planning in mainland China, and acquisitions in Singapore and India to accelerate the development of our wealth capabilities across Asia. At the same time, our work to digitise HSBC and to play a leading role in the net zero transition has continued at pace. There is more to do - and it will be important to see successive consecutive quarters of growth - but good momentum exists across our businesses.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nDue to ongoing travel restrictions and safety concerns, the Board has not been able to meet in person for two years. We look forward to reconnecting with each other and welcoming those Board members we are yet to meet in person. At the same time, we have come to appreciate the benefits of this new way of working - which include more regular dialogue, less travel and reduced costs and/uni00A0we will therefore use a hybrid model going forward.",

        "page_content": "## ' HSBC has long understood that good ESG/uni00A0performance goes hand-in-hand with/uni00A0good financial performance.'\n\nWe were pleased to hold our first hybrid AGM in May 2021, which the majority of shareholders attended virtually. It is a matter of deep regret to me, and to the Board as a whole, that we have been unable to/uni00A0meet our loyal Hong Kong shareholders face-to-face. We look forward to doing so again as soon as/uni00A0it is practicable and safe. In/uni00A0the meantime, a/uni00A0hybrid meeting does at least allow for constructive engagement and discussions with shareholders, which we continue to value/uni00A0highly.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, Laura Cha, Henri de Castries and Heidi Miller all retired from the Board. We also recently announced that Irene Lee and Pauline van der Meer Mohr will step down from the Board at the conclusion of our 2022 AGM in April. I am enormously grateful to them all for their important and valuable contributions to the Board, the committees and the subsidiary entities on which they have served. We welcomed Dame Carolyn Fairbairn and Rachel Duan to the Board on 1 September. Both Carolyn and Rachel bring a wealth of skills and expertise that will be of great value to the Board's discussions.\n\n## External environment\n\nThe roll-out of vaccines around the world and a robust global economic recovery mean we entered 2022 in a better state than we might have expected a year ago. There are clearly still significant challenges ahead, foremost among which is the uncertainty caused by the spread of the Omicron variant, and potentially other variants in the future. Supply chain bottlenecks, high energy and food prices, surging consumer demand and higher wages have combined to drive up inflation. Central banks have already begun to respond by tightening monetary policy and this is likely to/uni00A0continue in 2022.\n\nGlobal economic growth forecasts are fairly resilient - our own forecast is 4.1% global GDP growth in 2022. However, there remains a great deal of uncertainty given the wide range of responses from governments to the di/fferent challenges they face.\n\nAfter China's strong recovery, growth slowed in the second half of 2021. As a result, we expect China's government to take action to ease monetary and fiscal policies, with the aim of shoring up growth. Meanwhile, India's economy is set to grow rapidly, but growth is expected to be slower in the UK and the US.\n\nGlobal trade performed well in 2021, with volumes rising above pre-pandemic levels despite ongoing supply chain disruptions. Looking forward, trade growth could be further boosted by the lifting of restrictions on/uni00A0movement that remain in place in some countries. There are also signs that supply chain bottlenecks will ease as the year goes on, although when and how remains uncertain. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership is expected to reinforce/uni00A0Asia's central role in global trade. Along with the bilateral trade deals being struck by some countries, it also shows that trade liberalisation continues to advance in some parts of the world.\n\nAlthough there is currently no long-term agreement between the UK and the EU on access to financial services, we have worked for a number of years to ensure we will be able to maintain a full service for our clients under all potential scenarios. Ideally, the temporary arrangements on access to financial services will be retained so as to minimise disruption and enable the UK financial services industry to continue to o/ffer the many benefits it brings/uni00A0to the UK and EU economies. However,/uni00A0we are well prepared for a broad range of outcomes.\n\nAs a global bank operating in more than 60/uni00A0countries and territories, with a history stretching back more than 156 years, we always have experienced - and always will experience - geopolitical tensions. However, we remain alive to the potential impact that geopolitics can have on our business, as well as on our clients. The relationship between the US and China remains a prominent feature of the external environment, but we do not currently expect it to/uni00A0change significantly in the near future. We/uni00A0also expect the mutual economic benefits brought by the UK-China relationship to outweigh any short-term pressures. We continue to engage with all governments and remain focused on serving the needs of our customers in both East and West, and the many points in between.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nOur purpose of opening up a world of opportunity is equally applicable to our di/fferent stakeholders. For our people, it can mean helping them to develop new skills and advance in their careers, as well as being diverse and inclusive. For our shareholders, it/uni00A0can mean creating sustainable returns\n\nand value. For our suppliers, it can mean supporting them to grow their businesses and/uni00A0strengthen their own supply chains. And for the communities we serve, it can mean being a responsible citizen and leading the net/uni00A0zero transition.\n\nStakeholder engagement has been a priority for the Board in 2021. For example, the Board oversaw HSBC's continuing work in support of our ambition to align our financed emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner. This included engaging shareholders and leading NGOs ahead of the 2021 AGM, when our special resolution on the next steps in relation to our climate ambition was overwhelmingly approved. We also reviewed and approved a/uni00A0new thermal coal phase-out policy, which we announced in December 2021 and is designed to allow HSBC to help facilitate the transition to net zero in both developed and developing markets.\n\n## Thank you\n\nFinally, I would like to reiterate how grateful I/uni00A0am to all my colleagues for the great dedication and care they have shown to our customers and to each other over the past year. Their tremendous e/fforts have, above everything else, made us what we are today - and will shape what we become tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mark E Tucker\n\nGroup Chairman\n\n22 February 2022",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review\n\nWe are making good progress transforming and growing HSBC, which is helping us to open up a world of opportunity for our customers, our colleagues and our shareholders.\n\nNoel Quinn Group Chief Executive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA year ago, we refreshed our core purpose as an organisation. 'Opening up a world of opportunity' was the outcome of extensive consultation with colleagues and customers around the globe. I have been delighted by the way it has been embraced across HSBC - and in the many/uni00A0conversations I have had with colleagues, I have been greatly encouraged by how they see their roles/uni00A0contributing towards it.\n\nOpening up a world of opportunity draws heavily on HSBC's past, but it also encapsulates what we need to focus on to succeed now and in the future. Opportunities have always come in many shapes and forms, some of which have required us to change and evolve to make the most of them. We need to keep challenging ourselves to find and capture these opportunities. This is how we will help our customers to grow and succeed over the long term.\n\nAs we do so, we will be guided by the values underpinning our purpose - we value di/fference, we succeed together, we take responsibility and we get it done. These are the behaviours that will help us to identify and unlock new opportunities - and together they represent the kind of organisation we want HSBC to be.\n\nWith our purpose and values firmly in mind, we made good progress in 2021 against all four of our strategic pillars: focus on our strengths, digitise at scale, energise for growth and transition to net zero. Delivering against them contributed to a strong financial performance, which was supported by the global economic recovery. All of our regions were profitable and we have built a strong platform for future growth.\n\nFor some of our customers, the first priority has remained navigating the ongoing impact of Covid-19, particularly in markets that su/ffered severe outbreaks or faced restrictions during the course of 2021. To this end, I must again o/ffer my deep thanks to my colleagues, who have exemplified our values in supporting our customers and each other, all the while continuing to deal with the pandemic themselves.\n\nAs economies recovered and opened up, we have helped more and more of our customers to look beyond the immediate horizon and towards the opportunities we can open up for them. In 2021, we helped almost 269,000 personal customers to buy their first homes. We lent $47bn to help our business banking customers to run, grow and digitise their businesses. We launched new products and services that make it easier for our customers to bank with us, and allow us to focus our e/fforts on serving them. We facilitated $799bn of trade, which has helped businesses and economies around the world to recover and grow again.\n\nAs our people also began to look to the future, we created opportunities for them too. We helped more than 30,000 colleagues move into new roles in 2021, and over 115,000 colleagues to develop future-ready skills through our learning programmes. An increasing number of these programmes focused on building skills and capabilities in areas like data and sustainability, which are essential to our future.",

        "page_content": "' The opportunities of the future will be defined by the single greatest challenge of our time - the need for everyone to make the low-carbon transition.'\n\nMore than anything else, the opportunities of/uni00A0the future will be defined by the single greatest challenge of our time - the need for everyone to make the low-carbon transition. To seize them, we must change, adapt, invest/uni00A0and innovate. Since 2019, we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions across our/uni00A0operations by more than half. We also provided and facilitated $82.6bn of sustainable/uni00A0finance and investment bringing/uni00A0the cumulative total since 1 January 2020 to $126.7bn, towards our ambition of $750bn to/uni00A0$1tn by 2030. Furthermore, we have collaborated with other banks and financial institutions to help accelerate the transition through initiatives including the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero and the Sustainable Markets Initiative's Financial Services Taskforce.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nThe global economic recovery supported our 2021 financial performance, as the release of expected credit losses resulted in an improvement in the profitability of the Group and all global businesses. Our interest-rate sensitive business lines continued to be adversely impacted by low interest rates, but our net interest margin remained broadly stable during 2021 and the outlook is now significantly more positive. After absorbing the impact of low interest rates for some time, we believe we have turned the corner on revenue. We have also seen good fee income growth,\n\ngood growth in mortgage balances and our lending pipelines across both retail and wholesale remain strong. Our insurance business also continues to perform well, notably in Asia where we have seen strong growth in value of new business, despite the border between Hong Kong and mainland China remaining closed.\n\nAs a consequence, the Group delivered $18.9bn of reported profit before tax, up $10.1bn on the prior year, and $21.9bn of adjusted profits, up 79%. We were profitable in every region, with Asia leading the way and/uni00A0material increases in profits in the UK, continental Europe, the US and the Middle/uni00A0East.\n\nAdjusted revenue was down 3%, due mainly to the impact of interest rate cuts. However, trade balances grew by 23% overall, while loans and advances increased by $23bn for the year.\n\nOur cost reduction programmes were able to absorb increased technology investment and higher performance-related pay, with adjusted operating expenses down by 1%. Return on tangible equity was 8.3%. If rates follow the path currently implied by the market, we would expect to reach a return on tangible equity of at least 10% for 2023, one year ahead of our previous expectations.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we took a charge on expected credit losses, due to changing market conditions in the mainland China commercial real estate sector. Since the year end, there has been some positive sentiment as a consequence of new policy actions. They will take time to impact the market and we will continue to support our clients, with whom we have good and long-standing relationships.\n\nOur funding, liquidity and capital all remain strong. We grew deposits by $90bn on a constant currency basis, with growth in all three global businesses. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 15.8%. As a consequence, we/uni00A0are able to announce a second interim dividend of $0.18, bringing the full-year dividends for 2021 to $0.25 per ordinary share. This is within our target payout ratio, and our aim is for a sustainable dividend in 2022.",

We also intend to initiate a further share buy-back of up to $1bn, to commence after the existing buy-back of up to $2bn has concluded.\n\nWe are also helping to create sustainable returns for shareholders by driving underlying growth across the business. We have much more to do, but I am encouraged by what we have achieved so far.\n\n## Focus on our strengths\n\nWe have made good progress restructuring our portfolio of businesses, with the aim of investing in those areas in which we are strongest and withdrawing from those areas/uni00A0in/uni00A0which we lack the necessary scale to/uni00A0compete.\n\nOver the last two years, we reduced gross risk-weighted assets by a cumulative $104bn, against our original three-year target of $110bn. Given this progress, we now expect to/uni00A0exceed this target by the end of 2022. In Global Banking and Markets, adjusted risk-weighted assets were 10% lower in 2021, as we moved capital and resources mainly into Asia and the/uni00A0Middle East. The extensive work undertaken to transform this business since 2019 was also designed to mitigate the impact/uni00A0of Basel III reforms.\n\nWe reached two key milestones for our transformation as we took steps to resolve the/uni00A0future of our businesses in the US and continental Europe. In the US, we entered into/uni00A0an agreement to sell our mass market\n\nretail business, which has now been completed on schedule. We also entered into an agreement to sell our retail banking activities in France, which we expect to complete in 2023. Both deals will help our US and continental Europe businesses to become more focused, better aligned to the Group and the international needs of our wholesale and wealth management customers.\n\nIn Asia, we continued to enhance our wealth proposition, including through the launch of HSBC Greater Bay Area Connect and more than 30 new asset management products across the region. In December, we received regulatory approval to acquire the remaining 50% stake in HSBC Life China, our joint venture insurance company in mainland China. All of this is enabling us to significantly expand our capabilities to serve the growing wealth and insurance needs of our customers in China, particularly in the Greater Bay Area.\n\nWe accelerated the development of our wealth capabilities across the rest of Asia by several years through two acquisitions. We entered into an agreement to buy AXA Singapore, which was completed earlier this month and will expand our insurance and wealth franchise in our ASEAN regional hub. We also agreed to buy L&T Investment Management to/uni00A0strengthen our asset management business in India. Both deals represent significant steps towards our ambition of being a leading wealth manager in Asia.\n\nThe overall investment we have made in Asia wealth was evidenced by strong customer acquisition, and significantly increased assets and balances, year-on-year. Net new invested assets in Asia wealth were $36.2bn, which was more than double the previous year.\n\nIn Commercial Banking, we grew our lending by $11bn and our international account opening increased by 13% in 2021, while trade balances grew by 30% and are now above pre-pandemic levels.\n\n## Digitise at scale\n\nWe invested $6bn in technology in 2021, as/uni00A0we continued to drive change in the way we approach technology across the organisation and ultimately improve the customer experience.\n\nAround 97% of transactions are now fully automated. For example, automated credit and lending systems processed around $15bn\n\nof personal loans in 2021. Our use of the Cloud increased to cover 27% of technology services, giving us more processing power and speed, while we also increased our use of/uni00A0Agile across technology roles.\n\nAlmost half of our retail customers are now active on mobile, and we have developed new products and improved existing ones so we can better meet their needs. Our revamped mobile app is now available across 24 markets and Global Money was extended to more markets, allowing more of our international retail customers to hold, manage and send funds in various currencies. Corporate customers carried out over 9 million payments through the HSBCnet app - an increase of 58% year-on-year. HSBC Kinetic - our awardwinning mobile banking app for business customers in the UK - has acquired more than 24,000 customers since it was launched.\n\n## Energise for growth\n\nWe have taken further steps to create a dynamic and inclusive culture, which helps us/uni00A0to attract and retain the best people.\n\nAfter listening to our people, we introduced a hybrid working model, wherever appropriate, which allows us to strike the right balance between o/ffice-based work and home-based work. We have also taken the opportunity during Covid-19 to reconfigure much of our head o/ffice workspace to better facilitate team-based Agile working methods. We are still learning about what works, but we believe that trusting our colleagues to find the right balance is integral to building the culture we aspire to at HSBC. As a consequence of hybrid working, we will need less o/ffice space. In 2021, we reduced our global o/ffice footprint by/uni00A0more than 3.4 million square feet equivalent to 18%.\n\nWe were pleased to exceed our target for 30%/uni00A0women in leadership roles globally in 2020, and we set a new target of 35% by 2025. HSBC was named in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index last month, with our overall score increasing by 21 percentage points in 2021 and outperforming the financial services average by 15 percentage points. We/uni00A0also continued to work to improve ethnicity representation, especially for Black colleagues. However, we still have a way to go/uni00A0to get to where we want, and need, to be/uni00A0on both measures.",

I am determined that HSBC will play a leading role in driving this change.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, 99.7% of shareholders backed our special resolution on climate change, providing a strong endorsement of/uni00A0our climate plan and our commitment to support our customers on their transitions to a/uni00A0low-carbon future. However, we do not take this support for granted, and we have taken a/uni00A0number of further steps to maintain our leadership role.\n\nIn September, we partnered with Temasek, subject to regulatory approval, to launch a new debt financing fund for sustainable infrastructure in south-east Asia, with $150m of seed capital and the ambition to deploy $1bn of financing over five years.\n\nAt the COP26 meeting in Glasgow, HSBC was one of over 100 public and private organisations behind the launch of FAST-Infra, a labelling system that aims to increase investor confidence in the sustainability credentials of projects in emerging markets. We are also supporting the Energy Transition Mechanism, a public-private partnership led by the Asian Development Bank that aims for/uni00A0the materially earlier retirement of coal\n\nassets without hindering growth. HSBC was/uni00A0presented with the Terra Carta seal by HRH the Prince of Wales in recognition of the work that we are doing to create truly sustainable markets.\n\nAfter also joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance, we published a new thermal coal policy to phase out the financing of coal-fired power and thermal coal mining in EU and OECD markets by 2030, and globally by 2040. This fulfilled the commitment approved by our shareholders and followed a period of extensive engagement with our stakeholders. It has two clear objectives: to drive thermal coal phase-out within the timeframe required to reach net zero by 2050/uni003B and to help enable the energy transition in developing economies.\n\nWe are committed to working with our clients to develop valid, science-based transition plans to understand - sector-by-sector and client-by-client - how we will move to net zero by 2050. These transition plans and the targets within them must be predicated on the science relevant to the individual sectors. We/uni00A0will use them as a basis for further engagement and decision making, including how we drive change within our portfolios. As/uni00A0part of this process, we have disclosed interim targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions in the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. In the year ahead, we plan to set interim targets for financed emissions across a range of other sectors. We will also work on our climate transition plan, which will be published in 2023 and will bring together in/uni00A0one place how we will embed our net zero targets into our strategy, processes, policies and governance.\n\n## 2022\n\nWe have good momentum coming into 2022 and are confident that we can continue to execute against our strategy. We also remain cognisant of the potential impact that further Covid-19-related uncertainty and continued inflation might have on us and our clients.\n\nThroughout HSBC's history, our people have always demonstrated great professionalism and commitment to those we serve, and that is as evident today as it has ever been. Despite the personal and professional challenges they continue to face after two years of living with the pandemic, I am proud of my colleagues, and the sense of duty and care they continue to show towards our customers and each other. Our success - now and in the future - is testament to them and all they continue to do for our bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Noel Quinn\n\nGroup Chief Executive\n\n22 February 2022",

In Commercial Banking, we saw strong growth in fee income,\n\nand momentum in trade volumes. In Global Banking and Markets, we had strong countercyclical revenue even as we exceeded our expectations on RWA rundowns and client exits.

We saw strong progress across all parameters in 2021. While the proportion of fee and insurance income increased relative to 2020, reflecting fee and insurance revenue growth, this metric was also favourably impacted by lower net interest income due to 2020 interest rate reductions, as well as favourable market impacts in life insurance manufacturing.\n\n## Capital allocation and planned revenue concentration\n\n## Asia\n\n(as a % of Group tangible equity)/one.numerator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adjusted fees and insurance revenue\n\n(as a % of total adjusted revenue)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Based on tangible equity of the Group's major legal entities excluding associates, holding companies, and consolidation adjustments.\n- 2 WPB tangible equity as a share of tangible equity allocated to the global businesses (excluding Corporate Centre).

We grew our net new invested assets from $53bn in 2020 to $64bn, with $36bn coming from Asia, where we saw an increase of 138%. This contributed to a 5% increase in Wealth and Personal Banking wealth balances to $1.67tn, including 5% growth in Asset Management's funds under management to $630bn. In Asia, Wealth and Personal Banking wealth revenue - which comprises wealth, insurance, private banking, and asset management - grew by 10% to $5.8bn. This included a 40% growth in value of new business in insurance to $917m. We continued to enhance our wealth product o/fferings in the region, including launching Greater Bay Area Wealth Management Connect, and over 30 new asset management products. Globally, Wealth and Personal Banking customer lending balances were $489bn, an increase of 6% compared with 2020, notably reflecting mortgage balance growth across all regions, but particularly in the UK and Hong Kong.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $64bn\n\nNet new invested assets in 2021.\n\n## Repositioning for growth\n\nWe are repositioning our portfolio to support our areas of growth.\n\n## Restructuring the US and Europe\n\nWe aim to create capacity for growth by refocusing our US business and HSBC Bank plc, our non-ring-fenced bank in Europe and the UK. In May and June respectively, we announced the exit of mass market retail in the US, and the planned sale of our retail operations in France. Our plan to exit our US mass market retail banking business was completed in February 2022, which includes approximately $8.8bn of deposits held for sale and exiting and winding down approximately 125 branches, leaving us with approximately 25 international wealth centres. The planned sale of our France retail business includes a network (using values at 31 December 2021) of 244 retail branches, approximately 800,000 customers, $24.9bn in customer loans and $22.6bn in deposits balances.\n\nWe also made strong progress in 2021 on reducing the capital and cost base in the two/uni00A0franchises. During the year, adjusted RWAs decreased $7bn in the US to $78bn at 31 December 2021, while in HSBC Bank plc, they decreased by $22bn to $141bn. The respective balances at 31 December 2021 included approximately $1.3bn relating to the announced US mass market retail disposal and approximately $7bn relating to the planned disposal of our France retail business. We also lowered the adjusted cost base in these franchises by 5% compared with 2020 to $10.4bn, in spite of strong inflationary pressures in these markets.\n\n## Repositioning Asia for growth\n\nWe announced three key acquisitions in 2021 to further strengthen our wealth franchise in Asia. In August, we entered an agreement to\n\n## Global Banking and Markets\n\nWe repositioned our capital and resources in Global Banking and Markets to create capacity for growth opportunities, mainly into Asia and the Middle East, and to serve international clients that are aligned to our strategy. As part of our transformation programme, we reduced adjusted RWAs by approximately 10% to $236bn at 31 December 2021, driven by saves in our Western franchise, comprising our Europe and Americas businesses. Despite the focus on repositioning, the business performed well in 2021, with overall revenue reaching approximately $15bn, driven by strong performances in Equities, Capital Markets and Advisory and Securities Services. Collaboration with other businesses through cross-selling products remains important for us. In 2021, the business facilitated $2.5bn into Commercial Banking, an increase of 12% compared with 2020, and $1.4bn into Wealth and Personal Banking, an increase of 2%.\n\n## 18%\n\nAdjusted RWA reduction in the West in 2021.\n\nacquire AXA Singapore for $529m, with the intention to merge the business with the operations of our existing HSBC Life Singapore franchise. The acquisition was recently completed on 11 February 2022. The combined business would be the seventh largest life insurer in Singapore, based on annualised new premiums, and the fourth largest retail health insurer, based on gross premiums, with over 600,000 policies in-force, data as of end of 2020. In December, we announced the agreement to fully acquire L&T/uni00A0Investment Management, the 12th largest mutual fund management company in India with assets under management of $10.8bn and over 2.4 million portfolios as of September 2021. We also received regulatory approval to acquire the remaining 50% stake in HSBC Life China, bringing our shareholder ownership to 100% upon completion.\n\n## Commercial Banking\n\nOur Commercial Banking business continued to grow our lending pipeline and maintain leadership in supporting cross-border trade. Customer lending volume increased 3% to $349bn in 2021, mainly from continued growth in trade and term lending. The recovery in global trade volumes was also reflected in higher fee income in Global Trade and Receivables Finance, where we saw a 9% revenue growth compared with 2020. Over the same period, fee income in the overall Commercial Banking business also grew 9%,/uni00A0reaching approximately $3.6bn and surpassing pre-pandemic levels in 2019. We/uni00A0also committed to investing in global platforms and improving SME propositions in/uni00A0our key markets.

In 2021, we reduced our organisation's absolute greenhouse gas emissions in our operations to 341,000 tonnes, a decrease of 50.3% from the 2019 baseline (the data for 2019 and 2020 has been revised as we have updated our air travel reporting methodology to include the cabin class travel and the impact of radiative forces, and therefore, the percentage change from 2019 baseline is based on the revised methodology). In December, we published\n\nworkforce to help equip our colleagues for the/uni00A0future of work. At the end of 2021, 15% of/uni00A0our total technology workforce in the global/uni00A0businesses and functions were aligned to at least one agile team per agile blueprint. This marks a significant improvement from 5%/uni00A0in/uni00A02020.\n\nOur digital engagement with customers also improved. At the end of 2021, 43% of our customers active on our mobile services had logged onto a HSBC mobile app at least once in the last 30 days, compared with 38% in 2020. Our wholesale clients executed over 9/uni00A0million payments on HSBCnet's mobile banking app, a 58% increase compared with 2020.

We are on track to meet our/uni00A0ambition of having more than 35% representation of women in these roles by/uni00A02025.\n\nWe continue to energise our colleagues through initiatives that help develop their future skills and learning opportunities, especially in areas including data, digital and sustainability.

In 2021, we provided and facilitated $82.6bn of sustainable finance and investment, taking the cumulative amount to/uni00A0$126.7bn since 1 January 2020, as part of our $750bn to $1tn by 2030 ambition. This comprised support including facilitation of capital flow and access to capital markets for/uni00A0sustainability-linked outcomes, as well as financing and investments in environmental and social goals such as decarbonisation of energy systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe outline how we put our purpose and values into practice in the following 'How we do business' section.

In September, we launched a new debt financing fund for sustainable infrastructure in southeast Asia in partnership (subject to regulatory approval) with Temasek, with $150m of seed capital and the ambition to deploy $1bn of financing over five years. We are leading the FAST-Infra initiative, which we co-founded to/uni00A0establish a consistent, globally applicable labelling system to identify and evaluate sustainable infrastructure assets. We are also supporting the Energy Transition Mechanism, a public-private partnership led by the Asian Development Bank, which endeavours to accelerate the retirement of coal-fired power stations and increase demand and investments in renewable energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on our climate ambition, see the Environmental section in the ESG review on/uni00A0page 45.\n\ndigitally for HSBCnet grew from 83% to 94% in the 18 Asian markets where HSBCnet is available for wholesale clients.

On the following page, we have set out/uni00A0further ways that we continued to support our stakeholders.\n\n## Fair outcomes\n\nOur conduct approach guides us to do the right thing and to focus on the impact we have for our customers and the financial markets in which we operate. It complements our purpose and values and - together with more formal policies and the tools we have to do our jobs - provides a clear path to achieving our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npurpose and delivering our strategy. For further information on conduct, see page 83. For further details on our purpose-led conduct approach framework, see www.hsbc.com/ who-we-are.\n\n## Our colleagues\n\nUnderstanding the experience of colleagues is/uni00A0central to our e/fforts to open up a world of opportunity. Through our employee survey, Snapshot, we capture their views on issues from our strategy to their well-being to the future of work. These views will guide our approach as we embrace hybrid working.\n\nWe value di/fference among our colleagues, which is why we continue to build an inclusive workforce. Having surpassed our 2020 target to reach 30% women in senior leadership roles - classified as those at band 3 and above in our global career band structure - we have made strong progress towards our goal to achieve 35% by 2025, with 31.7% achieved in/uni00A02021.\n\nWe expanded the ability for our colleagues to share their diversity characteristics, with over 70% now able to self-identify their ethnic heritage, gender identity, disability and sexual orientation. This will help us to set locally appropriate goals, reflective of our markets. In/uni00A0July 2020, we set out our early global race commitments, which included the goal of doubling the number of Black employees in senior roles over the following five years. In 2021, we put in place important foundations to/uni00A0achieve this goal.\n\nDeveloping the skills of colleagues is critical to/uni00A0energising our organisation. We foster a culture of learning through a range of resources, providing colleagues with a breadth of educational materials and opportunities.\n\nAs we continue to reshape the organisation, we are committed to managing change well, and redeploying impacted colleagues. In 2021, 23% of colleagues impacted through restructuring programmes found new jobs within HSBC.\n\n## Our climate ambition\n\nWe have set a climate ambition to become net zero in our operations and our supply chain by 2030, and align our financed emissions to the Paris Agreement goal of net zero by 2050. We have set on-balance sheet financed emissions targets for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors, aligned to the International Energy Agency's ('IEA') net zero scenario, underpinned by a clear science-based strategy. To support our goal of net zero financed emissions, it will be crucial to unlock transition finance for our portfolio of clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our ESG disclosures, see our/uni00A0ESG review on page 42.\n\n## Update on our purpose and values\n\nWe relaunched our purpose in March 2021. We have been pleased to see how quickly our colleagues have embraced 'Opening up a world of opportunity' as our purpose, and how they are delivering against it. You can find some examples from 2021 below. We/uni00A0have enabled the recognition of colleagues who have lived up to our values,/uni00A0and there have been over 600,000 recognitions made in 2021.\n\n- - We helped 268,771 people buy their first home, lending $92.9bn in mortgages.\n- - We provided $47bn in loans to our business banking customers to help support, grow, internationalise and digitise their businesses.\n- - We facilitated $799bn of trade globally to/uni00A0help economies grow and prosper.\n- - We supported over 270,000 students move internationally to study by providing key financial products including account openings, fund transfer and day-to-day finance management in their new countries.\n- - Over 115,000 colleagues made use of our/uni00A0new learning platform, Degreed, during 2021.\n- - We enabled over 30,000 colleagues to progress their careers at the Group by helping them move into new roles.",

The support we provide is driven by the feedback from our people surveys. In 2021, we launched new tools and training to support mental, physical and financial health. We are also enabling more colleagues to work flexibly and continue to follow social\n\n## Our COP26 actions\n\nCOP26, the UN climate change conference held in Glasgow, Scotland, in November, was a critical moment for the financial sector, including HSBC, to demonstrate how we are helping to accelerate the transition to net zero. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which we are part of, announced potentially transformative measures for the sector, including setting short-term science-based targets, annual reporting of progress, embedding climate risk management into businesses, and mobilising transition finance for emerging and developing countries.\n\nOur delegation, including our Group Chief Sustainability O/fficer, Celine Herweijer (pictured here at COP26) was involved in\n\ndistancing and protection measures in line with local guidance.

We believe our most significant contribution will be to align our financed emissions to the Paris Agreement goal to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner. The Paris Agreement aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, above pre-industrial levels. To limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C, the global economy would need to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\nIn May 2021, a climate change resolution proposed by the Board was backed by more than 99% of our shareholders at our AGM. The/uni00A0resolution included a commitment to set out the next steps in our transition to net zero,/uni00A0including setting sector-based targets, publishing a thermal coal phase-out policy and reporting annually on our progress. We also\n\n## Ambition\n\n## Metrics and indicators\n\nProgress to date\n\nindicated that we would provide further details on our approach to assessing financed emissions by the end of 2021.\n\nWe have set on-balance sheet financed emissions 2030 targets for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors, focusing on the companies within these sectors which we believe account for the majority of emissions in the sector. For further details including scope, methodology, assumptions and limitations, see page 47.\n\nWe continue to track our progress against our ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030, aligned to our published data dictionary, and our transformation to a net zero bank by reducing our operations and our supply chain emissions to net zero by 2030.\n\nIn the year ahead we plan to set interim targets for financed emissions across a wide range of sectors, alongside a broad transformation programme to embed the climate transition into our core business and risk processes. We/uni00A0will also begin work on our climate transition plan, which will bring together in/uni00A0one place - how we plan to embed our net zero targets into the Group's strategy, processes, policies and governance. We plan to publish this in 2023, and update on progress annually thereafter.\n\nWe know this is a journey and recognise that certain metrics and targets may need to be revised as a result of changes or developments in methodology, climate science and improvements in data quality.

        "page_content": "## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD')\n\nThe Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') recommendations set an important framework for understanding and analysing climaterelated risks, and we are committed to regular, transparent reporting to help communicate and track our progress. We will advocate the same from our customers, suppliers and the industry. We recognise that further work lies ahead as we develop our management and metrics capabilities.\n\nThe information set out on page 63 in this Annual Report and Accounts 2021 aims to provide key climate-related information and cross-references to where additional information can be found. In this context, we/uni00A0have considered our 'comply or explain' obligation under the UK's Financial Conduct Authority's Listing Rules, and confirm that we have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures in this Annual Report and Accounts 2021 save for certain items, which we summarise below and describe in more detail in the information set out on page 63 and in the additional information section on/uni00A0page 402.\n\nThere are certain areas where we have not included climate-related disclosures, a summary of these are set out below:\n\n- - We do not fully disclose impacts on financial/uni00A0planning and performance (including proportions of revenue, costs and/uni00A0balance sheet related to climate-related opportunities), quantitative scenario analysis, detailed climate risk exposures for all sectors and geographies or physical risk metrics. This is due to transitional challenges in relation to data limitations. We expect these data limitations to be addressed in the/uni00A0medium term as more reliable data becomes available and technology solutions/uni00A0are implemented.\n- - We currently disclose partial scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. In relation to on-balance sheet financed emissions, we are disclosing our scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for oil and gas, and the power and utilities sectors. Future disclosure on scope 3 financed emissions (customers) and supply chain emissions (suppliers), as well as related risks is reliant on both our customers and suppliers publicly disclosing their carbon emissions and related risks. We/uni00A0aim to disclose financed emissions for additional sectors by 2023, as set out in our/uni00A0Financed Emissions - Approach and Methodology Update published in December 2021, which can be found at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/esg-reporting-centre.\n- - Given that climate scenarios are mainly focused on medium- to long-term horizons, rather than short-term, we have set interim 2030 targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions for the oil and gas and power and utilities sectors. HSBC intends to review the financed emissions baseline and targets annually, where relevant, to help ensure that they are aligned with market practice and current climate science.\n\n## Supporting renewable projects through our operations\n\nWe are expanding our e/fforts to bring additional renewable electricity in the markets where we operate, as part of our ambition to source 100% renewable power across our operations by 2030. In September 2021, we signed a power purchase agreement that supported the development of the Sorbie Wind Farm project in Ayrshire, south-west of Glasgow. This agreement will create a new renewable electricity source that will benefit us, as well as our customers and the wider communities we serve.\n\nThis power purchase agreement will be our fourth project in the UK, supporting wind or solar projects, and will result in approximately 90% of our UK electricity being sourced from such/uni00A0renewable projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leading on an inaugural green bond\n\nWe were joint lead manager and bookrunner as Arab Petroleum Investments Corporation ('APICORP') in September 2021 raised $750m with its inaugural green bond. The multilateral development bank, founded in 1975 by the 10 Arab oil-exporting countries, has a strategic focus to promote the energy sector within the region to a more sustainable future. As set out in its green bond framework, APICORP will use the proceeds to finance or invest in projects focused on renewable energy, pollution prevention and control, and green buildings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this section, we outline our requirements under the NonFinancial Reporting Directive.\n\n## Employee matters\n\nWe are opening up a world of opportunity for our colleagues through building an inclusive organisation that values di/fference, takes responsibility, and seeks di/fferent perspectives for the overall benefit of our customers.\n\nWe want to encourage a dynamic culture where our colleagues can expect to be treated with dignity and respect. We are an organisation that takes action where we find behaviours that fall short of this aspiration. We monitor our progress through metrics that we value and have benchmarked against peers.\n\nListening to our colleagues is critical to the business we conduct, and is reflected in our purpose and values, which were established through the largest employee engagement programme in our history.\n\nWe continue to seek innovative ways that encourage and provide opportunities for our people to speak up. We recognise that at times people may not feel comfortable speaking up through the usual channels. HSBC Confidential is our global whistleblowing channel, allowing our colleagues past and present to raise concerns confidentially and, if preferred, anonymously (subject to local laws).\n\nHaving surpassed our 2020 target to reach 30% women in senior leadership roles (classified as those at band 3 and above in our global career band structure), we aim to reach 35% by 2025, with 31.7% achieved in 2021.\n\nIn July 2020, we set out our early global race commitments, which included the goal of doubling the number of Black employees in senior roles over the next five years. To support our ambition, we have placed a strong focus on enhancing the quality and transparency of our ethnicity data through the expansion of our\n\nself-identification capability. We will use this data to develop market-specific goals that are connected to the communities we serve. While we know we need to do more, we have put in place important foundations in 2021 through leadership development, inclusive hiring practices and investing in the next generation of high-performing, diverse talent.\n\nThe table below outlines high-level diversity metrics.\n\n## All employees\n\n| Male                | 48%   |\n|---------------------|-------|\n| Female              | 52%   |\n| Senior leadership 1 |       |\n| Male                | 68%   |\n| Female              | 32%   |\n| Directors           |       |\n| Male                | 62%   |\n| Female              | 38%   |\n\n- 1  Senior leadership is classified as those at band 3 and above in our global career band structure\n- For further details on how we look after our people, including our diversity targets, transformation employee metrics and how we encourage our employees to speak up, see the Employees section of the ESG review on page 70.\n\n## Social matters\n\nWe have a responsibility to invest in the long-term prosperity of the communities where we operate. We recognise that technology is developing at a rapid pace and that a range of new and di/fferent skills are now needed to succeed in the workplace. For this reason, much of our focus is on programmes that develop employability and financial capability. We also back climate solutions and innovation, and contribute to disaster relief based on need. For further details of our programmes see 'Communities' on page 77.\n\n## Engaging colleagues in future skills\n\nOur colleagues have explored digital, data, sustainability and personal skills as part of our 'Future Skills' campaign. Colleagues engaged with various tools, assessments and industry experts over 44,000 times throughout the campaign, and learned how these skills are critical for the future of our organisation. Colleagues identified specific skills they wanted to develop and assessed them through our skills platform to shape their development plan.\n\nWe helped a number of colleagues to share their own skills with others through our partnership with Ashoka. In 2021 we launched the global Green Skills Innovation Challenge to support innovations that connect people with the skills to support a green transition. Out of 340 submissions, 12 winners were selected, each receiving a prize of up to $20,000 alongside support and mentoring from HSBC colleagues.\n\n## Human rights\n\nOur commitment to respecting human rights, principally as they apply to our employees, our suppliers and through our financial services lending, is set out in our Statement on Human Rights. This statement, along with our statements under the UK's Modern Slavery Act, is available on www.hsbc.com/who-weare/esg-and-responsible-business/esgreporting-centre.\n\n## Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\n\nWe require compliance with all applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws in all markets and jurisdictions in which we operate. These include the UK Bribery Act, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Hong Kong Prevention of Bribery Ordinance and France's 'Sapin II' law. We have a global anti-bribery and corruption policy, which gives practical e/ffect to these laws and regulations, but also requires compliance with the spirit of laws and regulations to demonstrate our commitment to ethical behaviours and conduct as part of our environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\n## Environmental matters\n\nFor details of our climate ambition and carbon/uni00A0emission metrics, see the ESG review on/uni00A0page 45.\n\n## Non-financial information statement\n\nThis section primarily covers our nonfinancial information as required by the regulations. Other related information can be found as follows:\n\n- For further details on our key performance indicators, see page 1.\n- For further details on our business model, see page 4.\n- For further details on our principal risks and how they are managed, see pages 37 to 40.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It describes how the Directors have performed their duty to promote the success of the company, including how they have considered and engaged with stakeholders and, in particular, how they have taken account of the matters set out in section 172(1)(a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement and key considerations for the Board\n\nThe Group continued to focus on its engagement with our key stakeholders, acknowledging that this engagement is core to being a responsible business. Our key stakeholders remain the same as last year, namely our customers, employees, investors, communities, regulators and governments, and suppliers. How the Group has engaged with our stakeholders more generally is explained on page 16. The Board recognises the importance of building strong relationships with our stakeholders to help broaden understanding of their needs and concerns and ultimately to help us deliver our strategy. In discharging its responsibilities, the Directors sought to understand, and have regard to, the interests and priorities of these stakeholders, including in relation to material decisions that were taken by the Board during the course of/uni00A0the year.\n\n## Virtual and physical meetings\n\nDuring 2021, despite the ongoing logistical challenges of meeting physically as a result of/uni00A0the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board was determined to maintain an active engagement programme with as many stakeholders as possible. The move to virtual meetings presented new and e/ffective opportunities to/uni00A0engage. The Board met virtually with one of/uni00A0our major suppliers of technology services on the US west coast, which provided insights/uni00A0into technological advances and the growing importance of data/uni00A0management and security. During this meeting, the participants shared their respective views on the net zero transition journey, and the Board was able to/uni00A0gain a clear/uni00A0understanding of the supplier's/uni00A0plans.\n\nSeveral Board members were also able to connect with our global graduate community on occasion, thanks to virtual facilities. Meeting in this way meant a far broader set of views was able to be shared than if the\n\nmeeting had been in person. The exchanges with the graduates gave the Directors a real appreciation of the challenges they had faced in joining and working for HSBC during lockdown conditions.\n\nAs part of the engagement programme during/uni00A0the year, the Board continued to meet directly with many of its other stakeholders, in/uni00A0particular our colleagues, regulators and investors. It was also kept informed of relevant stakeholder matters through management dialogue and reports. Where circumstances permitted, Board members gathered for stakeholder meetings in person, including at/uni00A0our o/ffices in the UK and Hong Kong, with/uni00A0examples of these engagements detailed/uni00A0below.\n\nIn May 2021, HSBC was pleased to be able to host its first hybrid AGM and engage with its investors despite the challenges at the time. Following focused discussions, the Board committed to creating an opportunity to enable as much shareholder participation as possible. This event allowed shareholders to either physically attend the meeting under strict and safe conditions in line with the advice from the UK Government, or to attend virtually, together with all Board members who attended either physically or virtually. The virtual participation option o/ffered through the hybrid solution allowed shareholders to ask questions of the Board in person, by telephone and online, as well as vote live by electronic means during the meeting. While restrictions meant, regrettably, it was not possible to hold the annual Informal Shareholders' Meeting in Hong Kong, the hybrid AGM helped facilitate the connection of our Hong Kong-based shareholders directly to the Board. Given the success of the hybrid approach, we intend to host hybrid AGM meetings in the future.\n\n## Engaging during the Covid-19 pandemic\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic continued to underpin the need to ensure careful consideration of the\n\ninterests of the Group's stakeholders. Throughout the year, the Board maintained close interaction with management on its plans for a gradual return to o/ffice working under safe conditions, and careful consideration was given to our support for colleagues' mental and physical well-being. Care was taken to include the views and opinions of our colleagues in developing new ways of working, including hybrid working solutions where appropriate. By engaging with/uni00A0colleagues, including graduates, the Board was able to discuss and reflect, both in/uni00A0and outside of the boardroom, on the learnings gained from such sessions, including on how to improve induction and ongoing employee support programmes. It was also able to give its support to management to continue these initiatives.\n\n## Doing business responsibly\n\nGiven the nature of our business, maintaining a transparent and trusting relationship with our/uni00A0regulators is key to helping to ensure that we do business responsibly and that we can respond to all challenges appropriately. The/uni00A0Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive met with our regulators in the UK and Hong Kong on a regular basis. As part of such meetings, our regulators were kept updated on our strategic plans and progress. On certain occasions, the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive also met with government o/fficials globally to foster good relations. Several Board members were - and continue to be - actively involved in climate initiatives and attend global events such as at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow. The Board also remained informed of management interaction with national governments, on matters such as forbearance schemes and climate matters.",

This regular reporting and an annual programme of learning served to inform the Board about stakeholder matters and supported its decision making. For further details on the Board's activities during the year, including training, see pages 229 to 234. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group and our stakeholders remained of material concern. The impact of the decision taken in 2020 to cancel the fourth interim dividend for 2019 and suspend dividends for 2020 was a key consideration when the Board was deliberating on its approach to distributions for 2021. The Board sought to balance emerging risks, performance and its duties to shareholders, while remaining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nOur business is centred around our customers and clients. The greater the understanding we have of their needs and the challenges they face, the better we can help support them to achieve their financial aims and succeed in our purpose and strategy.

The net promoter score is a key measurement of customer sentiment, satisfaction and areas of concern and improvement.\n- - Following an enhancement to digital chat/uni00A0services for customers in Bermuda, the/uni00A0Board requested feedback from customers gained through a satisfaction survey and real-time customer prompts to help shape improvements in automation across the Group.\n\nconscious of its responsibilities to support communities and help customers manage financial challenges and changing demands. The 'Principal decisions' disclosure below includes details on how the Board took the decision to introduce dividend payments in 2021. Further details are also provided in 'Financial decisions' on page 232 and 'Dividends' on page 287.\n\nTo educate the Board on the broader impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Board invited a leading immunologist to its meeting in December. Through this engagement, the Board gained valuable independent insight into what assistance may be required globally in support of the recovery to our communities, customers, suppliers and employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employees\n\nWe want our organisation to continue to be a positive place to work and build careers. The success of the Group's strategy is dependent upon having motivated people with the expertise and skills required to help deliver it. Examples of the Board's engagement with our employees in 2021 included:\n\n- - Our Directors partnered with each of our employee resource groups, supporting and attending employee resource group events. These included sessions covering diversity, inclusion, disability, ethnicity and gender, the pandemic, climate, purpose and values, and culture. Following these events, the Board, in its formal meetings, discussed its learnings and where further support could be o/ffered.\n- - Twice a year, the Board discussed the results of Snapshot surveys, which provide employee feedback, and which in 2021 focused on home working, culture, behaviours and pay.\n- - The Group Chairman visited Hong Kong in July and August, where he met with local leadership and took time to hear from a group of over 500 employees.\n- - The Group Chief Executive reported to the Board on his engagement with colleagues, including discussions about the return to the o/ffice, culture, new joiners, purpose and values, female leadership and graduate induction. His engagements also included virtual exchange sessions and town halls with employees globally, and in person in Singapore and the US.\n- - The Group Chief Risk and Compliance O/fficer provided a weekly Board note on risk/uni00A0matters relating to our response to the/uni00A0Covid-19 pandemic and employee support initiatives.\n\n## Adapting our engagement programme\n\nAs restrictions are lifted, and when safe to do/uni00A0so, the Board intends to meet regularly in/uni00A0person both as a Board, and with our stakeholders globally. In the meantime, the Board continues to remain agile in adapting its/uni00A0ongoing engagement programme so that it/uni00A0continues to be informed by a broad range of activities with stakeholders. This helps the Board fulfil its duties and support decision making as it oversees the execution of the Group strategy in line with our purpose and values and strategic plans.

Examples of the Board's engagement with communities in 2021 included:\n\n- - The Board received ESG and climate-related updates and policies, which detailed community engagement activity and stakeholder sentiment.\n- - The Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive both participated at COP26, and the Group Chairman presented at Chapter Zero events.\n- - The Group Chief Executive supported the/uni00A0World Economic Forum's disclosures on/uni00A0climate.\n- - The Board supported employee resource group community initiatives, such as introducing 'safe places' in selected HSBC branches for the whole community as needed, and education in schools and universities on topics such as technology and climate.\n- - A leading immunologist provided an update to the Board on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, providing insight into what assistance may be required from HSBC to our communities, customers and employees.\n\n## Regulators and governments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaintaining constructive dialogue and relations with the relevant authorities in the markets in which we operate helps support the e/ffective functioning of economies globally and the achievement of our strategic aims. Examples of the Board's engagement with regulators and governments in 2021 included:\n\n- - Executive and non-executive Directors attended 'continuous assessment' meetings with the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and other individual regulatory meetings.\n- - The PRA attended a Board meeting for its annual presentation to discuss the outcome and progress of its periodic summary meeting letter, and in a separate meeting, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') attended to present its annual firm evaluation letter.\n- - The Group Chairman led a meeting with the/uni00A0supervisory college of regulators.\n- - Directors held regular dialogue and meetings with governments and regulators globally, with some representing HSBC at government-led forums.\n- - The Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive both participated at the G7 Climate conference and COP26.\n\n## Principal decisions\n\nThe Board operates having regard to the duties of the Directors, including the relevant matters set out in section 172(1)(a)-(f) of the Companies Act 2006. Specific examples of key areas of focus and considerations a/ffecting the Board's decision-making process during 2021 are set out below.\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals activity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2021, the Board took several key decisions to acquire and divest certain businesses in support of the Group's strategic aims.\n\nIn furtherance of the Group's strategy and ambition, the Board considered several material and strategic acquisition and disposal opportunities throughout 2021. Two of these opportunities considered by the Board are highlighted below. In each case, in discussing these proposals and taking its decisions, members of the Board exercised their statutory duties including the duty to act in the way that they considered, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole.\n\nThe first strategic acquisition opportunity the Board considered in 2021 concerned the purchase of AXA's insurance business in Singapore. In its meeting, the Board discussed that this was a rare opportunity for inorganic growth and a key step in helping to achieve the Group's ambition of becoming a leading wealth manager in Asia, by expanding its insurance and wealth franchise in Singapore, a strategically important scale market and a major hub\n\nfor the Group's wealth business in the ASEAN region. The Board considered a number of benefits in making this investment, including synergies with the Group's asset management and private wealth solutions business, and the ability to materially scale up the Group's presence in the regional insurance market, providing an excellent platform for future growth and further opportunities for customers. The proposed acquisition was subject to a combination of discussions with and approvals from various stakeholders, including UK, Singapore and Hong Kong regulators as well as pre-notifications to local union authorities. In order to support successful integration and transformation plans, management recommended to the Board that key employee talent should be identified and secured. As part of this key talent selection process, certain important skills and qualities were taken into account, including diversity and inclusion, as well as culture, to form the right leadership team for the acquired business to succeed. In making its final decision to approve the acquisition, the Board took these relevant stakeholder considerations and other factors into account, including an assessment of the financial merits and risks of the transaction, and paid particular attention to the section 172 factors of the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and the interests of the Group's employees.\n\nThe Board subsequently considered a separate proposal for the disposal of the Group's non-core retail banking business in France. The Board's\n\ndecision to/uni00A0approve the disposal was aligned to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group's strategic aim of being a leading wholesale bank in continental Europe, and took into/uni00A0account the impact on our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nIn this case, the Board considered there to be a number of benefits to the disposal, including simplifying the Group structure, helping to mitigate transformation risk of the business in Europe, and allowing management to focus on the completion of the European wholesale transformation programme. Several key stakeholders were consulted ahead of the decision. Consultation with relevant French works' councils was undertaken alongside Director and management engagement with French and UK regulators to elicit their views on the proposed disposal. The Board noted that completion of the disposal would involve engagement with additional key stakeholders, including relevant regulators and bondholders. In taking its decision, the Board considered all relevant factors including the Group's strategic goals and the benefits of the transaction, while also taking into account the loss associated with the disposal, the interests of stakeholders and alternative proposals in respect of the retail business. As a result, the Board agreed to proceed with the disposal on the basis that it considered it to be in the/uni00A0best interests of the company's members as a/uni00A0whole and would promote the long-term success of/uni00A0the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Suppliers\n\nOur suppliers provide the Group with vital resources, expertise and services to help us operate our business e/ffectively and execute our strategy. We work with our suppliers to help ensure mutually beneficial relationships on a global and local level. In some cases, our suppliers are also our customers. Plans have been made to meet with more third-party providers of services once travel can safely resume. Examples of the Board's engagement with suppliers in 2021 included:\n\n- - The Group Chief Operating O/fficer provided/uni00A0reports to the Board, with updates/uni00A0on third-party suppliers and operational resilience.\n- - Directors held a virtual meeting with one of/uni00A0our key technology suppliers to discuss technology developments and improvements and to better understand the/uni00A0supplier's net zero ambition and transition plans.\n- - The Group Audit Committee Chair met with/uni00A0the four major accountancy firms and challenger audit firms in preparation for a/uni00A0future audit tender.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## Principal decisions continued\n\nClimate agenda\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021 the Board was actively and directly engaged with the Group's response to the climate change agenda, proposing a resolution and agreeing relevant policies aligned to our ambition to support the transition to a net zero global economy.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the Group's climate ambition in October 2020 and ahead of the 2021 AGM, the Board received a shareholder requisitioned resolution from ShareAction, together with a number of other shareholders, in relation to the Group's climate agenda. Selected Board members and senior management engaged extensively with ShareAction, certain co-filers and other shareholders, to understand their perspectives and rationale in submitting the shareholder resolution. As a result of/uni00A0such engagements, the Board carried out further discussions in its meetings to consider our approach in terms of sectorial priorities and associated timelines, in order to help support the delivery of our climate ambition most e/ffectively, while recognising our responsibilities to our customers and communities across the diverse range of markets in/uni00A0which we operate. Ultimately, following further engagement and discussion, the Board welcomed and agreed the decision by ShareAction, on behalf of/uni00A0the co-filers, to withdraw the requisitioned resolution and in its place, support HSBC's own climate change resolution at the 2021 AGM. The HSBC resolution outlined the next phase of the Group's net zero strategy, with a particular emphasis on how it would support its customers on their own transition journeys. As well as the engagement with\n\n## Dividend payments and share buy-backs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing the decision in 2020 to cancel dividend payments, the Board took action in 2021 to consider dividend payments, the Group's dividend policy and share buy-backs.\n\nFollowing the PRA's announcement in December 2020 that it was supportive of UK banks resuming dividend payments under certain conditions, at its first meeting in January 2021 the Board turned its attention to whether it would be appropriate to restart dividend payments. In considering this, the Board reflected on the impact on the decision it took in 2020 to suspend dividend payments and the views of stakeholders in respect of the suspension. The reactions and interests of our investors based on feedback from our external brokers and meetings with investors by individual Board members and management were key considerations for the Board in/uni00A0considering whether to restart dividend payments, especially given the impact of this decision on our shareholders, including those based in Hong Kong, who rely heavily on the income derived from our dividends. The Board also had regard to regulatory considerations, including the PRA's requirements for banks resuming dividends and other relevant factors such as our financial performance for 2020 and our earnings forecasts for 2021 and 2022. Having\n\nstakeholders, in formulating the Group's climate approach including its climate change resolution, the/uni00A0Board took into consideration the role we seek to/uni00A0play in setting and leading a standard for the financial services sector, as it collectively works to tackle climate change. The Board was also mindful of the crucial importance of working with customers on their own transition and how the Group could help support this outcome. The Board's decision to propose the HSBC climate change resolution and recommendation that shareholders vote in favour of it took account of these reasons, and gave due regard to section 172 factors, in particular the impact of the decision on the environment and communities the company serves, our valuable relationships with customers and investors, and the long-term success of the company.\n\nThe climate change resolution was passed at the 2021 AGM, with 99.7% of our shareholders supporting our resolution, providing a strong endorsement of our climate plan and our commitment to support our customers on their transitions to a low-carbon future. The resolution committed us to: setting out the next steps in our transition, including through short- and mediumterm sector-based targets/uni003B publishing a policy to phase out the financing of coal power and thermal coal mining by 2030 in EU and OECD countries, and by 2040 globally/uni003B and reporting annually on our progress. We also indicated that we would provide further details by the end of 2021 on our approach to/uni00A0assessing financed emissions and setting targets.\n\nIn December 2021 the Board approved the publication of the thermal coal phase-out policy, and further details on our approach to assessing financed emissions and setting targets. In doing so the Board took into consideration the requirements of the climate resolution and the extensive engagement with stakeholders, both before and after the 2021\n\nconsidered these factors and also taking into account its section 172 duty to consider the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, in its/uni00A0February meeting, the Board was pleased to approve an interim dividend for the full-year ending 2020. In that same meeting, the Board considered and approved a revised dividend policy designed to provide sustainable dividends. In considering the revised dividend policy, the Board discussed and acknowledged the need to o/ffer good income to our investors while giving management the flexibility to reinvest capital to grow the firm. These factors are important to the long-term success of the company. During the year, engagement continued with the PRA for dividends in respect of the 2021 financial year. In August 2021, the Board also agreed to approve an interim dividend for the first six months of 2021 in line with the dividend policy, taking into account the Group's performance, market expectations and the shareholders' interests.\n\nIn addition, having indicated in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020 that the Group would consider share buy-backs over time, in October 2021 the Board approved the announcement of a share buy-back of up to $2bn. In reaching this decision, the/uni00A0Board considered our actual and potential financial performance during the year to date and our capital position (including in light of regulatory requirements). The Board also considered expected reactions and interests of our investors (including based on feedback from our external brokers) and peer analysis. Regulatory approvals were sought in\n\nAGM. In Board meeting discussions, Directors considered long-term objectives including the responsibility of helping to ensure continued and expanding access to a/ffordable electricity in the markets we serve, many of which are presently highly reliant on thermal coal. The Board also considered the need to phase out the financing of/uni00A0coal-fired power and thermal coal mining in recognition of the rapid decline in coal emissions required for any viable pathway to 1.5\u02daC and the important role for HSBC to play in helping to finance our clients' transition to net zero. The Board noted that the policy was a key part of executing the Group's ambition to align its financed emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner and would be reviewed annually based on evolving science and internationally recognised guidance, given the fast changing landscape. For further details on our policy/uni00A0and approach, see page 62.\n\nSince publication of the thermal coal phase-out policy, stakeholder engagement has continued, including with key institutional investors to discuss with them the policy, its impacts and alignment with our ambition to help finance our clients' transition to net zero. Extensive engagement also continues to take place among employees and with clients as we/uni00A0implement the policy.\n\nIn their respective roles as chair of Chapter Zero and chair of the Financial Services Taskforce, both the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive are at the forefront of climate matters, demonstrating their leadership and commitment to understanding and collaborating on these critical matters, mirroring the Board's and the Group's commitment to the transition to net zero as a key part of delivering our/uni00A0strategy.\n\nthe UK and Hong Kong, as well as views and inputs with regards to customer, employee, investor and community stakeholder considerations. Together, these inputs enabled the Board to conclude that the share buy-back would likely be viewed positively by the market and be considered to represent an appropriate balance between shareholder return and investment. The Board's assessment of our capital position took account of the company's ability to conduct its business and to support the communities in which it serves. Taking these stakeholder views and other relevant matters into account as prescribed by section 172, including our strong capital position and notwithstanding the growth opportunities available to us at the time of the decision, the Board considered that a return of capital by way of share buy-back would be in the best interests of investors as a whole having regard to the long-term success of the company and thereby approved the share buy-back.",

While lower policy rates adversely impacted revenue compared with 2020, the interest rate outlook is now significantly more positive.\n\nReported profit before tax of $18.9bn increased by 115%, while our return on average tangible equity ('RoTE') improved by\n\n## Group financial targets\n\nReturn on average tangible equity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2020: 3.1%)\n\n## 8.3%\n\nThe Group is targeting a reported RoTE greater/uni00A0than or equal to 10% in the medium term. In 2021, RoTE was 8.3%, an increase of 5.2 percentage points from 2020, primarily reflecting net releases of ECL. Our net interest/uni00A0income outlook is now significantly more positive. If policy rates were to follow the/uni00A0current implied market consensus, we would expect to deliver a RoTE of at least 10%/uni00A0for 2023.\n\nGross RWA reductions\n\n## $104bn\n\nSince the start of the programme.\n\nTo improve the return profile of the Group, we are targeting a gross RWA reduction, mainly in low-returning parts of the Group.\n\nDuring 2021, we updated the list of clients we are remediating and also implemented other methodology changes to improve how we align the tracking and reporting of reductions to how the programme is being managed. In line with these changes, we also increased our gross RWA reduction target from $100bn to $110bn by the end of 2022, updating executive scorecards accordingly.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group had achieved cumulative RWA reductions of $104bn since the start of the programme, including accelerated saves of $9.6bn made in 2019. Given progress to date, we now expect to exceed our $110bn reduction target by the end/uni00A0of 2022.\n\n5.2 percentage points to 8.3%. The growth in reported profit was due to a net release of ECL, compared with a significant charge in 2020, as well as an increase in share of profit from associates and joint ventures, while reported operating expenses remained broadly unchanged.

Notwithstanding lower policy rates, our Asia\n\nAdjusted operating expenses\n\n## $32.1bn\n\n(2020: $32.4bn)\n\nIn February 2020, we announced a multi-year plan to substantially reduce the cost base and/uni00A0accelerate the pace of change, with the/uni00A0aim of becoming leaner, simpler and more/uni00A0competitive.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to demonstrate strong cost control, with adjusted operating expenses of $32.1bn, a reduction of 1% compared with 2020.\n\nAdjusted operating expenses for 2022 are expected to be in line with 2021, with inflationary impacts, continued investment and the impact of acquisitions and disposals broadly o/ffset by further savings from our cost-reduction programme. This compares with our original target of $31bn or less (based/uni00A0on average December 2020 rates of/uni00A0foreign exchange).\n\nOur cost reduction programme remains on/uni00A0track to deliver cost saves of between $5bn/uni00A0and $5.5bn in the period from 2020 to/uni00A02022, while spending around $7bn in costs/uni00A0to achieve.\n\nCumulatively, since the start of our cost programme in 2020, we have generated savings of $3.3bn, with costs to achieve of $3.6bn, which included actions to restructure our businesses in Europe and the US.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness continued to perform strongly, delivering 65% of Group reported profits, while there was a material recovery in profitability in all of our other regions.\n\nThe Group maintained its strong capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 15.8% at 31/uni00A0December 2021, and increased both customer deposit and lending balances.\n\nCapital and dividend policy\n\nCET1 ratio\n\n15.8%\n\nDividend payout ratio\n\n## 40.3%\n\nAt 31 December 2021, our CET1 ratio was 15.8%. We expect mid-single-digit RWA growth in 2022 through a combination of business growth, acquisitions and regulatory changes, partly o/ffset by additional RWA savings. This growth, together with capital returns are expected to normalise our CET1 position to be within our 14% to 14.5% target operating range during 2022. Once we are within the target operating range, we intend to/uni00A0actively manage our CET1 position to stay within this range. However, due to normal capital volatility, we may be above or below this/uni00A0range in any given quarter. Our ambition remains to manage this operating range down in the longer term.\n\nThe Board has approved a second interim dividend for 2021 of $0.18 per ordinary share. The total dividend per share in 2021 of $0.25 results in a dividend payout ratio of 40.3% of reported earnings per share ('EPS'), relative to our target range of between 40% and 55% from 2022 onwards. We also intend to initiate a further share buy-back of up to $1bn, to commence after the existing up to $2bn buy-back has concluded.\n\nIn line with our dividend policy, we retain the flexibility to adjust EPS for non-cash significant items. In 2022, we intend to adjust EPS to exclude the forecast loss on the planned sale of/uni00A0our retail banking operations in France.",

The increase was primarily due to a net release in reported ECL, reflecting an improvement in the forward economic outlook, notably in the UK, compared with the significant build-up of stage 1 and stage 2 allowances in 2020. We also reported an increase in the share of profit from associates, while reported operating expenses remained broadly unchanged.\n\nLower reported revenue primarily reflected the impact of 2020 global interest rate reductions, as well as a decline in revenue in GBM's Markets and Securities Services ('MSS') business compared with a strong performance in 2020. Reported revenue also included the net favourable impact of certain volatile items:\n\n- - In WPB, favourable market impacts in life insurance manufacturing of $504m compared with favourable movements in/uni00A02020 of $90m.\n- - In GBM, MSS included favourable movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments, as favourable adjustments of $30m compared with adverse adjustments of $252m in 2020.\n- - In Corporate Centre, there were adverse fair value movements on our long-term debt and/uni00A0associated swaps of $99m (2020: $150m favourable).\n\nIn 2021, all of our regions were profitable. Despite the impact of lower global interest rates, our Asia business continued to perform strongly. In addition, there was a material recovery in profitability in all other regions, primarily reflecting a net release in ECL as the economic outlook improved.\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' sets the requirements that an entity should apply in accounting for insurance contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it holds. IFRS 17 is e/ffective from 1 January 2023 and could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of our insurance business. For further details on the impact of IFRS 17 on the results of our insurance operations, see page 318.\n\n## Reported revenue\n\nReported revenue of $49.6bn was $0.9bn or 2% lower than in 2020. The reduction primarily reflected a fall in net interest income as a result of the impact of lower global interest rates, notably a/ffecting our deposit franchises in WPB and in Global Liquidity and Cash Management ('GLCM') in CMB and GBM. In GBM's MSS business, revenue decreased in Global Foreign Exchange and Global Debt Markets, compared with a strong 2020, although revenue increased in Equities from higher volatility and there were favourable movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments. In addition, revenue was lower in Corporate Centre.\n\n| Reported results                                                                                               | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net operating income before change in  expected credit losses and other credit  impairment charges ('revenue') | 49,552    | 50,429    | 56,098    |\n| Change in expected credit losses and other  credit impairment charges                                          | 928       | (8,817)   | (2,756)   |\n| Net operating income                                                                                           | 50,480    | 41,612    | 53,342    |\n| Total operating expenses                                                                                       | (34,620)  | (34,432)  | (42,349)  |\n| Operating profit                                                                                               | 15,860    | 7,18 0    | 10,993    |\n| Share of profit in associates and  joint/uni00A0ventures                                                       | 3,046     | 1,597     | 2,354     |\n| Profit before tax                                                                                              | 18,906    | 8,777     | 13,347    |\n| Tax expense                                                                                                    | (4,213)   | (2,678)   | (4,639)   |\n| Profit after tax                                                                                               | 14,693    | 6,099     | 8,708     |\n\nThese reductions were in part mitigated by revenue growth in Wealth in WPB of $1.2bn, notably from a net favourable movement in market impacts in life insurance manufacturing, and growth in investment distribution, asset management and new business in insurance. GBM revenue also benefited from favourable valuation gains in Principal Investments. In CMB, revenue increased in Credit and Lending as margins improved, and a recovery in trade volumes resulted in higher fee income in Global Trade and Receivables Finance ('GTRF').\n\nThe reduction in reported revenue included adverse fair value movements on financial instruments of $0.5bn, although these were more than o/ffset by the favourable impact of/uni00A0foreign currency translation di/fferences of/uni00A0$1.4bn.\n\n## Reported ECL\n\nReported ECL were a net release of $0.9bn, compared with a charge of $8.8bn in 2020. The net release in 2021 reflected an improvement in the economic outlook, notably in the UK, partly o/ffset by an increase in allowances in the fourth quarter, reflecting recent developments in China's commercial real estate sector. This compared with the significant build-up of stage 1 and stage 2 allowances in 2020 due to the worsening economic outlook at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The reduction in ECL also reflected historically low levels of stage 3 charges, although with some normalisation during the fourth quarter, as well as the non-recurrence of a significant charge in 2020 related to a corporate exposure in Singapore.\n\nFor further details on the calculation of ECL, including the measurement uncertainties and significant judgements applied to such calculations, the impact of the economic scenarios and management judgemental adjustments, see pages 144 to 152.\n\n## Reported operating expenses\n\nReported operating expenses of $34.6bn were/uni00A0broadly unchanged compared with 2020. This included the impact of our cost saving initiatives, as well as lower impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, as 2021 included a $0.6bn impairment of goodwill related to our WPB business in Latin America to reflect the macroeconomic outlook, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rate deterioration and inflationary pressures, notably on our Argentina business. However, 2020 included a $1.3bn impairment of intangible assets, mainly in Europe. There was also a $0.6bn reduction in the UK bank levy due to a change in the basis of calculation to only include the UK balance sheet rather than the global balance sheet, as well as a credit of $0.1bn relating to the 2020 charge.\n\nThese decreases were broadly o/ffset by an increase in performance-related pay of $0.7bn/uni00A0as Group performance improved, and by an increase in investment in technology of/uni00A0$0.9bn (gross of cost savings of $0.5bn). The remaining increase primarily reflected inflationary impacts, non-technology investment in regulatory programmes, and business growth notably Asia wealth investment. In addition, there was an adverse impact of foreign currency translation di/fferences of $1.1bn.\n\nIn February 2020, we announced a plan to substantially reduce the cost base by 2022 and accelerate the pace of change. We continue to target $5bn to $5.5bn of cost saves for 2020 to 2022, while spending around $7bn in costs to achieve, which are included in restructuring and other related costs. Cumulative spend since the start of the programme in 2020 was $3.6bn, with cumulative saves of $3.3bn. In 2021, the total spend was $1.8bn with saves during the year of $2.2bn.",

In GBM's MSS business, revenue decreased in Global Foreign Exchange and Global Debt Markets, compared with a strong 2020, although revenue increased in Equities from higher volatility and there were favourable movements in credit and funding valuation adjustments of $301m. In addition, revenue was lower in Corporate Centre from a net adverse fair value movement relating to the economic hedging of interest rate and exchange rate risk on our long-term debt with/uni00A0associated swaps.\n\nThese reductions were in part mitigated by revenue growth of $1.1bn in Wealth in WPB, notably from a net favourable movement in market impacts in life insurance manufacturing of $434m, and growth in investment distribution, asset management and new business in insurance. In GBM, there were higher favourable revaluations in Principal Investments compared with 2020, and increased revenue in Capital Markets and Advisory.

Capital generation was more than o/ffset by dividends, the up to $2bn share buy-back announced in October, foreign exchange movements and other deductions. RWAs reduced despite new Pillar 1 requirements for structural foreign exchange, reflecting actions under our transformation programme.\n\n## Liquidity position\n\nWe actively manage the Group's liquidity and funding to support our business strategy and meet regulatory requirements at all times, including under stress. To do this, we monitor our position using a number of risk appetite measures, including the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio. At 31/uni00A0December 2021, we held high-quality liquid assets of $717bn. This excludes high-quality liquid assets in legal entities which are not transferable due to local restrictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details, see page 193.\n\nt",

This reflected a net release of adjusted ECL as the economic outlook improved, compared with the significant build-up of allowances in 2020. Adjusted revenue fell as the impact of lower global interest rates resulted in a decrease in net interest income. This was partly o/ffset by an increase in Wealth revenue of $1.1bn due to/uni00A0a net favourable movement of $434m in market impacts in insurance, higher new business in insurance (up $0.3bn), as well as growth in investment distribution (up $0.2bn) and asset management (up $0.1bn).\n\nAdjusted revenue of $22.1bn was $0.5bn or 2% lower.\n\nIn Personal Banking, revenue of $12.3bn was down $1.1bn or 8%.\n\n- - Net interest income was $1.2bn lower due to narrower margins following the fall in global interest rates in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This reduction was partly mitigated by deposit balance growth of $29bn or 4% and higher retail mortgage lending of $22bn or 7% across all regions, particularly in the UK and Hong Kong.\n- - Non-interest income increased by $0.1bn or 11%, driven by growth of mortgage fees in the UK and higher transaction volumes and spending on cards.\n\nIn Wealth, revenue of $9.1bn was up $1.1bn or/uni00A014%.\n\n- - Life insurance manufacturing revenue was $0.7bn higher, driven by a net favourable movement in market impacts of $434m. A favourable movement of $504m compared with a favourable movement of $70m in\n\n2020, as equity markets performed strongly in 2021 compared with volatile conditions in/uni00A02020. The value of new business written was $0.3bn or 41% higher, reflecting market share growth, notably in Hong Kong, where we continued to scale up our health platforms and significantly broadened engagement with domestic customers.\n\n- - Investment distribution revenue was $0.2bn or 7% higher, driven by higher mutual fund sales in Hong Kong and mainland China.\n- - Asset management revenue was $0.1bn or/uni00A014% higher, driven by an increase in management fees, reflecting growth of $28bn in invested assets, and higher performance fees.\n- - Global Private Banking revenue was $37m or 2% higher due to growth in non-interest income of $78m or 7% driven by a rise in investment revenue, reflecting higher fees from advisory and discretionary mandates. This was partly o/ffset by a reduction in net interest income of $41m or 6% as a result of the impact of lower global interest rates.\n\nIn Other, revenue fell by $0.5bn, reflecting a reduction in revenue allocated from Markets Treasury, lower interest income earned on capital held in the business and adverse valuations on properties.\n\nAdjusted ECL were a net release of $0.3bn, reflecting an improvement in the economic outlook. This compared with a charge of $3.0bn in 2020 due to the significant build-up/uni00A0of allowances as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAdjusted operating expenses of $15.4bn were $0.1bn lower, as the benefits of our costsaving initiatives funded our continued investment in wealth in Asia and o/ffset higher performance-related pay.\n\nt",

This was partly o/ffset by a 14% increase in year-on-year average deposit balances, with growth particularly in Hong Kong, the UK and the US, as well as from an 11% increase in fee income, with growth across all regions.\n- - In Markets products, Insurance and Investments and Other, revenue reduced by $11m or 1%, reflecting the impact of lower global interest rates on income earned on capital held in the business and lower Markets Treasury revenue. This reduction was partly o/ffset by a 12% increase in revenue from the sale of GBM products to CMB customers, notably Global Markets and Capital Markets and Advisory, as well as higher insurance and investment revenue.\n- - In Credit and Lending, revenue increased by $0.2bn or 4%, reflecting wider margins and a 9% increase in fee income, notably in the UK and North America. During 2021, we grew balances in Asia, although year-onyear average balances decreased, as customers' funding requirements fell due to Covid-19 restrictions, notably in Europe and North America.\n\nAdjusted ECL were a net release of $0.3bn, compared with a charge of $5.0bn in 2020. ECL in 2021 reflected a release of stage 1 and stage 2 allowances as the economic outlook improved, notably in the UK, although ECL were a net charge of $0.2bn in the fourth quarter, including an increase in allowances relating to recent developments in China's commercial real estate sector. This compared with the significant build-up of allowances in 2020 as a result of the adverse economic outlook due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The reduction in ECL also included lower stage 3 charges in 2021, and as 2020 included a significant charge related to a corporate exposure in Singapore.\n\nAdjusted operating expenses of $7.0bn were $0.1bn or 1% higher, primarily reflecting an increase in performance-related pay. We continued to invest in our digital and transactional banking capabilities, as well as/uni00A0simplifying customer journeys for both onboarding and lending, and enhancing self-service capabilities. These investments helped us drive operational and hiring e/fficiencies, resulting in cost reductions, in addition to the impact of our cost-saving initiatives. From 2021, the UK bank levy was partially allocated to global businesses, which was previously retained in Corporate Centre, resulting in an additional $47m of operating expenses in 2021.\n\nDuring 2021, we delivered $13bn of gross RWA reductions, taking our cumulative total to/uni00A0$26bn since January 2020, as part of our transformation programme.\n\n- - In GTRF, revenue rose by $0.2bn or 9%, driven by an 8% growth in fee income across all regions, partly reflecting a recovery in global trade volumes, as well as a 9% increase in average balances, notably in Asia, and higher margins in the UK.\n\nt",

This reflected a net release of adjusted ECL, compared with a significant build-up of allowances in 2020, although adjusted revenue fell and adjusted operating expenses rose.\n\nAdjusted revenue of $15.0bn decreased by $0.8bn compared with 2020.\n\nIn MSS, revenue fell by $0.7bn or 8%, compared with a strong comparative period, primarily in Global Foreign Exchange and Global Debt Markets, from a reduction in client/uni00A0activity.\n\n- - In Equities, our diversified product mix and geographical coverage enabled us to benefit from volatility in Asian markets, particularly in wealth products, resulting in revenue growth of $0.4bn or 45%.\n- - In Securities Services, we continued to grow fees from client inflows and market-related growth, and increased average assets under custody by 18% to over $10tn. Net interest income decreased by 16% as lower global interest rates were in part mitigated by growth in average cash balances.\n- In Banking, revenue fell by $0.1bn or 2%.\n- - In GLCM, revenue fell by $0.2bn or 10%, as/uni00A0lower global interest rates compressed margins. This was partly o/ffset by growth in average balances of 4% and increased fee income, reflecting higher transaction volumes.\n- - Revenue in Credit and Lending and GTRF was adversely a/ffected by strategic actions taken to reduce RWAs.\n- - Capital Markets and Advisory benefited from a strong performance in leveraged and acquisition finance, particularly in the US, although debt underwriting volumes fell.\n\nAdjusted ECL were a net release of $0.3bn, reflecting an improved economic outlook.

Despite the successful roll-out of vaccines around the world, a varying degree of uncertainty remained throughout 2021. This was caused by new variants of Covid-19, varying vaccine e/ffectiveness rates and the need for the reimposition of government-imposed restrictions. While the global economic recovery in 2021 eased financial di/fficulties for/uni00A0some of our customers, the future e/ffects remain uncertain.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have continued to support our customers and adapted our operational processes. We maintained high levels of service as our people, processes and systems responded to the required changes.\n\nThe financial performance of our operations varied in di/fferent geographies, but our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong. This helped us to support our customers both during periods of government-imposed restrictions and when these restrictions were/uni00A0eased.\n\nTensions between China and the US, the UK, the EU, India and other countries were heightened during 2021. In addition, the potential for an escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine further complicates the geopolitical landscape.

This was achieved by the release in allowances for expected credit losses, reflecting: an improvement of the economic outlook/uni003B the adaption of our strategy following the Covid-19 pandemic/uni003B enhancements to how we monitor risks/uni003B reviews of our portfolios that are highly vulnerable to the economic environment/uni003B and the implementation of additional review measures for new credit requests.\n\n## Stress tests\n\nWe regularly conduct stress tests to assess the resilience of our balance sheet and our capital adequacy, as well as to provide actionable insights into how key elements of our portfolios may behave during crises. We use the outcomes to calibrate our risk appetite and to review the robustness of our strategic and financial plans, helping to improve the quality of management's decision making. Stress testing analysis assists management in understanding the nature and extent of vulnerabilities to which the Group is exposed. The results from the stress tests also drive\n\nrecovery and resolution planning to help enhance the Group's financial stability under various macroeconomic scenarios. The selection of stress scenarios is based upon the identification and assessment of our top and emerging risks identified and our risk appetite.\n\nIn 2021, the Bank of England ('BoE') required all major UK banks to conduct a solvency stress test to assess whether the capital bu/ffers that banks had built during the Covid-19 pandemic were su/fficient to deal with a prevailing stress period. This exercise di/ffered from previous BoE stress tests, which were used to determine the capital requirements for participating banks. The 2021 solvency stress test incorporated a 'double dip' scenario, whereby an economy faces a recession and then a partial or full recovery for/uni00A0a short period of time before entering a second recessionary period. Additionally, it/uni00A0represented an intensification of the macroeconomic shocks seen in 2020, with economic weaknesses persisting around the world, leading to ongoing weaknesses in global GDP.\n\nWe also conducted our own internal stress test, which explored the potential impacts of key vulnerabilities to which we are exposed, including geopolitical issues and the Covid-19 pandemic. The internal stress test considered the impacts of various risk scenarios across all risk types and on capital resources. The results of the internal stress test were shared with senior management, and showed that after taking appropriate actions, the Group would remain adequately capitalised.\n\nIn 2021, the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') requested all major UK banks to run a/uni00A0climate-related stress test to explore the impacts of a set of scenarios: an early policy action, a late policy action and no additional",

To support the requirements for assessing the impacts of climate change, we have developed a set of capabilities to execute climate stress testing and scenario analysis. These are used to improve our understanding of our risk exposures for risk management and business decision making. In addition to the PRA requirements, we also delivered regulatory climate change stress testing exercises to a number of other regulators including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. These have provided us with insights to identify appropriate areas of further development and actions to mitigate against the impact of climate change.\n\n## Risks related to Covid-19\n\nA global vaccination roll-out in 2021 helped reduce the social and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, although there has been significant divergence in the speed at which vaccines have been deployed around the world. By the end of 2021, high vaccination rates had ensured that many Covid-19-related restrictions on activity in developed markets had been lifted and travel constraints were easing. However, the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021 demonstrated the continued risk new variants pose. There remains a divergence in approach taken by countries to the level of restrictions on activity and travel in response to the pandemic. Such diverging approaches to future pandemic waves could prolong or worsen supply chain and international travel disruptions. A full return to pre-pandemic levels of social interaction across all our key markets is unlikely in the short to medium term.\n\nOur ECL models continue to be impacted by the pandemic, as a result of the continued economic uncertainty caused by new Covid-19 variants. We continued to carry out enhanced monitoring of model outputs and use of model overlays, including management judgemental adjustments based on the expert judgement of senior credit risk managers. In addition, we recalibrated certain key loss models to take into account the impacts of Covid-19 on critical model inputs. We also responded to complex conduct considerations and heightened risk of fraud related to the varying government support measures and restrictions. The continued economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could adversely impact our revenue assumptions, notably volume growth.\n\n## Geopolitical and macroeconomic risks\n\nThe macroeconomic, trade and regulatory environment has become increasingly fragmented, with the spread of new variants of Covid-19, alongside other factors, continuing to disrupt supply chains in several industries globally. It remains to be seen how supply chains will be impacted by the Omicron or other future variants. The mismatch between supply and demand has pushed up commodity and other prices, particularly in the energy sector, creating further challenges for monetary authorities and our customers. Against the backdrop of both a vaccine-led economic recovery and increasing inflationary pressures, interest rates generally rose during 2021. Central banks in developed markets have either begun, or are expected to soon begin, to/uni00A0raise benchmark rates in order to help ease inflationary pressures, although rates are expected to remain low by historical standards,/uni00A0as uncertainties over the economic/uni00A0outlook continue.\n\nMarket concerns remain about repercussions for the Chinese domestic economy from recent\n\ninstability in its commercial real estate sector. Such repercussions may occur directly through financial exposures to the Chinese commercial real estate sector, or indirectly through the e/ffect of a slowdown in economic activity in China and in the supply chain to the real estate sector. According to the Chinese government's 'three red lines' framework used to govern the real estate sector, at 31 December 2021 we had no direct credit exposure to developers in the 'red' category, noting that deteriorating operating performance and challenging liquidity conditions were seen more broadly across the sector. We continue to monitor the situation closely, including potential indirect impacts, and seek to take mitigating actions as/uni00A0required.\n\nIn December 2021, the OECD published model rules that provided a template for countries to implement a new global minimum tax rate of 15% from 2023.

The impact on HSBC will depend on exactly how the UK\n\n## Our operations\n\nWe remain committed to investing in the reliability and resilience of our IT systems and critical services that support all parts of our business.

However, the operational support functions on which the Group relies are based in a number of countries worldwide, some of which have been particularly a/ffected by the Covid-19 pandemic during 2021. As a result, business continuity responses have been implemented and the majority of service level agreements have been maintained in locations where the Group operates. We continue to monitor the situation closely, in/uni00A0particular in those countries and regions where Covid-19 infections are most prevalent and/or where travel restrictions are in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details on our approach to the risks related to Covid-19, see 'Areas of special interest' on page 131.\n\nimplements the model rules, as well as the profitability and local tax liabilities of HSBC's operations in each tax jurisdiction from 2023. Separately, potential changes to tax legislation and tax rates in the countries in which we operate could increase our e/ffective tax rate in/uni00A0future as governments seek revenue to pay for Covid-19 support packages.\n\nHeightened tensions across the geopolitical landscape could also have implications for the Group and its customers. The relationship between the UK and the EU may come under further strain in 2022 with a number of potential areas of tension, notably the Northern Ireland Protocol, with possible repercussions for the operation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Diplomatic tensions between China and the US, and extending to the UK, the EU, India and other countries, and developments in Hong Kong and Taiwan, may/uni00A0a/ffect the Group, creating regulatory, reputational and market risks.

Following the announcement by ICE Benchmark Administration Limited in March 2021 that the publication of the US dollar London interbank o/ffer rate ('Libor') would be extended to 30 June 2023, the Group's transition programme focused mainly on client engagement for sterling, Swiss franc, euro and Japanese yen Libor interest rates, as well as Euro Overnight Index Average ('Eonia'). These interest rate benchmarks were all demised from the end of 2021 although six sterling and Japanese yen settings are currently being published under an amended methodology, commonly known as 'synthetic' Libor.

They must also specify the period covered by, and the appropriateness of, this statement.\n\nThe Directors have specified a period of three years to 31 December 2024. They are satisfied that a forward-looking assessment of the Group for this period is su/fficient to enable a reasonable statement of viability. In addition, this period is covered by the Group's stress testing programmes, and its internal projections for profitability, key capital ratios and leverage ratios. Notwithstanding this, our/uni00A0stress testing programmes also cover scenarios out to five years and our assessment/uni00A0of risks are beyond three years where appropriate:\n\n- - This period is representative of the time horizon to consider the impact of ongoing regulatory changes in the financial services/uni00A0industry.\n- - Our updated business plan covers 2022-2026.\n\nThe Board, having made appropriate enquiries, is satisfied that the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report, and it therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nBased upon their assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group/uni00A0will be able to continue in operation and meet liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.\n\nIn making their going concern and viability assessments, the Directors have considered a/uni00A0wide range of detailed information relating to/uni00A0present and potential conditions, including projections for profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and capital resources.\n\nThe Directors carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group to determine its long-term viability, including those that would threaten its solvency and liquidity. They determined that\n\nthe principal risks are the Group's top and emerging risks as set out on page 40. These include risks related to geopolitical and macroeconomic risks (including in relation to Covid-19), which have remained at the same level as 2020. Environmental, social and governance risk has replaced the former Climate-related risks theme to cover the wider scope of climate, nature and human rights, and digitalisation and technological advances has been added as a new theme to capture the emerging strategic and operational risks associated with the advancement of technology. Both of these risks were at a heightened level during 2021.\n\nThe Directors assessed that all of the top and emerging risks identified are considered to be/uni00A0material and, therefore, appropriate to be classified as the principal risks to be considered in the assessment of viability. They/uni00A0also appraised the impact that these principal risks could have on the Group's risk profile, taking account of mitigating actions planned or taken for each, and compared this with the Group's risk appetite as approved by/uni00A0the Board.\n\nIn carrying out their assessment of the principal risks, the Directors considered a wide range of information including:\n\n- - details of the Group's business and operating models, and strategy/uni003B\n- - details of the Group's approach to managing risk and allocating capital/uni003B\n- - a summary of the Group's financial position considering performance, its ability to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital, liquidity funding and the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities over the period of the assessment. Notable are the risks which the Directors believe could cause the Group's future results or operations to adversely impact any of the above/uni003B\n- - enterprise risk reports, including the Group's risk appetite profile (see page 121) and top and emerging risks (see page 124)/uni003B\n- - the impact on the Group due to the Covid-19 pandemic including the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants/uni003B recent instability in China's commercial real estate sector/uni003B and strained economic and diplomatic tensions between China and the US, the UK, the EU and other countries/uni003B\n\n- - reports and updates regarding regulatory and internal stress testing. During 2021, the/uni00A0Bank of England ('BoE') mandated an industry-wide solvency stress test exercise, which incorporated a 'double dip' scenario and represented an intensification of the macroeconomic shocks seen in 2020.

It also included a commitment to publish a policy to/uni00A0phase out the financing of coal-fired power and thermal coal mining, by 2030 in the EU/OECD, and 2040 in all other markets.\n\nWe have disclosed our baseline financed emissions for two priority sectors - oil and gas, and power and utilities - and set targets to reduce on-balance sheet financed emissions in these sectors. In assessing financed emissions, we are focusing our analysis on those parts of the sectors that we believe are most material in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe are also working with peers and industry bodies to mobilise the financial system to take/uni00A0action on climate change, biodiversity and nature.\n\nThrough a series of surveys, we aim to listen to our customers to put them at the centre of our decision making. If things do go wrong, we aim to take action in a timely manner.\n\nOur colleagues have needed to adapt at pace due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. This has o/ffered us the opportunity to rethink\n\n## Environmental\n\n- - Since 2020, we have provided and facilitated $126.7bn of sustainable finance and investment towards our ambition of $750bn to $1tn by 2030.\n- - In line with the climate change resolution, we published our thermal coal phase-out policy. For the oil and gas sector, we target a 34% Mt CO2e reduction in oil and gas absolute on-balance sheet financed emissions by 2030, from a 2019 baseline. For the power and utilities sector, we target a 0.14 Mt CO2e/TWh power and utilities on-balance sheet financed emissions intensity, representing a 75% reduction from 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more in the Environmental section on page 45.\n\n## Social\n\n- - We aim to be a top-three bank for customer satisfaction. Even though our performance, using the net promoter score, improved in many markets in which we operate, we still have work to do to improve our rank position against competitors, as some have accelerated their performance faster than us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more in the Customers section on page 67.\n- - In 2021, 31.7% of women occupied senior leadership roles, with a target to achieve 35% by 2025. We have put in place important foundations to support our goal of doubling the number of Black employees in senior leadership roles by 2025.\n- - Employee engagement, which is our headline measure, remained unchanged in 2021 at 72% following a five-point increase from 2019 and was four points above benchmark.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more in the Employees section on page 70.\n\n## Governance\n\n- - Governance activities are managed through a combination of specialist governance infrastructure, and regular meetings and committees, where appropriate. We expect that our ESG governance approach will continue to develop, in line with our evolving approach to ESG matters and stakeholder expectations.\n- - In seeking to safeguard the financial system, we monitor on average over 1.1 billion transactions each month for signs of financial crime.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more in the Governance section on page 79.\n\nhow our colleagues work, considering what worked well during the pandemic, and what challenges they face. Our future of work strategy will provide a framework through which we will implement hybrid working principles and adopt new technologies and working practices to enhance productivity, engagement and well-being.\n\nWe run a Snapshot survey every six months and report insights to our Group Executive Committee and the Board. We received 272,718 responses to our two Snapshot surveys in 2021, with record response rates. We will look to continue\n\nto focus on those aspects of the employee experience that we know to have the greatest impact on employee sentiment: fostering a healthy work-life balance, trust towards leadership, career progression opportunities and confidence in the company's future.\n\nWe are on a journey to embed ESG principles across the organisation, including incorporating climate changerelated risks within the risk framework, training our workforce, incorporating climate-related targets within executive scorecards, and engaging with customers and suppliers.",

We use the information they provide us with to identify the issues that are most important to them and consequently also matter to our own business.\n\nOur ESG Committee (previously the ESG Steering Committee) and other relevant governance bodies regularly discuss the new and existing themes and issues that matter to our stakeholders. Our management team then uses this insight, alongside the framework of the ESG Guide (which refers to our obligations under the Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide contained in Appendix 27 to The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited), and other applicable laws and regulations to choose what we measure and publicly report in this ESG review.\n\nUnder the ESG Guide, 'materiality' is considered to be the threshold at which ESG issues become su/fficiently important to our investors and other stakeholders that they should be publicly reported. We are also informed by stock exchange listing and disclosure rules globally. We know that what is/uni00A0important to our stakeholders evolves over time and we plan to continue to assess our approach to ensure we remain relevant in what we measure and publicly report.\n\nRecognising the need for a consistent and global set of ESG metrics, we started to report against the core World Economic Forum ('WEF') 'Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics' within the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 for the first/uni00A0time.\n\n## Our reporting around ESG\n\nWe report on ESG matters within this ESG review and throughout our Annual Report and Accounts, including the 'How we do business' section of the Strategic Report (pages 15 to 20), this ESG review (pages 43 to 88), and the 'Climate-related risks' section of our Risk review (pages 131 to 135).

Further details, which last year were presented in a separate supplement, have been embedded in this section and the Risk review section on pages 131 to 135.\n\n## Assurance relating to ESG data\n\nWe recognise the importance of ESG disclosures and the quality of data underpinning it. Certain aspects of our ESG/uni00A0disclosures are subject to independent assurance and we will continue to enhance/uni00A0our approach in line with external/uni00A0expectations.\n\nFor 2021, PwC provided stand-alone limited assurance reports in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of/uni00A0Historical Financial Information' and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions, in/uni00A0accordance with International Standard\n\non/uni00A0Assurance Engagements 3410 'Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements', issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, on the following specific ESG-related metrics:\n\n- - our Green Bond Report 2021 (published in December 2021)/uni003B\n- - our 2019 baseline for financed emissions related to our climate change resolution (see page 48)/uni003B\n- - our own operations' scope 1, 2 and 3 (business travel) greenhouse gas emissions data (see page 52)/uni003B and\n- - our progress towards our ambition to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of/uni00A0sustainable finance and investment (see/uni00A0page 53).\n\nOur data dictionaries and methodologies for preparing the above ESG-related metrics and PwC's assurance reports can be found on: www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/esg-reporting-centre.\n\nConsistent with the scope of financial information presented in our Annual Report and Accounts, the ESG review covers the operations of HSBC Holdings plc and its subsidiaries.

At the core of it is an ambition to support our customers on their transition to net zero, so that the greenhouse gas emissions from our portfolio of clients reaches net zero by 2050. We also aim to be/uni00A0net zero in our operations and supply chain/uni00A0by 2030.\n\nWe aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn/uni00A0of sustainable finance and investment to/uni00A0support our customers in their transition to/uni00A0net zero and a sustainable future by 2030. To /uni00A0support our ambition of net zero financed emissions, unlocking transition finance for our portfolio of clients will be crucial.\n\nAs we describe in the following pages, we have set on-balance sheet financed emissions targets for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors, aligned to the IEA's net zero scenario, underpinned by a clear sciencebased strategy.\n\n## Our approach to climate risk\n\nWe recognise that to achieve our climate ambition we need to further enhance our approach to managing climate risk. We have established a dedicated programme to develop a strong climate risk management capability.\n\nWe manage climate risks in line with our risk management framework and three lines of defence model. We also use stress testing and scenario analysis to assess how these risks will impact our customers, business and infrastructure. This approach gives the Board and senior management visibility and oversight of the climate risks that could have the greatest impact on HSBC, and helps us identify opportunities to deliver sustainable growth in support of our climate ambition. For/uni00A0further details on our approach to climate risk management, see Environmental, social and governance risk on page 125/uni00A0and Climate-related risks on page 131.\n\n## Impact on financial statements\n\nWe have assessed the impact of climate risk/uni00A0on our balance sheet and have concluded that there is no material impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. We considered the impact on expected credit losses, classification and measurement of financial instruments, our owned properties, as well as our long-term viability and going/uni00A0concern.\n\nDuring the year we also conducted a stress test to understand the impact of climate risk. While the focus of the exercise was solely on banking book impairments and RWAs, no issues were identified regarding the going concern status of the Group. For further details on how climate risk can impact HSBC in the medium to long term, including credit risk, see/uni00A0page 131.\n\n## In this section\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Our climate  ambition                      | Becoming a net zero bank                                       | We aim to achieve net zero in our financed emissions by 2050,   and in our own operations and supply chain by 2030.                                                                | Page  46   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n|                                            | Measuring our  financed/uni00A0emissions                       | In delivering our financed emissions ambition, we have initially  focused on the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors.                                                     | Page  47   |\n|                                            | Our approach to our  own/uni00A0operations                     | We aim to reduce energy consumption by 50% by 2030, against  a/uni00A02019 baseline.                                                                                               | Page  51   |\n|                                            | Supporting customers  through transition                       | Our ability to finance the transformation of businesses and  infrastructure is key to building a sustainable future for our  customers and society.                                | Page  53   |\n|                                            | Unlocking climate  solutions and innovations                   | We are working closely with a range of partners to accelerate  investment in natural resources, technology and sustainable  infrastructure.                                        | Page  55   |\n|                                            | Biodiversity and natural  capital strategy                     | By addressing nature-related risks and investing in nature,   we have an opportunity to accelerate the transition to net zero.                                                     | Page  55   |\n| Our approach  to/uni00A0climate risk       | Managing risk for our  stakeholders                            | We manage climate risk across all our businesses in line with our  Group-wide risk management framework.                                                                           | Page  56   |\n|                                            | Insights from scenario  analysis                               | Enhancing our climate change stress testing and scenario analysis  capability is crucial in identifying and understanding climate- related risks and opportunities.                | Page  57   |\n|                                            | Our approach to  sustainability policies                       | Our sustainability risk policies seek to ensure that the financial  services that we provide to customers do not contribute to  unacceptable impacts on people or the environment. | Page  62   |\n| Our approach  to/uni00A0climate  reporting | Task Force on Climate- related Financial  Disclosures ('TCFD') | Our TCFD index provides our responses to each of the 11  recommendations and summarises where additional information  can be found.                                                | Page  63   |",

We/uni00A0recognise that our planet urgently needs drastic and lasting action to protect our communities, businesses and the natural environment from the damaging e/ffects of climate change.\n\nThe Paris Agreement aims to limit the rise in/uni00A0global temperatures to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, compared with preindustrial levels. To limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C, the global economy would need to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by/uni00A02050. Our ability to steer finance for the transformation of businesses and infrastructure will be key in helping to enable the transition to a net zero global economy.\n\nWe believe we can make the most significant impact by working with our customers to support their transition to a net zero future. We aim to align our financed emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\nWe intend to set targets on a sector by sector basis that are consistent with net zero outcomes by 2050. In assessing financed emissions, we focus on those parts of the sector that are most material in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, and where we believe engagement and climate action have the greatest potential to e/ffect change, taking into account industry and scientific guidance.\n\n## Explaining scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\n\nTo measure and manage our carbon emissions, we follow the Greenhouse Gas Protocol global framework, which identifies three scopes of emissions. Scope 1 represents the direct emissions we create. Scope 2 represents the indirect emissions resulting from the use of electricity and energy to run a business. Scope 3 represents indirect emissions attributed to upstream and downstream activities taking place to provide services to customers. Our upstream activities include business travel and emissions from our supply chain including transport, distribution and waste. Our downstream activities include those related to investments and financed emissions.\n\n- For further details, see our ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.\n\nAs an asset manager, we will work towards the target of net zero emissions across all assets under management by 2050 or sooner.\n\nOur ambition is to become net zero in our operations and supply chain. This covers our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. As well as transforming our own operations and supply chain to net zero across our own organisation by 2030, we are asking our suppliers to do the same.\n\nThe next two sections provide further details on how we are measuring our progress on our financed emissions ambition and the progress made to date on our own operations and supply chain.\n\nThe diagram below shows how these ambitions map to our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting an energy provider through the transition\n\nIn March 2021, Air Liquide S.A., a French multinational specialised in gases, technologies and services, presented its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The company has placed the use of a competitive low-carbon hydrogen o/ffering at the cornerstone of its energy transition ambition, while aiming to decarbonise its production assets. We aim to support our clients through the transition. In May, we acted as a joint bookrunner for Air Liquide Finance's inaugural green bond and helped them to raise \u20ac500m, which will be dedicated to eligible sustainable projects including hydrogen, biogas, carbon capture, air gases, energy e/fficiency and green buildings in accordance with its sustainable finance framework.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Measuring our financed emissions\n\nWe announced our ambition to become a net zero bank in October 2020, including an aim to/uni00A0align our financed emissions to net zero by 2050 or sooner. In May 2021, shareholders approved a climate change resolution at our AGM that commits us to set, disclose and implement a strategy with short- and medium-term targets to align our provision of/uni00A0finance with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement.\n\nOur analysis of financed emissions considers on-balance sheet financing, including project finance and direct lending, as well as financing we help clients access through capital markets activities. Given the di/fferent nature of these two forms of financing, we distinguish between 'on-balance sheet financed' and 'facilitated' emissions where necessary in our/uni00A0reporting. Our analysis covers financing from both Global Banking and Markets, and Commercial Banking.\n\nFinanced emissions link the financing we provide to our customers and their activities\n\n## What is included in our/uni00A0analysis\n\nIn 2021, we assessed our financed emissions related to the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors using 2019 data. We believe these sectors are most material in terms of emissions, and are where we believe engagement and climate action have the greatest potential to e/ffect change.\n\nFor the oil and gas sector, we focused on upstream companies, and integrated or diversified energy companies. Our assessment of this portfolio included scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions of financed counterparties. By focusing on upstream and diversified energy producers, and including scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, we believe we are accounting for the majority of emissions across the sector. These include emissions associated with the ultimate use of oil and gas products as a fuel source. We have excluded midstream and downstream companies within the sector to limit double-counting and to\n\nin/uni00A0the real economy, and helps provide an indication of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with those activities. They form part of our scope 3 emissions, which include emissions associated with the use of a company's products and services.\n\n## Our initial disclosures\n\nWe started with measuring our financed emissions for two emissions-intensive sectors: the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. On the following pages, we report on the results of our analysis for these two sectors. We plan to measure and report on an annual basis, and intend to extend our analysis in our Annual Report and Accounts 2022 and related disclosures.\n\nOur analysis relies on data disclosed by our customers and other sources that may result in/uni00A0a time lag of one year or longer. We chose to/uni00A0use 2019 data as the basis for our initial disclosures, having taken into consideration potential distortions to economic activity caused by the Covid-19 pandemic during 2020.\n\nconcentrate engagement with customers whose products contribute most to greenhouse gas emissions in the global/uni00A0economy.\n\nFor the power and utilities sector, our analysis focused on upstream power generation companies, including scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions of financed counterparties. We believe power generation is where the majority of sector emissions occur through the use of fossil fuel as a source of energy. In analysing the power and utilities sector, we did not take account of scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions because we believe them to be immaterial. We believe upstream power producers have the most potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by shifting to renewables and other sources of lowemissions power generation.\n\nRegarding the di/fferent types of greenhouse gas measured, we include CO2 and methane (measured in CO2e) for the oil and gas sectors,/uni00A0and CO2 only for the power and utilities sector due to data availability and emissions materiality.\n\nThe following pages also set out our initial 2030 targets to align our on-balance sheet financed emissions for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors to the International Energy Agency's ('IEA') net zero emissions by 2050 scenario. The scenario provides a science-based decarbonisation pathway for the global economy that is consistent with a/uni00A01.5\u00b0C global warming target.\n\nIn developing our approach, we engaged with industry initiatives to help formulate our methodology for assessing and measuring financed emissions. In 2021, we were one of 43 founding members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance ('NZBA'), which seeks to reinforce, accelerate, and support the implementation of/uni00A0decarbonisation strategies for the banking sector. We also joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials ('PCAF'), which seeks to define and develop greenhouse gas accounting standards for financial institutions.\n\nTo calculate on-balance sheet financed emissions, we used drawn balances at 31 December 2019 related to wholesale credit and lending, which included business loans, trade and receivables finance, and project finance as the value of finance provided to customers in our analysis. We only included facilities with an original duration of 12 months or longer having considered industry guidance. We plan to continue to review the scope of facilities included in our analysis and update our approach following industry guidance.\n\nFor facilitated emissions, we used the apportioned value of underwriting for debt and equity issuances and syndicated loans as the proportion of funds provided to companies. We refer to these collectively as/uni00A0capital markets activities. Although we applied a similar methodology to assess facilitated and on-balance sheet financed emissions, using PCAF guidance as our foundation, we expect to continue to report them separately for transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Measuring our financed emissions continued\n\n## Our analysis of oil and gas, and power and utilities portfolios\n\nThe table below summarises the results of our assessment of financed emissions using 2019 data. It indicates the emissions associated with our financing activities in terms of both absolute emissions and emissions per unit of output relevant to each sector. The table also includes the PCAF data quality scores for the various components of our analysis, as explained further in the box on this page.\n\nFrom our analysis, total absolute on-balance sheet financed emissions associated with our oil and gas portfolio were more than three times greater than those from power and utilities. Similarly, the emissions associated with each dollar invested, or economic intensity, for our oil and gas portfolio is more than triple that of our power and utilities portfolio. More than 80% of on-balance sheet/uni00A0financed emissions for our oil and gas portfolio were attributed to our customers' scope 3 emissions.\n\nWe found that data quality scores varied across the di/fferent components of our analysis, although not significantly. For the oil and gas portfolio, data quality scores for scope 3 emissions were found to be slightly higher due to lower availability of reported data. Di/fferences between the data quality scores for on-balance sheet financed and facilitated emissions reflect the di/fferent composition of the customers and weighting of finance provided in each portfolio.\n\n## Financed emissions using 2019 data\n\n## Notes on data and methodology\n\nPCAF provides guidance on how to assess and disclose greenhouse gas emissions associated with loans and investments. It/uni00A0also provides a common approach for addressing variability in the data available to/uni00A0assess emissions.\n\nWe applied PCAF's data quality score to the sources of data we used to determine counterparty emissions. The PCAF scores can be seen in the table below.\n\nThe majority of our clients do not yet report the full scope of greenhouse gas emissions included in our analysis, in particular scope 3 emissions. In the absence of clientreported emissions, we estimated emissions using proxies based on company production and revenue figures. We validated data inputs used in our analysis with the global relationship managers for the top clients ranked by financed emissions and covering a significant majority of total financed emissions for each sector portfolio. Although we sought to minimise the use of non-company specific data, we applied industry averages in our analysis where company-specific data was unavailable.\n\nThe methodology and data used to assess financed emissions and set targets is new and evolving, and we expect industry guidance, market practice, and regulations to continue to change. We plan to refine our/uni00A0analysis using the data sources and methodologies available for the sectors we/uni00A0analyse, including, among others, the Science Based Targets initiative ('SBTi') and the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment ('PACTA') methodology. We expect our data quality scores to improve over time as companies continue to expand their disclosures to meet growing regulatory and stakeholder expectations.\n\nOur initial set of baselines and targets may require updating as data availability changes over time and methodology and climate science evolve. We plan to report financed emissions and progress against our targets annually and seek to be transparent in our disclosures about the methodologies applied. However, financed emissions figures may not be reconcilable or comparable year-on-year and targets may require re-evaluation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our approach and methodology, see our Financed Emissions Approach and Methodology Update at www. hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsiblebusiness/esg-reporting-centre.\n\n|                                                                                               | Absolute emissions 1                                                                          | Absolute emissions 1                                                                          | Emiss i ons intensity 2                                                                       | PCAF data quality scores 3                                                                    | PCAF data quality scores 3                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                               | Scope 1-2                                                                                     | Scope 3                                                                                       | Physical intensity   (per unit of output)                                                     | Scope 1-2                                                                                     | Scope 3                                                                                       |\n| On-balance sheet financed emissions -

        "page_content": "## Measuring our financed emissions continued\n\n## Our oil and gas, and power and utilities/uni00A0targets\n\nWe have defined targets to 2030 for the on-balance sheet financed emissions of our oil and gas, and power and utilities portfolios, as set out below. These are aligned with global sector decarbonisation pathways set out by the IEA in its net zero emissions by 2050 scenario. For facilitated emissions, we are supporting e/fforts to establish an industry standard. When this becomes available, we intend to refresh our analysis and set interim targets. The methodology for targets is set out in our Financed Emissions Methodology, which is available at www.hsbc.com/ who-we-are/esg-and-responsible-business/ esg-reporting-centre.\n\nFor the oil and gas sector, we target a reduction of 34% in absolute on-balance sheet/uni00A0financed emissions by 2030, using 2019 as our baseline. Our target is equal to the percentage reduction that the IEA indicates in its scenario for global sector emissions to 2030 from a 2019 baseline. We chose to use an absolute emissions metric in order to reflect a direct link to reducing greenhouse gas emission in the real economy. Our on-balance sheet financed emissions for 2019 was 35.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent ('Mt CO2e').\n\nFor the power and utilities sector, we target an on-balance sheet financed emissions intensity of 0.14 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per terawatt hour ('Mt CO2e/TWh') by 2030. Our emissions intensity target is equal to the global sector average emissions intensity for 2030 set out by the IEA, and represents a 75% reduction compared with our baseline of 0.55 Mt CO2e/TWh for 2019. We chose to use an emissions intensity metric, rather than absolute emissions, as the basis for our 2030 target for the power and utilities portfolio to reflect the need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from power generation while also meeting the anticipated increase in electricity demand. Electrification is central to the transition pathways for transport, heating, and other economic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nactivities. This will require scaling up investment and financing for renewable and other low-emission sources of electricity to meet demand.\n\nOur approach to target setting is in line with industry guidance on assessing portfolio alignment, including from - among others the NZBA and the Financial Services Taskforce ('FSTF'). Our approach does not rely on purchasing o/ffsets to achieve any financed emissions targets we set.\n\nIn selecting a reference scenario to assess alignment to net zero, we reviewed the IEA's net zero emissions by 2050 scenario against other available science-based 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. We believe it provides the greatest level of detail for assessing alignment across relevant sectors at a global level. Choosing this scenario allows us to make comparisons of our portfolio targets with other banks and peers who use this same scenario.\n\nWe have used the global decarbonisation pathway set out by the IEA's net zero emissions by 2050 scenario by sector as the reference for setting targets for our oil and gas, and power and utilities portfolios. The IEA's net zero emissions by 2050 scenario does not currently provide decarbonisation pathways at a regional level. We completed analysis to help ensure a global pathway is relevant for our financing portfolio and we will continue to assess this as further information becomes available over time. For further details on the IEA net zero by 2050 scenario, see www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050.\n\n## Oil and gas - absolute emissions (Mt CO2e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- HSBC 2019 on-balance sheet financed emissions baseline\n- IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario\n\n## Power and utilities - emissions intensity (Mt CO2e/TWh)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping to power a European first\n\nWe used our global reach and local expertise to attract a diverse base of international and domestic investors in March 2021 when Greece's largest power producer issued a \u20ac650m high-yield sustainability-linked bond - a first for Europe. We acted as joint global coordinator and left-lead bookrunner on the bond, which committed Public Power Corporation to reducing its carbon emissions by 40% by the end of 2022, or face higher financing costs. We were also ratings adviser and ESG structuring adviser supporting the company in achieving an improved sustainability performance target, measured using a Sustainalytics rating. Public Power Corporation has committed to end its reliance on lignite - low-grade brown coal - plants over the next few years and significantly boost its solar and wind power capacity.",

We aim to provide and facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment by 2030 (see page 53).\n- - We are working to embed financed emissions considerations into our business activities and culture. Our global businesses have had active roles alongside our Corporate Sustainability, Global Risk and Compliance, and Global Finance functions in/uni00A0developing our financed emissions approach in 2021. Collaboration across\n\nthe organisation will continue to be essential. This includes plans to strengthen our climate data and analytics capability to inform decision making and portfolio management, as well as expanding the resources to support business engagement.\n\nAs part of our annual disclosures for the year ending 31 December 2022, we plan to report baseline financed emissions and targets for the following sectors: coal mining/uni003B aluminium/uni003B cement/uni003B iron and steel/uni003B and transport (including automotive, aviation and shipping). We expect to also report on the agriculture, and commercial and residential real estate sectors in our annual disclosures for the year ending 31 December 2023 at the latest, following baseline analysis for these sectors.\n\nIn 2022 we will begin work on our climate transition plan, which will bring together - in one place - how we plan to embed our 2050 and 2030 net zero targets into the Group's strategy, processes, policies and governance. We plan to publish this in 2023, and update on progress annually thereafter as part of our annual disclosures.\n\nThe transition to a net zero global economy has implications for our customers across industries and geographies. It introduces new risks that need to be managed, as well as opportunities. Given our global presence and relationships with clients across industries and customer groups, we recognise the role we can play in helping catalyse this change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steering the automobile transition\n\nWe have been working with Ford Motor Co. towards its sustainability goals with two sustainability-linked transactions in 2021. In September, we supported Ford as it extended its revolving credit facilities worth a combined $15.5bn. Ford amended the credit facilities to include sustainability-linked targets, which included lower emissions from global manufacturing facilities and reduced exhaust emissions from passenger vehicles sold in Europe.\n\nIn November, we also acted as a joint lead manager on Ford's $2.5bn inaugural 10-year green bond under its new sustainable finance framework. This framework targets investments in clean transportation, clean manufacturing, advancing economic opportunity and equity for underrepresented and/or disadvantaged populations and community revitalisation.\n\n## Financed emissions targets to 2030\n\n|                     | Target metric                                   |   Our 2019 baseline | Our 2030 targets 1                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Oil and gas         | Absolute emissions  (Mt CO2e) 2                 |               35.8  | 34% Mt CO2e reduction in oil and gas absolute   on-balance sheet financed emissions                                       |\n| Power and utilities | Physical  emissions intensity   (Mt CO2e/TWh) 3 |                0.55 | 0.14 Mt CO2e/TWh power and utilities on-balance sheet financed  emissions intensity, representing 75% reduction from 2019 |\n\n- 1  Our 2030 targets are based on IEA net zero emissions by 2050 scenario references.

        "page_content": "## Our approach to our own operations\n\nPart of our ambition to be a net zero bank is to achieve net zero carbon emissions in our operations and supply chain by 2030 or sooner.\n\n## Reduce, replace and remove\n\nWe have three elements to our strategy: reduce, replace and remove. We plan to first focus on reducing carbon emissions from consumption, and then replacing remaining emissions with low-carbon alternatives in line with the Paris Agreement. We plan to remove the remaining emissions that cannot be reduced or replaced by procuring, in accordance with prevailing regulatory requirements, high-quality o/ffsets at a later/uni00A0stage.\n\n## Our energy consumption\n\nIn October 2020, we announced our ambition to reduce our energy consumption by 50% by 2030, against a 2019 baseline. To do this, we plan to reduce our energy consumption by optimising the use of our real estate portfolio.\n\nIn 2017, we announced our ambition to achieve 100% renewable power across our operations by 2030, joining other global companies in the RE100 initiative. In 2021, 37.5% of our electricity was renewable, mainly due to our power purchase agreements of wind and solar energy in the UK, Mexico and India. As part of this energy replacement strategy, in September 2021, we signed our fourth power purchase agreement for the UK. This agreement, which will support the development of the Sorbie Wind Farm project in Ayrshire, south-west of Glasgow, will result in approximately 90% of our UK electricity being sourced from such renewable projects (for further details, see page 19). We continue to look for opportunities to procure green energy in each of our markets. A key challenge is the limited opportunity to pursue power purchase agreements or green tari/ffs in/uni00A0key markets due to regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are considering the impact on our emissions from our colleagues working from home during the Covid-19 pandemic, and in the future, as they embrace more flexible ways of working. Using the EcoAct methodology, we calculated the emissions of our colleagues working from home was 4% of total electricity emissions in 2021. This only includes energy consumption from the IT equipment and lighting. We do not report employee home working emissions in our scope 1 and 2 performance data.\n\n## Business travel and employee commuting\n\nOur travel emissions continued to reduce in 2021 as a result of ongoing international travel restrictions caused by the pandemic. As international travel gradually resumes, we will update our internal policies with the aim to halve travel emissions by 2030, compared with pre-pandemic levels. We will continue to encourage the use of technological solutions where possible to provide connectivity with colleagues and customers. To ensure we are following best practices, we updated our air travel reporting methodology in 2021 to include cabin class and indirect climate change e/ffects in our travel emission calculations.\n\nWe continue to pursue the reduction of vehicles we use in our global markets, and accelerate the use of electric vehicles.\n\n## Focus on natural resources\n\nAlongside our net zero operations ambition, our aim is to be a responsible consumer of natural resources. Building on the success of/uni00A0our previous operational environmental strategy, we are identifying the key opportunities where we can lessen our wider environmental impact over the coming decade. We plan to set interim and 2030 global targets to maintain short-term momentum while also changing behaviour through ambitious long-term goals.\n\n## Our presence in environmentally sensitive areas\n\nAs a global organisation, our branches, o/ffices and data centres may be located in - or near areas of water stress and/or protected areas of biodiversity, as we support our customers and communities in these locations.\n\nApproximately 28% of our global o/ffices, branches and data centres are located in areas identified as being subject to high and very high water stress, accounting for 37% of our annual water consumption. These are predominantly urban or city centre locations with large, concentrated populations. Our industry is a low user of potable water, and we have implemented measures to further reduce water consumption through the installation of flow restrictors, auto-taps and low or zero flush sanitary fittings.\n\nIn addition, 1.7% of our global o/ffice, branch and data centre portfolio lies in protected areas and areas of biodiversity. We strive through our design, construction and operational standards to ensure that, where possible, our premises do not adversely a/ffect the environment or natural resources in these areas.\n\n## Our environmental and/uni00A0sustainability management policies\n\nOur buildings policy recognises that regulatory and environmental requirements vary across geographies and may include environmental certification. The policy is supported by/uni00A0Corporate Services procedures on environmental and sustainability management, ensuring HSBC's properties continually reduce their overall direct impact on the environment. Detailed design considerations documented in our/uni00A0Global Engineering Standards aim to/uni00A0reduce or avoid depletion of critical resources like energy, water, land, and raw materials. Suppliers are required to/uni00A0adhere to strict environmental management principles and reduce their/uni00A0impact on the environment in which/uni00A0they operate.",

The target for 2021 was for suppliers representing 45% of total supplier spend to have completed the CDP questionnaire. In total, suppliers representing 51.2% of total supplier spend completed the CDP questionnaire.\n\nWe will continue to engage with our supply chain with the aim of increasing the response rate, and have expanded the scope of our engagement with the CDP programme for/uni00A02022.\n\n## Our greenhouse gas emissions in 2021\n\nWe report our emissions following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which incorporates the scope 2 market-based emissions methodology. We report greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the energy used in our buildings and employees' business travel. Due to the nature of our primary business, carbon dioxide is the main type of greenhouse gas applicable to our operations. While the amount is immaterial, our current reporting also incorporates methane and nitrous oxide for completeness. We do not report employee home working emissions in/uni00A0our scope 1 and 2 performance data.

To estimate the emissions of our operations in countries and territories where we have operational control and a small presence, we scale up the emissions data from 92% to 100%. We then apply emission uplift rates to reflect uncertainty concerning the quality and coverage of emission measurement and estimation. This is consistent both with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and our internal analysis of data coverage and quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details on our methodology, our third-party assurance report and relevant environment key facts, see our ESG Data Pack at/uni00A0www.hsbc.com/esg.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions in tonnes CO2e per FTE\n\n|       |   2021 |   2020 2 |\n|-------|--------|----------|\n| Total |   1.52 |     1.93 |\n\n## Working with our Cloud/uni00A0partners\n\nUsing Cloud technologies is one of the ways we are reducing our IT carbon footprint.

The most significant contribution we can make is by supporting our portfolio of customers to decarbonise within the transition to a net zero global economy.\n\n## A leader in sustainable finance\n\nWe are a recognised leader in sustainable finance, helping to pioneer the market for green, social and sustainable bonds and attaching ambitious environmental targets to/uni00A0business loans.\n\nIn 2021, we acted on more green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds for clients than in 2020. We were mandated to act as structuring adviser on nine ESG-related government bonds, including for the UK, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Indonesia. We were recognised by Euromoney as the Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Asia and the Middle East for 2021.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to expand the horizons of sustainable finance:\n\n- - We acted as global coordinator and bookrunner for POSCO, the South Korean steelmaker, when it raised a \u20ac1.06bn five-year green convertible bond, which was South Korea's first green convertible bond and its largest equity-linked deal, to help establish and expand its rechargeable battery and hydrogen business.\n- - We launched a \u00a3500m Green SME Fund in/uni00A0the UK to help remove the barriers small businesses face in the transition to a lower-carbon economy.\n- - We partnered with Walmart and CDP to create the industry's first sustainable supply chain finance programme to use sciencebased targets to encourage suppliers to reduce emissions in alignment with the Paris/uni00A0Agreement. The initiative also included additional criteria for suppliers to meet certain scores on their environmental disclosures with the CDP.\n- - We launched green mortgages for customers in the UAE and Singapore to finance their purchase of homes that have/uni00A0been respectively accredited by the LEED and BCA Green Mark schemes as energy e/fficient.\n- - We supported the transition within the aviation sector, acting as the sole coordinator for a \u00a31bn sustainability-linked loan - backed by the UK's export credit agency, UK Export Finance - to British Airways plc, with the loan margin linked to/uni00A0aircraft fuel e/fficiency.\n\n## Sustainable finance summary 1\n\n|                                                              |   2021  ($bn) |   2020  ($bn) |   Cumulative  progress  since 2020  ($bn) |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Balance sheet-related transactions provided                  |          26.2 |          10.4 |                                      36.6 |\n| Capital markets/advisory (facilitated)                       |          48.7 |          30   |                                      78.7 |\n| Investments (assets under  management/uni00A0-/uni00A0flows) |           7.7 |           3.7 |                                      11.4 |\n| Total contribution 2                                         |          82.6 |          44.1 |                                     126.7 |\n\n- 2  Data is subject to limited assurance by PwC in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information'.

Our sustainable finance ambition has enabled sustainable infrastructure and energy systems, promoted decarbonisation e/fforts across the real economy, and enhanced investor capital through sustainable investment.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, we have provided and facilitated $109.8bn of sustainable finance, $11.7bn of sustainable investment and $5.2bn of sustainable infrastructure spanning more than 1,193 transactions, as defined in our data dictionary. This comprised 29% of green, social and sustainability-linked lending to companies, 9% of investments managed and distributed on behalf of investors, and 62% that facilitated the flow of capital and provided access to capital markets. Our data dictionary defining our sustainable finance and investment continues to evolve, which takes into account the revised marketing standards and guidelines.

There remains a significant investment gap and lack of adequate, bankable projects. Stronger standards are also needed to bring investors to the table.\n\nTo help solve this, we are leading the Finance to Accelerate the Sustainable TransitionInfrastructure ('FAST-Infra') initiative, which in November 2021 launched the Sustainable Infrastructure (SI) label (see box to the right).\n\nIn September 2021, we partnered with Temasek to establish (subject to regulatory approval) a debt financing platform dedicated to sustainable infrastructure projects with an initial focus on south-east Asia. The platform aims to deploy blended finance at scale over time to unlock more marginally bankable projects and create a tradeable asset class. We also co-chair the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment, which was launched at/uni00A0the UN Climate Action Summit to help investors and policymakers understand infrastructure investments and incorporate physical climate risk in decision making.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nWe o/ffer a broad suite of ESG capabilities across asset management, global markets, research, wealth, private banking and securities services, enabling institutional and individual investors to manage risk and pursue ESG-related opportunities.\n\nWe expanded our investment o/ffering for private banking and wealth clients, launching several cross-border ESG funds including a Sustainable Healthcare fund, to help investors generate long-term returns while contributing to the UN SDGs on good health and wellbeing. We launched a green certificate of deposit for the first time in renminbi to clients in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as the first Hong Kong dollar-denominated sustainability-linked bonds to clients in Hong Kong. We also expanded our ESG o/ffering to emerging markets, including a Global Equity Climate Change fund/uni00A0in India that helps clients to capture emerging opportunities during the low-carbon transition journey.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHSBC Asset Management strengthened its proposition with the formation of a new Sustainability O/ffice, which is responsible for the delivery of our sustainability strategy and business-wide transition to sustainable investment. Our endeavour is to influence the/uni00A0markets through active engagement on ESG issues. HSBC Asset Management's stewardship activities, through its portfolio managers and other investment analysts, led/uni00A0to ESG issues being raised in engagements with over 1,800 corporate and non-corporate issuers in 73 markets in 2021. We also voted on over 84,000 resolutions at over 8,400 company meetings in 72 markets by year/uni00A0end.\n\nAt HSBC Life, our insurance business, we continued to build our sustainable investment portfolios to support the UN SDGs and the Paris Agreement. During 2021, we made an e/ffort to increase our sustainable investment across our di/fferent manufacturing entities in Asia, Europe and Latin America. The intent is to continue to build on the work and grow the assets under management. While previously, HSBC Life invested in only green bonds within the spectrum of traditional bond instruments, in 2021 it also invested in social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds.\n\n## Embedding ESG into our engagement\n\nOur vision is to support our customers' aspirations to make a positive change in the world through wealth value creation. We are embedding ESG in our client engagement and/uni00A0investment solutions across our business/uni00A0functions.\n\nWe provide our customers with ESG insights and foster industry development. HSBC Global Research published over 200 climate and ESG-related reports in 2021, accompanied by approximately 525 client meetings and close to 30 client webcasts and events. Our ESG team works in close collaboration with analysts from other asset classes and across markets, embedding sustainability into research and o/ffering a deeper integration approach to a global investor client base. The/uni00A0team released five episodes of the ESG/uni00A0Brief podcast. ESG Insights from HSBC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Sustainable Infrastructure (SI) label\n\nIn 2021, FAST-Infra launched the Sustainable Infrastructure (SI) Label - a consistent, globally applicable labelling system designed to identify and evaluate sustainable infrastructure assets. The use of the label will help to address the estimated $6.9tn of annual investment that the OECD says is required until 2030 to meet the sustainable infrastructure objectives of the Paris Agreement. We helped conceive the FAST-Infra initiative, working with the IFC, OECD, the World Bank's Global Infrastructure Facility and the Climate Policy Initiative, under the auspices of the One Planet Lab.\n\nGlobal Research are also repackaged for retail/uni00A0investors as a series known as #WhyESGMatters. Through our sustainable finance think tank, HSBC Centre of Sustainable Finance, we launched 42 reports and collaborated with 15 partners to provide thought leadership on decarbonisation strategies and strengthen the financial system response to climate change. The centre and our reports are publicly available at www.sustainablefinance.hsbc.com.\n\n- For further details of our net zero ambition, see www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/our-climatestrategy/becoming-a-net-zero-bank.\n\n## Developing a beacon of green luxury\n\nThe former US embassy at Grosvenor Square, London, is being converted into a luxury hotel and could become a model of sustainability for future hospitality developments. Qatari Diar the property arm of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund - is converting the former embassy into the Chancery Rosewood, which will feature green roofs, energy e/fficiency measures and a system to reduce water consumption. The Chancery Rosewood is aspiring to achieve a BREEAM 'Outstanding' rating for sustainable development, which would make it the first five-star hotel and first UK hotel to achieve this rating under the 2014 assessment scheme. As mandated lead arranger, facility and security agent, hedge coordinator, and green loan coordinator, in April 2021 we helped Qatari Diar secure a \u00a3450m green loan for the landmark development.",

Climate Asset Management's ambition is to become the world's largest dedicated natural capital asset management company. Its investment strategies are grounded in nature-based investments, including sustainable forestry, regenerative agriculture, nature-based carbon projects, and exploration of new forms of natural capital. Climate Asset Management established a partnership with the Global\n\nEverGreening Alliance in November 2021, supporting the alliance's aim to deliver a $150m nature-based carbon programme in/uni00A0Africa.\n\nClimate Asset Management is one of the three founding partners of the Natural Capital Investment Alliance, which aims to mobilise $10bn towards natural capital themes by the end of 2022.\n\n## Backing new technology and innovation\n\nAddressing climate change requires innovative ideas. By connecting financing with fresh thinking, we can help climate solutions to scale to support sustainable growth.\n\nOur Climate Solutions Partnership aims to scale up climate innovation ventures and nature-based solutions, as well as help the energy sector transition towards renewable sources in Asia. For further details, see page/uni00A077.\n\n## Biodiversity and natural capital strategy\n\nWe recognise that achieving net zero goes hand in hand with halting and reversing nature loss. Nature loss, which refers to the decline of/uni00A0natural capital, ecosystem services and biodiversity, is one of the greatest systemic risks to the global economy and the health of/uni00A0people and the planet.\n\n## Investing in nature\n\nBy addressing nature-related risks and investing in nature, we have an opportunity to/uni00A0accelerate the transition to net zero, help tackle climate change and open up a more resilient and inclusive global economy.\n\nWe recognise that more needs to be done to assess and manage our exposure to naturerelated risks and that collective initiatives are needed to progress at pace. In 2021, we joined several working groups dedicated to helping us progress on this journey, such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures ('TNFD'). For further details on the/uni00A0nature-related initiatives we have joined, see 'Key external memberships' in the box on/uni00A0the right.\n\n## Catalyst for change\n\nWe are committed to playing a key role as a catalyst for change, using our scale, influence, and financing to help preserve natural capital and protect biodiversity as a component of our net zero ambition. In 2021, we facilitated green and blue bonds, as well as provided lending to corporate and sovereign clients for sustainable projects. Highlights included:\n\n- - We co-led the provision of $90m of green loan facilities to support Instar Asset Management's acquisition of PRT Growing Services, North America's largest producer of container-grown forest seedlings.\n- - We launched the world's first broad-based biodiversity screened equity indices, developed jointly with Euronext and Iceberg Data Lab, to explore ways to apply a biodiversity benchmark to trading and investment activities.\n- - Our asset management business published its biodiversity policy to publicly explain how our analysts address nature-related issues. In 2021, it also engaged with companies in the food industry on how to manage their suppliers' impact on biodiversity. For further details on the biodiversity policy, see: www.assetmanagement.hsbc.com/ about-us/responsible-investing/policies.\n\nWe have expanded our venture debt platform to support climate technology hardware and software companies that are growing rapidly. In 2020, we committed to fund $100m to climate technology (climate tech) companies through this platform. We closed our first two deals in 2021 and expect to achieve the $100m goal by the end of the first quarter of 2022. Consequently, we have raised our commitment to $250m.\n\nHSBC Asset Management has also developed a new venture capital capability that provides institutional and private banking customers with opportunities to invest in technology start-ups addressing global climate change challenges. We launched the first fund in November 2021 and provided it with a cornerstone investment.\n\nOur climate technology venture debt and venture capital platforms invest in companies that are developing innovative technological solutions that help companies and governments understand, track and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key external memberships\n\nOur nature-related external memberships and endorsements include:\n\n- - Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures\n- - Cambridge Institute on Sustainability Leadership's nature-related financial risks working group\n- - Accountability Alignment on Deforestation Working Group\n- - Business for Nature's Call to Action\n- - Get Nature Positive\n- - Signatory by the asset management business to the Finance for Biodiversity/uni00A0pledge\n- For further details of our sustainabilityrelated memberships, see www.hsbc. com/who-we-are/our-climate-strategy/ sustainability-memberships.",

We manage climate risk across all our businesses in line with our Group-wide risk management framework. Our most material risks in terms of managing climate risk relate to corporate and retail client financing within our banking portfolio, but there are also significant responsibilities in relation to asset ownership by our insurance business and employee pension plans, as well as from the activities of our asset management business.\n\nWe tailor our underlying policies and controls to manage the di/fferent risks and exposures to reflect these respective roles to meet the needs of our key stakeholders.

In December, we announced our thermal coal phase-out policy (see page 62) and we will use our deep relationships to partner with customers in this sector to help them transition to cleaner, safer and cheaper energy alternatives.\n\n## Asset management\n\nHSBC Asset Management managed over $630bn assets - including assets managed for parts of HSBC Insurance and employee pensions - at the end of 2021. With the majority of assets managed in ESG-integrated strategies, it treats climate change risk as a key feature of the investment decision-making process. Investment teams examine and determine the level of importance of potential ESG risks that could impact current and/or future value of issuers. These risks are reflected in proprietary issuer ESG scoring methodology and are embedded into investment processes.

The 2021 exercise focused on the portfolios most exposed to climate risk: our wholesale corporate lending, commercial real estate and retail mortgage portfolios. We performed our assessment over a 30-year time horizon, reflecting the long-term nature and e/ffects of transition and physical risks. For all portfolios, our assessments considered:\n\n- - transition risk arising from the process of moving to a net zero economy, including changes in policy, technology, and consumer behaviour and stakeholder perception, which will each impact borrowers' operating income, financing requirements and asset values/uni003B and\n- - physical risk arising from the increased frequency and severity of weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, or chronic shifts in weather patterns, which will each impact property values, repair costs and lead to business interruptions.\n\n## Scenarios and time horizons\n\nWe have developed capabilities to define parameters for bespoke scenario modelling. Our 2021 climate-related scenario analysis was run on a suite of specific scenarios published by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System ('NGFS'). The NGFS scenarios test a broad range of possible outcomes and have been created as a starting point for central banks and supervisors, encompassing a complex set of social, political and economic assumptions. The scenarios we considered were:\n\n- - An Orderly scenario assumes climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more stringent. As a result of\n\n## Our progress in 2021\n\nClimate change scenario analysis requires bespoke data, modelling techniques and analysis. In order to integrate climate considerations in our analysis, we used the people, processes, controls, and governance structures from traditional stress tests. Building on that, throughout 2021, we continued to develop our climate change scenario analysis capabilities, including:\n\n- - We identified new data requirements and sourced data for a vast number of inputs representing climate, macroeconomic and financial variables.\n- - We built and refined climate change models for wholesale corporate lending, commercial real estate and retail mortgage portfolios. Our models incorporated sector-specific adjustments for the higher risk industrial sectors. These portfolios represent a material part of our lending activities. The models projected the impact of climate change and produced outputs such as credit ratings, which helped us assess the financial impact on our portfolios.\n- - We held training sessions covering all levels/uni00A0of seniority from our colleagues to Board Directors, to allow our people to e/ffectively understand, review, challenge and use the outcomes.\n- - Following the execution of results, we revisited the end-to-end process to learn key lessons and make continuous improvements for the next stress testing cycle.\n- early action to tackle global warming and climate change, both physical and transition risks are relatively subdued. A moderate level of carbon sequestration (which is the process of capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide) is factored into the scenario.\n- - A Disorderly scenario explores higher transition risk due to policies being delayed or divergent across countries and sectors. Carbon prices are typically higher for a given temperature outcome. There is a low level of carbon sequestration assumed in this scenario due to the absence of timely and sizable investments in such technologies.\n\nThe process has involved engaging with stakeholders across our Finance, Corporate Sustainability and Risk functions, as well as global businesses at Group and regional levels. We held 'in-depth' sessions with the Group Risk Management Meeting ('RMM'), Group Risk Committee ('GRC') and the Group Executive Committee covering data, models, risk assessments and outcomes. A series of governance meetings culminating with the RMM and GRC reviewed, challenged and approved the overall outcomes of this exercise.\n\n## Our framework\n\nWe have created - and continue to develop - a/uni00A0target state framework for climate change stress testing and scenario analysis. This framework uses many of the building blocks from of our traditional capital stress testing framework, but it demands larger and richer data that feeds innovative and granular forecasting solutions. All activities in this framework need to be embedded in our business-as-usual processes to help drive business/uni00A0decisions.\n\nThe following pages highlight some of the analysis conducted. The nature of the scenarios, our developing capabilities, and limitations of the analysis have led to outcomes that are directionally indicative of climate change headwinds, but they are not a direct forecast. Developments in climate science, data, methodology, and scenario analysis techniques will help us shape our approach further. We therefore expect this view of risk to change over time.\n\n- - A Hot house world scenario assumes that some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but global e/fforts are insu/fficient to halt significant global warming. Critical temperature thresholds are exceeded, leading to severe physical risks and irreversible impacts like sea-level rise. This scenario also assumes a low level of carbon sequestration.\n- Further details of these scenarios are available at: www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal.",

We have focused on these sectors because they are most likely to be impacted by climate risk. We/uni00A0assessed these sectors against Orderly, Disorderly and Hot house scenarios over a 30-year horizon. The two transition risk scenarios (Orderly and Disorderly) have the most impact on our wholesale portfolio and therefore the commentary focuses on these scenarios. While cumulative impacts over the 2020 to 2050 scenario horizon are broadly similar, the Disorderly scenario has a delayed disruptive transition and the Orderly scenario starts to impact the portfolio immediately.\n\n## Wholesale corporate lending portfolio methodology\n\nWe have developed a standardised framework to assess the financial impact of climate change on our wholesale corporate counterparties. We carried out granular modelling for material counterparties, projecting how their financial position might be impacted under each scenario. As data limitations often posed a challenge, we performed a high-level impact assessment for less material counterparties.\n\nFor simplicity, we assumed that our counterparty exposures would remain static over the 30-year horizon under all\n\n## Impact for key wholesale transition risk sectors 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  This heat map is based on projected change in average credit ratings between 2020 and 2050 of counterparties by sector/sub-sector.

These risks influence property values and the ability and willingness of borrowers to service their debts. Another risk driver is the ability to respond and adapt to new and emerging regulatory requirements, such as new energy e/fficiency standards, which may influence property values.\n\nThe table below focuses on our most material retail mortgage portfolios in Hong Kong and the UK - covering 66% of our retail mortgage portfolio as of 31 December 2020. It demonstrates the potential physical risks of river, surface and coastal flooding, and how this may vary under the Orderly, Disorderly and Hot house scenarios. We show the projected change in flood depth in metres given a 1-in-100-year flood event. Since the Orderly and Disorderly scenarios use the same physical risk forecasts, these are combined into a single column.\n\nOur analysis indicates that the most pronounced e/ffects of physical risk on our retail mortgage customers are under a Hot house scenario characterised by a more than 3\u00b0C increase in global temperatures, which leads to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. There are also risks posed by the transition to a net zero economy, predominantly through macroeconomic disruption, as well as some country-specific policies that may be enacted to meet these targets, including introduction of minimum energy e/fficiency standards.\n\n## Exposure to flooding\n\nProportion of properties predicted to be impacted by floods given a 1-in-100-year severity flood event (%)\n\n|                       | Hong Kong   | Hong Kong                          | Hong Kong           | UK     | UK                                 | UK                  |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|--------|------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Scenarios             | 2020 1      | 2050                               | 2050                | 2020 1 | 2050                               | 2050                |\n| Flood depth in metres |             | Orderly and  Disorderly,  +1.5\u00baC 2 | Hot house,  +>3\u00b0C 3 |        | Orderly and  Disorderly,  +1.5\u00baC 2 | Hot house,  +>3\u00b0C 3 |\n| 0-0.5                 | 92.1        | 92.0                               | 73.3                | 98.5   | 97.5                               | 96.1                |\n| 0.5-1.5               | 6.9         | 6.9                                | 25.6                | 1.3    | 2.3                                | 3.6                 |\n| >1.5                  | 1.0         | 1.1                                | 1.1                 | 0.2    | 0.2                                | 0.3                 |\n\n- 1 Represents the baseline flood risk in 2020.\n- 2  Represents the flood risk in 2050 under a climate scenario aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C increase in global temperatures.\n- 3  Represents the flood risk in 2050 under a climate scenario aligned to a more than 3\u00b0C increase in global temperatures.\n\nImpacts across mortgage portfolios are primarily driven by the increased risk of flooding, including river, surface and coastal flooding. While relatively small proportions of the portfolios are predicted to be impacted by flooding events, the severity of these events is expected to increase over time. Under a Hot house scenario, sea levels are expected to rise up to 1.5 metres, which would increase the risk of coastal flooding for parts of the Hong Kong portfolio in the latter part of the century. The table shows that the Hot house scenario puts 25.6% of properties in Hong Kong at risk of a 0.5 metre to 1.5 metres 1-in-100-year flood event, up 18.7% from 6.9% in the Orderly and Disorderly scenarios.\n\nThe risk of extreme wind stress has also been considered and is only deemed material in Hong Kong, where typhoons regularly occur. Buildings standards in Hong Kong mean that structures are designed to withstand high wind speeds, and the severity of wind events is not predicted to materially change between now and the end of the century.\n\nWe take into account the transition risk for our/uni00A0retail mortgage portfolio as part of our business-as-usual lending and scenario analysis exercises. We focused on physical risk on this page because our current analysis/uni00A0shows it to be a/uni00A0material climate risk/uni00A0for this business.\n\n## Retail mortgage portfolio methodology\n\nWe used granular models to assess our material retail mortgage portfolios exposed to a high degree of climate change. After simulating thousands of weather events and assessing their impact on each property's value, we estimated expected physical losses under all scenarios. Key parameters included insurance coverage, public defences and building resilience archetypes. Transition risk was modelled considering the changes in key macroeconomic variables and region-specific policies, such as the requirement for homes to have certain minimum-rated energy performance certificates ('EPC') in the UK.",

The map below illustrates the potential impact of physical risk on our commercial real estate portfolio in Hong Kong under the Hot house scenario. We have focused on this portfolio as it is our most material commercial real estate portfolio in terms of exposure. The map shows a projected increase in average damage ratio, which represents the ratio between the cost of potential damage due to climate-related perils and the value of the property. The key peril drivers in our results are coastal, river and surface water flooding, and wind under a Hot house scenario.\n\n## Exposure to physical risk in Hong Kong under a Hot house scenario\n\nThe chart shows the increase in average damage ratio between 2020 and 2050 using a/uni00A0simple average for locations of our commercial real estate properties in each district. Our approach assumes an acceleration of physical risk impacts from later/uni00A0in the century.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProvided by Marsh LTD\n\nThe table alongside shows the projected increase in financial impact over 30 years for our most material commercial real estate portfolios - Hong Kong, the UK, Canada and/uni00A0the US, which cover 77% of the total commercial real estate portfolio as of 31/uni00A0December 2020 - under the Orderly, Disorderly and Hot house scenarios. The increase in projected financial impact represents the increase in expected credit losses relative to exposure. The commentary highlights the key reasons for the change in impact between the Orderly scenario and alternative scenarios.\n\nUnder the Hot house scenario, the impacts are/uni00A0driven primarily by the increased risk of flooding (coastal, riverine and surface water). In this scenario, Hong Kong and the UK would be particularly impacted by coastal flooding due to the estimated rise in the sea level of up/uni00A0to 1.5 metres, with an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Risks posed by the transition to a net zero economy also exist, which manifest mainly through macroeconomic disruption under the Disorderly scenario, as well as country-specific policies enacted to meet these targets, such as, minimum energy e/fficiency standards in the UK.\n\n## Commercial real estate portfolio methodology\n\nThe commercial real estate methodology is tailored to individual property characteristics and is used to analyse the impact on borrowers' credit risk. We have also taken into account existing property insurance in our portfolio. Transition risk drivers include country-specific net zero policies, such as requirements for EPCs, and the associated macroeconomic disruption.\n\nWe are continuing to refine the data used for physical and transition risk assessment of our portfolios together with our modelling capabilities which use these inputs.\n\n## Impact on commercial real estate for key countries/territories\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                        | Country/territory-                                          | Projected impact 1   | Projected impact 1                                                                 | Projected impact 1                                                        |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Countries/ territories | specific EPC  policies in the  scenario                     | Orderly,  +1.5\u00b0C     | Disorderly,  +1.5\u00b0C                                                                | Hot house,  +>3\u00b0C                                                         |\n| Hong Kong              | -                                                           | a                    | Higher value of  collateral helps  reduce impact a                                 | Increased risk of  coastal flooding b                                     |\n| Canada                 | -                                                           | a                    | Macroeconomic  disruption due to  late policy action b                             | Increased risk   of riverine and  surface water  flooding b               |\n| US                     | -                                                           | a                    | Macroeconomic  disruption due to  late policy action b                             | No material  increase of  physical risk due  to location of  properties a |\n| UK 2                   | Energy e/fficiency  standards  introduced via  EPC policies | a                    | Macroeconomic  disruption and  stricter EPC  policies due to late  policy action b | Increased risk of  coastal flooding b                                     |\n\nLower Impact\n\nHigher impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Projected impacts from perils include flooding (coastal, river and surface water), wind and wildfires, without taking into account client adaptation plans or management actions.\n- 2  UK financial projections include transition risks related to meeting minimum energy e/fficiency standards, whereas the other countries/territories do not.",

        "page_content": "## Insights from scenario analysis continued\n\n## Understanding the resilience of our critical properties\n\nClimate change poses a physical risk to the buildings that we occupy as an organisation, including our o/ffices, retail branches and data centres. We measure the impacts of climate and weather events to our buildings on an ongoing basis, using historical, current and scenario modelled forecast data. In 2021, there were 47 major events that had no impact on the/uni00A0availability of/uni00A0our buildings.\n\nWe use stress testing to evaluate the potential for impact to our/uni00A0owned or leased premises. Our scenario stress test, conducted in 2021, analysed how seven di/fferent climate changerelated hazards - comprising coastal inundation, extreme heat, extreme winds, wildfires, riverine flooding, soil movement due to drought, and surface water flooding - could impact 250 of our critical buildings.\n\nThe 2021 scenario stress test of 250 of our critical buildings modelled climate change with a Hot house scenario that projects that the rise in the temperature of the world will likely exceed 4\u00b0C by 2100. It also modelled a less severe scenario that projects that global warming will likely be limited to 2\u00b0C, in line with the upper limit ambition of the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Regulatory climate stress tests\n\nRegulators in an increasing number of jurisdictions are incorporating climate factors in their supervisory tools, with di/fferent aspects considered around the world. We have built flexibility into our approach to climate stress tests to support these di/fferences. During 2021, we completed a/uni00A0number of climate stress tests in response to/uni00A0regulatory requirements from the Bank of England, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. We/uni00A0expect to complete further tests in 2022.\n\nAny specific outcomes and balances disclosed in this section should not be assumed to be those that have fed into our aggregated final climate results for the Bank of England's biennial exploratory scenario.\n\nKey findings from the 4\u00b0C or greater Hot house scenario included:\n\n- - By 2050, 22 of our 250 critical buildings will have a high potential for impact due to climate change, with insurance-related losses estimated to be in excess of 10% of the insured value of our buildings.\n- - The eight most a/ffected locations face hazards relating to surface flooding, rising river levels and landslides, as well as coastal flooding from rising sea levels and storms. Of the remaining 14 locations, 11 are data centres where the predominant hazards emanate from a mixture of temperature extremes, water stress and drought for which the specific direct physical impact could be soil movement. The other three are o/ffices where the predominant hazard is coastal flooding.\n- - A further 25 locations have the potential to be impacted by climate change, albeit to a lesser extent, with insurance-related losses estimated at between 5% and 10% of the insured value of our buildings.\n\nA key finding from the 2\u00b0C, less severe scenario/uni00A0showed:\n\n- - The total number of buildings at risk reduces from 47 to 35, with the same eight key facilities still at risk by 2050 from the same/uni00A0perils.\n\n## Our priority next steps\n\nWhile we have conducted a number of climate change scenario analyses and stress tests in 2021, we continue to broaden and enhance our capabilities in order to overcome the limitations identified. These include enhancing our climate data repository, expanding scenario analysis methodology beyond credit risk, forecasting key climate metrics, integrating climate scenario analysis into risk/uni00A0management, business decisions and strategic planning. Together, they will help us/uni00A0define and monitor targets to support the Group's climate strategy. We aim to continue to improve on scenario analysis disclosures in line with regulatory expectations, supported by robust control processes and governance.\n\nThis forward-looking data will inform real estate planning. We will continue to improve our understanding of how extreme weather events impact our building portfolio as climate risk assessment tools improve and evolve. Additionally, we buy insurance for property damage and business interruption, and consider insurance as a loss mitigation strategy depending on its availability and price.\n\nWe regularly review and enhance our building selection process and global engineering standards, and will continue to assess historic claims data to help ensure our building selection and design standards reflect the potential impacts of climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have developed, implemented and refined our approach to working with our business customers to understand and manage these issues. We have joined various partnerships to/uni00A0support our role in this, including the Powering Past Coal Alliance and World Economic Forum's Principles for Financing a/uni00A0Just and Urgent Energy Transition.\n\n## Our policies\n\nOur sustainability risk policies cover agricultural commodities, chemicals, energy, forestry, mining and metals, thermal coal, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and Ramsardesignated wetlands.\n\nThese policies define our appetite for business in these sectors and seek to encourage customers to meet good international standards of practice. Where we identify activities that could cause material negative impacts, we will only provide finance if we can/uni00A0confirm clients are managing these risks responsibly. Such customers are subject to greater due diligence and generally require additional approval by sustainability risk specialists.\n\nOur sustainability policies continue to be aligned with our approach to climate risk, and/uni00A0our net zero ambition.\n\nFor further details on how we manage sustainability risk, as well as our full policies, see www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-andresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\n\n## Supporting the transition\n\nReinforcing our ambition to support our clients' transition to lower carbon through transition financing - and particularly to the phase-out of thermal coal - we published our thermal coal phase-out policy, which we introduced in December 2021 (see right).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Governance and implementation\n\nWithin our Global Risk and Compliance function, we have reputational and sustainability risk specialists who are responsible for reviewing, implementing and managing our sustainability risk policies as well as our application of the Equator Principles. Our global network of more than 75/uni00A0sustainability risk managers supports the implementation of these policies. In 2021, these local sustainability risk managers continued to be supported by regional reputational risk managers across the Group who have taken on additional oversight responsibilities for sustainability risk.\n\nThe Sustainability Risk Oversight Forum, made up of senior members of the Global Risk and Compliance function and global businesses, continued to oversee the development and implementation of policies that identify, manage and mitigate the Group's sustainability risk, including a refreshed assurance framework in 2021. This framework has been designed to take a more holistic view of the ESG risks we face in our sustainability risk policies, including:\n\n- - monitoring ESG news across the sustainability risk policies/uni003B\n- - overseeing clients considered to be of higher risk or under exit/uni003B\n- - reviewing client files across the sustainability risk policies/uni003B and\n- - setting and reporting against a defined set/uni00A0of key control indicators aligned to our risk appetite.\n\nThe framework is used to monitor the in-scope portfolio and keep track if there is any deterioration in the risk ratings. With the respective risk rating assigned, our sustainability risk specialists will take the necessary actions to mitigate unacceptable risks. If necessary, we will proactively end the client relationship.\n\n## Our thermal coal phase-out policy\n\nIn fulfilment of our commitment approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2021, we published a policy to phase out thermal coal financing in EU and OECD markets by 2030, and globally by 2040. This incorporates project finance, direct lending, or arranging or underwriting of capital markets transactions to in-scope clients, as well as the refinancing of existing finance facilities.\n\nEvery year we commit to review our policy and targets, taking into account evolving science and internationally recognised guidance.\n\nUsing our TCFD disclosures in 2020 as/uni00A0our baseline, we intend to reduce thermal coal financing exposure by at/uni00A0least 25% by 2025, and by 50% by 2030. These targets will be reviewed in/uni00A0conjunction with assessments of client transition plans. For further details, see www.hsbc.com/news-andmedia/hsbc-news/were-phasing-outcoal-financing.\n\nAs shown in the wholesale loan exposure table on page 133, within the power and utilities, and metals and mining sectors, and recognising external party assessments of power generation and mining capacity, our exposure to thermal coal at 31 December 2021 was $1.0bn (2020: $1.2bn) or 0.2% of the total wholesale loans and advances figures.\n\nIn 2021, HSBC, together with other financial institutions, participated in capital markets transactions relating to clients who own or operate thermal coal-fired powered plants or thermal coal mines. HSBC facilitated a total of $1.3bn out of the total of these transactions.\n\n## Biodiversity and natural capital-related policies\n\nWe have taken several steps to unlock the value of natural capital in the global economy, and help tackle biodiversity loss and other nature-related financial risks. However, we recognise we are at the beginning of our journey.\n\nWe regularly assess our clients for their commitment to sustainable business practices, and have clear policies to help mitigate the risk of nature loss. Our sustainability risk policies are designed to provide several protections against financing, which will have a negative impact on nature. These include our forestry and agricultural commodities policies, which put an emphasis on customers involved with the major forest-risk commodities to obtain independent certification that their businesses operate in a sustainable manner. These include requiring palm oil customers to commit to 'No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation'. Our World Heritage Sites and Ramsar-designated wetlands policy prohibits the financing of any project that threatens the special natural characteristics of these internationally protected areas.",

In 2021, we gathered feedback from over one million customers across our three global businesses to help us/uni00A0understand our strengths and the areas of/uni00A0focus.\n\nOur recommendation scores improved in more than 60% of our markets, although we still have work to do to improve our rank position against competitors, as some have accelerated their performance faster than us.\n\n## Listening to drive continuous improvement\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to embed our new feedback system so we can better listen, learn and act on our customers' feedback. We use NPS to provide a consistent measure of our performance. NPS is measured by subtracting the percentage of 'Detractors' from the percentage of 'Promoters'. 'Detractors' are customers who provide a score of 0 to 6, and 'promoters' are customers who provide a score of 9 to 10 to the question: 'On a scale on 0 to 10, how likely is it that you would recommend HSBC to a friend or colleague'.\n\nWe run studies that allow us to benchmark ourselves against other banks. In 2021, these were live in 10 WPB markets and 13 CMB markets, and in our key regions for our private bank and GBM. These will be expanded to other key markets in 2022. We try to make it as easy as possible for customers to give us\n\n## Acting on feedback\n\nWe continued to focus on our digital capabilities in 2021 to enable better customer experiences.\n\nIn WPB, we introduced new mobile account opening functionality in Hong Kong, leading to improved NPS, and reaching an all-time high of 62 in March. We also launched Trade25, our new stock trading platform for 18 to 25 year-olds. By the end of the year, 1,800 users had opted into the programme.

By sharing this and other feedback with our front-line teams, and allowing them to respond directly to customers, we are improving how we address issues and realising opportunities.\n\n## How we fared\n\nIn WPB, our NPS rose in seven markets. In/uni00A0Hong Kong, mainland China and UAE, we/uni00A0were ranked in the top-three banks, and in/uni00A0the UK, Malaysia and Mexico we improved rank positions. Our rank in Singapore and the US remained flat while our positions slipped in Australia and Canada. Customers told us we needed to focus on: making digital platforms more accessible, making payments easier, improving our account opening experience and helping customers better monitor their spending. We have made a commitment to invest in making these things better. In our private bank, our global NPS increased to 31, compared with 9 in 2020. This was largely due/uni00A0to an increase in our scores in Hong Kong, the US and Germany, with scores in Switzerland, the UK and Luxembourg also/uni00A0performing strongly.\n\nIn CMB, NPS rose in eight of our 13 key markets, with our rank positions in Malaysia, India, UAE and Mexico either improving or in the top three against competitors.

In addition to this, our colleagues are developing new skills and working more flexibly than ever before.\n\n## Adapting at pace\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, our colleagues adapted at pace in a fast-changing environment to provide continuity of service for our customers.

We developed e-learnings and conversation guides to help managers discuss hybrid ways of working with their teams. We also created films and communications, showcasing how leaders and colleagues were role modelling new ways of working.\n\nTo further support individual flexibility, we created a new global flexible working framework and best practice guidelines to enable all colleagues to have more choice around how and where they work.\n\nOur June 2021 Snapshot survey revealed there are five key areas our colleagues want us to get right for hybrid working to be successful:\n\n- - improve communication/uni003B\n- - o/ffer the right level of flexibility/uni003B\n- - provide fit-for-purpose technology/uni003B\n- - facilitate collaboration/uni003B and\n- - enable our leaders to lead hybrid teams.\n\nOur culture is underpinned by our values: we/uni00A0value di/fference, we succeed together, we/uni00A0take responsibility, and we get it done.\n\nIn line with this feedback, we improved technology platforms including the accelerated deployment of Microsoft Teams and improved remote internet connection capabilities. We have commenced refurbishment of buildings to support better collaboration, while ensuring the safety of our colleagues by continuing to provide social distancing measures. The future of work will remain an area of focus in 2022 and beyond.\n\nWe recognise we do not have all the answers, so we will continue to take a 'test and learn' approach, closely evaluating our success through regular feedback and business performance.\n\n## 66%\n\nof employees whose roles allow them to work remotely told us their ideal work pattern would be hybrid, according to the Snapshot employee survey in December 2021.\n\n## Spotlight on hybrid working\n\nOur colleagues in mainland China - one of the first markets to reopen following Covid-19-related restrictions - embraced our new hybrid ways of working.\n\nManagers assessed role types against a global 'workstyle' framework, which considers issues such as local laws, regulations and the need for face-to-face contact. This helped management understand and role model a balance between home and o/ffice working. Managers were then encouraged to have open discussions with their teams, supported by HR guidelines, around how individuals could be supported to work more flexibly. Following these changes, we received feedback that showed that ways of working had changed, and where roles allowed, hybrid working was now seen to be the standard way to work.",

At the end of 2021, we had 31.7% of women in senior leadership roles.\n\nAppointments of external female candidates into senior positions were 37.6%, up from 31.7% in 2020. Promotions of women into senior leadership roles were 43.2%.\n\nTalent programmes - including Accelerating Female Leaders and our Explore leadership course - have provided skills and coaching to/uni00A0help high-performing women progress their/uni00A0careers at an accelerated rate.\n\n## Gender diversity statistics\n\n| Holdings  Board                                      | 8 5     | 38% 62%   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|\n| Group                                                | 17      | 81%       |\n| Executive  Committee                                 | 4       | 19%       |\n|                                                      | 169     | 66%       |\n| Combined  executive  committee and  direct reports 1 |         |           |\n| Combined  executive  committee and  direct reports 1 | 87      | 34%       |\n| Senior  leadership                                   | 6,382   | 68%       |\n| 2                                                    | 2,968   | 32%       |\n| All employees                                        | 108,296 | 48%       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\n- 1  Combined executive committee and direct reports includes HSBC Group Executives, General Managers, Managing Directors, Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance O/fficer and their direct reports (excluding administrative sta/ff).\n- 2  Senior leadership is classified as those at band 3 and above in our global career band structure.\n\n## Our ethnicity commitments\n\nIn July 2020, we made a commitment to double the number of Black colleagues in senior leadership positions by 2025. We have focused on the UK and US markets, where most of our Black colleagues are based. In 2021 we grew our number of Black senior leaders by 17.5%.\n\nOur global campaign to invite colleagues to provide us with data on how they identify has provided us with a more robust understanding of the ethnic profile of our workforce. Using this data, in 2022 we are refining our ethnic diversity goals to work towards a diverse senior leadership representation that better reflects the communities we serve. We will maintain our focus on goals for Black senior leaders and will also establish goals for other underrepresented ethnically diverse groups.\n\nWe put in place important foundations in 2021 through leadership development programmes, inclusive hiring, and investing in the next generation of high-performing diverse talent.\n\nOur Accelerating into Leadership programme was expanded to include ethnically diverse men as well as women in middle management. In the UK, we piloted the Solaris Bridge development programme for high-performing Black women.\n\nWe have partnered with organisations that specialise in engaging ethnically diverse talent for graduate, mid-career and leadership recruitment, and request diverse candidate slates from our recruitment partners.\n\nWe are building our pipeline of future talent through grants, scholarships and internships.\n\nWe have signed up to the UK 10,000 Black Interns initiative, pledging to hire 35 interns - which is the highest number of places among all financial services companies. In the/uni00A0UK we also donated \u00a32m to the #Merky Foundation to support 30 Stormzy Scholars at/uni00A0the University of Cambridge over the next three years. In the US, we have established an/uni00A0$800,000 scholarship with the Executive Leadership Council to fund Black students interested in a career at HSBC.\n\n## Representation and pay gap reporting\n\nWe publish our gender representation, ethnicity representation and pay gap data annually to ensure we continue to make progress and to help us identify new areas for action. We have been reporting our gender representation and pay gap data for the UK since 2017. In 2020, we voluntarily extended our reporting to include ethnicity for the UK and gender for the US. In 2021, we extended this further to include ethnicity for the US and/uni00A0gender for mainland China, Hong Kong, India and Mexico. This covers 70% of our organisation, providing a clear view of overall/uni00A0representation.\n\nWhile we are confident in our approach to pay, until women and ethnically diverse colleagues are appropriately represented at every level across the organisation, and we have more complete ethnicity self-identification data, we/uni00A0will continue to see gaps in average pay. We review our pay practices regularly and work with independent third parties to review equal pay. If pay di/fferences are identified that are not due to objective, tangible reasons such/uni00A0as/uni00A0performance or skills and experience, we make adjustments.\n\nIn 2021, our median aggregate UK-wide gender pay gap, including all reported HSBC entities, was 46.7%, compared with 48.0% in 2020, and the ethnicity pay gap was -6.0%, compared with -5.6% in 2020. Our overall UK gender pay gap is driven by the shape of our\n\nUK workforce. There are more men than women in senior and higher-paid roles, and more women than men in junior roles. We also have a number of senior, global, head o/ffice roles based in the UK.\n\n- For further details on our gender representation, ethnicity representation, pay gap data, and actions/uni00A0we are taking, see www.hsbc.com/ diversitycommitments and the ESG Data Pack at/uni00A0www.hsbc.com/esg.\n\nPercentage of our senior leadership who are women\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2020: 30.3%/uni003B 2019: 29.4%/uni003B 2018: 28.2%)\n\n## 31.7%\n\n## Ethnicity declaration 52.4%\n\nColleagues who have shared their ethnic heritage with us to date, out of 91% who are/uni00A0able to do so.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity data\n\nDuring 2021, our inclusion team worked with legal, regulatory and diversity and inclusion colleagues in each of our markets to ensure we enabled as many colleagues as possible to share their data on a voluntary basis.\n\nThis was one of the biggest global initiatives we have run, and has resulted in significant engagement from colleagues sharing their ethnicity data/uni00A0so far.\n\nIt will be a multi-year process for colleagues and candidates to feel comfortable sharing their diversity data with us. We will need to demonstrate the robustness of our data security controls, deliver on our commitments to use this data to progress representation targets, identify and remove inclusion barriers and enhance our inclusion culture.",

        "page_content": "## Learning and skills development\n\nWe aim to build a dynamic, inclusive culture where colleagues can develop skills and undertake experiences that help them fulfil their potential. This determines not only how we develop our people but also how we recruit, identify and nurture talent.\n\n## Our resources\n\nWe use a range of resources to help colleagues take ownership of their development and career including:\n\n- - HSBC University is our home for learning and skills, which is accessed online and through a network of training centres. Learning is organised through technical academies aligned to businesses and functions and enterprise-wide academies.\n- - Our My HSBC Career portal o/ffers career development information and resources to help colleagues manage the various stages of their career from joining through to career/uni00A0progression.\n- - HSBC Talent Marketplace is a new online platform using artificial intelligence ('AI') to match those keen to learn specific skills while they work, with opportunities to support relevant projects alongside existing work.\n\n## Developing strong foundations\n\nWe expect all colleagues to complete global mandatory training each year. It plays a critical role in shaping our culture, ensuring a focus on the issues that are fundamental to working with us - such as sustainability, financial crime risk, and our intolerance of bullying and harassment. New joiners attend our Global Discovery programme designed to enhance their knowledge of the organisation and engage them with our purpose, values and/uni00A0strategy.\n\nAs our risks and opportunities change, our technical academies o/ffer general and targeted development. Our Risk Academy provides learning for every employee in traditional areas of risk like financial crime risk but also o/ffers more specialised development for those in high-risk roles and for emerging issues like climate risk or the ethics of AI and/uni00A0Big Data.\n\n## A focus on skills\n\nOur approach to learning is skills based. Our/uni00A0academies work with businesses and functions to identify the key skills and capabilities they need in the future. We also help colleagues identify, assess and develop the skills that match their aspirations.\n\nIn 2021, we ran a Future Skills campaign called Focus 4, encouraging colleagues to identify four skills to prioritise in their development plans. During four themed weeks colleagues attended various events that introduced them to areas such as data, digital and sustainability skills, as well as personal skills including critical thinking and resilience.\n\n## Changing how we learn\n\nColleagues can access HSBC University online via a learning platform called Degreed. This helps them identify, assess and develop skills through internal and external courses and resources in a way that suits them. Launched in 2021, usage of Degreed grew significantly through the year.\n\nDegreed materials range from short videos, articles or podcasts to packaged programmes or curated learning pathways that link content in a logical structure. Degreed changes the nature of learning, balancing time-intensive classroom learning with simple accessible and timely content. By December, more than 115,000 colleagues were registered on the platform, and in 2021, overall training volumes were up to 26.7 hours per FTE from 23 hours per FTE in 2020.\n\nMost development happens while our colleagues work. In 2021, we launched an AI-based platform called Talent Marketplace, which matches colleagues to projects and experiences based on their aspirations. By December, this had been rolled out to nearly 50,000 colleagues in the US, India, Singapore and the UK, and will be rolled out globally in/uni00A02022.\n\n## Leadership development\n\nIt remains critical to our ability to energise for growth that we manage people e/ffectively and our leaders make an impact. In recent years, we have refreshed how we provide leadership development. In 2021, we launched a new executive development curriculum for our most senior leaders, combining internal programmes and business school activities with targeted technical programmes on key topics and skills.\n\n## Retaining and identifying future talent\n\nThe starting point to identifying talent is having a recruitment process that is fair and inclusive. In February 2021, we launched inclusive hiring training to help managers make decisions in line with our hiring principles. Managers can now only hire once they have completed this training, with over 13,500 managers receiving certification in 2021.\n\nAs we reshape HSBC we recognise that managing change well is critical. To that end,/uni00A0we have committed to focusing on redeploying those colleagues impacted by restructuring. In 2021, 23% of sta/ff impacted found new jobs within HSBC, compared with 14% in 2020.\n\nOur global graduate programme welcomed 650 new colleagues to the organisation in 2021. We held a three-day virtual induction to/uni00A0help graduates understand the programme and how they can play their part in bringing our purpose, strategy and values to life.\n\nThe Group Executive Committee takes time to/uni00A0identify successors for our most critical roles. Successors undergo robust assessment and participate in executive development programmes.\n\nTraining at HSBC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraining hours carried out by our colleagues in 2021. (2020: 5.2 million)\n\n## 5.9 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New routes to opportunity\n\nOur Talent Marketplace platform helps our colleagues to open up a world of new opportunities to develop their skills, connections and careers to complement traditional learning.\n\nColleagues can create a profile that describes their skills, experience and aspirations. The system uses AI to match projects to potential candidates, providing our colleagues with an opportunity to learn and o/ffering project owners a diverse pool of talent from which to draw.\n\nHaving launched in a number of countries in 2021, Talent Marketplace is helping our colleagues to connect with each other around the world and realise new opportunities. For example, one Singapore-based colleague who wanted to improve their communication skills and was matched with a London-based project owner who needed local market knowledge and language skills.",

        "page_content": "## Listening to our colleagues\n\nWe were founded on the strength of di/fferent experiences, attributes and voices. We believe that seeking out and listening to the views of our colleagues is a fundamental part of who we are and how we work. This has been especially important in 2021, as we look to define the future of work, support colleague well-being and develop the skills to enable future success.\n\n## Listening to colleague sentiment\n\nWe run a Snapshot survey every six months and report insights to our Group Executive Committee and the Board. Results are shared across the Group to provide managers in each region with a better understanding to plan and make decisions. We complement these all-employee surveys with targeted listening activity throughout the year, and in 2022 we will move to one all-employee Snapshot survey to reduce the risk of survey fatigue.\n\nWe received 272,718 responses to our two Snapshot surveys in 2021, with a record response rate of 64% in June and 61% in December, up from 62% and 56% respectively in the same periods of 2020.\n\n## Employee listening to support our people/uni00A0priorities\n\nIn addition to our regular Snapshot surveys, we captured monthly feedback through a series of pulse surveys from September 2020 through to April 2021 to understand colleagues' views on returning to the workplace and their preferences for the future of work, with more than 60,000 participants. This feedback was complemented by a virtual focus group involving 3,400 colleagues across 20 markets in September 2021, deep-diving into hybrid working. We will continue to monitor employee attitudes and preferences for the future of work through our Snapshot\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsurveys and other targeted research. For further details on the future of work, see page/uni00A070.\n\nWe also used our Snapshot surveys and virtual focus groups to engage with colleagues about learning and skills development, with over 1,100 participants to a series of virtual focus groups in March 2021 on learning, development and skills for the future. In our December Snapshot, 76% of colleagues said that where they work, people are empowered to seek opportunities to learn and develop new skills. For further details on learning and skills development, see page 73.\n\nEmployee well-being has remained a central focus of our Snapshot research throughout 2021 with a dedicated section of each survey focused on colleague well-being. For further details on well-being, see page 76.\n\nWe also used Snapshot and pulse surveys to/uni00A0measure the progress of our refreshed purpose, strategy and values, which we launched in February 2021. By the end of 2021, 78% of colleagues said they were aware of these, and 82% of those believed that we have the right purpose, strategy and values to/uni00A0drive success (see below).\n\n## Fostering an inclusive working environment\n\nWe expect our people to treat each other with/uni00A0dignity and respect and do not tolerate bullying or harassment on any grounds.\n\nOver the past few years, we have strengthened our approach to bullying and harassment, improving our collective understanding of, and response to, these issues. In 2021, we reinforced expected standards of conduct with a refreshed\n\nglobal anti-bullying and harassment code, supplemented with local codes to reflect cultural context while maintaining consistent high standards across the Group.\n\nWe have added further anti-bullying and harassment messages to our mandatory training for all our colleagues, and continued our campaign to encourage colleagues to be 'active bystanders' and speak up when they see or experience poor behaviours or things that do not seem right.\n\nWe have mandatory local procedures for handling employee concerns, including complaints of bullying and harassment. Where/uni00A0investigations are required, we have a/uni00A0global framework setting the standards for those investigations and an additional quality assurance process. We monitor bullying and harassment cases to inform our response and/uni00A0identify actions that could prevent future/uni00A0issues. The data is reported to management committees.\n\nWe are not complacent and know that this journey continues. Our refreshed values will guide and inform our plans for 2022 to continue to create and promote an inclusive working environment.\n\n## Employee engagement and turnover\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Employee engagement   | 72% 72%   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Voluntary             | 12.7%     |\n| turnover              | 7.7%      |\n| Involuntary turnover  | 3.6% 3.8% |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Embedding our new purpose and values\n\nFollowing the launch of our new purpose and values in February 2021, we have continued to embed them in how we/uni00A0operate.\n\nAs well as building awareness through communications, we have helped leaders, teams and individuals explore how they bring them to life through workshops, webinars and team discussions. We have further embedded the new values and their associated behaviours into our learning programmes, recognition schemes and performance management processes across HSBC. We continue to find ways to make our purpose and values a cornerstone of how we communicate, conduct business and deliver employee services.\n\nAwareness of the new purpose and values has been consistently high, at 78% in June and December 2021. As evidence that the new purpose and values are becoming embedded, we had positive change in sentiment during the year. Among colleagues who were aware of our purpose and values, 76% of respondents to the December Snapshot survey believed that they will lead to meaningful changes in how we work. This was a seven point increase from the survey result in June. Similarly, a total of 77% of employees stated in December that people around them demonstrate the values in how they work, which was a seven point increase from June. Overall, 82% of aware employees believed that we have the right purpose, strategy and values to drive success.",

The employee focus index dropped by/uni00A0one point, but remained three points above the benchmark.\n\nOur response to the Covid-19 pandemic remained a strong positive driver of employee sentiment in 2021. Employee feedback frequently references flexibility and the ability to work from home as an important factor in why they would recommend HSBC as a great place to work, with employee well-being, HSBC's Covid-19 response and the working environment having the greatest positive influence on employee engagement. Looking beyond the pandemic, we will continue to focus on aspects of the wider employee experience that our research shows are the strongest drivers of employee engagement. This included ensuring that colleagues feel a sense of belonging, feel trust towards leadership, see career progression opportunities at HSBC and are confident in the company's future.\n\nOur strategy index continued to strengthen with employees increasingly confident about the future. We still trailed the benchmark by five points for employees stating that they see the positive impact of our strategy. We hope to address this through a renewed focus on our purpose and strategy as part of our 2022 employee engagement activities.\n\nWe note that voluntary turnover increased from 7.7% in 2020 to 12.7% in 2021, consistent with trends across the wider employment market. Our Snapshot survey showed a slight decrease in employees who intend to stay with HSBC for five or more years, from 65% in 2020 to 64% in 2021. Our research shows that how employees feel about their career at HSBC is a key driver of their intent to stay. Ensuring that our people have the opportunity to develop new skills and further their careers with HSBC is therefore important for retaining talent. We are reassured that against this backdrop, our career index increased by two points since 2020 and was three points above the external benchmark.\n\n## Employee engagement 72%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployee engagement index score (2020: 72%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOf colleagues feel confident about this company's future (2020: 70%)\n\n74%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOf colleagues feel they can achieve their career objectives at this company (2020: 66%)\n\n67%\n\n- For further details on how employee engagement scores, including among colleagues identifying as part of an ethnic minority or as having a disability, have an impact on executive Director remuneration scorecards, see page 268 in our corporate governance report.",

        "page_content": "## Well-being\n\nWe are deeply committed to supporting the well-being of our colleagues as we transition to new ways of working and support our colleagues through the pandemic. Guided by data and feedback from our employee surveys, our approach will continue to adapt to ensure our services remain relevant.\n\nIn 2021, our global well-being programme covered three pillars: mental, physical and financial. In 2022, we added social well-being as a fourth pillar.\n\n## Mental well-being\n\nDespite the immense challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, 82% of colleagues in our December Snapshot survey rated their mental well-being as positive, compared with 81% in 2020. However, colleagues faced challenges, with 27% asking for more support in this area. To address this, we made Headspace, a meditation app, available to all colleagues globally. Since July 2021, 23,000 colleagues have used Headspace to access guided exercises and meditations.\n\nAll colleagues took part in mental health awareness training, as part of our global mandatory training programme. We updated our mental health e-learning to help colleagues identify signs of mental ill-health in other colleagues, in both remote and face-to-face settings, as well as to help have supportive conversations with customers. Despite being voluntary the e-learning has been completed by 26,000 colleagues, with 18% of these being line managers.\n\nTo celebrate World Mental Health Day, we ran a global awareness campaign and created a film featuring colleagues sharing personal stories. Throughout October 2021, we held over 60 virtual events globally, featuring external experts providing advice on mental health-related topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe know from employee surveys that colleagues are more likely to report better mental well-being when they are physically active, have a good work-life balance, and have regular well-being conversations with their manager. We recognise there is more we can do to support these good habits and will prioritise addressing them in 2022.\n\n## Physical well-being\n\nEmployee Snapshot surveys revealed 75% of/uni00A0colleagues rated their physical well-being positively, compared with 73% in 2020. As a/uni00A0result of the pandemic, access to doctor appointments became limited in some locations. To reduce the risk of serious illnesses going undetected, we increased the/uni00A0number of markets where we o/ffered telemedicine services, allowing colleagues to/uni00A0have appointments with doctors virtually. Coverage of our workforce increased from 50% in 2020 to 66% in 2021. We have continued to provide access to private medical/uni00A0insurance in the majority of our countries, covering 98% of permanent employees. In certain countries we provide on-site medical centres that the majority of employees can access.\n\nIn June, we ran a month-long global physical well-being campaign, featuring guidance from sport ambassadors and our Chief Medical Adviser on topics including management of chronic conditions, exercise, nutrition and symptoms that should not be ignored.\n\n## Financial well-being\n\nSnapshot surveys revealed a decrease in financial well-being, with 64% of colleagues reporting positively, compared with 68% in 2020. However, colleagues felt more supported to manage their financial wellbeing, at 58%, an increase of two points, and more confident talking about their financial well-being with their line manager, at 56%, an/uni00A0increase of six points.\n\nDuring the pandemic, we preserved pay and benefits, and introduced hardship funds in some markets, which allowed colleagues to apply for financial support. In 2021, we expanded our employee banking proposition, HSBC Together, into Asia and parts of Europe, providing financial guidance and seminars in seven countries, covering 53% of colleagues.\n\nWe also introduced employee share plans in mainland China and Poland for the first time, meaning 90% of colleagues can invest in HSBC shares.\n\n## Social well-being\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, we formalised social well-being as a new pillar of our programme. This was done to address challenges around reduced in-person connections, and to continue the development of our colleagues' work-life balance.\n\nWe will prioritise promoting team cohesion in a hybrid environment, with 25% of colleagues indicating they would like better technology and support with interacting with one another. Snapshot surveys revealed 76% of colleagues say they can integrate their work and personal life positively, compared with 74% in 2020. We will continue to facilitate this by introducing flexible working policies in line with our future of work initiative (see page 69).\n\nIn 2021, we refreshed our At Our Best recognition online platform, which allows for/uni00A0real-time recognition and appreciation between colleagues. In 2021, the total number of recognitions made was 1.1 million. In 2022, we will evolve the programme to encourage more recognitions, including through access on mobile devices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal Centre for Healthy Workplace Awards 2021\n\n- Best global healthy workplace programme, multinational employer\n\n## Advocating change for positive mental health\n\nIn January 2021, we helped found and launch the Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health. It is the first global business-led initiative of its kind designed to advocate for - and accelerate - positive change for mental health in the workplace.\n\nDespite important progress in some countries, there remains a lack of evidence, best practice and tools, to e/ffectively implement global approaches to workplace mental health. This challenge is exacerbated by cultural complexities and stigma.\n\nTogether with academic experts and not-for-profit organisations, we want to create a world where all business leaders recognise, have the right tools, and commit to take tangible and evidence-based action on mental health in the workplace, enabling their workplace to thrive.\n\nThis initiative seeks to advance progress around the world by committing business leaders to a pledge to create mentally healthy workplaces, and by freely sharing insights and best practices to create a roadmap for change, wherever an organisation is on its journey.",

This year we awarded $7.4m to 26 projects, which will be distributed over two years.\n\n## Climate Solutions Partnership\n\nWorking with the World Resources Institute and WWF, we are focusing our collective e/fforts on three global themes: climate-related innovation, nature-based solutions and energy e/fficiency initiatives in Asia. We see these as having the potential to make a significant impact in the mission to achieve a net zero, resilient and sustainable future. Since 2020, we/uni00A0have provided $28.4m to our NGO partners.\n\n## Local priorities\n\nOur support for Covid-19 relief e/fforts continued in 2021, with a further $10m donated in India. Focusing on the longer-term response to the pandemic, we also launched a one-year programme with UNICEF to support the employability and financial capability of young people in Mexico, Indonesia and India.\n\n## Employee volunteering\n\nWe o/ffer paid volunteering days, and encourage our people to give time, skills and knowledge to causes within their communities. In 2021, our colleagues gave over 79,000 hours to community activities during work time.\n\n## Engagement with pressure groups\n\nWe aim to maintain a constructive dialogue on/uni00A0important topics that are often raised by/uni00A0campaigning organisations and pressure/uni00A0groups.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Skills impact bond\n\nIn 2021, we supported India's first skills impact bond, issued by the National Skills Development Corporation, a public-private partnership set up by India's Ministry of Finance. We are providing $4.3m as one of four outcome funders, who commit to pay out once the partnership achieves its stated objectives. Over the next four years, the partnership aims to equip 50,000 young people with skills and vocational training, and to help them to find employment.

Throughout 2020 and 2021, we received over 2.8 million unique visitors to our digital financial education content, making progress towards our 2019 goal of reaching 4 million unique visitors by the end of 2022. In the UK, we have a/uni00A0financial fitness score that provides individuals with an indicative score on the healthiness of their finances based on details about their spending, borrowing and saving habits, as well/uni00A0as tips to improve their financial fitness.\n\nOur financial education o/ffering is extended to our colleagues in the form of online learning modules, empowering them to improve their skills and enhance their financial well-being.

In/uni00A02021, we launched our Saving for Good programme in partnership with JA Worldwide - Injaz Al-Arab. The programme aims to equip economically vulnerable migrant workers in Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE with/uni00A0financial literacy skills to strengthen their financial resilience.\n\nWe understand the importance of building financial capability in children to ensure future resilience, and continue to collaborate with partners to deliver financial education programmes such as Money Heroes. In 2021, HSBC UK also introduced a programme to tackle the unhealthy spending habits associated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith the increased amount of gaming that young people are engaging with today. The programme featured digital tools, videos and in-school lesson plans to educate children and parents on the issue.\n\n## Inclusive design\n\nWe aim to ensure that our banking products and services are designed to be accessible for customers experiencing either temporary or permanent challenging circumstances, such as disability, impairment or a major life event. For further details on our new HSBC UK accessible card features, see page 297.\n\nWe strive to make our digital channels accessible so they are usable by everyone, regardless of ability. We have now reviewed our browser-based websites in 27 retail markets and our mobile banking services in 21 markets against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA standards, which are stipulated by the World Wide Web Consortium. We are continuing to make progress in this area.\n\nWe also want to be more explicit about catering for neurodiverse users and have launched our first Neurodiversity Guidelines. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide members of HSBC digital teams with guidance for how they should design, code and create digital content to support the needs of people who are neurodiverse.\n\nWithin our insurance business, we are redesigning the layout of our documents, adding in visual graphics and simplifying the/uni00A0language used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of our product design and our product responsibilities, please see page 83.\n\n## Supporting women and minority-led businesses\n\nWe are aiming to support our diverse customers by opening up a world of opportunity for women and minorities.

We understand it is critical to provide financial support to founders who are historically underrepresented, so that their businesses can grow and expand. Since 2019, we have also been in partnership with AllBright,\n\na/uni00A0network that helps women in business connect with funding and growth opportunities.

Progress against our ESG ambitions is reviewed through Board discussion and review of key topics such as updates on net zero, customer experience and employee sentiment. Board members receive ESG-related training as part of their ongoing development, and seek out further opportunities to build their skills and experience in this area. For further details on Board members' ESG skills and experience, see page 220. For further details on their induction and training in 2021, see page 229. Given the wide-ranging remit of ESG matters, the governance activities are managed through a combination of specialist governance infrastructure and regular meetings and committees, where appropriate. These include the Disclosure Committee, which provides oversight for the scope and\n\nGovernance forums\n\nResponsible for:\n\nResponsibility held by:\n\ncontent of ESG disclosures, and the Group People Committee, which provides oversight support for the Group's approach to performance management.\n\nFor some areas, such as climate where our approach is more advanced, dedicated governance activities exist to support the wide/uni00A0range of activities, from sustainable finance solution development in the Sustainability Execution Review Group to climate risk management in the Climate Risk/uni00A0Oversight Forum.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk and Compliance O/fficer and the chief risk o/fficers of our Prudential Regulation Authority-regulated businesses are the senior managers responsible for climate financial risks under the UK Senior Managers Regime. The chief risk o/fficers attend Board meetings and where appropriate provide regular verbal and written updates to the\n\nBoard and Group Executive Committee. Climate risks are also considered in the Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee, with scheduled updates provided, as well as detailed reviews of material matters, such as climate-related stress testing exercises.\n\nThe below table details the main specialist governance forums, their responsibilities and the responsible executives for the management of ESG matters. We expect that our ESG governance approach is likely to continue to develop, in line with our evolving approach to ESG matters and stakeholder expectations. The Board is regularly provided with specific updates on ESG matters, including the thermal coal phase-out policy and exposures, human rights, and employee well-being.\n\n| Supports Group Executives in the development and  delivery of ESG strategy, key policies and material  commitments by providing oversight, coordination   and management of ESG commitments and activities                                                                               | Group Chief Sustainability O/fficer  and/uni00A0Group Company Secretary and  Chief Governance O/fficer   | ESG Committee (new)                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Oversees the delivery of our ambition to provide and  facilitate $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and  investment, and realisation of commercial opportunities                                                                                                                      | Group Chief Executive                                                                                    | Sustainability Execution  Review Group (new) |\n| Oversees employee engagement, diversity and  inclusion, community engagement, customer  satisfaction, and social considerations for stakeholders                                                                                                                                         | Group Chief Human Resources  O/fficer/uni00A0and Group Chief  Communications O/fficer                    | Social management forums                     |\n| Oversees subsidiaries, business conduct and ethics,  corporate governance, whistleblowing, reputational  factors, data privacy and human rights                                                                                                                                          | Group Chief Risk and Compliance  O/fficer and Group Company Secretary  and Chief Governance O/fficer     | Governance management  forums                |\n| Oversees the global delivery of ESG activities within our  own operations, services and technology elements of  our strategy                                                                                                                                                             | Group Chief Operating O/fficer                                                                           | Digital Business Services  ESG/uni00A0Forum  |\n| Supports global leadership in promoting, enhancing   and reflecting human rights in execution of the Group's  strategic goals, as well as developing the Group's  Human Rights, and Modern Slavery and Human  Tra/fficking statements and associated oversight  of/uni00A0implementation | Group Chief Risk and  Compliance/uni00A0O/fficer                                                         | Human Rights Steering  Committee             |\n| Oversees all global risk activities relating to climate  risk/uni00A0management, including physical and transition  risks.

        "page_content": "## Our respect for human rights\n\nAs set out in our Human Rights Statement, we follow the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights ('UNGPs'). In 2021, with the help of external stakeholders, we continued to review and improve our approach.\n\n## Our priorities on human rights\n\nWe respect all categories of/uni00A0human rights in the Universal Declaration of/uni00A0Human Rights. We focus our attention on those rights we assess as most likely to be a/ffected by our business activities and by those of our customers and suppliers.\n\nSuch assessment takes account of a range of factors, including geographical and cultural context and economic sectors, and is subject to periodic review. After a policy review and prioritisation process, including consultation across key business units, we identified discrimination and modern slavery as the two priority human rights issues on which we could use our influence to make the most positive impact. These priorities also align closely with our commitments on diversity and inclusion and those we have made under the UN Global Compact and under the WEF metrics on risk for incidents of child and forced or compulsory labour.\n\n- For further details on our approach to tackling discrimination, see www.hsbc.com/ diversitycommitments. For further details on our/uni00A0work on inclusion in the workplace, see 'Inclusion' on page 71.\n- For further details of our approach to tackling modern slavery, including steps taken to eliminate child and forced labour practices, see/uni00A0www.hsbc.com/modernslaveryact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our priority human rights issues in 2021\n\n| Issues         |                   | Our  employees   | Suppliers'  employees   | Customers   | Communities   |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Discrimination | In the  workplace | \u25c6                | \u25c6                       |             | \u25c6             |\n|                | In our services   |                  |                         | \u25c6           |               |\n| Modern slavery |                   | \u25c6                | \u25c6                       | \u25c6           | \u25c6             |\n\n## Sector policies\n\nTo meet our responsibility for respecting human rights under the UNGPs, we consider those rights that may be adversely impacted through involvement in high-risk sectors. Our sector policies for agricultural commodities, energy, forestry, mining and metals all refer specifically to human rights. These considerations include issues such as forced labour, harmful or exploitative child labour, tra/fficking, land rights, the rights of indigenous peoples such as 'free prior and informed consent', workers' rights, and the health and safety of communities.\n\nOur policy for financing forest plantations and downstream supply chain operations in, or sourced from, high-risk countries is linked to/uni00A0certification by the Forestry Stewardship Council or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. Through our membership of international certification schemes such as the Forestry Stewardship Council, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Equator Principles, we actively support the continual improvement of standards aimed at respecting human rights.\n\n## Financial crime controls\n\nThe risk of us causing, contributing or being linked to negative human rights impacts is also mitigated by our financial crime framework, with global policies to mitigate money laundering, sanctions, and bribery and corruption risks, including those where protecting human rights and preventing financial crime converge. Our financial crime controls include customer due diligence, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, negative news screening, and targeted investigations.\n\n- For further details of how we fight financial crime, see www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/ esg-and-responsible-business/fightingfinancial-crime.\n- For further details of our policy prohibitions and other financing restrictions, see our sectorspecific sustainability risk policies at www.hsbc. com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsible-business/ managing-risk/sustainability-risk.\n\n## Sustainable finance and the just transition\n\nOur leading role in providing and facilitating sustainable finance to businesses around the world is another way in which we contribute to the rights of the communities we serve. We support the drive/uni00A0for a 'just transition' to net zero, harnessing political momentum for action with policies and finance to support disadvantaged sectors and communities. On 29 October 2021, we joined other private sector institutions in signing up to the WEF Just and Urgent Energy Transition principles.\n\nWe are also harnessing our leadership position in sustainable finance to create products that will help our clients to support social development, mobility and capability building in line with International Capital Markets Association social bonds principles released in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of how we support our customers with sustainable finance, see 'Supporting customers through the transition' on page 53.",

We built on this experience in developing access to banking services for customers in the UK and/uni00A0in Hong Kong with no fixed abode.\n\nIn Hong Kong, we also introduced basic banking services for ethnic minority customers who do not speak English or Chinese. The service allows ethnic minorities who speak Hindi, Punjabi, Nepali and Urdu to open a Hong Kong Dollar Statement Savings account, by providing tailored material in each of the four languages. In addition, we hired part-time ethnic minority customer service ambassadors to o/ffer further support at six designated branches. In May 2021, the Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission named HSBC a Gold Awardee in the inaugural Equal Opportunity Employer Recognition scheme, which recognises organisations for setting an example in promoting and implementing equal opportunities employment policies.\n\nThese initiatives support several di/fferent human rights, such as the right to adequate living standards and the right to own property. As well as benefiting the communities we serve in the UK and Hong Kong, these initiatives allowed us to work alongside local/uni00A0non-governmental organisations, learning from their understanding of human/uni00A0rights impacts.\n\nWe are committed to working with governments to help create inclusive communities. In 2021, we supported the development of regulation related to human rights, including as an adviser to the UK Government on developing their online Registry of Statements under the Modern Slavery Act.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nIn 2021, as part of an internal survey of senior executives, we gathered information from across our network on our engagement with civil society stakeholders and those who represent individuals or groups at risk of impact from our activities or from the activities of those with whom we have business relationships. As a result of this work, we acknowledged the need to expand our engagement in future. We also took steps to ensure that our approach to human rights was well understood by our colleagues. In 2021:\n\n- - We o/ffered a detailed course on human tra/fficking to new employees in the Global Risk Operations function, highlighting the importance of identification and reporting.\n- - We provided detailed briefings to more than 250 senior colleagues on human rights and the UNGPs.\n- - We provided training materials to colleagues in our Procurement team on/uni00A0modern slavery.\n- - We delivered training on antidiscrimination as part of our diversity and/uni00A0inclusion programme.\n\nAs we develop our approach to human rights, we will focus on training modules for our colleagues, supplemented by role-specific training. We also intend to improve the process for our suppliers to ensure that the key elements of our ethical code of conduct that relate to human rights are clearly and regularly communicated. For retail customers, we aim to communicate our approach and expectations through our public statements, and for our business customers, we aim to integrate our approach to human rights more clearly into/uni00A0our processes.\n\nIn developing the initiatives described above, we drew upon expertise from within our organisation, including the insights of specialist sta/ff in key departments and of 200 senior executives from every part of our network. We also engaged the support of external advisers with expertise in human rights as they relate to business.",

        "page_content": "## Conduct: Our product responsibilities\n\nFollowing the refresh of our purpose and values, we have taken the opportunity to align and simplify our conduct approach, making conduct easier to understand and showing how it fulfils our value 'we take responsibility'.\n\nOur conduct approach guides us to do the right thing and to focus on the impact we have/uni00A0on our customers and the financial markets in which we operate. It focuses on/uni00A0five clear outcomes:\n\n- - We understand our customers' needs.\n- - We provide products and services that o/ffer a fair exchange of value.\n- - We serve customers' ongoing needs, and will put it right if we make a mistake.\n- - We act with integrity in the financial markets we operate in.\n- - We operate with resilience and security to avoid harm to customers and markets.\n\nOur conduct approach is embedded into the way we develop, distribute, structure and execute products and services. For further details of our approach to conduct, see page/uni00A0208.\n\n## Designing products and services\n\nOur approach to product design and development - including how we advertise our/uni00A0products - is set out in our policies, and provides a clear basis from which strategic product and service decisions can be made. Our global businesses each take the following/uni00A0approach:\n\n- - We carry out robust testing during the design and development of a product to help ensure there is an identifiable need in/uni00A0the market.\n- - We consider the complexity of products and/uni00A0the possible financial risks to customers when determining the target market.\n- - We o/ffer a carefully selected range of products that are managed through product inventories, helping to ensure they continue to meet customers' needs and continue to deliver a fair exchange of value.\n- - We regularly review products to help ensure they remain relevant and perform in line with expectations we have set.\n- - Where products do not meet our customers' needs or no longer meet our high standards, improvements are made or they are withdrawn from sale.\n- - Wherever possible, we act on feedback from our customers to provide better and more accessible products and services.\n\nOur GBM business also considers our impact on the integrity of markets when introducing new products.\n\nOversight of product design and sales is provided by governance committees chaired and attended by senior executives who are accountable for ensuring we manage risks appropriately, and within appetite, to ensure fair customer outcomes.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to develop our product governance. In CMB, we deployed our new Google Cloud-based product inventory, which has improved the way we manage our products. Our product management and governance system supports our colleagues throughout the product lifecycle, from product development to demise. In GBM's markets business, we continued to focus on the development of our ESG product suite across all asset classes, ensuring we maintain our position as an innovator of ESG products.\n\nIn WPB, we are developing our sustainable product suite, and remain committed to help mitigate against greenwashing risks. For further details on the Group's sustainable finance and investment ambition, see page 53.\n\n## Managing incentives for front-line colleagues\n\nIn WPB, we continued to apply a discretionary approach to incentivising our front-line colleagues rather than applying a formulaic link to sales. Following the review of incentives during 2020, we continued to embed the changes with the aim to be even more customer-centric and focused on employee development. We also continued to strengthen our approach to third-party sales agents that distribute our products, such as insurance and retail, to ensure that our principles on balanced reward are in place. While there is still more to do, this change is designed to improve oversight and alignment with third-party sales agents.\n\nIn our CMB and GBM businesses, we recognise and reward exceptional conduct demonstrated by our colleagues while discouraging misconduct and inappropriate behaviour that exposes us to financial, regulatory and reputational risks. During the annual pay review, we apply adjustments to variable pay to employees who exhibit either exceptional behaviours, or behaviours not aligned to our values. In addition, the businesses have specific goals to help drive conduct outcomes and ensure they are incorporated into how employees achieve their goals. CMB has created a scorecard reference guide, and GBM has specific mandatory conduct objectives applicable to all global GBM colleagues.\n\n## Meeting our customers' needs\n\nOur customers' interests are at the centre of everything we do, and we have policies and procedures in place that set the standards required to protect them. These include:\n\n- - providing information on products and services that is clear, fair and not misleading/uni003B\n- - enabling customers to understand the key features of products and services, especially the risks, exclusions and limitations/uni003B\n- - enabling customers to make informed decisions before purchasing a product or service/uni003B and\n- - checking that customers are o/ffered appropriate products and, where relevant, received the right advice.\n\n## Supporting customers with enhanced care needs\n\nOur strategy to support customers with enhanced care needs continues to be a core focus. We have guidelines and have developed procedures to ensure we provide the right outcomes for customers who may require enhanced care. We have made a number of improvements to our products, services, governance and oversight, as well as developed our colleagues' skills and capabilities.\n\nIn our CMB business in the UK, we identify customers with enhanced care needs to ensure we tailor our approach in our communications, services and product design. This is supported by post-sale calls with these customers to ensure we identify and support their needs fairly. In our UK retail branches, we have launched a daily quiet hour to help those needing access to banking in a calmer environment.

This is achieved through measures such as:\n\n- - a globally consistent risk rating methodology for investment products, which is customised for local regulatory requirements/uni003B and\n- - a thorough customer risk profiling methodology to assess customers' financial objectives, attitudes towards risk, financial ability to bear investment risk, and knowledge and experience.\n\nIn WPB, sales quality and mystery shopping reviews assess whether customers receive a fair outcome. If any issues are identified, we investigate the root cause, put things right and/uni00A0act to reduce the risk of the issue occurring again.\n\nIn CMB, we operate focused sales outcome testing to ensure that we correctly explain product features and pricing. We look at di/fferent customer needs and circumstances, particularly where customers may have enhanced needs. In 2021, we identified issues relating to documentation, sales process and pricing. Subsequently we ensured we put things right for our customers and took the necessary internal action.\n\n## Supporting customers during Covid-19\n\nWe responded rapidly to the changing environment caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Many of our personal banking and wealth customers needed financial relief as a result of the pandemic, which we sought to address in a responsible way. We provided significant financial relief to our WPB customers in several markets. These solutions varied by market and were aligned with government or regulatory guidance in each jurisdiction. At its peak in 2021, we had payment relief measures o/ffered to 1.6 million customers, which equated to $31bn in balances. We support customers that are in/uni00A0arrears or experiencing financial di/fficulty, in/uni00A0line with our policies and procedures.\n\nIn our CMB business, we made more than 56 Covid-19-related enhancements to products in/uni00A0specific countries. We continue to review these to ensure they remain appropriate. We/uni00A0aim to support our customers as and when any relief products are demised.\n\nIn Asia, given the ongoing Covid-19 environment, our CMB business temporarily enabled manual payments processes in Bangladesh, India and Maldives to support relevant customers and ensure continuity of services and payment handling.\n\nIn GBM's markets business, we undertake sample-based testing on sales of products to customers to ensure that product features and pricing have been correctly explained and sales processes have been adhered to. Feedback is collated centrally and acted upon in a timely manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transition from Ibor\n\nAs a result of the planned cessation of the London interbank o/ffered rates ('Libor'), Euro Overnight Index Average ('Eonia') and other benchmarks collectively known as Ibors, we are ensuring that we have the product capability in place to support our customers on the transition to alternative rates. We aim to clearly outline the options available to our customers holding existing Ibor-based products, and/uni00A0our commercial strategy is designed to minimise value transfer when transitioning their products from Ibor to/uni00A0alternative rates.\n\nTransition from Libor and Eonia benchmarks to alternative risk-free rates ('RFRs') progressed significantly over 2021 and all industry cessation milestones were met. We continued to proactively support the transition, or inclusion of contractual fallback provisions where more appropriate, of customers' legacy contracts referencing sterling, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc Libor to RFR products, or other alternatives, by the end of 2021. We completed this transition in line with regulatory expectations and met our goal of transitioning more than 90% of contracts by the end of 2021, with the balance continuing to be actively transitioned in early 2022 ahead of the next interest rate reset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of the transition from\n\nIbors, see 'Ibor transition' in the Risk section on page 126.\n\n## Training our colleagues to support our customers\n\nIn WPB, we provide training to our employees through our product management academy. In 2021, more than 750 of our colleagues completed over 2,000 courses, relating to customer insight, customer-focused design, communications, product development, balance sheet management and governance. We created global training, with over 60,000 courses completed by colleagues to manage situations for customers with enhanced care needs, assigning to both customerfacing and non-customer-facing colleagues.\n\nIn CMB, we focused on training all our UK-based colleagues on meeting the needs of customers who require enhanced care due to their circumstances. We delivered tailored training to our product managers to/uni00A0ensure that customers with enhanced care needs are considered across each stage of the product lifecycle.\n\nIn GBM, we continued to develop and roll out interactive conduct training that focuses on behaviour. Following the successful completion of the training by 21,000 colleagues early in 2021, this has now been adapted to cover joiners and those who have taken on a new management role.",

Failure to protect our operations from cyber-attacks may result in financial loss, disruption for customers or loss/uni00A0of data. This could negatively a/ffect our/uni00A0reputation and ability to attract and retain/uni00A0customers.\n\n## Prevent, detect and mitigate\n\nWe invest in business and technical controls to/uni00A0help prevent, detect and mitigate cyber threats. We apply a 'defence in depth' approach to cyber controls, recognising the/uni00A0complexity of our environment. Our abilities to/uni00A0detect and respond to attacks through round-the-clock security operations centre capabilities help to reduce the impact of/uni00A0attacks.\n\nWe continually evaluate threat levels for the most prevalent attack types and their potential outcomes. We have an internal cyber intelligence and threat analysis capability, which proactively collects and analyses external cyber information. We input into the broader cyber intelligence community through technical expertise in investigations and contributions to the cyber-sharing ecosystem in the financial services industry, alongside government agencies around the world.\n\nAs we continue to grow and digitise at scale, we may be exposed to new cyber threats. In 2021, we further strengthened our cyber defences and enhanced our cybersecurity capabilities to help reduce the likelihood and impact of advanced malware, security vulnerabilities being exploited, data leakage and unauthorised access. These defences are grounded in controls that help to mitigate cyber-attacks and build upon a proactive data analytical approach to help identify advanced targeted threats.\n\n## Policy and governance\n\nWe have a comprehensive range of cybersecurity policies and systems designed to help ensure that the organisation is well managed, with oversight and control.\n\nWe operate a three lines of defence model, aligned to the operational risk management framework, to help ensure oversight and challenge of our cybersecurity capabilities and/uni00A0priorities.\n\nIn the first line of defence, we have risk owners within global businesses and functions who are accountable for identifying, owning and managing the cyber risk. They work with control owners to help ensure controls are in place to mitigate issues, prevent risk events from occurring and resolve them if needed. These controls are executed in line with policies produced by our Resilience Risk teams, the second line of defence, which provide independent review and challenge. They are overseen by the Global Internal Audit function, the third line of defence.\n\nWe regularly report and review cyber risk and control e/ffectiveness at relevant governance forums and to the Board to help ensure visibility and oversight.

Our Group-wide privacy policy and principles aim to provide a consistent global approach to managing data privacy risk, and must be applied by all of our global businesses and global functions. Our privacy principles are available at www.hsbc. com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsiblebusiness/managing-risk/operational-risk.\n\nWe conduct regular employee training and awareness sessions on data privacy and security issues throughout the year, including global mandatory training for all our colleagues, along with additional training sessions, where required, to keep abreast of new developments in this space.\n\nWe provide transparency to our customers and stakeholders on how we collect, use and/uni00A0manage their personal data, and their associated rights. Where relevant, we work closely with third parties to help ensure adequate protections are provided, in line with our data privacy policy and as required under data privacy law. We o/ffer a broad range of channels in the markets where we operate, through which customers and stakeholders can raise any concerns regarding the privacy of their data.\n\nOur dedicated privacy teams report to the highest level of management on data privacy risks and issues, and oversee our global data privacy programmes. We review data privacy\n\nregularly at multiple governance forums, including at Board level, to help ensure there is/uni00A0appropriate challenge and visibility among senior executives. As part of our three lines of defence model, our Global Internal Audit function provides independent assurance as to whether our data privacy risk management approaches and processes are/uni00A0designed and operating e/ffectively. In addition, we have established data privacy governance structures, and continue to embed accountability across all businesses and functions.\n\nWe continue to implement industry practices for data privacy and security. Our privacy teams work closely with industry bodies and research institutions to drive the design, implementation and monitoring of privacy solutions. We conduct regular reviews and privacy risk assessments, and continue to develop solutions to strengthen our data privacy controls. In 2021, we implemented new tooling to improve accountability for data privacy. We have procedures to articulate the actions needed to deal with data privacy considerations. These include notifying regulators, customers or other data subjects, as required under applicable privacy laws and regulations, in the event of a reportable incident occurring.\n\n## Intellectual property rights practices\n\nWe have policies, controls and guidance to manage risk relating to intellectual property. This is to ensure that intellectual property is/uni00A0identified, maintained and protected appropriately, and to help ensure we do not infringe third-party intellectual property rights/uni00A0during the course of business and/ or/uni00A0operation.\n\n## Our approach with our suppliers\n\nWe have globally consistent standards and procedures for the onboarding and use of external suppliers. We require suppliers to meet our compliance and financial stability requirements, and to comply with our supplier ethical code of conduct.\n\n## Ethical code of conduct\n\nWe have an ethical and environmental code of conduct for suppliers of goods and services, which must be complied with by all suppliers. The code of conduct provides suppliers with an outline for economic, environmental and social standards and the requirements for having a reasonable governance and management structure.\n\nAt the end of 2021, we had approximately 9,600 contracted suppliers. In 2021, we had 8,144 engagements with suppliers that\n\nresulted in either the confirmation that they adhered to our code of conduct or that their own code of conduct had been reviewed and accepted by Strategic Procurement Services.\n\n## Managing environmental and social risk\n\nWe use an ESG reputational risk tool to identify environmental and social risk for supplier engagements with a contract value over $500,000. The tool provides an ESG reputational risk score for the supplier. In 2021, 2,248 ESG reputational risk assessments were undertaken. A high-risk score drives a manual review to assess the extent of the risk and whether we are willing to accept the heightened risk and onboard the supplier. We are reviewing the reputational risk process to ensure we focus on sectors with high ESG risk going forward.\n\nThese policies and controls support our management of intellectual property risk, and/uni00A0operate to help ensure that intellectual property risk is controlled consistently and e/ffectively in line with our risk appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The ethical use of Big Data and AI\n\nBig Data technologies and artificial intelligence give us the ability to process and analyse data at a depth and breadth not previously possible. While this technology o/ffers significant potential benefits for our customers, it also poses potential ethical risks for the financial services industry and society as a whole. We have developed a set of principles to help us consider and address the ethical issues that could arise. HSBC's Principles for the Ethical Use of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence are available at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/our-conduct.\n\nWe formalise commitments to the ethical code with clauses in our suppliers' contracts, which support the right to audit and act if a breach is/uni00A0discovered.\n\nIn 2021, we produced an internal toolkit to explain how Strategic Procurement Services can integrate net zero initiatives into everyday procurement activity. The toolkit, which outlines our net zero ambition and provides practical guidance on how Strategic Procurement Services can improve the way it drives net zero initiatives, is available to our\n\nteams globally to ensure a consistent approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For further details of the number of suppliers by geographical region, see the ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.",

These financial crime risks include money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions/uni00A0breaches, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.\n\nWe are committed to acting with integrity and have built a strong financial crime risk management framework across all global businesses and all countries and territories in which we operate. The financial crime risk framework, which is overseen by the Board, is/uni00A0supported by our holistic financial crime policies that enable adherence to applicable laws and regulations globally.\n\nAnnual mandatory training is provided to all colleagues, with additional targeted training tailored to certain individuals. We carry out regular risk assessments, identifying where we need to respond to evolving financial crime threats, as well as conducting monitoring and testing of our financial crime programme, with applicable findings included within our policies and framework.\n\nWe continue to invest in new technology such as contextual monitoring in our trade finance business, the enhancement of our fraud monitoring and market surveillance capabilities, and the application of machine learning to improve the accuracy and timeliness of our detection capabilities.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nWe want colleagues and stakeholders to have confidence in speaking up when they observe unlawful or unethical behaviour. We o/ffer a range of speak-up channels to listen to their concerns and have a zero tolerance for acts of/uni00A0retaliation. However, we recognise that sometimes people may still not be comfortable using these routes.\n\n## Listening through whistleblowing channels\n\nOur global whistleblowing channel, HSBC Confidential, allows our colleagues and stakeholders to raise concerns confidentially and, if preferred, anonymously (subject to local/uni00A0laws).\n\nIn the majority of countries, HSBC Confidential concerns are raised through an independent third-party provider that o/ffers 24/7 hotlines and a multiple language web portal to our colleagues. We also provide an external email address for concerns about accounting, internal financial controls or auditing matters (accountingdisclosures@hsbc.com).\n\nWe pay due care and attention to ethical questions when considering the use of AI. We are confident our adoption of these new technologies will continue to enhance our ability to respond quickly to suspicious activity and be more granular in our risk assessments, helping to protect our customers and the integrity of the financial system.\n\n## Our anti-bribery and corruption policy\n\nOur global anti-bribery and corruption policy requires that all activity must be: conducted without intent to bribe or corrupt/uni003B reasonable and transparent/uni003B considered to not be lavish nor disproportionate to the professional relationship/uni003B appropriately documented with business rationale/uni003B and authorised at an appropriate level of seniority. There were no concluded, nor live active, legal cases regarding bribery or corruption brought against HSBC or its employees in 2021.\n\nOur global anti-bribery and corruption policy requires that we identify and mitigate the risk of our customers and third parties committing bribery or corruption. We utilise anti-money laundering controls, including customer due diligence and transaction monitoring, to identify and mitigate the risk that our customers are involved in bribery or corruption. We perform a bribery risk assessment on all third parties, and impose risk-based controls on the third parties that expose us to bribery or corruption risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on our financial crime risk management framework, see page 208.\n\nIn 2021, while we continued to actively promote speak-up opportunities, the volume of HSBC Confidential concerns reduced by 11%, driven in part, we believe, by the continued change to the working environment during the Covid-19 pandemic. Of the HSBC Confidential concerns closed in 2021, 87% related to colleagues' behaviour and personal conduct concerns, 9% to security and fraud risks, 3% to compliance risks and less than 1% to other issues.\n\nConcerns are investigated proportionately and independently, with action taken where appropriate. Actions can include disciplinary action, dismissal, and adjustments to variable pay and performance ratings.\n\nCompliance sets whistleblowing policy and procedures, and provides the Group Audit Committee with periodic reports on the e/ffectiveness of whistleblowing arrangements. These reports are informed by first line of defence control assessments, second line assurance reviews and third line internal and external audit reports.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The scale of our work\n\nEach month, on average, we monitor over 1.1 billion transactions for signs of financial crime. During 2021, we filed over 56,000 suspicious activity reports to law enforcement and regulatory authorities where we identified potential financial crime. In addition, we screen approximately 116 million customer records monthly for sanctions exposure.\n\n## 99%\n\nTotal percentage of employees who have received training on the organisation's anti-corruption policies and procedures.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee has overall oversight of whistleblowing arrangements.

        "page_content": "## A responsible approach to tax\n\nWe seek to pay our fair share of tax in all jurisdictions in which we operate and to minimise the likelihood of customers using our/uni00A0products and services to evade or inappropriately avoid tax. We also abide by international protocols that a/ffect our organisation. Our approach to tax and governance processes is designed to achieve/uni00A0these goals.\n\nThrough adoption of the Group's risk management framework, we have put in place regularly maintained controls. These aim to ensure, among other things, that we do not adopt inappropriately tax-motivated transactions or products and that tax planning is scrutinised and supported by genuine commercial activity. HSBC has no appetite for using aggressive tax structures. We continue to commit to making a significant investment globally in implementation and maintenance of appropriate tax risk processes and controls.\n\nWith respect to our own taxes, we are guided by the following principles:\n\n- - We are committed to applying both the letter and spirit of the law. This includes adherence to a variety of measures arising\n\nfrom the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative.\n\n- - We seek to have open and transparent relationships with all tax authorities. Given the size and complexity of our organisation, which operates across over 60 jurisdictions, a number of areas of di/ffering interpretation or disputes with tax authorities exist at any point in time. We cooperate with the relevant local tax authorities to mutually agree and resolve these in a timely manner.\n- - We have applied the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Pillar 2 guidance to identify those jurisdictions in which we operate that have nil or low tax rates (15% or below). We have identified 14 such jurisdictions in which we had active subsidiaries during 2021. We continually monitor the number of active subsidiaries within each jurisdiction as part of our ongoing entity rationalisation programme. We ensure that our entities active in nil or low tax jurisdictions have clear business rationale for why they are based in these locations and appropriate transparency over their activities.\n\nWith respect to our customers' taxes, we are guided by the following principles:\n\n- - We have made considerable investment implementing processes designed to enable us to support external tax transparency initiatives and reduce the risk of banking services being used to facilitate customer tax evasion. Initiatives include the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information ('Common Reporting Standard'), and the UK legislation on the corporate criminal o/ffence of failing to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion.\n- - We implement processes that aim to ensure/uni00A0that inappropriately tax-motivated products and services are not provided to/uni00A0our customers.\n\n## Our tax contributions\n\nThe e/ffective tax rate for the year was 22.3%. Further details are provided on page 338.\n\nAs highlighted below, in addition to paying $6.3bn of our own tax liabilities during 2021, we collected taxes of $9.2bn on behalf of governments around the world. A more detailed geographical breakdown of the taxes paid in 2021 is provided in the ESG Data Pack.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Other duties and levies includes property taxes of $126m (2020: $129m).\n\n## Acting with integrity\n\nWe aim to act with courageous integrity and learn from past events to prevent their recurrence. We recognise that restoration of trust in our industry remains a significant challenge as past misdeeds continue to be in the spotlight. But it is a challenge we must meet successfully. We owe this not just to our customers and to society at large, but to our colleagues to ensure they can be rightly proud of/uni00A0the organisation where they work.\n\nWe aim to make decisions based on doing the right thing for our customers and never compromising our ethical standards or integrity.\n\nFurther information regarding the measures that we have taken to prevent the recurrence of past mistakes can be found at www.hsbc.com/ who-we-are/esg-and-responsible-business/ esg-reporting-and-policies.\n\nA chart reflecting fines and penalties arising out/uni00A0of significant investigations involving criminal, regulatory, competition or other law enforcement authorities, and costs relating to payment protection insurance remediation is available in the ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.",

These measures include those derived from our reported results that eliminate factors that distort year-on-year comparisons. The 'adjusted performance' measure used throughout this report is described below. Definitions and calculations of other alternative performance measures are included in our 'Reconciliation of alternative performance measures' on page 117. All alternative performance measures are reconciled to the closest reported performance measure.\n\nThe global business segmental results are presented on an adjusted basis in accordance with IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' as detailed in Note 10 'Segmental analysis' on page 341.\n\n## Adjusted performance\n\nAdjusted performance is computed by adjusting reported results for the effects of foreign currency translation differences and significant items, which both distort year-on-year comparisons.\n\nWe consider adjusted performance provides useful information for investors by aligning internal and external reporting, identifying and quantifying items management believes to be significant, and providing insight into how management assesses year-on-year performance.\n\n## Significant items\n\n'Significant items' refers collectively to the items that management and investors would ordinarily identify and consider separately to improve the understanding of the underlying trends in the business.\n\nThe tables on pages 98 to 101 and pages 108 to 113 detail the effects of significant items on each of our global business segments, geographical regions and selected countries/territories in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Foreign currency translation differences\n\nForeign currency translation differences reflect the movements of the US dollar against most major currencies during 2021.\n\nWe exclude them to derive constant currency data, allowing us to assess balance sheet and income statement performance on a like-for-like basis and better understand the underlying trends in the business.\n\n## Foreign currency translation differences\n\nForeign currency translation differences for 2021 are computed by retranslating into US dollars for non-US dollar branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates:\n\n- \u00b7 the income statements for 2020 and 2019 at the average rates of exchange for 2021; and\n- \u00b7 the balance sheets at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 at the prevailing rates of exchange on 31 December 2021.\n\nNo adjustment has been made to the exchange rates used to translate foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities into the functional currencies of any HSBC branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates. The constant currency data of HSBC's Argentinian subsidiaries have not been adjusted further for the impacts of hyperinflation.\n\nWhen reference is made to foreign currency translation differences in tables or commentaries, comparative data reported in the functional currencies of HSBC's operations have been translated at the appropriate exchange rates applied in the current period on the basis described above.\n\n## Future accounting developments\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' was issued in May 2017, with amendments to the standard issued in June 2020. It has been adopted for use in the EU but not yet for use in the UK. The standard sets out the requirements that an entity should apply in accounting for insurance contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it holds. Following the amendments, IFRS 17 is effective from 1 January 2023. The Group is in the process of implementing IFRS 17. Industry practice and interpretation of the standard are still developing. Therefore, the likely impact of its implementation remains uncertain. We expect to provide an update on the likely impacts on our insurance business at or around our 2022 interim results announcement. For the purpose of planning the Group's financial resources, our initial assumption (based on analysis of the expected 2022 position) is that the accounting changes may result in a reduction in the reported profit of our insurance business by approximately two thirds on the transition to IFRS 17, albeit with a range of expected outcomes. A similar impact is expected on the equity of the insurance business, primarily reflecting the elimination of the present value of in-force business ('PVIF') asset and creation of the contractual service margin (the latter impacting tangible equity). The return on average ordinary shareholders' equity ('RoE') of the insurance business is not expected to be significantly impacted. At 31 December 2021, the equity associated with our insurance manufacturing operations was $17.0bn, including PVIF assets of $9.5bn and an associated deferred tax liability of $1.6bn. These assumptions may change significantly in the period prior to adoption of the standard.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe results of HSBC reflect the choice of accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of HSBC's consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting policies, including the policies which include critical accounting estimates and judgements, are described in Note 1.2 on the financial statements. The accounting policies listed below are highlighted as they involve a high degree of uncertainty and have a material impact on the financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment of amortised cost financial assets and financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI'): The most significant judgements relate to defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk, determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of revolving facilities, and making assumptions and estimates to incorporate relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of economic conditions. A high degree of uncertainty is involved in making estimations using assumptions that are highly subjective and very sensitive to the risk factors. See Note 1.2(i) on page 323.\n- \u00b7 Deferred tax assets: The most significant judgements relate to judgements made in respect of expected future profitability. See Note 1.2(l) on page 327.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of financial instruments: In determining the fair value of financial instruments a variety of valuation techniques are used, some of which feature significant unobservable inputs and are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Note 1.2(c) on page 321.\n- \u00b7 Impairment of interests in associates: Impairment testing involves significant judgement in determining the value in use, and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment, based on a number of management assumptions. The most significant judgements relate to the impairment testing of our",

See Note 1.2(a) on page 319.\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment of goodwill and non-financial assets: A high degree of uncertainty is involved in estimating the future cash flows of the cash-generating units ('CGUs') and the rates used to discount these cash flows. See Note 1.2(a) on page 319.\n- \u00b7 Provisions: Significant judgement may be required due to the high degree of uncertainty associated with determining whether a present obligation exists, and estimating the probability and amount of any outflows that may arise.

This reflected lower average market interest rates across the major currencies compared with 2020. This was partly offset by interest income associated with the increase in average interest-earning assets ('AIEA') of $116.6bn or 5.6%.\n\nExcluding the favourable effects of foreign currency translation differences, net interest income decreased by $1.8bn or 6.2%.\n\nNII for the fourth quarter was $6.8bn, up 2.4% compared with the previous year. The increase was driven by a change in funding composition leading to a reduction of debt securities and an increase in lower-yielding customer deposits. This was partly offset by lower interest income  on AIEA, primarily driven by a shift of balances from financial investments to lower yielding short-term funds, and reduced yields on customer loans. Compared with the previous quarter, NII was up 2.5%. The increase was mainly driven by higher interest rates on other interest-earning assets as well as growth in AIEA.\n\nNet interest margin ('NIM') for 2021 of 1.20% was 12 basis points ('bps') lower compared with 2020 as the reduction in the yield on AIEA of 36bps was partly offset by the fall in funding costs of average interest-bearing liabilities of 28bps. The decrease in NIM in 2021 included the adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences. Excluding this, NIM fell by 11bps.\n\nNIM for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 1.19%, down 3bps yearon-year, predominantly driven by a change in balance sheet composition towards lower yielding short-term funds and loans and advances to banks. NIM remained unchanged compared with the previous quarter.\n\nInterest income for 2021 of $36.2bn decreased by $5.6bn or 13%, primarily due to the lower average interest rates compared with 2020 as the yield on AIEA fell by 36bps. This was partly offset by income from balance sheet growth, predominantly in Asia and the UK. In particular, balances of short-term funds and loans and advances to banks grew by $152.4bn, and loans and advances to customers grew by $13.9bn. The decrease in interest income included $0.9bn from the favourable effects of foreign currency",

        "page_content": "translation differences. Excluding these, interest income decreased by $6.5bn.\n\nInterest income of $9.2bn in the fourth quarter was down $0.1bn year-on-year. The decline was predominantly driven by a change in the balance sheet composition where high-yielding financial investments decreased by $33.8bn, while low-yielding short-term funds and loans and advances to banks increased by $138.8bn. Compared with the previous quarter interest income was up $0.2bn, mainly due to improved yield on other interest-earning assets, as well as growth in AIEA.\n\nInterest expense for 2021 of $9.7bn represented a decrease by $4.5bn or 32% compared with 2020. This reflected a decrease in funding costs of 28bps, mainly arising from lower interest rates paid on interest-bearing customer accounts, debt securities in issue and repurchase agreements. Funding costs further declined due to a change in funding composition from debt securities to low-yielding customer deposits, which grew by $108bn, predominantly in Asia and Europe. The decrease in interest expense included the adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences of $0.3bn. Excluding this, interest expense decreased by $4.8bn.\n\nInterest expense of $2.4bn in the fourth quarter of 2021 was down $0.2bn year-on-year. The decline was predominantly driven by an improved funding mix, with additional funding from lower costing customer accounts, coupled with the impact of lower market interest rates. Compared with the previous quarter, the interest expense was materially unchanged.\n\nNet fee income of $13.1bn was $1.2bn higher than in 2020, and included a favourable impact from foreign currency translation differences of $0.3bn. Net fee income grew in all of our global businesses.\n\nIn WPB, net fee income increased by $0.5bn. Fee income grew, mainly in Wealth, as improved market sentiment resulted in increased customer demand. This increase included higher fee income from funds under management, notably in Hong Kong, the UK and France, and from unit trusts in Asia. Cards income grew as spending increased compared with 2020. This also resulted in higher fee expense.\n\nIn CMB, net fee income increased by $0.4bn. Fee income increased from credit facilities, as well as from trade products, as global trade volumes recovered during 2021. Income from account services and remittances also rose as customer activity increased.\n\nIn GBM, net fee income increased by $0.3bn. This was driven by higher fee income from growth in corporate finance activity and in account services, which included higher activity from transaction banking clients. Fee income also increased in remittances, credit facilities, funds under management and global custody, reflecting a higher level of client activity compared with 2020.\n\nNet income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis of $7.7bn was $1.8bn lower compared with 2020 and included adverse fair value movements on non-qualifying hedges of $0.4bn.\n\nThe remaining reduction was mainly in GBM, as 2020 benefited from higher market volatility supporting a particularly strong performance within Global Foreign Exchange and Global Debt Markets, notably in the UK and the US.\n\nNet income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss of $4.1bn, compared with $2.1bn in 2020. This increase primarily reflected favourable equity market performances in France and Hong Kong and higher gains on unit trust assets, supporting insurance and investment contracts. This compared with 2020, which was adversely impacted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThis favourable movement resulted in a corresponding movement in liabilities to policyholders and the present value of in-force longterm insurance business ('PVIF') (see 'Other operating income' below). This reflected the extent to which the policyholders and\n\nshareholders respectively participate in the investment performance of the associated assets.\n\nChange in fair value of designated debt and related derivatives was $0.4bn adverse compared with 2020. These movements were driven by the widening of long-term interest rate curves between the periods, driven by the gradual recovery of major economies.\n\nAll of our financial liabilities designated at fair value are fixed-rate, long-term debt issuances and are managed in conjunction with interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate management strategy. These liabilities are discussed further on page 96.\n\nChanges in fair value of other financial instruments mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss of $0.8bn was $0.3bn higher compared with 2020. This primarily reflected the impact of adverse movements in equity markets in the first half of 2020 following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as from favourable equity market movements during 2021.\n\nGains less losses from financial investments of $0.6bn were $0.1bn lower compared with 2020, primarily reflecting lower gains on the disposal of debt securities.\n\nNet insurance premium income of $10.9bn was $0.8bn higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting higher sales volumes, particularly in France, the UK and Singapore.\n\nOther operating income of $0.5bn was broadly unchanged compared with 2020, as a $0.3bn decrease in net favourable movements in PVIF was broadly offset by the gain on the sale of a property in Germany and the non-recurrence of revaluation losses on investment properties in Hong Kong in 2020.\n\nThe change in PVIF included a net reduction of $0.7bn from assumption changes and experience variances, primarily reflecting increased interest rates and the effect of sharing higher investment returns with policyholders in Hong Kong and Singapore. These were partly offset by France where higher interest rates reduced the cost of guarantees. The net reduction due to assumption changes was partly offset by a $0.3bn increase in the value of new business written, primarily in Hong Kong.\n\nPVIF is presented in accordance with IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts'. As set out in our Annual Report and Accounts 2020 , IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' is effective from 1 January 2023. Under IFRS 17, there will be no PVIF asset recognised. Instead, the estimated future profit will be included in the measurement of the insurance contract liability as the contractual service margin and gradually recognised in revenue as services are provided over the duration of the insurance contract.\n\nNet insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities to policyholders was $1.7bn higher, primarily due to higher returns on financial assets supporting contracts where the policyholder is subject to part or all of the investment risk and higher sales volumes, particularly in France and the UK.\n\nChanges in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges ('ECL') were a net release of $0.9bn, compared with a charge of $8.8bn in 2020. The net release in 2021 reflected an improvement in the economic outlook, notably in the UK, partly offset by an increase in allowances in the fourth quarter, reflecting recent developments in China's commercial real estate sector. This compared with the significant build-up of stage 1 and stage 2 allowances in 2020 due to the worsening economic outlook at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The reduction in ECL also reflected historically low levels of stage 3 charges, although with some normalisation during the fourth quarter, as well as the non-recurrence of a significant charge in 2020 related to a corporate exposure in Singapore.\n\nFor further details on the calculation of ECL, including the measurement uncertainties and significant judgements applied to such calculations, the impact of the economic scenarios and management judgemental adjustments, see pages 144 to 152.",

This included the impact of our cost saving initiatives, as well as lower impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, as 2021 included a $0.6bn impairment of goodwill related to our WPB business in Latin America to reflect the macroeconomic outlook, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rate deterioration and inflationary pressures, notably on our Argentina business. However, 2020 included a $1.3bn impairment of intangible assets, mainly in Europe. There was also a $0.6bn reduction in the UK bank levy due to a change in the basis of calculation to only include the UK balance sheet rather than the global balance sheet, as well as a credit of $0.1bn relating to the 2020 charge.\n\nThese decreases were broadly offset by an increase in performance-related pay of $0.7bn as Group performance improved, and by an increase in investment in technology of $0.9bn (gross of cost savings of $0.5bn). The remaining increase primarily reflected inflationary impacts, non-technology investment in regulatory programmes, and business growth notably Asia wealth investment. In addition, there was an adverse impact of foreign currency translation differences of $1.1bn.\n\nIn February 2020, we announced a plan to substantially reduce the cost base by 2022 and accelerate the pace of change. We continue to target $5bn to $5.5bn of cost saves for 2020 to 2022, while spending around $7bn in costs to achieve, which are included in restructuring and other related costs. Cumulative costs to achieve spend since the start of the programme in 2020 was\n\n$3.6bn, with related saves of $3.3bn. In 2021, the total cost to achieve spend was $1.8bn with saves during the year of $2.2bn.\n\nShare of profit in associates and joint ventures of $3.0bn was $1.4bn higher, primarily reflecting a higher share of profit from The Saudi British Bank ('SABB') due to the non-recurrence of our share of its goodwill impairment charge in 2020, and an increased share of profit from BoCom. Our share of profit also rose from Business Growth Fund in the UK due to a recovery in asset valuations relative to 2020.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, we performed an impairment review of our investment in BoCom and concluded that it was not impaired, based on our value-in-use ('VIU') calculations. The excess of the VIU of BoCom and its carrying value has increased over the period, reflecting the impact of BoCom's performance on the VIU.\n\nFor more information, see Note 19: Interests in associates and joint ventures on page 359.\n\n## Tax expense\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2021 of 22.3% was lower than the 30.5% for 2020. The effective tax rate for 2021 was increased by the impact of substantively enacted legislation to increase the UK statutory tax rate from 1 April 2023. The 2020 effective tax rate was high, due mainly to the non-recognition of deferred tax on losses in the UK and France.",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet commentary compared with 31 December 2020\n\nAt 31 December 2021, our total assets were $3.0tn, which were $26bn or 1% lower on a reported basis and $19bn or 1% higher on a constant currency basis.\n\nThe decrease in total assets reflected lower derivative assets and a fall in financial investments, in part reflecting a redeployment of our commercial surplus into cash. Reported customer lending balances were $8bn higher, mainly from growth in mortgage balances.\n\nReported loans and advances to customers as a percentage of customer accounts was 61.1%, which was lower compared with 63.2% at 31 December 2020. This was due to an increase in customer accounts as corporate customers continued to build up liquidity and personal customers grew their savings accounts.\n\n## Assets\n\nCash and balances at central banks increased by $99bn or 32%, mainly in the UK and the US, as we redeployed our commercial surplus to cash to increase liquidity for our clients and as a result of deposit inflows.\n\nTrading assets increased by $17bn or 7%, notably from an increase in equity securities held, particularly in Hong Kong and the US, largely driven by client demand. These were partly offset by a reduction of debt securities in the US.\n\nDerivative assets decreased by $111bn or 36%, primarily in the UK and France. This reflected adverse revaluation movements on interest rate contracts due to higher long-term yield curve rates in most major markets. Foreign exchange contracts also decreased as a result of foreign exchange rate movements in the UK and Hong Kong and lower client demand in the US. The decrease in derivative assets was consistent with the decrease in derivative liabilities, as the underlying risk is broadly matched.\n\nLoans and advances to customers of $1.0tn increased by $8bn on a reported basis, which included adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences of $16bn. On a constant currency basis, customer lending balances were $23bn higher, despite $3bn of loans and advances to customers being reclassified to assets held for sale in the US.\n\nThe commentary below is on a constant currency basis.\n\nCustomer lending increased in WPB by $27bn to $489bn, mainly from growth in mortgage balances of $23bn, notably in the UK (up $10bn), Hong Kong (up $7bn) and Canada (up $4bn) as housing market activity continued to increase.\n\nIn CMB, customer lending of $349bn was $11bn higher, as we grew trade lending by $13bn, reflecting a recovery in global trade volumes, which more than offset a reduction in other term lending.\n\nIn GBM, lending of $207bn fell by $14bn, due to a reduction in other term lending mainly in the UK.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements - non-trading increased by $11bn or 5%, primarily in Asia due to client demand. This was partly offset by the redeployment of our commercial surplus to cash in the US.\n\nThere was also an increase in balances eligible for netting in the UK, resulting in an overall balance reduction.\n\nFinancial investments decreased by $44bn or 9%, mainly as we reduced our holdings of debt securities and treasury bills through a combination of disposals and maturities. A notable portion of these funds was redeployed into cash as we managed our commercial surplus.\n\nOther assets decreased by $11bn due to lower cash collateral as derivative balances decreased, partly offset by an increase from the reclassification of loans and advances to customers to assets held for sale, reflecting our exit of mass market retail banking in the US.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nCustomer accounts of $1.7tn increased by $68bn or 4% on a reported basis, which included adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences of $23bn. On a constant currency basis, customer accounts were $90bn higher, with growth across all of our global businesses, despite a reclassification of $10bn to liabilities of disposal groups held for sale in the US. The increase was primarily in the UK, Hong Kong and the rest of Asia, as corporate customers continued to build up liquidity and personal customers grew their savings as spending remained below prepandemic levels.\n\nDeposits by banks increased by $19bn or 23%, primarily in the UK, relating to the utilisation of a Bank of England scheme to provide loans to corporate customers during the year. There were also increases in Hong Kong and the US.\n\nRepurchase agreements - non-trading increased by $15bn or 13%, primarily in Hong Kong, as client demand increased.\n\nDerivative liabilities decreased by $112bn or 37%, which is consistent with the decrease in derivative assets, since the underlying risk is broadly matched.\n\nOther liabilities decreased by $4bn or 2% due to lower cash collateral as derivative balances decreased, partly offset by an increase from a reclassification of customer accounts to liabilities held for sale, reflecting our exit of mass market retail banking in the US.\n\n## Equity\n\nTotal shareholders' equity, including non-controlling interests, increased by $2bn or 1% compared with 31 December 2020. This reflected the effects of profits generated of $15bn, partly offset by a reduction in other comprehensive income ('OCI') of $5bn, dividend payments and coupon distributions on securities classified as equity of $6bn and a $2bn reduction related to our share buy-back programme. Movements in OCI included fair value losses on debt instruments of $2bn, driven by unrealised losses on fixed rate bonds due to higher long-term yield curve rates, and adverse foreign exchange differences of $2bn.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nRisk-weighted assets ('RWAs') totalled $838.3bn at 31 December 2021, a $19.2bn decrease since 2020. Excluding foreign currency translation differences, RWAs fell by $6.3bn in 2021. This was due to the following movements:\n\n- \u00b7 a $4.7bn asset size increase, mostly caused by CMB and WPB lending growth in Asia, while lending fell in GBM;\n- \u00b7 a $8.0bn reduction in RWAs due to changes in asset quality from favourable portfolio mix and credit migration, mostly in CMB and WPB in Asia and North America; and\n- \u00b7 a $3.0bn fall in RWAs due to changes in methodology and policy. This was primarily the result of risk parameter refinements in GBM and CMB, partly offset by higher market risk RWAs following our adoption of a Pillar 1 approach to the capitalisation of structural foreign exchange.",

Our global businesses - Wealth and Personal Banking,\n\nCommerical Banking, and Global Banking and Markets - along with Corporate Centre are our reportable segments under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' and are presented below and in Note 10: Segmental analysis on page 341.\n\nGeographical information is classified by the location of the principal operations of the subsidiary or, for The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank plc, HSBC UK Bank plc, HSBC Bank Middle East Limited and HSBC Bank USA, by the location of the branch responsible for reporting the results or providing funding.\n\nThe expense of the UK bank levy is included in the Europe geographical region as HSBC regards the levy as a cost of being headquartered in the UK. From 2021, the UK bank levy was partially allocated to global businesses, which was previously retained in Corporate Centre. Comparative periods have not been re-presented.\n\nThe results of geographical regions are presented on a reported basis on page 106 and an adjusted basis on page 108.\n\n## Reconciliation of reported and adjusted items -

These eliminations are presented within Banking operations.\n- 2  Net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment charges, also referred to as revenue. This differs from the WPB Life insurance manufacturing revenue shown in the managed view of adjusted revenue on page 31, which excludes the impact of Argentina hyperinflation and includes the effect of goodwill adjustments.\n- 3  Operating expenses in Global Private Banking in 2021 included a one-off charge of $0.1bn, which did not meet the criteria to be classified as a significant item.\n\n## WPB insurance manufacturing adjusted results\n\nThe following table shows the results of our insurance manufacturing operations by income statement line item. It shows the results of insurance manufacturing operations for WPB and for all global business segments in aggregate, and separately the insurance distribution income earned by HSBC bank channels.\n\nThese results are prepared in accordance with current IFRSs which will change following adoption of IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', effective from 1 January 2023. Further information about the adoption of IFRS 17 is provided on page 90.\n\nAdjusted results of insurance manufacturing operations and insurance distribution income earned by HSBC bank channels 1, 2\n\n|                                                                                                                                                         | 2021         | 2021                   | 2020         | 2020                   | 2019         | 2019                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                         | WPB          | All global  businesses | WPB          | All global  businesses | WPB          | All global  businesses |\n|                                                                                                                                                         | $m           | $m                     | $m           | $m                     | $m           | $m                     |\n| Net interest income                                                                                                                                     | 2,316        | 2,492                  | 2,249        | 2,414                  | 2,179        | 2,318                  |\n| Net fee income/(expense)                                                                                                                                | (620)        | (652)                  | (527)        | (564)                  | (726)        | (750)                  |\n| -

        "page_content": "## Insurance manufacturing\n\nThe following commentary, unless otherwise specified, relates to the 'All global businesses' results.\n\nHSBC recognises the present value of long-term in-force insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features ('PVIF') as an asset on the balance sheet. The overall balance sheet equity, including PVIF, is therefore a measure of the embedded value in the insurance manufacturing entities, and the movement in this embedded value in the period drives the overall income statement result.\n\nAdjusted profit before tax of $2.1bn increased by $0.8bn or 55% compared with 2020.\n\nAdjusted net operating income before change in expected credit losses and other credit impairment changes was $0.8bn or 40% higher than in 2020. This reflected the following:\n\n- \u00b7 'Net income from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss' of $4.1bn in 2021 compared with $2.0bn in 2020. This increase primarily reflected favourable equity market performance in France and Hong Kong and higher gains on unit trust assets, supporting insurance and investment contracts. This compared with 2020, which was adversely impacted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n- \u00b7 This favourable movement resulted in a corresponding movement in liabilities to policyholders and PVIF (see 'Other operating income' below), to the extent to which policyholders and shareholders respectively participate in the investment performance of the associated assets.\n- \u00b7 Net insurance premium income of $11bn was $0.7bn higher than in 2020, primarily reflecting higher sales volumes particularly in France, the UK and Singapore.\n- \u00b7 Other operating income of $0.2bn decreased by $0.2bn compared with 2020, mainly from adverse movements in PVIF. This included a reduction of $0.7bn due to assumption changes and experience variances, primarily reflecting increased interest rates and the effect of sharing higher investment returns with policyholders in Hong Kong and Singapore, partly offset in France where higher interest rates reduced the cost of guarantees. The net reduction from assumption changes and experience variances was partly offset by a $0.3bn increase in the value of new business written, primarily in Hong Kong.\n- \u00b7 Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in liabilities to policyholders was $1.8bn higher, primarily due to higher returns on financial assets supporting contracts where the policyholder is subject to part or all of the investment risk and higher sales volumes, particularly in France and the UK.\n\nAdjusted operating expenses of $0.6bn increased by 20% compared with 2020, reflecting investments in core insurance functions and capabilities during the period.\n\nAnnualised new business premiums ('ANP') is used to assess new insurance premium generation by the business. It is calculated as 100% of annualised first year regular premiums and 10% of single premiums, before reinsurance ceded. Higher ANP during the period reflected improved new business volumes, mainly in Hong Kong.\n\nInsurance distribution income from HSBC channels included $486m (2020: $476m; 2019: $665m) on HSBC manufactured products, for which a corresponding fee expense is recognised within insurance manufacturing, and $346m (2020: $340m; 2019: $392m) on products manufactured by third-party providers. The WPB component of this distribution income was $433m (2020: $428m; 2019: $589m) from HSBC manufactured products and $329m (2020: $323m; 2019: $372m) from third-party products.\n\n## WPB: Wealth adjusted revenue by geography\n\nThe following table shows the adjusted revenue of our Wealth business by region.

Assets held in custody are not reported on the Group's balance sheet, except where it is deemed that we are acting as principal rather than agent in our role as investment manager. At 31 December 2021, we held $10.8tn of assets as custodian, 7% higher than at 31 December 2020. The balance comprised $10.0tn of assets in Securities Services, which were recorded at market value, and $0.8tn of assets in Issuer Services, recorded at book value.\n\nThe growth was driven by Securities Services balances, from net client asset inflows, including increases from new client mandates, notably in Asia, the US and the UK, and favourable market movements. These increases were partly offset by the adverse impact of currency translation differences.\n\n## Assets under administration\n\nOur assets under administration business, which includes the provision of bond and loan administration services, transfer agency services and the valuation of portfolios of securities and other financial assets on behalf of clients, complements the custody business. At 31 December 2021, the value of assets held under administration by the Group amounted to $4.9tn, which was 10% higher than at 31 December 2020. The balance comprised $3.0tn of assets in Securities Services, which were recorded at market value, and $1.9tn of assets in Issuer Services, recorded at book value.\n\nThe increase was mainly driven by Securities Services balances, from a net inflow of client assets, particularly in the UK and Hong Kong, and from favourable market movements.\n\ncustomer deposits.

These are considered alternative performance measures (non-GAAP financial measures).\n\nThe following information details the adjustments made to the reported results and the calculation of other alternative performance measures. All alternative performance measures are reconciled to the closest reported performance measure.\n\n## Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity and return on average tangible equity\n\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders' equity ('RoE') is computed by taking profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the parent company ('reported results'), divided by average ordinary shareholders' equity ('reported equity') for the period. The adjustment to reported results and reported equity excludes amounts attributable to non-controlling interests and holders of preference shares and other equity instruments.\n\nReturn on average tangible equity ('RoTE') is computed by adjusting reported results for the movements in the present value of in-force long-term insurance business ('PVIF') and for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets (net of tax), divided by average reported equity adjusted for goodwill, intangibles and PVIF for the period.\n\nReturn on average tangible equity excluding significant items is annualised profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, excluding changes in PVIF and significant items (net of tax), divided by average tangible shareholders' equity excluding fair value of own debt, debt valuation adjustment ('DVA') and other adjustments for the period. Since 1 January 2021, the UK bank levy has no longer been excluded from the calculation of this measure. Comparative data have not been re-presented.\n\nWe provide RoTE ratios in addition to RoE as a way of assessing our performance, which is closely aligned to our capital position.\n\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders' equity and return on average tangible equity\n\n|                                                                                                                   | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   | 2019 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Profit                                                                                                            |           |           |           |\n| Profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the parent company                                            | 12,607    | 3,898     | 5,969     |\n| Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets (net of tax)                                                   | 608       | 1,036     | 7,349     |\n| Decrease/(increase) in PVIF (net of tax)                                                                          | (58)      | (253)     | (1,248)   |\n| Profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders, excluding goodwill, other intangible assets impairment and PVIF | 13,157    | 4,681     | 12,070    |\n| Significant items (net of tax) and other adjustments 1                                                            | 2,086     | 2,402     | 2,251     |\n| Profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders, excluding goodwill impairment, PVIF and significant items 1     | 15,243    | 7,083     | 14,321    |\n| Equity                                                                                                            |           |           |           |\n| Average total shareholders' equity                                                                                | 199,295   | 189,719   | 189,035   |\n| Effect of average preference shares and other equity instruments                                                  | (22,814)  | (22,326)  | (23,614)  |\n| Average ordinary shareholders' equity                                                                             | 176,481   | 167,393   | 165,421   |\n| Effect of goodwill, PVIF and other intangibles (net of deferred tax)                                              | (17,705)  | (17,292)  | (22,574)  |\n| Average tangible equity                                                                                           | 158,776   | 150,101   | 142,847   |\n| Fair value of own debt, DVA and other adjustments                                                                 | 1,278     | 422       | 1,032     |\n| Average tangible equity excluding fair value of own debt, DVA and other adjustments                               | 160,054   | 150,523   | 143,879   |\n|                                                                                                                   | %         | %         | %         |\n| Ratio                                                                                                             |           |           |           |\n| Return on average ordinary shareholders' equity                                                                   | 7.1       | 2.3       | 3.6       |\n| Return on average tangible equity                                                                                 | 8.3       | 3.1       | 8.4       |\n| Return on average tangible equity excluding significant items 1                                                   | 9.5       | 4.7       | 10.0      |",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to risk\n\n## Our risk appetite\n\nWe recognise the importance of a strong culture, which refers to our shared attitudes, values and standards that shape behaviours related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. All our people are responsible for the management of risk, with the ultimate accountability residing with the Board.\n\nWe seek to build our business for the long term by balancing social, environmental and economic considerations in the decisions we make. Our strategic priorities are underpinned by our endeavour to operate in a sustainable way. This helps us to carry out our social responsibility and manage the risk profile of the business. We are committed to managing and mitigating climaterelated risks, both physical and transition risks, and continue to incorporate consideration of these into how we manage and oversee risks internally and with our customers.\n\nThe following principles guide the Group's overarching appetite for risk and determine how our businesses and risks are managed.\n\n## Financial position\n\n- \u00b7 We aim to maintain a strong capital position, defined by regulatory and internal capital ratios.\n- \u00b7 We carry out liquidity and funding management for each operating entity, on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## Operating model\n\n- \u00b7 We seek to generate returns in line with our risk appetite and strong risk management capability.\n- \u00b7 We aim to deliver sustainable and diversified earnings and consistent returns for shareholders.\n\n## Business practice\n\n- \u00b7 We have zero tolerance for any of our people knowingly engaging in any business, activity or association where foreseeable reputational risk or damage has not been considered and/or mitigated.\n- \u00b7 We have no appetite for deliberately or knowingly causing detriment to consumers, or incurring a breach of the letter or spirit of regulatory requirements.\n- \u00b7 We have no appetite for inappropriate market conduct by any member of staff or by any Group business.\n- \u00b7 We are committed to managing the climate risks that have an impact on our financial position, and delivering on our net zero ambition.\n\n## Enterprise-wide application\n\nOur risk appetite encapsulates the consideration of financial and non-financial risks. We define financial risk as the risk of a financial loss as a result of business activities. We actively take these types of risks to maximise shareholder value and profits. Non-financial risk is the risk to achieving our strategy or objectives as the result of failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.\n\nOur risk appetite is expressed in both quantitative and qualitative terms and applied at the global business level, at the regional level and to material operating entities. Every three years, the Global Risk and Compliance function commissions an external independent firm to review the Group's approach to risk appetite and to help ensure that it remains in line with market best practice and regulatory expectations. This review was last carried out in 2019 and confirmed the Group's risk appetite statement ('RAS') remains aligned to best practices, regulatory expectations and strategic goals. Our risk appetite continues to evolve and expand its scope as part of our regular review process.\n\nThe Board reviews and approves the Group's risk appetite twice a year to make sure it remains fit for purpose. The Group's risk appetite is considered, developed and enhanced through:\n\n- \u00b7 an alignment with our strategy, purpose, values and customer needs;\n- \u00b7 trends highlighted in other Group risk reports;\n- \u00b7 communication with risk stewards on the developing risk landscape;\n- \u00b7 strength of our capital, liquidity and balance sheet;\n- \u00b7 compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 effectiveness of the applicable control environment to mitigate risk, informed by risk ratings from risk control assessments;\n- \u00b7 functionality, capacity and resilience of available systems to manage risk; and\n- \u00b7 the level of available staff with the required competencies to manage risks.\n\nWe formally articulate our risk appetite through our RAS. Setting out our risk appetite ensures that we agree a suitable level of risk for our strategy. In this way, risk appetite informs our financial planning process and helps senior management to allocate capital to business activities, services and products.\n\nThe RAS consists of qualitative statements and quantitative metrics, covering financial and non-financial risks. It is applied to the development of business line strategies, strategic and business planning and remuneration. At a Group level, performance against the RAS is reported to the Group Risk Management Meeting ('RMM') alongside key risk indicators to support targeted insight and discussion on breaches of risk appetite and any associated mitigating actions. This reporting allows risks to be promptly identified and mitigated, and informs risk-adjusted remuneration to drive a strong risk culture.\n\nEach global business, region and strategically important country and territory is required to have its own RAS, which is monitored to help ensure it remains aligned with the Group's RAS. Each RAS and business activity is guided and underpinned by qualitative principles and/or quantitative metrics.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe recognise that the primary role of risk management is to protect our customers, business, colleagues, shareholders and the communities that we serve, while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth. This is supported through our three lines of defence model described on page 123.\n\nThe implementation of our business strategy, which includes a major transformation programme, remains a key focus. As we implement change initiatives, we actively manage the execution risks. We also perform periodic risk assessments, including against strategies, to help ensure retention of key personnel for our continued safe operation.\n\nWe aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organisation and across all risk types, underpinned by our culture and values. This is outlined in our risk management framework, including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks, both financial and nonfinancial. The framework fosters continual monitoring, promotes risk awareness and encourages a sound operational and strategic decision-making and escalation process. It also supports a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities, with clear accountabilities. We continue to actively review and develop our risk management framework and enhance our approach to managing risk, through our activities with regard to: people and capabilities; governance; reporting and management information; credit risk management models; and data.\n\nWe merged our Group Risk and Compliance functions on 1 July 2021 to take an increasingly comprehensive view of risk, and enhance cross-discipline collaboration on key areas such as fraud, credit and conduct risk. This merger did not have an impact on our policies and practices regarding the management of risk. Led by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, this merged function plays an important role in reinforcing our culture and values. It focuses on creating an environment that encourages our people to speak up and do the right thing.",

The Group Reputational Risk Committee considers matters arising from customers, transactions and third parties that either present a serious potential reputational risk to the Group or merit a Group-led decision to ensure a consistent risk management approach across the regions, global\n\nbusinesses and global functions. Our reputational risk policy sets out our risk appetite and the principles for managing reputational risk. Further details can be found under the 'Reputational risk' section of www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-responsibility.\n\nDay-to-day responsibility for risk management is delegated to senior managers with individual accountability for decision making. All our people have a role to play in risk management. These roles are defined using the three lines of defence model, which takes into account our business and functional structures as described in the following commentary, 'Our responsibilities'.\n\nWe use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability of risk, which facilitates reporting and escalation to the Group RMM.

Roles are defined using the three lines of defence model, which takes into account our business and functional structures as described below.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nTo create a robust control environment to manage risks, we use an activity-based three lines of defence model. This model delineates management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment.\n\nThe model underpins our approach to risk management by clarifying responsibility and encouraging collaboration, as well as enabling efficient coordination of risk and control activities. The three lines of defence are summarised below:\n\n- \u00b7 The first line of defence owns the risks and is responsible for identifying, recording, reporting and managing them in line with risk appetite, and ensuring that the right controls and assessments are in place to mitigate them.\n- \u00b7 The second line of defence challenges the first line of defence on effective risk management, and provides advice and guidance in relation to the risk.\n- \u00b7 The third line of defence is our Global Internal Audit function, which provides independent assurance as to whether our risk management approach and processes are designed and operating effectively.\n\n## Global Risk and Compliance function\n\nOur Global Risk and Compliance function is responsible for the Group's risk management framework. This responsibility includes establishing global policy, monitoring risk profiles, and identifying and managing forward-looking risk. Global Risk and Compliance is made up of sub-functions covering all risks to our business. Forming part of the second line of defence, the Global Risk and Compliance function is independent from the global businesses, including sales and trading functions, to provide challenge, appropriate oversight and balance in risk/return decisions.\n\nResponsibility for minimising both financial and non-financial risk lies with our people. They are required to manage the risks of the business and operational activities for which they are responsible. We maintain adequate oversight of our risks through our various specialist risk stewards and the collective accountability held by our chief risk officers.\n\n- We have continued to strengthen the control environment and our approach to the management of non-financial risk, as broadly set out in our risk management framework. The management of nonfinancial risk focuses on governance and risk appetite, and provides a single view of the non-financial risks that matter the most and the associated controls. It incorporates a risk management system designed to enable the active management of non-financial risk. Our ongoing focus is on simplifying our approach to non-financial risk management, while driving more effective oversight and better end-to-end identification and management of non-financial risks. This is overseen by the Operational and Resilience Risk function, headed by the Group Head of Operational and Resilience Risk.\n\n## Stress testing and recovery planning\n\nWe operate a wide-ranging stress testing programme that is a key part of our risk management and capital and liquidity planning. Stress testing provides management with key insights into the impact of severely adverse events on the Group, and provides confidence to regulators on the Group's financial stability.\n\nOur stress testing programme assesses our capital and liquidity strength through a rigorous examination of our resilience to external shocks. As well as undertaking regulatory-driven stress tests, we conduct our own internal stress tests in order to understand the nature and level of all material risks, quantify the impact of such risks and develop plausible business-as-usual mitigating actions.\n\n## Internal stress tests\n\nOur internal capital assessment uses a range of stress scenarios that explore risks identified by management. They include potential adverse macroeconomic, geopolitical and operational risk events, as well as other potential events that are specific to HSBC.\n\nThe selection of stress scenarios is based upon the output of our identified top and emerging risks and our risk appetite. Stress testing analysis helps management understand the nature and extent of vulnerabilities to which the Group is exposed. Using this information, management decides whether risks can or should be mitigated through management actions or, if they were to crystallise, be absorbed through capital and liquidity. This in turn informs decisions about preferred capital and liquidity levels and allocations.\n\nIn addition to the Group-wide stress testing scenarios, each major subsidiary conducts regular macroeconomic and event-driven",

They also participate, as required, in the regulatory stress testing programmes of the jurisdictions in which they operate, such as the Bank of England ('BoE') stress tests required in the UK, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing programmes in the US, and the stress tests of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ('HKMA'). Global functions and businesses also perform bespoke stress testing to inform their assessment of risks to potential scenarios.\n\nWe also conduct reverse stress tests each year at Group level and, where required, at subsidiary entity level to understand potential extreme conditions that would make our business model nonviable. Reverse stress testing identifies potential stresses and vulnerabilities we might face, and helps inform early warning triggers, management actions and contingency plans designed to mitigate risks.\n\n## Recovery and resolution plans\n\nRecovery and resolution plans form part of the integral framework safeguarding the Group's financial stability. The Group recovery plan, together with stress testing, helps us understand the likely outcomes of adverse business or economic conditions and in the identification of appropriate risk mitigating actions. The Group is committed to further developing its recovery and resolution capabilities in line with the BoE resolvability assessment framework requirements.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nWe continued to actively manage the risks resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and its impacts on our customers and operations during 2021, as well as other key risks described in this section. In addition, we enhanced our risk management in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 We streamlined the articulation of our risk appetite framework, providing further clarity on how risk appetite interacts with strategic planning and recovery planning processes.\n- \u00b7 We continued to simplify our approach to non-financial risk management, with the implementation of more effective oversight tools and techniques to improve end-to-end identification and management of these risks.\n- \u00b7 We accelerated the transformation of our approach to managing financial risks across the businesses and risk functions, including initiatives to enhance portfolio monitoring and analytics, credit risk management, traded risk management, treasury risk management and models used to manage financial risks.\n- \u00b7 We are progressing with a comprehensive regulatory reporting programme to strengthen our global processes, improve consistency, and enhance controls.\n- \u00b7 We launched an enhanced approach to conduct for all colleagues, businesses and geographies, establishing the outcomes to be achieved for customers and markets in all risk disciplines, operations and technologies and integrating it into our approach to culture and our risk management arrangements.\n- \u00b7 We continued to enhance our approach to portfolio risk management, through clearly defined roles and responsibilities, and improving our data and management information reporting capabilities.\n- \u00b7 The Climate Risk Oversight Forum continued to shape and oversee our approach to climate risk. We appointed a Head of Climate Risk in support of our climate change strategy and to oversee the development of our climate risk management capabilities. The climate risk programme continues to drive the delivery of our enhanced climate risk management approach.\n- \u00b7 We continued to improve the effectiveness of our financial crime controls with a targeted update of our fraud controls. We refreshed our financial crime policies, ensuring they remained up to date and addressed changing and emerging risks, and we continued to meet our regulatory obligations.\n\n- \u00b7 We introduced enhanced governance and oversight around management judgemental adjustments and related processes for IFRS 9 models and Sarbanes-Oxley controls.\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nWe use a top and emerging risks process to provide a forwardlooking view of issues with the potential to threaten the execution of our strategy or operations over the medium to long term.\n\nWe proactively assess the internal and external risk environment, as well as review the themes identified across our regions and global businesses, for any risks that may require global escalation. We update our top and emerging risks as necessary.\n\nOur current top and emerging risks are as follows.\n\n## Externally driven\n\n## Geopolitical and macroeconomic risks\n\nOur operations and portfolios are exposed to risks associated with political instability, civil unrest and military conflict, which could lead to disruption of our operations, physical risk to our staff and/ or physical damage to our assets.\n\nGlobal tensions over trade, technology and ideology are manifesting themselves in divergent regulatory standards and compliance regimes, presenting long-term strategic challenges for multinational businesses.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic brought supply chain issues into focus, with shortages appearing across several regions and products throughout 2020 and 2021, and it is not expected that these issues will ease significantly before mid-2022.\n\nThe pandemic has also heightened geopolitical tensions, which could have implications for the Group and its customers.\n\nThe Group will continue to need to consider potential regulatory, reputational and market risks arising from the evolving geopolitical landscape. In 2021, there was an escalation of diplomatic tensions between China and the US, and increasingly extending to the UK, the EU, India and other countries.\n\nThe US-China relationship in particular remains complex, with tensions over a number of critical issues. The US, the UK, the EU, Canada and other countries have imposed various sanctions and trade restrictions on Chinese individuals or companies, and the US continues to develop its approach to perceived strategic competition with China.\n\nAmong these, the US Hong Kong Autonomy Act authorises the imposition of secondary sanctions against non-US financial institutions found to be knowingly engaged in significant transactions with individuals and entities subject to US sanctions for engaging in certain activities that undermine Hong Kong's autonomy. In addition, the US has imposed restrictions on US persons' ability to buy or sell certain publicly traded securities linked to a number of prominent Chinese companies.\n\nThere is also a risk of increased sanctions being imposed by the US and other governments in relation to human rights, technology and other issues with China, and this could create a more complex operating environment for the Group and its customers. Notably, alongside the EU, UK, and Canada, the US has increasingly imposed sanctions and other measures in response to allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.\n\nChina, in turn, has announced a number of its own sanctions and trade restrictions that target, or provide authority to target, foreign individuals or companies. These have been imposed mainly against certain public officials associated with the implementation of foreign sanctions against China. China has also promulgated new laws that provide a legal framework for imposing further sanctions and export restrictions, including laws prohibiting implementation of - or compliance with - foreign sanctions against China and creating a private right of action in Chinese courts for damages caused by third parties implementing foreign sanctions or other discriminatory measures.",

        "page_content": "These and any future measures and countermeasures that may be taken by the US, China and other countries may affect the Group, its customers and the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nAs the geopolitical landscape evolves, compliance by multinational corporations with their legal or regulatory obligations in one jurisdiction may be seen as supporting the law or policy objectives of that jurisdiction over another, creating additional compliance, reputational and political risks for the Group. We maintain dialogue with our regulators in various jurisdictions on the impact of legal and regulatory obligations on our business and customers.\n\nTensions between Russia and the US and a number of European states have heightened significantly following the increasing risk of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. While negotiations are ongoing to seek a resolution, a continuation of or any further deterioration to the situation could have significant geopolitical implications, including economic, social and political repercussions on a number of regions that may impact HSBC and its customers. In addition, the US, the UK and the EU have threatened a significant expansion of sanctions and trade restrictions against Russia in the event of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, and Russian countermeasures are also possible.\n\nExpanding data privacy and cybersecurity laws in a number of markets could pose potential challenges to intra-group data sharing. These developments could increase financial institutions' compliance burdens in respect of cross-border transfers of personal information.\n\nPolitical disagreements between the UK and the EU, notably over the future operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, have meant work on the creation of a framework for voluntary regulatory cooperation in financial services following the UK's withdrawal from the EU has stalled. While negotiations are continuing, it is unclear whether or when an agreement will be reached, and this has led to speculation that the UK may trigger Article 16 of the Protocol, which could suspend the operation of the Protocol in certain respects. Any decision to do so could be met with retaliatory action by the EU, complicating the terms of trade between the UK and the EU and potentially preventing progress in other areas such as financial services. We are monitoring the situation closely, including the potential impacts on our customers.\n\nOur global presence and diversified customer base should help mitigate the direct impacts on our financial position of the absence of a comprehensive EU-UK agreement on financial services. Our wholesale and markets footprint in the EU provides a strong foundation for us to build upon. Over the medium to long term, the UK's withdrawal from the EU may impact markets and increase economic risk, particularly in the UK, which could adversely impact our profitability and prospects for growth in this market.\n\nMonetary and fiscal policies in developed markets will likely remain broadly accommodative for some time owing to uncertainty over the economic outlook, although rising global inflation - partly on the back of higher energy prices - is putting pressure on central banks to tighten monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve Board began tapering its asset purchases in November 2021 and financial markets currently expect it to raise the Federal Funds rate over the next year. The European Central Bank is on course to end its extraordinary asset purchase programme in March 2022.\n\nPersistent supply issues or further increases in energy prices - for instance as a result of escalation in the Russia-Ukraine crisis could keep inflation high and force central banks to tighten monetary policies faster than currently envisaged. Conversely, monetary policy tightening may be constrained by the emergence and spread of new Covid-19 variants that dampen economic recovery. We continue to monitor our risk profile closely in the context of uncertainty over monetary policy.\n\nThe global economic recovery in 2021 eased financial difficulties for some of our customers, which contributed to a reduction in ECL charges. For further details on customer relief programmes, see page 159.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We closely monitor geopolitical and economic developments in key markets and sectors and undertake scenario analysis where appropriate. This helps us to take portfolio actions where necessary, including enhanced monitoring, amending our risk appetite and/or reducing limits and exposures.\n- \u00b7 We stress test portfolios of particular concern to identify sensitivity to loss under a range of scenarios, with management actions being taken to rebalance exposures and manage risk appetite where necessary.\n- \u00b7 We regularly review key portfolios to help ensure that individual customer or portfolio risks are understood and our ability to manage the level of facilities offered through any downturn is appropriate.\n- \u00b7 We continue to monitor the UK's relationship with the EU, and assess the potential impact on our people, operations and portfolios.\n- \u00b7 We have taken steps, where necessary, to enhance physical security in geographical areas deemed to be at high risk from terrorism and military conflicts.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\nWe are subject to financial and non-financial risks associated with environmental, social and governance ('ESG') related matters. Our current areas of focus are climate risk, nature-related risks and human rights risks. These can impact us both directly and indirectly through our customers. For details on how we govern ESG, see page 80.\n\nClimate-related risk increased over 2021, owing to the pace and volume of policy and regulatory changes globally particularly on climate risk management, stress testing and scenario analysis and disclosures. If we fail to meet evolving regulatory expectations or requirements on climate risk management, this could have regulatory compliance and reputational impacts.\n\nWe face increased reputational, legal and regulatory risk as we make progress towards our net zero ambition, with stakeholders likely to place greater focus on our actions such as the development of climate-related policies, our disclosures and financing and investment decisions relating to our ambition. We will face additional risks if we are perceived to mislead stakeholders in respect of our climate strategy, the climate impact of a product or service, or the commitments of our customers.\n\nTo track and report on progress towards achieving our ambition, we rely on internal and, where appropriate and available, external data, guided by certain industry standards. While emissions reporting has improved over time, data remains of limited quality and consistency. Methodologies we have used may develop over time in line with market practice and regulations, as well as owing to developments in climate science. Any developments in data and methodologies could result in revisions to reported data going forward, including on financed emissions, meaning that reported figures may not be reconcilable or comparable year-on-year. We may also have to reevaluate our progress towards our climaterelated targets in future and this could result in reputational, legal and regulatory risks.\n\nClimate risk will also have an impact on model risk, as models play an important role in risk management and the financial reporting of climate-related risks. The uncertain impacts of climate change and data limitations present challenges to creating reliable and accurate model outputs.\n\nWe could also face increased resilience risk, retail credit risk and wholesale credit risk owing to the increase in frequency and severity of weather events and chronic shifts in weather patterns. These risks could affect our own critical operations, impacting our customers and resulting in losses to our operations. Our customers' operations and assets could also be affected, reducing their ability to afford mortgage or loan repayments, and leading to credit risk impacts.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that a number of nature-related risks beyond climate change - which include risks that can be",

These risks arise when the provision of natural services - such as water availability, air quality, and soil quality - is compromised by overpopulation, urban development, natural habitat and ecosystem loss, and other environmental stresses beyond climate change. They can show themselves in various ways, including through macroeconomic, market, credit, reputational, legal and regulatory risks, for both HSBC and our customers. In 2021, we added nature-related risks as a new emerging risk driver, under the umbrella theme of ESG risks and we continue to engage with investors, regulators and customers on nature-related risks to evolve our approach and understand best practice risk mitigation.\n\nRegulation and disclosure requirements in relation to human rights, and to modern slavery in particular, are increasing. Businesses are expected to explain more about their efforts to identify and respond to the risk of negative human rights impacts arising from the actions of their employees, suppliers, customers and those in whom they invest.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We continue to deepen our understanding of the drivers of climate risk as well as manage our exposure. A dedicated Climate Risk Oversight Forum is responsible for shaping and overseeing our approach and providing support in managing climate risk. For further details on the Group's ESG governance structure, see page 80.\n- \u00b7 Our climate risk programme continues to accelerate the development of our climate risk management capabilities across four key pillars - governance and risk appetite, risk management, stress testing and scenario analysis, and disclosures. We are also enhancing our approach to greenwashing risk management.\n- \u00b7 In December, we published our thermal coal phase-out policy, which committed to phase out the financing of coal-fired power and thermal coal mining in EU/OECD markets by 2030, and globally by 2040. The policy helps us chart the path to net zero and is a component of our approach towards managing the climate risk of our lending portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Climate stress tests and scenarios are being used to further improve our understanding of our risk exposures for use in risk management and business decision making.\n- \u00b7 We are undertaking training and adding additional roles with specialist skills to manage climate-related model risk.\n- \u00b7 We have delivered climate risk training to our legal entity boards and wider target audiences.\n- \u00b7 With the help of external stakeholders, we continued to review and improve our approach to human rights issues, following the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, we joined several industry working groups dedicated to helping us assess and manage nature-related risks, such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosure ('TNFD'). Our asset management business also published its biodiversity policy to publicly explain how our analysts address naturerelated issues.\n- \u00b7 We continue to engage with our customers, investors and regulators proactively on the management of ESG risks. We also engage with initiatives, including the Climate Financial Risk Forum, Equator Principles, Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) to drive best practice for climate risk management.\n\nFor further details on our approach to climate risk management, see 'Areas of special interest' on page 131.\n\nFor further details on ESG risk management see 'Financial crime risk environment and 'Regulatory compliance risk environment including conduct' on page 129.\n\nOur ESG review can be found on page 43.\n\n## Ibor transition\n\nInterbank offered rates ('Ibors') have historically been used extensively to set interest rates on different types of financial transactions and for valuation purposes, risk measurement and performance benchmarking.\n\nFollowing the UK's Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') announcement in July 2017 that it would no longer continue to persuade or require panel banks to submit rates for the London interbank offered rate ('Libor') after 2021, we have been actively working to transition legacy contracts from Ibors to products linked to near risk-free replacement rates ('RFRs') or alternative reference rates. In March 2021, in accordance with the 2017 FCA announcement, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited ('IBA') announced that it would cease publication of 24 of the 35 main Libor currency interest rate benchmark settings from the end of 2021, and that the most widely used US dollar Libor settings would cease from 30 June 2023. The FCA subsequently used its regulatory powers to compel IBA to publish the remaining six sterling and Japanese yen settings, from 1 January 2022, under an amended methodology, commonly known as 'synthetic' Libor. As a result, our focus during 2021 was on the transition of legacy contracts referencing the Euro Overnight Index average ('Eonia') and the Libor settings that demised from the end of 2021, including those settings subsequently being published on a 'synthetic' basis.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued the development of IT and RFR product capabilities, implemented supporting operational processes, and engaged with our clients to discuss options for the transition of their legacy contracts. The successful implementation of new processes and controls, as well as the transition of contracts away from Ibors, reduced the heightened financial and non-financial risks to which we were exposed. However, while all but exceptional new Libor contract issuance ceased during 2021, or from the end of 2021 for US dollar Libor, we remain exposed to material risks. These include from so-called 'tough legacy' contracts, which have not been able to be transition to a new RFR rate and will use a 'synthetic' Libor or a contractual fallback rate, and from legacy contracts that reference the remaining US dollar Libor tenors, which are expected to demise from June 2023.\n\nFinancial risks have been largely mitigated as a result of the implementation of model and pricing changes. However, differences in US dollar Libor and its replacement RFR, Secured Overnight Funding Rate ('SOFR'), create a basis risk in the trading book and banking book due to the asymmetric adoption of SOFR across assets, liabilities and products that we need to actively manage through appropriate financial hedging. Additionally, the comparatively limited use of the SOFR benchmark for new RFR products to date and lack of alignment around conventions could potentially delay transition of some US dollar contracts into 2023. This would compress the amount of time to transition these contracts, which could lead to heightened operational and conduct-related risk.\n\nAdditional non-financial risks, including regulatory compliance risk, resilience risk, financial reporting risk, and legal risk also remain for 'tough legacy' contracts, and the US dollar legacy portfolio. These risks continue to be actively managed and mitigated with a focus on ensuring that fair outcomes for our clients are achieved.\n\nThese risks are present in different degrees across our product offering.\n\n## Transition of legacy contracts\n\nDuring 2021 we successfully transitioned over 90% of legacy Ibor lending contracts in sterling, Swiss franc, euro and Japanese yen Libor interest rates, as well as Eonia, directly or via appropriate fallback mechanisms. The majority of the remaining contracts will transition in advance of their next interest payment date, with only a small proportion of 'tough legacy' contracts remaining. We expect that out of approximately 5,000 lending contracts there will be less than 50 'tough legacy' contracts, the majority of which will be transitioned to alternative rates during 2022. Our approach to transition 'tough legacy' and US dollar Libor legacy contracts will",

        "page_content": "differ by product and business area, but will be based on the lessons learned from the successful transition of contracts during 2021. We will continue to communicate with our clients and investors in a structured manner and be client led in the timing and nature of the transition.\n\nFor derivatives, approximately 99% of our sterling, Swiss franc, euro and Japanese yen Libor interest rate exposures at the end of 2021 had successfully transitioned directly or via appropriate fallback mechanisms, leaving a small number of 'tough legacy' contracts. Out of the approximately 13,000 bilateral derivatives trades there are expected to be less than 20 that remain 'tough legacy', the majority of which are expected to mature or transition in 2022. We anticipate our 'tough legacy' and US dollar exposure will continue to reduce through 2022 as a result of contract maturities, and active transition. We will continue to look to actively reduce our US dollar exposure by transitioning trades ahead of the demise date of 30 June 2023, by working with our clients to determine their needs and discuss how we transition their contracts. Additionally, we are working with market participants, including clearing houses, to ensure we are able to transition our cleared derivative contracts as the US dollar Libor benchmark demise date approaches.\n\nFor our loan book, approximately 85% of our reported exposure at the end of 2021 linked to sterling, Swiss franc, euro and Japanese yen Libor interest rate contracts required no further client negotiation but remained drawn as they have yet to reach their next interest payment date. The majority of the remaining exposure linked to benchmarks that demised from the end of 2021 relates to contracts where discussions with our clients and other market participants, for syndicated transactions, have continued into early 2022, in advance of their next scheduled interest payment date, and this has led to further transitions being completed. A small number of 'tough legacy' contracts, less than 50, that were unable to transition prior to their first interest payment date in 2022, are expected to use legislative reliefs, such as 'synthetic' Libor, or an alternative rate determined by the contractual fallback language, and in the main will be transitioned during 2022. For the remaining demising Ibors, notably US dollar Libor, we have implemented new products and processes and updated our systems in readiness for transition. In our US retail bank, our mortgage products are offered in SOFR, and the transition of legacy contracts will occur once an industry spread adjustment is available. Global Banking, Commercial Banking and Global Private Banking have begun to engage with clients who have upcoming contract maturities with a view to refinancing using an appropriate replacement rate. Further communications and outreach to customers with US dollar Libor contracts with later maturities will occur in due course.\n\nFor the Group's own debt securities issuances, in 2021 HSBC launched a consent solicitation to remediate Ibor references in five of its English law governed regulatory capital and MREL sterling and Singapore dollar instruments. The proposed amendments were successfully adopted on all of the sterling instruments, but were not adopted with respect to the Singapore dollar instruments as the minimum quorum requirements were not met. The terms of these two instruments provide for an Ibor benchmark being used to reset the coupon rate if HSBC chooses not to redeem the instruments on the respective call date, or dates, for each series. We remain mindful of the various factors that impact on the Ibor remediation strategy for our regulatory capital and MREL instruments, including - but not limited to - timescales for\n\ncessation of relevant Ibor rates, constraints relating to the governing law of outstanding instruments, and the potential relevance of legislative solutions. We remain committed in seeking to remediate or mitigate relevant risks relating to Ibor-demise, as appropriate, on our outstanding regulatory capital and MREL instruments before the relevant calculation dates, which may occur post-cessation of the relevant Ibor rate or rates. Where we hold bonds issued by other institutions, we have remained dependent on the issuer's agents to engage in the transition process, although analysis will be undertaken of the issuers in US dollar Libor bonds to reduce our exposure, as occurred through 2021.\n\nThe completion of an orderly transition from the remaining Ibors, notably US dollar Libor, continues to be our programme's key objective through 2022 and 2023, with the aim of putting systems and processes in place to help achieve this.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 Our global Ibor transition programme, which is overseen by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, will continue to deliver IT and operational processes to meet its objectives.\n- \u00b7 We carry out extensive training, communication and client engagement to facilitate appropriate selection of new rates and products.\n- \u00b7 We have dedicated teams in place to support the transition.\n- \u00b7 We actively transitioned legacy contracts and ceased new issuance of Libor-based contracts, other than those allowed under regulatory exemptions, with associated monitoring and controls.\n- \u00b7 We assess, monitor and dynamically manage risks arising from Ibor transition, and implement specific mitigating controls when required.\n- \u00b7 We continue to actively engage with regulatory and industry bodies to mitigate risks relating to 'tough legacy' contracts.\n\n## Financial instruments impacted by Ibor reform\n\n## (Audited)\n\nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2, the amendments to IFRSs issued in August 2020, represents the second phase of the IASB's project on the effects of interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments address issues affecting financial statements when changes are made to contractual cash flows and hedging relationships.\n\nUnder these amendments, changes made to a financial instrument measured at other than fair value through profit or loss that are economically equivalent and required by interest rate benchmark reform, do not result in the derecognition or a change in the carrying amount of the financial instrument. Instead they require the effective interest rate to be updated to reflect the change in the interest rate benchmark. In addition, hedge accounting will not be discontinued solely because of the replacement of the interest rate benchmark if the hedge meets other hedge accounting criteria.",

The amounts provide an indication of the extent of the Group's exposure to the Ibor benchmarks that are due to be replaced. Amounts are in respect of financial instruments that:\n\n- \u00b7 contractually reference an interest rate benchmark that is planned to transition to an alternative benchmark;\n- \u00b7 have a contractual maturity date beyond the date by which the reference interest rate benchmark is expected to cease; and\n- \u00b7 are recognised on HSBC's consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn March 2021, the administrator of Libor, IBA, announced that the publication date of most US dollar Libor tenors has been extended from 31 December 2021 to 30 June 2023. Publication of one-week and two-month tenors ceased after 31 December 2021. This change, together with the extended publication dates of Sibor, SOR and THBFIX, reduce the amounts presented at 31 December 2021 in the above table as some financial instruments included at 31 December 2020 will reach their contractual maturity date prior to the extended publication dates. Comparative data have not been re-presented.\n\n## Financial crime risk environment\n\nFinancial institutions remain under considerable regulatory scrutiny regarding their ability to prevent and detect financial crime. The financial crime threats we face have continued to evolve, often in tandem with broader geopolitical, socioeconomic and technological shifts in our markets, leading to challenges such as managing conflicting laws and approaches to legal and regulatory regimes.\n\nFinancial crime risk evolved during the Covid-19 pandemic, notably with the manifestation of fraud risks linked to the economic slowdown and resulting deployment of government relief measures. The accelerated digitisation of financial services has fostered significant changes to the payments ecosystem, including a multiplicity of providers and new payment mechanisms, not all of which are subject to the same level of regulatory scrutiny or regulations as financial institutions. This is presenting increasing challenges to the industry in terms of maintaining required levels of transparency, notably where institutions serve as intermediaries. Developments around digital assets and currencies, notably the role of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies, have continued at pace, with an increasing regulatory and enforcement focus on the financial crimes linked to these types of assets.\n\nExpectations with respect to the intersection of ESG issues and financial crime as our organisation, customers and suppliers transition to net zero, are increasing, not least with respect to potential 'greenwashing'. Companies also face a heightened regulatory focus on both human rights issues and environmental crimes from a financial crime perspective. We also continue to face increasing challenges presented by national data privacy",

We monitor regulatory developments closely and engage with regulators, as appropriate, to help ensure new regulatory requirements are implemented effectively and in a timely way.\n\nThe competitive landscape in which the Group operates may be impacted by future regulatory changes and government intervention. In the UK, potential regulatory developments include any legislative changes resulting from a statutory review of ringfencing, which has been undertaken by an independent panel appointed by HM Treasury. The panel has recommended several adjustments to the regime and HM Treasury is reviewing these recommendations. Legislative amendments may be proposed in due course.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We monitor for regulatory developments to understand the evolving regulatory landscape and respond with changes in a timely way.\n- \u00b7 We engage, wherever possible, with governments and regulators to make a positive contribution to regulations and ensure that new requirements are considered properly and can be implemented effectively. We hold regular meetings with relevant authorities to discuss strategic contingency plans, including those arising from geopolitical issues.\n- \u00b7 We launched our simplified conduct approach to align to our new purpose and values, in particular the value 'we take responsibility'.\n\n## Cyber threat and unauthorised access to systems\n\nTogether with other organisations, we continue to operate in an increasingly hostile cyber threat environment. This requires ongoing investment in business and technical controls to defend against these threats, including potential unauthorised access to customer accounts, attacks on our systems, and attacks on our third-party suppliers.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We continually evaluate threat levels for the most prevalent attack types and their potential outcomes. To further protect HSBC and our customers and help ensure the safe expansion of our global business lines, we strengthen our controls to reduce the likelihood and impact of advanced malware, data leakage, exposure through third parties and security vulnerabilities.\n- \u00b7 We continue to enhance our cybersecurity capabilities, including Cloud security, identity and access management, metrics and data analytics, and third-party security reviews. An important part of our defence strategy is ensuring our colleagues remain aware of cybersecurity issues and know how to report incidents.\n- \u00b7 We report and review cyber risk and control effectiveness at executive and non-executive Board level. We also report across our global businesses, functions and regions to help ensure appropriate visibility and governance of the risk and mitigating actions.\n- \u00b7 We participate globally in industry bodies and working groups to collaborate on tactics employed by cyber-crime groups and to collaborate in fighting, detecting and preventing cyberattacks on financial organisations.\n\n## Digitalisation and technological advances\n\nDevelopments in technology and changes in regulations are enabling new entrants to the industry. This challenges HSBC to continue to innovate and optimise in order to take advantage of new digital capabilities to best serve our customers, and adapt our products to attract and retain customers. As a result, we may need to increase our investment in our business to modify or adapt our existing products and services or develop new products and services to respond to our customers' needs.\n\n## Mitigating actions:\n\n- \u00b7 We continue to monitor this emerging risk, as well as the advances in technology, and changes in customer behaviours to understand how these may impact our business.\n- \u00b7 We closely monitor and assess financial crime and the impact on payment transparency and architecture.\n\n## Internally driven\n\n## Data management\n\nWe use a large number of systems and growing quantities of data to support our customers. Risk arises if data is incorrect, unavailable, misused, or unprotected. Along with other banks and financial institutions, we need to meet external regulatory obligations and laws that cover data, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's 239 guidelines and the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR').\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 Through our global data management framework, we monitor proactively the quality, availability and security of data that supports our customers and internal processes. We resolve any identified data issues in a timely manner.\n- \u00b7 We have made improvements to our data policies and are implementing an updated control framework to enhance the end-to-end management of data risk by our global businesses, global functions and regions.\n- \u00b7 We protect customer data via our data privacy framework, which establishes practices, design principles and guidelines that enable us to demonstrate compliance with data privacy laws and regulations.\n- \u00b7 We continue to modernise our data and analytics infrastructure through investments in Cloud technology, data visualisation, machine learning and AI.\n- \u00b7 We educate our employees on data risk and data management and have delivered global mandatory training on the importance of protecting data and managing data appropriately.",

        "page_content": "## Model risk management\n\nModel risk arises whenever business decision making includes reliance on models. We use models in both financial and nonfinancial contexts, as well as in a range of business applications such as customer selection, product pricing, financial crime transaction monitoring, creditworthiness evaluation and financial reporting. Assessing model performance is a continuous undertaking. Models can need redevelopment as market conditions change. This was required following the outbreak of Covid-19 as some models used for estimating credit losses needed to be redeveloped due to the dramatic change to inputs. This included GDP; unemployment rates; housing prices; and the varying government support measures introduced.\n\nWe prioritised the redevelopment of internal ratings-based ('IRB') and internal model methods ('IMM') models, in relation to counterparty credit, as part of the IRB repair and Basel III programmes with a key focus on enhancing the quality of data used as model inputs. Submission of these models to the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and other key regulators for feedback and approval is in progress. Some IMM and internal model approach ('IMA') models have been approved for use and feedback has been received for some IRB models. Climate risk modelling is a key focus for the Group as HSBC's commitment to sustainability has become a critical part of the Group's strategy.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We further enhanced the monitoring, review and challenge of loss model performance through our Model Risk Management function as part of a broader quarterly process to determine loss levels. The Model Risk Management team aims to provide strong and effective review and challenge of any future redevelopment of these models.\n- \u00b7 Model Risk Management works closely with businesses to ensure that IRB/IMM/IMA models in development meet risk management, pricing and capital management needs. Global Internal Audit provides assurance over the risk management framework for models.\n- \u00b7 Additional assurance work is performed by the model risk governance teams, which act as second lines of defence. The teams test whether controls implemented by model users comply with model risk policy and if model risk standards are adequate.\n- \u00b7 Models using advanced machine learning techniques are validated and monitored to ensure that risks that are determined by the algorithms have adequate oversight and review.\n\n## Risks arising from the receipt of services from third parties\n\nWe use third parties to provide a range of goods and services. Risks arising from the use of third-party providers and their supply chain may be harder to identify. It is critical that we ensure we have appropriate risk management policies, processes and practices over the selection, governance and oversight of third parties and their supply chain, particularly for key activities that could affect our operational resilience. Any deficiency in the management of risks associated with our third parties could affect our ability to support our customers and meet regulatory expectations.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We have enhanced our control framework for external supplier arrangements to ensure the risks associated with third-party arrangements are understood and managed effectively by our global businesses, global functions and regions.\n- \u00b7 We have applied the same control standards to intra-group arrangements as we have for external third-party arrangements to ensure we are managing them effectively.\n- \u00b7 We are implementing the changes required by the new global third-party risk policy to comply with new regulations as defined by our regulators.\n\n## Risks associated with workforce capability, capacity and environmental factors with potential impact on growth\n\nOur success in delivering our strategic priorities and managing the regulatory environment proactively depends on the development and retention of our leadership and high-performing employees. A very competitive employment market will continue to test our ability to attract and retain talent. Changed working arrangements, local Covid-19 restrictions and health concerns during the pandemic have also impacted on employee mental health and well-being.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We have put in place measures to help support our people so they are able to work safely during the Covid-19 pandemic. While our approach to workplace recovery around the world is consistent, the measures we take in different locations are specific to their environment.\n- \u00b7 We promote a diverse and inclusive workforce and provide active support across a wide range of health and well-being activities. We continue to build our speak-up culture through active campaigns.\n- \u00b7 We monitor people risks that could arise due to organisational restructuring, helping to ensure we manage redundancies sensitively and support impacted employees. We encourage our people leaders to focus on talent retention at all levels, with an empathetic mindset and approach, while ensuring the whole proposition of working at HSBC is well understood.\n- \u00b7 Our Future Skills curriculum helps provide critical skills that will enable employees and HSBC to be successful in the future.\n- \u00b7 We continue to develop succession plans for key management roles, with actions agreed and reviewed on a regular basis by the Group Executive Committee.\n\n## IT systems infrastructure and resilience\n\nWe operate an extensive and complex technology landscape, which must remain resilient in order to support customers, the organisation and markets globally. Risks arise where technology is not understood or maintained, and development of technology is not controlled.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 We continue to invest in transforming how software solutions are developed, delivered and maintained. We concentrate on improving system resilience and service continuity testing. We continue to ensure security is built into our software development life cycle and improve our testing processes and tools.\n- \u00b7 We continue to upgrade many of our IT systems, simplify our service provision and replace older IT infrastructure and applications. These enhancements supported global improvements in service availability during 2021 for both our customers and colleagues.\n\n## Change execution risk\n\nWe have continued our increased investment in strategic change to support the delivery of our strategic priorities and regulatory commitments. This requires change to be executed safely and efficiently.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 A global transformation programme is progressing with the delivery of strategic change commitments made in February 2020 to restructure our business, reallocate capital into higher growth and higher return businesses and markets, and to simplify our organisation to improve operational resilience and reduce costs.\n- \u00b7 The remit of the Transformation Oversight Executive Committee, established in 2020 to oversee the global transformation programme, was expanded in 2021 to oversee the prioritisation, strategic alignment and management of execution risk for all change portfolios and initiatives.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 We continue to work to strengthen our change management practices to deliver sustainable change, increased adoption of Agile ways of working, and a more consistent standard of delivery. The Transformation Oversight Executive Committee oversees the continued embedding of our improved Groupwide change framework released in May 2021, which sets out the mandatory principles and standards relating to leading and delivering change.\n\n## Areas of special interest\n\nDuring 2021, a number of areas were identified and considered as part of our top and emerging risks because of the effect they may have on the Group. While considered under the themes captured under top and emerging risks, in this section we have placed a particular focus on the Covid-19 pandemic and climate-related risks.\n\n## Risks related to Covid-19\n\nDespite the successful roll-out of vaccines around the world, the Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on the global economy have continued to impact our customers and organisation. The global vaccination roll-out in 2021 helped reduce the social and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, although there has been significant divergence in the speed at which vaccines have been deployed around the world. Most developed countries have now vaccinated a large proportion of their populations, but many less developed countries have struggled to secure supplies and are at an earlier stage of their roll-out. By the end of 2021, high vaccination rates had ensured that many Covid-19-related restrictions on activity in developed markets had been lifted and travel constraints were easing. However, the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021 demonstrated the continued risk new variants pose.\n\nThe pandemic necessitated governments to respond at unprecedented levels to protect public health, and to support local economies and livelihoods. The resulting government support measures and restrictions created additional challenges, given the rapid pace of change and significant operational demands. Renewed outbreaks, particularly those resulting from the emergence of variants of the virus, emphasise the ongoing threat of Covid-19 and could result in further tightening of government restrictions. There remains a divergence in approach taken by countries to the level of restrictions on activity and travel. Such diverging approaches to future pandemic waves could prolong or worsen supply chain and international travel disruptions. The evolving Covid-19 restrictions in Hong Kong, including travel, public gathering and social distancing restrictions, are impacting the Hong Kong economy, and may affect the ability to attract and retain staff.\n\nWe continue to support our personal and business customers through market-specific measures initiated during the Covid-19 pandemic, and by supporting those remaining national government schemes that focus on the parts of the economy most impacted by the pandemic. For further details of our customer relief programmes, see page 159.\n\nThe rapid introduction and varying nature of the government support schemes introduced throughout the Covid-19 pandemic led to increased operational risks, including complex conduct considerations, increased reputational risk and increased risk of fraud. These risks are likely to be heightened further as and when those remaining government support schemes are unwound. These events have also led to increased litigation risk.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic on the long-term prospects of businesses in the most vulnerable sectors of the economy - such as retail, hospitality, travel and commercial real estate - remains uncertain and may lead to significant credit losses on specific exposures, which may not be fully captured in ECL estimates. In addition, in times of stress, fraudulent activity is often more prevalent, leading to potentially significant credit or operational losses.\n\nAs economic conditions improve, and government support measures come to an end, there is a risk that the outputs of IFRS 9\n\nmodels may have a tendency to underestimate loan losses. To help mitigate this risk, model outputs and management adjustments are closely monitored and independently reviewed at the Group and country level for reliability and appropriateness. For further details on model risk, see page 209.\n\nDespite the ongoing economic recovery, significant uncertainties remain in assessing the duration and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, including whether any subsequent outbreaks result in a reimposition of government restrictions. There is a risk that economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period, increasing inequality across markets, and it will likely be some time before societies return to pre-pandemic levels of social interactions. As a result, there may still be a requirement for additional mitigating actions including further use of adjustments, overlays and model redevelopment.\n\nGovernments and central banks in major economies have deployed extensive measures to support their local populations. This is expected to reverse partially in 2022. Central banks in major markets are expected to raise interest rates, but such increases are expected to be gradual and monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative overall. Policy tightening in major emerging markets has already begun in order to counteract rising inflation and the risk of capital outflows. Governments are also expected to reduce the level of fiscal support they offer households and businesses as the appetite for broad lockdowns and public health restrictions decreases. Government debt has risen in most advanced economies, and is expected to remain high into the medium term. High government debt burdens have raised fiscal vulnerabilities, increasing the sensitivity of debt service costs to interest rate increases and potentially reducing the fiscal space available to address future economic downturns. Our Central scenario used to calculate impairment assumes that economic activity will continue to recover through 2022, surpassing peak pre-pandemic levels of GDP in all our key markets. It is assumed that private sector growth accelerates, ensuring a strong recovery is sustained even as pandemic-related fiscal support is withdrawn. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with economic forecasts in the current environment and there are significant risks to our Central scenario. The degree of uncertainty varies by market, driven by country-specific trends in the evolution of the pandemic and associated policy responses. As a result, our Central scenario for impairment has not been assigned an equal likelihood of occurrence across our key markets. For further details of our Central and other scenarios, see 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates' on page 144.\n\nWe continue to monitor the situation closely, and given the novel and prolonged nature of the pandemic, additional mitigating actions may be required.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nClimate change can have an impact across HSBC's risk taxonomy through both transition and physical channels. Transition risk can arise from the move to a net zero economy, such as through policy, regulatory and technological changes. Physical risk can arise through increasing severity and/or frequency of severe weather or other climatic events, such as rising sea levels and flooding.\n\nThese have the potential to cause both idiosyncratic and systemic risks, resulting in potential financial and non-financial impacts for HSBC. Financial impacts could materialise if transition and physical risks impact the ability of our customers to repay their loans. Non-financial impacts could materialise if our own assets or operations are impacted by extreme weather or chronic changes in weather patterns, or as a result of business decisions to achieve our climate ambition.\n\n## How climate risk can impact our customers\n\nClimate change could impact our customers in two main ways. Firstly, customer business models may fail to align to a net zero economy, which could mean that new climate-related regulation would have a material impact on their business. Secondly, extreme weather events or chronic changes in weather patterns",

To do this effectively, we must understand the risks they are facing.\n\nThe table below summarises the key categories of transition and physical risk, with examples of how our customers might be affected financially by climate change and the shift to a lowcarbon economy.\n\n| Climate risk   |                      | Main causes of financial impact on customers                                                                                                   |\n|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Transition     | Policy and  legal    | Mandates on, and regulation of, existing  products and services  Litigation from parties who have suffered  from the effects of climate change |\n|                | Technology           | Replacement of existing products with lower  emission options                                                                                  |\n|                | End-demand  (market) | Changing consumer behaviour                                                                                                                    |\n|                | Reputational         | Increased scrutiny following a change in  stakeholder perceptions of climate-related  action or inaction                                       |\n| Physical       | Acute                | Increased frequency and severity of weather  events                                                                                            |\n|                | Chronic              | Changes in precipitation patterns Rising temperatures                                                                                          |\n\nFor further details on how we manage climate risk for our other stakeholders, see the ESG review on page 56.\n\n## Integrating climate into enterprise-wide risk management\n\nOur approach to climate risk management is aligned to our Groupwide risk management framework and three lines of defence model, which sets out how we identify, assess and manage our risks. This approach ensures the Board and senior management have visibility and oversight of our key climate risks.\n\n## Climate risk appetite\n\nOur developing climate risk appetite measures support the oversight and management of the financial and non-financial risks from climate change, meet regulatory expectations and support the business to deliver our climate ambition in a safe and sustainable way. Our initial measures are focused on the oversight and management of our key climate risks: wholesale credit risk, retail credit risk, reputational risk, resilience risk and regulatory compliance. These measures are implemented at a global and regional level. We continue to develop climate risk appetite measures and our future ambition for our climate risk appetite is to:\n\n- \u00b7 adapt the risk appetite metrics to incorporate forward-looking transition plans and net zero commitments;\n- \u00b7 expand metrics to consider other financial and non-financial risks; and\n- \u00b7 use enhanced scenario analysis capabilities.\n\n## Climate risk policies, processes and controls\n\nWe are integrating climate risk into the policies, processes and controls for our key climate risks and we will continue to update these as our climate risk management capabilities mature over time. We have updated our policy on product management, and developed the first version of a climate risk scoring tool for our corporate portfolios. In addition, we published and started to implement our new thermal coal phase-out policy. For further details on our thermal coal phase-out policy, see page 62.\n\n## Climate risk governance and reporting\n\nOur global and regional Climate Risk Oversight Forums are responsible for the oversight, management and escalation of climate risks across the Group and are supported by specific forums for our global businesses, as well as for our Risk and Compliance function. These include the Sustainability Risk Oversight Forum, the WPB Risk Management Meeting and the Regulatory Compliance ESG and Climate Risk Working Group.\n\nOur climate risk management information dashboard includes metrics relating to our key climate risks, and is reported to the Group Climate Risk Oversight Forum. The Group Risk Management Meeting and the Group Risk Committee receive scheduled updates on climate risk, and receive regular updates on our climate risk appetite and top and emerging climate risks.\n\nFor further details on the Group's ESG governance structure, see page 80.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer is the key senior manager responsible for the management of climate-related financial risks under the UK Senior Managers Regime. The Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer is the overall accountable executive for the Group's climate risk programme, including responsibility for governance, risk management, stress testing and scenario analysis and disclosures.\n\n## Climate risk programme\n\nOur dedicated programme continues to accelerate the development of our climate risk management capabilities. The key achievements in 2021 include:\n\n- \u00b7 We delivered tailored training sessions to our legal entity boards.\n- \u00b7 We delivered training to colleagues across the three lines of defence so they can understand climate risk as part of their role, and we also included an introduction to our climate ambition in our global mandatory training.\n- \u00b7 We developed our climate risk scoring tool for corporate customers for use in priority regions, which builds on our corporate transition questionnaire.\n- \u00b7 We introduced a risk appetite based on monitoring climate risk exposure at property level across the UK mortgage portfolio.\n- \u00b7 We have continued to develop our climate stress testing and scenarios capabilities, including model development and delivered regulatory climate stress tests. These are being used to further improve our understanding of our risk exposures for use in risk management and business decision making. For more detail on our approach to climate stress testing and scenario analysis, see page 57.\n\nWe will continue to enhance our climate risk management capabilities throughout 2022. This will include the further roll-out of training, refinement of our risk appetite, enhancement of our climate risk scoring tool and increasing the availability and quality of data so that new metrics can be developed.\n\n## How climate risk can impact HSBC\n\nBelow, we provide details on how climate risk impacts to our customers might manifest across our key climate risks, and the potential timeframes involved using the TCFD's four main drivers of transition climate risk - policy and legal, technology, enddemand (market) and reputational - and two physical risk drivers acute and chronic.",

These are oil and gas, building and construction, chemicals, automotive, power and utilities, and metals and mining. We continue to roll out our transition and physical risk questionnaire to our largest customers in high-risk sectors, with the addition of four more sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, real estate and transportation. The questionnaires will help us to assess and improve our understanding of the impact of climate changes on our customers' business models and any related transition strategies. It also helps us to identify potential business opportunities to support the transition. In 2022, we intend to increase the scope of the questionnaires by adding more countries to the scope.\n\n## Management\n\nIn 2021, we developed a scoring tool, which provides a climate risk score for each customer based on questionnaire responses. The climate risk score will then be used in portfolio level management information to assess and compare clients. The scoring tool will be enhanced and refined over time as more data becomes available. The results of the tool have been provided to business and risk management teams. During 2021, we also performed a climate-related stress test, as explained further on page 58. In 2022 we aim to further embed climate risk considerations in our credit risk management processes.\n\n## Aggregation and reporting\n\nWe currently internally report our transition risk exposure and RWAs consumed by the six high-risk sectors in the wholesale portfolio.\n\nWe also report the proportion of questionnaire responses that reported either having a board policy or management plan for transition risk. Our key wholesale credit exposures are included as part of our broader ESG management information dashboard, which is presented to the Group Executive Committee each quarter. In addition, a representative from wholesale credit risk attends the Global Climate Risk Oversight Forum to ensure consideration of this risk type, and we report our exposure through the climate risk management information dashboard at this meeting.\n\nWe will continue to report these metrics in 2022 and will aim to cascade these measures to global businesses and to provide insight on the climate risk profile of our portfolio and customers.\n\nIn the table below, we capture our lending activity, including environmentally responsible and sustainable finance activities, to customers within the six high risk sectors. Green financing for large companies that work in high transition sectors is also included. The overall exposure has increased slightly to 20.0% (2020:19.6%). For further details on how we designate counterparties as high transition risk, see footnote 2.\n\nSince 2019, we have received responses from customers within the six high transition risk sectors, which represent 56% of our exposure, an increase in coverage of 15% since last year. The breakdown of our customer responses is presented by sector in the table below.\n\nWithin the power and utilities, and metals and mining sectors shown in the table below, and recognising external third-party assessments of power generation and mining capacity, our exposure to thermal coal is 0.2% of the total wholesale loans and advances figures.\n\nWholesale loan exposure to transition risk sectors and customer questionnaire responses at 31 December 2021\n\n|                                                                                                          | Automotive %   | Chemicals %   | Construction  and building  materials  %   | Metals and  mining %   | Oil and  gas %   | Power and  utilities %   | Total %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-----------|\n| Wholesale loan exposure as % of total wholesale loans and advances to  customers and banks 1,2,3         | \u2264 2.8          | \u2264 3.4         | \u2264 4.5                                      | \u2264 2.4                  | \u2264 3.4            | \u2264 3.5                    | \u2264 20.0    |\n| Proportion of sector for which questionnaires were completed 4                                           | 59             | 44            | 56                                         | 52                     | 64               | 59                       | 56        |\n| Proportion of questionnaire responses that reported either having a  board policy or a management plan 4 | 65             | 76            | 76                                         | 57                     | 77               | 90                       | 75        |\n| Sector weight as proportion of high transition risk sector 4                                             | 14             | 17            | 22                                         | 12                     | 17               | 18                       | 100       |",

This enabled us to enhance our understanding and assess the impact of physical risk to our mortgage portfolio under three potential future climate scenarios, with a focus on the UK, Hong Kong and Canada.\n\nAdditionally, for the UK mortgage portfolio, we considered the impact of potential minimum energy performance certificate ('EPC') rating requirements, as well as changes to the availability of buildings insurance following the demise of FloodRe. These factors were considered alongside macroeconomic drivers, given the supplemental data available for the UK.\n\nFloodRe is a scheme between the UK Government and the insurance industry that aims to improve the availability and affordability of flood cover for properties in high flood risk areas. It is currently in place until 2039.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of future climate risk relies heavily upon the availability of quality data, as well as on the evolution of climate risk modelling expertise. As this matures, we plan to expand our approach to additional markets.\n\n## Management\n\nWe are focusing on embedding climate risk into retail credit risk management processes, prioritising the largest residential mortgage portfolios.\n\nWe continue to update our risk management framework to reflect lessons learnt.\n\n## Aggregation and reporting\n\nWe manage and monitor the integration of climate risk across Wealth and Personal Banking through the Risk Management Meeting.\n\nWe have also developed and are implementing metrics to support active risk management, which will be tracked and monitored through relevant credit risk meetings.\n\nA representative from Retail Credit Risk attends the Group Climate Risk Oversight Forum to ensure this risk type is considered.\n\n## How we are starting to measure climate risk\n\nWe are starting to measure climate risk with the most material market, which is the UK, where the primary risk facing properties is flooding.\n\nUsing a risk methodology that considers a combination of the likelihood and severity of flood hazard affecting individual properties, we estimate that on a total volume basis, and at present day levels, 3.5% of the UK retail banking mortgage portfolio is at high risk of flooding, and 0.3% is at a very high risk. This is based on 94% coverage of our mortgage portfolio and is reliant on flood data provided by Ambiental Risk Analytics, flood risk experts and suppliers of flood models to more than 50% of the UK insurance industry.\n\nThis data will enable monitoring and reporting of properties at risk of flooding, which will support activities to educate impacted customers and protect the Group from incurring losses as a result of climate events.\n\nOur transition risk efforts in the UK have focused on obtaining current and potential energy efficiency ratings for individual properties, sourced from property EPC data.\n\nThe UK Government has a stated ambition to improve the EPC ratings of housing stock as set out in its Clean Growth Strategy. We are working towards improving the proportion of properties on our book with an EPC rating of C or above and on improving the EPC data coverage.\n\nWe have approximately 53% of properties in our portfolio with a valid EPC certificate (i.e. dated within the last 10 years) and 35.7% of these are rated A to C.\n\nFor further details and metrics relating to physical and transition risk to our UK mortgage portfolio, see our ESG Data Pack at www.hsbc.com/esg.\n\n## Reputational risk\n\n## Identification and assessment\n\nWe implement sustainability risk policies, including the Equator Principles, as part of our broader reputational risk framework. We focus on sensitive sectors that may have a high adverse impact on people or the environment, and in which we have a significant number of customers. A key area of focus is high-carbon sectors, which include oil and gas, power generation, mining, agricultural commodities and forestry. During 2021 we published our thermal coal phase-out policy.\n\n## Management\n\nAs the primary point of contact for our customers, our relationship managers are responsible for checking that our customers meet policies aimed at reducing carbon impacts. Our global network of more than 75 sustainability risk managers provides local policy support and expertise to relationship managers. A central Sustainability Risk team provides a higher level of guidance and is responsible for the oversight of policy compliance and implementation over wholesale banking activities. During 2021, we introduced a refreshed assurance framework, which takes a risk-based approach focusing on higher risks.\n\nFor further details on our sustainability risk policies, see our ESG review on page 62.\n\n## Aggregation and reporting\n\nOur Sustainability Risk Oversight Forum provides a Group-wide forum for senior members of our Global Risk and Compliance team and global businesses. It also oversees the development and implementation of sustainability risk policies. Cases involving complex sustainability risk issues related to customers, transactions or third parties are managed through the reputational risk and client selection governance process. We report annually on our implementation of the Equator Principles and the corporate loans, project-related bridge loans and advisory mandates completed under the principles. With the introduction of Equator Principles IV, a training programme was delivered to raise the awareness of the changes and obligations therein.\n\nFor the latest report, see: www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/our-climatestrategy/sustainability-risk/equator-principles.\n\nA representative from Reputational risk attends the Group Climate Risk Forum to ensure consideration of this risk type.\n\n## Regulatory compliance risk\n\n## Identification and assessment\n\nCompliance, as a sub-function within Group Risk and Compliance, continues to prioritise the identification and assessment of compliance risks that may arise from climate risk. Although not an exhaustive list, key regulatory compliance risks under consideration include those related to product management, misselling, marketing, conflicts of interest and regulatory change.\n\nAn area of particular focus is the risk of greenwashing. We regard greenwashing as the act of knowingly or unknowingly misleading stakeholders regarding our climate ambition, the climate impact/ benefits of a product or service or regarding the climate commitments of our customers. For the Compliance function, product-based greenwashing is a key area of focus. When considering product-based greenwashing, we seek to:\n\n- \u00b7 effectively and consistently consider climate risk factors in the development and ongoing governance of new, changed or withdrawn products and services through the enhancement of existing risk management frameworks utilised within the Group's operating entities and lines of business, enabling climate risks to be identified and assessed in a timely manner;",

As such, we have integrated and are continuing to enhance climate risk considerations within our product and customer life-cycle policies. Our policies set the minimum standards that are required to manage the risk of breaches of our regulatory duty to customers, including those related to climate risk, ensuring fair customer outcomes are achieved.\n\nThe Compliance sub-function placed significant focus in 2021 on supporting and improving the capability of Compliance colleagues through climate-specific training, communications and guidance materials to ensure the robust identification, assessment and management of climate risks.\n\n## Aggregation and reporting\n\nThe Compliance sub-function continues to operate an ESG and Climate Risk Working Group. This group tracks and monitors the integration and embedding of Climate risk within the management of regulatory compliance risks and controls more generally, and monitors ongoing regulatory and legislative changes across the sustainability and climate risk agenda.\n\nWe have also developed and implemented climate risk metrics and indicators aligned to wider regulatory compliance risks.\n\n## Our material banking risks\n\nThe material risk types associated with our banking and insurance manufacturing operations are described in the following tables:\n\n## Description of risks - banking operations\n\n| Risks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Arising from                                                                                                                                                                                          | Measurement, monitoring and management of risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk (see page 137)                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Credit risk (see page 137)                                                                                                                                                                            | Credit risk (see page 137)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Credit risk is the risk of financial  loss if a customer or  counterparty fails to meet an  obligation under a contract.                                                                                                                                 | Credit risk arises principally  from direct lending, trade  finance and leasing business,  but also from other products  such as guarantees and  derivatives.                                         | Credit risk is: \u00b7 measured as the amount that could be lost if a customer or counterparty fails to  make repayments;

Credit risk arises principally from direct lending, trade finance and leasing business, but also from other products such as guarantees and credit derivatives.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nThere were no material changes to the policies and practices for the management of credit risk in 2021. We continued to apply the requirements of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' within the Credit Risk sub-function.\n\nDue to the Covid-19 pandemic and its continued effects on the global economy we provided short-term support to customers through market-specific measures under the current credit policy framework. We have also implemented the guidance provided by regulators on managing the credit portfolio as required throughout the course of the customer relief life cycle.\n\nThe extent of our support depends on the degree of countryspecific government support measures, restrictions, associated policy responses, and the effects of new Covid-19 variants.\n\nThe majority of the customer relief programmes that we provided during the Covid-19 pandemic ended by 31 December 2021 and will not be reassessed under the revised definition of default. For further details of market-specific measures to support our personal and business customers, see page 159.\n\nIn the second half of 2021, market concerns regarding China's commercial real estate sector emerged. At 31 December 2021 we had no direct exposures to developers in the 'red' category under the Chinese government's 'three red lines' framework used to govern the real estate sector. We continue to monitor the situation closely, including potential indirect impacts that may arise, and seek to take mitigating actions as required under our existing policy framework.\n\nDuring 2021, we adopted the EBA 'Guidelines on the application of definition of default' for our wholesale portfolios. This did not have a material impact on our wholesale portfolios. For our retail portfolios, these guidelines will be adopted in 2022 and this is not expected to have a material impact.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nWe have established Group-wide credit risk management and related IFRS 9 processes. We continue to assess the impact of economic developments in key markets on specific customers, customer segments or portfolios. As credit conditions change, we take mitigating actions, including the revision of risk appetites or limits and tenors, as appropriate. In addition, we continue to evaluate the terms under which we provide credit facilities within the context of individual customer requirements, the quality of the relationship, local regulatory requirements, market practices and our local market position.\n\n## Credit Risk sub-function\n\n## (Audited)\n\nCredit approval authorities are delegated by the Board to the Group Chief Executive together with the authority to sub-delegate them. The Credit Risk sub-function in Global Risk and Compliance is responsible for the key policies and processes for managing credit risk, which include formulating Group credit policies and risk rating frameworks, guiding the Group's appetite for credit risk exposures, undertaking independent reviews and objective assessment of credit risk, and monitoring performance and management of portfolios.\n\nThe principal objectives of our credit risk management are:\n\n- \u00b7 to maintain across HSBC a strong culture of responsible lending, and robust risk policies and control frameworks;\n- \u00b7 to both partner and challenge our businesses in defining, implementing and continually re-evaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions; and\n- \u00b7 to ensure there is independent, expert scrutiny of credit risks, their costs and their mitigation.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\n## IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' process\n\nThe IFRS 9 process comprises three main areas: modelling and data; implementation; and governance.\n\n## Modelling and data\n\nWe have established IFRS 9 modelling and data processes in various geographies, which are subject to internal model risk governance including independent review of significant model developments.\n\n## Implementation\n\nA centralised impairment engine performs the expected credit losses calculation using data, which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements, from a variety of client, finance and risk systems. Where possible, these checks and processes are performed in a globally consistent and centralised manner.\n\n## Governance\n\nRegional management review forums are established in key sites and regions in order to review and approve the impairment results. Regional management review forums have representatives from Credit Risk and Finance. The key site and regional approvals are reported up to the global business impairment committee for final approval of the Group's ECL for the period. Required members of the committee are the global heads of Wholesale Credit, Market Risk, and Wealth and Personal Banking Risk, as well as the relevant global business Chief Financial Officer and the Global Financial Controller.\n\n## Concentration of exposure\n\n## (Audited)\n\nConcentrations of credit risk arise when a number of counterparties or exposures have comparable economic characteristics, or such counterparties are engaged in similar activities or operate in the same geographical areas or industry sectors so that their collective ability to meet contractual obligations is uniformly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. We use a number of controls and measures to minimise undue concentration of exposure in our portfolios across industries, countries and global businesses. These include portfolio and counterparty limits, approval and review controls, and stress testing.\n\n## Credit quality of financial instruments\n\n## (Audited)\n\nOur risk rating system facilitates the internal ratings-based approach under the Basel framework adopted by the Group to support the calculation of our minimum credit regulatory capital requirement. The five credit quality classifications encompass a range of granular internal credit rating grades assigned to",

All corporate customers are rated using the 10- or 23-grade scale, depending on the degree of sophistication of the Basel approach adopted for the exposure.\n\nEach CRR band is associated with an external rating grade by reference to long-run default rates for that grade, represented by the average of issuer-weighted historical default rates. This mapping between internal and external ratings is indicative and may vary over time.\n\n## Retail lending\n\nRetail lending credit quality is based on a 12-month point-in-time probability-weighted PD.\n\n## Credit quality classification\n\n|                            | Sovereign debt  securities and bills   | Other debt  securities and bills   | Wholesale lending and derivatives   | Wholesale lending and derivatives         | Retail lending          | Retail lending                        |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                            | External credit  rating                | External credit  rating            | Internal credit  rating             | 12-month Basel  probability of  default % | Internal credit  rating | 12 month  probability-  weighted PD % |\n| Quality classification 1,2 |                                        |                                    |                                     |                                           |                         |                                       |\n| Strong                     | BBB and above                          | A- and above                       | CRR 1 to CRR 2                      | 0-0.169                                   | Band 1 and 2            | 0.000-0.500                           |\n| Good                       | BBB- to BB                             | BBB+ to BBB-                       | CRR 3                               | 0.170-0.740                               | Band 3                  | 0.501-1.500                           |\n| Satisfactory               | BB- to B and  unrated                  | BB+ to B and  unrated              | CRR 4 to CRR 5                      | 0.741-4.914                               | Band 4 and 5            | 1.501-20.000                          |\n| Sub-standard               | B- to C                                | B- to C                            | CRR 6 to CRR 8                      | 4.915-99.999                              | Band 6                  | 20.001-99.999                         |\n| Credit impaired            | Default                                | Default                            | CRR 9 to CRR 10                     | 100                                       | Band 7                  | 100                                   |\n\n- 1  Customer risk rating ('CRR').\n- 2  12-month point-in-time probability-weighted probability of default ('PD').\n\n## Quality classification definitions\n\n- \u00b7 'Strong' exposures demonstrate a strong capacity to meet financial commitments, with negligible or low probability of default and/or low levels of expected loss.\n- \u00b7 'Good' exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate a good capacity to meet financial commitments, with low default risk.\n- \u00b7 'Satisfactory' exposures require closer monitoring and demonstrate an average-to-fair capacity to meet financial commitments, with moderate default risk.\n- \u00b7 'Sub-standard' exposures require varying degrees of special attention and default risk is of greater concern.\n- \u00b7 'Credit-impaired' exposures have been assessed as described on Note 1.2(i) on the financial statements.\n\n## Renegotiated loans and forbearance\n\n## (Audited)\n\n'Forbearance' describes concessions made on the contractual terms of a loan in response to an obligor's financial difficulties.\n\nA loan is classed as 'renegotiated' when we modify the contractual payment terms on concessionary terms because we have significant concerns about the borrowers' ability to meet contractual payments when due. Non-payment-related concessions (e.g. covenant waivers), while potential indicators of impairment, do not trigger identification as renegotiated loans under our existing disclosures.\n\nLoans that have been identified as renegotiated retain this designation until maturity or derecognition under our existing disclosures.\n\nFor details of our policy on derecognised renegotiated loans, see Note 1.2(i) on the financial statements.\n\n## Credit quality of renegotiated loans\n\nOn execution of a renegotiation, the loan will also be classified as credit impaired if it is not already so classified. In wholesale lending, all facilities with a customer, including loans that have not been modified, are considered credit impaired following the identification of a renegotiated loan under our existing disclosures.\n\nWholesale renegotiated loans are classified as credit impaired until there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment of future cash flows, observed over a minimum one-year period, and there are no other indicators of impairment. Personal renegotiated loans generally remain credit impaired until repayment, write-off or derecognition.\n\n## Renegotiated loans and recognition of expected credit losses\n\n## (Audited)\n\nFor retail lending, unsecured renegotiated loans are generally segmented from other parts of the loan portfolio. Renegotiated expected credit loss assessments reflect the higher rates of losses typically encountered with renegotiated loans. For wholesale lending, renegotiated loans are typically assessed individually. Credit risk ratings are intrinsic to the impairment assessments. The individual impairment assessment takes into account the higher risk of the future non-payment inherent in renegotiated loans.\n\n## Customer relief programmes and renegotiated loans\n\nIn response to the Covid-19 pandemic, governments and regulators around the world encouraged a range of customer relief programmes including payment deferrals. In determining whether a customer is experiencing financial difficulty for the purposes of identifying renegotiated loans a payment deferral requested under such schemes, or an extension thereof, is not automatically determined to be evidence of financial difficulty and would therefore not automatically trigger identification as renegotiated loans. Rather, information provided by payment deferrals is considered in the context of other reasonable and supportable information. The IFRS 9 treatment of customer relief programmes is explained on page 159.\n\n## Impairment assessment\n\n## (Audited)\n\nFor details of our impairment policies on loans and advances and financial investments, see Note 1.2(i) on the financial statements.",

The standard period runs until the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days contractually delinquent. However, in exceptional circumstances to achieve a fair customer outcome, and in line with regulatory expectations, they may be extended further.\n\nFor secured facilities, write-off should occur upon repossession of collateral, receipt of proceeds via settlement, or determination that recovery of the collateral will not be pursued.\n\nAny secured assets maintained on the balance sheet beyond 60 months of consecutive delinquency-driven default require additional monitoring and review to assess the prospect of recovery.\n\nThere are exceptions in a few countries and territories where local regulation or legislation constrains earlier write-off, or where the realisation of collateral for secured real estate lending takes more time. Write-off, either partially or in full, may be earlier when there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, for example, in the event of a bankruptcy or equivalent legal proceedings. Collection procedures may continue after write-off.\n\n## Credit risk in 2021\n\nAt 31 December 2021, gross loans and advances to customers and banks of $1,140bn increased by $6.3bn, compared with 31 December 2020. This included adverse foreign exchange movements of $17.0bn and a $2.4bn decrease due to domestic mass market retail banking in the US being reclassified to assets held for sale.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, the growth was driven by a $24.0bn increase in personal loans and advances to customers and a $3.0bn increase in loans and advances to banks. Wholesale loans and advances to customers decreased by $3.7bn.\n\nThe increase in personal loans and advances to customers was driven by mortgage growth of $22.8bn, mainly in the UK (up $10.1bn), Hong Kong (up $6.6bn), Canada (up $3.4bn) and Australia (up $2.1bn). Other personal lending increased by $1.2bn, mainly from unsecured personal lending in Hong Kong (up $1.0bn) and Latin America (up $0.7bn), as well as guaranteed loans in respect of residential property in France (up $0.8bn). These were offset by a decrease in credit cards mainly in the US (down $0.9bn).\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the allowance for ECL of $12.2bn decreased by $3.5bn compared with 31 December 2020, including favourable foreign exchange movements of $0.4bn. The $12.2bn allowance comprised $11.6bn in respect of assets held at amortised cost, $0.4bn in respect of loan commitments and financial guarantees, and $0.1bn in respect of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI').\n\nDuring the first half of 2021, the Group experienced a release in allowances for ECL, reflecting an improvement of the economic outlook. This trend continued during the second half of the year following better than expected levels of credit performance and lower levels of stage 3 charges. However, in the later part of the\n\nyear the trend slowed down due to the emergence of the new Omicron variant and the recent developments in China's commercial real estate sector.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, the allowance for ECL in relation to loans and advances to customers decreased by $2.7bn from 31 December 2020. This was attributable to:\n\n- \u00b7 a $1.2bn decrease in wholesale loans and advances to customers, of which $1.0bn was driven by stages 1 and 2; and\n- \u00b7 a $1.5bn decrease in personal loans and advances to customers, of which $1.3bn was driven by stages 1 and 2.\n\nDuring the first six months of the year, the Group experienced significant migrations from stage 2 to stage 1, reflecting an improvement of the economic outlook. This trend continued during the second half of 2021 as forecasts underpinning forward economic guidance stabilised.\n\nStage 3 balances at 31 December 2021 remained broadly stable compared with 31 December 2020.\n\nThe ECL release for 2021 was $0.9bn, inclusive of recoveries. This release comprised $0.6bn in respect of wholesale lending, of which the stage 3 and purchased or originated credit impaired ('POCI') charge was $0.5bn, and $0.3bn in respect of personal lending, of which the stage 3 charge was $0.4bn. Uncertainty remains as countries recover from the pandemic at different speeds, government support measures unwind and the emergence of new strains of the virus continue to test the efficacy of vaccination programmes.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to provide Covid-19-related support to customers under the current policy framework. For further details of market-specific measures to support our personal and business customers, see page 159.\n\n## Income statement movements are analysed further on page 92.\n\nWhile credit risk arises across most of our balance sheet, ECL have typically been recognised on loans and advances to customers and banks, in addition to securitisation exposures and other structured products. As a result, our disclosures focus primarily on these two areas.

The table excludes financial instruments whose carrying amount best represents the net exposure to credit risk, and it excludes equity securities as they are not subject to credit risk. For the financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount and is net of the allowance for ECL. For financial guarantees and other guarantees granted, it is the maximum amount that we would have to pay if the guarantees were called upon. For loan commitments and other credit-related commitments, it is generally the full amount of the committed facilities.\n\nThe offset in the table relates to amounts where there is a legally enforceable right of offset in the event of counterparty default and where, as a result, there is a net exposure for credit risk purposes. However, as there is no intention to settle these balances on a net basis under normal circumstances, they do not qualify for net presentation for accounting purposes. No offset has been applied to off-balance sheet collateral. In the case of derivatives, the offset column also includes collateral received in cash and other financial assets.\n\nCommentary on consolidated balance sheet movements in 2021 is provided on page 96.\n\nThe offset on derivatives remains in line with the movements in maximum exposure amounts.\n\n## Other credit risk mitigants\n\nWhile not disclosed as an offset in the following 'Maximum exposure to credit risk' table, other arrangements are in place that reduce our maximum exposure to credit risk. These include a charge over collateral on borrowers' specific assets, such as residential properties, collateral held in the form of financial instruments that are not held on the balance sheet and short positions in securities. In addition, for financial assets held as part of linked insurance/investment contracts the risk is predominantly borne by the policyholder. See page 322 and Note 30 on the financial statements for further details of collateral in respect of certain loans and advances and derivatives.\n\nCollateral available to mitigate credit risk is disclosed in the 'Collateral' section on page 169.",

We operate in a number of geographical markets with the majority of our exposures in Asia and Europe.\n\nFor an analysis of:\n\n- \u00b7 financial investments, see Note 17 on the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 trading assets, see Note 11 on the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 derivatives, see page 176 and Note 16 on the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 loans and advances by industry sector and by the location of the principal operations of the lending subsidiary (or, in the case of the operations of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank plc, HSBC Bank Middle East Limited and HSBC Bank USA, by the location of the lending branch), see page 162 for wholesale lending and page 176 for personal lending.\n\n## Credit deterioration of financial instruments\n\n(Audited)\n\nA summary of our current policies and practices regarding the identification, treatment and measurement of stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 (credit impaired) and POCI financial instruments can be found in Note 1.2 on the financial statements.\n\n## Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates\n\n## (Audited)\n\nDespite a broad recovery in economic conditions during 2021, ECL estimates continued to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and management judgements and estimates continued to reflect a degree of caution, both in the selection of economic scenarios and their weightings, and through management judgemental adjustments. Releases of provisions were made progressively as economic conditions recovered and by 31 December 2021 the majority of the 2020 uplift in ECL provisions had been reversed. By the end of 2021, we retained $0.6bn (15%) of the $3.9bn uplift in stage 1 and stage 2 ECL provisions on loans made during 2020.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of ECL involves the use of significant judgement and estimation. We form multiple economic scenarios based on economic forecasts, apply these assumptions to credit risk models to estimate future credit losses, and probability-weight the results to determine an unbiased ECL estimate. Management judgemental adjustments are used to address late-breaking events, data and model limitations, model deficiencies and expert credit judgements.\n\n## Methodology\n\nFour economic scenarios are used to capture the current economic environment and to articulate management's view of the range of potential outcomes. Scenarios produced to calculate ECL are aligned to HSBC's top and emerging risks.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, to ensure that the severe risks associated with the pandemic were appropriately captured, management added a fourth, more severe, scenario to use in the measurement of ECL. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, HSBC's methodology has been adjusted so that the use of four scenarios, of which two are Downside scenarios, is the standard approach to ECL calculation.\n\nThree of the scenarios are drawn from consensus forecasts and distributional estimates. The Central scenario is deemed the 'most likely' scenario, and usually attracts the largest probability weighting, while the outer scenarios represent the tails of the distribution, which are less likely to occur. The Central scenario is created using the average of a panel of external forecasters. Consensus Upside and Downside scenarios are created with reference to distributions for select markets that capture forecasters' views of the entire range of outcomes. In the later years of the scenarios, projections revert to long-term consensus trend expectations. In the consensus outer scenarios, reversion to trend expectations is done mechanically with reference to historically observed quarterly changes in the values of macroeconomic variables.\n\nThe fourth scenario, Downside 2, is designed to represent management's view of severe downside risks. It is a globally consistent narrative-driven scenario that explores more extreme economic outcomes than those captured by the consensus scenarios. In this scenario, variables do not, by design, revert to long-term trend expectations. They may instead explore alternative states of equilibrium, where economic activity moves permanently away from past trends.\n\nThe consensus Downside and the consensus Upside scenarios are each constructed to be consistent with a 10% probability. The Downside 2 is constructed with a 5% probability. The Central scenario is assigned the remaining 75%. This weighting scheme is deemed appropriate for the unbiased estimation of ECL in most circumstances. However, management may depart from this probability-based scenario weighting approach when the economic outlook is determined to be particularly uncertain and risks are elevated.\n\nIn light of ongoing risks, related primarily to the Covid-19 pandemic, management deviated from this probability weighting in most markets in the fourth quarter of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Description of economic scenarios\n\nThe economic assumptions presented in this section have been formed by HSBC with reference to external forecasts specifically for the purpose of calculating ECL.\n\nThe global economy experienced a recovery in 2021, following an unprecedented contraction in 2020. Restrictions to mobility and travel eased across our key markets, aided by the successful rollout of vaccination programmes. The emergence of new variants that potentially reduce the efficacy of vaccines remains a risk.\n\nEconomic forecasts remain subject to a high degree of uncertainty. Risks to the economic outlook are dominated by the progression of the pandemic, vaccine roll-out and the public policy response. Geopolitical risks also remain significant and include continued differences between the US and other countries with China over a range of economic and strategic defence issues. Continued uncertainty over the long-term economic relationship between the UK and EU also present downside risks.\n\nThe scenarios used to calculate ECL in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 are described below.\n\n## The consensus Central scenario\n\nHSBC's Central scenario features a continued recovery in economic growth in 2022 as activity and employment gradually return to the levels reached prior to the outbreak of Covid-19.\n\nOur Central scenario assumes that the stringent restrictions on activity, imposed across several countries and territories in 2020 and 2021 are not repeated. The new viral strain that emerged late in 2021, Omicron, has only a limited impact on the recovery, according to this scenario. Consumer spending and business investment, supported by elevated levels of private sector savings, are expected to drive the economic recovery as fiscal and monetary policy support recedes.\n\nRegional differences in the speed of economic recovery in the Central scenario reflect differences over the progression of the pandemic, roll-out of vaccination programmes, national level restrictions imposed and scale of support measures. Global GDP is expected to grow by 4.2% in 2022 in the Central scenario and the average rate of global GDP growth is 3.1% over the five-year\n\nforecast period. This exceeds the average growth rate over the five-year period prior to the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThe key features of our Central scenario are:\n\n- \u00b7 Economic activity in our top eight markets continues to recover. GDP grows at a moderate rate and exceeds prepandemic levels across all our key markets in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Unemployment declines to levels only slightly higher than existed pre-pandemic, with the exception of France where the downward trend in unemployment, related to structural changes to the labour market, resumes.\n- \u00b7 Covid-19-related fiscal spending recedes in 2022 as fewer restrictions on activity allow fiscal support to be withdrawn. Deficits remain high in several countries as they embark on multi-year investment programmes to support recovery, productivity growth and climate transition.\n- \u00b7 Inflation across many of our key markets remains elevated through 2022. Supply-driven price pressures persist through the first half of 2022 before gradually easing. In subsequent years, inflation quickly converges back towards central bank target rates.\n- \u00b7 Policy interest rates in key markets rise gradually over our projection period, in line with economic recovery.\n- \u00b7 The West Texas Intermediate oil price is forecast to average $62 per barrel over the projection period.\n\nIn the longer term, growth reverts back towards similar rates that existed prior to the pandemic, suggesting that the damage to longterm economic prospects is expected to be minimal.\n\nThe Central scenario was first created with forecasts available in November, and subsequently updated in December. Probability weights assigned to the Central scenario vary from 60% to 80% and reflect relative differences in uncertainty across markets.\n\nThe following table describes key macroeconomic variables and the probabilities assigned in the consensus Central scenario.\n\n## Central scenario 2022-2026\n\n|                                  | UK %   | US %   | Hong Kong %   | Mainland China %   | Canada %   | France %   | UAE %   | Mexico %   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|--------------------|------------|------------|---------|------------|\n| GDP growth rate                  |        |        |               |                    |            |            |         |            |\n| 2022: Annual average growth rate | 5.0    | 4.0    | 3.1           | 5.3                | 4.1        | 3.9        | 4.4     | 2.9        |\n| 2023: Annual average growth rate | 2.1    | 2.4    | 2.9           | 5.4                | 2.8        | 2.1        | 3.4     | 2.3        |\n| 2024: Annual average growth rate | 1.9    | 2.1    | 2.6           | 5.1                | 2.0        | 1.6        | 3.0     | 2.2        |\n| 5-year average                   | 2.5    | 2.5    | 2.7           | 5.1                | 2.5        | 2.1        | 3.2     | 2.3        |\n| Unemployment rate                |        |        |               |                    |            |            |         |            |\n| 2022: Annual average rate        | 4.5    | 4.2    | 4.1           | 3.8                | 6.3        | 8.0        | 3.1     | 4.0        |\n| 2023: Annual average rate        | 4.3    | 3.8    | 3.6           | 3.7                | 5.9        | 7.7        | 3.0     | 3.9        |\n| 2024: Annual average rate        | 4.2    | 3.8    | 3.5           | 3.8                | 5.8        | 7.6        | 2.9     | 3.8        |\n| 5-year average                   | 4.3    | 3.8    | 3.6           | 3.8                | 5.9        | 7.7        | 3.0     | 3.8        |\n| House price growth               |        |        |               |                    |            |            |         |            |\n| 2022: Annual average growth rate | 5.5    | 10.3   | 3.4           | 0.3                | 6.4        | 4.9        | 4.9     | 5.8        |\n| 2023: Annual average growth rate | 3.3    | 5.4    | 2.4           | 4.7                | 2.8        | 4.6        | -       | 5.0        |\n| 2024: Annual average growth rate | 3.3    | 3.7    | 2.0           | 4.9                | 2.1        | 4.0        | 2.1     | 4.4        |\n| 5-year average                   | 3.5    | 5.4    | 2.6           | 3.5                | 3.3        | 3.9        | 2.7     | 4.7        |\n| Short-term interest rate         |        |        |               |                    |            |            |         |            |\n| 2022: Annual average rate        | 1.0    | 0.5    | 0.5           | 3.1                | 1.1        | (0.5)      | 1.1     | 7.2        |\n| 2023: Annual average rate        | 1.3    | 1.1    | 1.1           | 3.2                | 2.0        | (0.3)      | 1.7     | 8.1        |\n| 2024: Annual average rate        | 1.2    | 1.5    | 1.6           | 3.4                | 2.2        | (0.1)      | 2.2     | 8.0        |\n| 5-year average                   | 1.2    | 1.3    | 1.4           | 3.4                | 1.9        | (0.2)      | 2.0     | 7.9        |\n| Probability                      | 60     | 75     | 70            | 80                 | 75         | 60         | 70      | 65         |",

Downside scenarios assume that new strains of the virus result in an acceleration in infection rates and increased pressure on public health services, necessitating restrictions on activity. The reimposition of such restrictions could be assumed to have a damaging effect on consumer and business confidence.\n\nGovernment fiscal programmes in advanced economies in 2020 and 2021 were supported by accommodative actions taken by central banks. These measures have provided households and firms with significant support. An inability or unwillingness to\n\ncontinue with such support or the untimely withdrawal of support present a downside risk to growth.\n\nWhile Covid-19 and related risks dominate the economic outlook, geopolitical risks also present a threat. These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 continued differences between the US and other countries with China, which could affect sentiment and restrict global economic activity;\n- \u00b7 the re-emergence of social unrest in Hong Kong; and\n- \u00b7 potential disagreements between the UK and the EU, which may hinder the ability to reach a more comprehensive agreement on trade and services, despite the Trade and Cooperation Agreement averting a disorderly UK departure.\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0",

In this scenario, new Covid-19 variants emerge that cause infections to rise sharply in 2022, resulting in setbacks to vaccination programmes and the rapid imposition of restrictions on mobility\n\nand travel across some countries. The scenario also assumes governments and central banks are unable to significantly increase fiscal and monetary support, which results in abrupt corrections in labour and asset markets.\n\nThe following table describes key macroeconomic variables and the probabilities assigned in the Downside 2 scenario.\n\n## Downside 2 scenario worst outcome\n\n|                          | UK %   | UK %           | US %   | US %          | Hong Kong %   | Hong Kong %    | Mainland China %   | Mainland China %   | Canada %       |\n|--------------------------|--------|----------------|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| GDP growth rate          |        | (4.6)  (4Q22)  |        | (4.6)  (4Q22) |               | (8.2)  (4Q22)  |                    | (4.8)  (4Q22)      | (13.9)  (4Q22) |\n| Unemployment rate        |        | 7.5  (2Q23)    |        | 10.6  (4Q23)  |               | 6.1  (4Q22)    |                    | 5.4  (4Q23)        | 11.5  (2Q23)   |\n| House price growth       |        | (14.2)  (2Q23) |        | (6.2)  (4Q22) |               | (17.7)  (4Q22) |                    | (24.8)  (4Q22)     | (23.8)  (1Q23) |\n| Short-term interest rate |        | 1.6  (2Q22)    |        | 1.3  (2Q22)   |               | 1.3  (2Q22)    |                    | 4.0  (2Q22)        | 0.5  (3Q23)    |\n| Probability              | 15     | 15             | 10     | 10            | 5             | 5              | 5                  | 5                  | 5              |\n\nNote: Extreme point in the Downside 2 is 'worst outcome' in the scenario, for example lowest GDP growth and the highest unemployment rate, in the first two years of the scenario.\n\n## Scenario weighting\n\nIn reviewing the economic conjuncture, the level of uncertainty and risk, management has considered both global and countryspecific factors. This has led management to assign scenario probabilities that are tailored to its view of uncertainty in individual markets.\n\nTo inform its view, management has considered the progression of the virus in individual countries, the speed of vaccine roll-outs, the degree of current and expected future government support and connectivity with other countries. Management has also been guided by the policy response and economic performance through the pandemic, as well as the evidence that economies have adapted as the virus has progressed.\n\nA key consideration in the fourth quarter was the emergence of the new variant, Omicron. The virulence and severity of the new strain, in addition to the continued efficacy of vaccines against it, was unknown when the variant first emerged. Management therefore determined that uncertainty attached to forecasts had increased and sought to reflect this in scenario weightings.\n\nChina's significant capacity to extend policy support to the economy and manage through Covid-19-related disruptions, led management to conclude that the outlook for mainland China was the least uncertain of all our key markets. The Central scenario was given an 80% probability while a total of 15% has been assigned to the two Downside scenarios.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the combination of recurrent outbreaks and the other risks outlined above led management to assign a 25% weight to the two Downside scenarios.\n\nThe UK and France faced the greatest economic uncertainties of our key markets. The emergence of Omicron exacerbated the rise in case rates and hospitalisations in both countries, necessitating the imposition of new restrictions. These increase uncertainties around economic growth and employment. Accordingly, the Central scenario was assigned a 60% weight in both countries. The two Downside scenarios were given a combined probability weighting of 30% for both the UK and France.\n\nFor the US, Canada and Mexico, connectivity across the three North American economies has been considered. For the US and Mexico, management similarly sought to reflect the increase in uncertainty by raising the probability weighting of the Downside 2 scenario. The two Downside scenarios combined have been given weights of between 20% and 30%. For Canada, the probability attached to the Downside 2 scenario was reduced. This follows from an adjustment to the methodology used for this scenario, which increased its overall severity. The change aligned the methodology to the global approach and weighting adjustments reflect the greater implied severity. In the UAE, the impact of the oil price on the economy and the ability of non-oil sectors to contribute to economic recovery have influenced the view of uncertainty. The Central scenario has been assigned between 65% and 75% weight for these four markets and, with risks perceived as being weighted to the downside, the two Downside scenarios have been given weights of between 15% and 30%.",

Despite a general recovery in economic conditions during 2021, the level of estimation uncertainty and judgement has remained high during 2021 as a result of the ongoing economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and other sources of economic instability, including significant judgements relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 the selection and weighting of economic scenarios, given rapidly changing economic conditions in an unprecedented manner, uncertainty as to the effect of government and central bank support measures designed to alleviate adverse economic impacts, and a wider distribution of economic forecasts than before the pandemic. The key judgements are the length of time over which the economic effects of the pandemic will occur, and the speed and shape of recovery. The main factors include the effectiveness of pandemic containment measures, the pace of roll-out and effectiveness of vaccines, and the emergence of new variants of the virus, plus a range of geopolitical uncertainties, which together represent a high degree of estimation uncertainty, particularly in assessing Downside scenarios;\n- \u00b7 estimating the economic effects of those scenarios on ECL, where there is no observable historical trend that can be reflected in the models that will accurately represent the effects of the economic changes of the severity and speed brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and the recovery from those conditions. Modelled assumptions and linkages between economic factors and credit losses may underestimate or overestimate ECL in these conditions, and there is significant uncertainty in the estimation of parameters such as collateral values and loss severity; and\n- \u00b7 the identification of customers experiencing significant increases in credit risk and credit impairment, particularly where those customers have accepted payment deferrals and other reliefs designed to address short-term liquidity issues given muted default experience to date. The use of segmentation techniques for indicators of significant increases in credit risk involves significant estimation uncertainty.\n\n## How economic scenarios are reflected in ECL calculations\n\nModels are used to reflect economic scenarios on ECL estimates. As described above, modelled assumptions and linkages based on historical information could not alone produce relevant information under the conditions experienced in 2021, and management judgemental adjustments were still required to support modelled outcomes.\n\nWe have developed globally consistent methodologies for the application of forward economic guidance into the calculation of ECL for wholesale and retail credit risk. These standard approaches are described below, followed by the management judgemental adjustments made, including those to reflect the circumstances experienced in 2021.\n\nFor our wholesale portfolios, a global methodology is used for the estimation of the term structure of probability of default ('PD') and loss given default ('LGD'). For PDs, we consider the correlation of forward economic guidance to default rates for a particular industry in a country. For LGD calculations, we consider the correlation of forward economic guidance to collateral values and realisation rates for a particular country and industry. PDs and LGDs are estimated for the entire term structure of each instrument.\n\nFor impaired loans, LGD estimates take into account independent recovery valuations provided by external consultants where available or internal forecasts corresponding to anticipated economic conditions and individual company conditions. In estimating the ECL on impaired loans that are individually considered not to be significant, we incorporate forward economic guidance proportionate to the probability-weighted outcome and the Central scenario outcome for non-stage 3 populations.",

        "page_content": "For our retail portfolios, the impact of economic scenarios on PD is modelled at a portfolio level. Historical relationships between observed default rates and macroeconomic variables are integrated into IFRS 9 ECL estimates by using economic response models. The impact of these scenarios on PD is modelled over a period equal to the remaining maturity of the underlying asset or assets. The impact on LGD is modelled for mortgage portfolios by forecasting future loan-to-value ('LTV') profiles for the remaining maturity of the asset by using national level forecasts of the house price index and applying the corresponding LGD expectation.\n\nThese models are based largely on historical observations and correlations with default rates. Management judgemental adjustments are described below.\n\n## Management judgemental adjustments\n\nIn the context of IFRS 9, management judgemental adjustments are short-term increases or decreases to the ECL at either a customer, segment or portfolio level to account for late-breaking events, model and data limitations and deficiencies, and expert credit judgement applied following management review and challenge.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, management judgements were applied to reflect credit risk dynamics not captured by our models. The drivers of the management judgemental adjustments reflect the changing economic outlook and evolving risks across our geographies.\n\nWhere the macroeconomic and portfolio risk outlook continues to improve, supported by low levels of observed defaults, adjustments initially taken to reflect increased risk expectations have been retired or reduced.\n\nHowever, other adjustments have increased where modelled outcomes are overly sensitive and not aligned to observed changes in the risk of the underlying portfolios during the pandemic, or where sector-specific risks are not adequately captured.\n\nThe effects of management judgemental adjustments are considered for balances and ECL when determining whether or not a significant increase in credit risk has occurred and are attributed or allocated to a stage as appropriate. This is in accordance with the internal adjustments framework.\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments are reviewed under the governance process for IFRS 9 (as detailed in the section 'Credit risk management' on page 137). Review and challenge focuses on the rationale and quantum of the adjustments with a further review carried out by the second line of defence where significant. For some management judgemental adjustments, internal frameworks establish the conditions under which these adjustments should no longer be required and as such are considered as part of the governance process. This internal governance process allows management judgemental adjustments to be reviewed regularly and, where possible, to reduce the reliance on these through model recalibration or redevelopment, as appropriate.\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments made in estimating the scenario-weighted reported ECL at 31 December 2021 are set out in the following table. The table includes adjustments in relation to data and model limitations, including those driven by late-breaking events and sector-specific risks and as a result of the regular process of model development and implementation.\n\n## Management judgemental adjustments to ECL at 31 December 2021 1\n\n|                                                                       | Retail $bn   | Wholesale $bn   | Total $bn   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Low-risk counterparties  (banks, sovereigns and  government entities) |              | (0.1)           | (0.1)       |\n| Corporate lending  adjustments                                        |              | 1.3             | 1.3         |\n| Retail lending probability  of default adjustments                    |              |                 | -           |\n| Retail model default  timing adjustments                              |              |                 | -           |\n| Macroeconomic-related  adjustments                                    |              |                 | -           |\n| Pandemic-related  economic recovery  adjustments                      | 0.2          |                 | 0.2         |\n| Other retail lending  adjustments                                     | 0.3          |                 | 0.3         |\n| Total                                                                 | 0.5          | 1.2             | 1.7         |\n\n.\n\n## Management judgemental adjustments to ECL at 31 December 2020 1\n\n|                            | Retail $bn   | Wholesale $bn   | Total $bn   |\n|----------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Low-risk counterparties    |              |                 |             |\n| (banks, sovereigns and     |              |                 |             |\n| government entities)       |              | (0.7)           | (0.7)       |\n| Corporate lending          |              |                 |             |\n| adjustments                |              | 0.5             | 0.5         |\n| Retail lending probability |              |                 |             |\n| of default adjustments     | (0.8)        |                 | (0.8)       |\n| Retail model default       |              |                 |             |\n| timing adjustment          | 1.9          |                 | 1.9         |\n| Macroeconomic-related      |              |                 |             |\n| adjustments                | 0.1          |                 | 0.1         |\n| economic recovery          |              |                 |             |\n| adjustments                |              |                 | -           |\n| Other retail lending       |              |                 |             |\n| adjustments                | 0.3          |                 | 0.3         |\n| Total                      | 1.5          | (0.2)           | 1.3         |\n\nManagement judgemental adjustments at 31 December 2021 were an increase to ECL of $1.2bn for the wholesale portfolio and an increase to ECL of $0.5bn for the retail portfolio.\n\nDuring 2021, management judgemental adjustments reflected an evolving macroeconomic outlook and the relationship of the modelled ECL to this outlook and to late-breaking and sectorspecific risks.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, wholesale management judgemental adjustments were an ECL increase of $1.2bn (31 December 2020: $0.2bn decrease).\n\n- \u00b7 Adjustments relating to low credit-risk exposures decreased ECL by $0.1bn at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: $0.7bn decrease). These were mainly to highly rated banks, sovereigns and US government-sponsored entities, where modelled credit factors did not fully reflect the underlying fundamentals of these entities or the effect of government support and economic programmes in the Covid-19 environment. The decrease in adjustment impact relative to 31 December 2020 was mostly driven by increased alignment of modelled outcomes to management expectations following changes in systems and data.\n- \u00b7 Adjustments to corporate exposures increased ECL by $1.3bn at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: $0.5bn increase).

The increase in adjustment impact relative to 31 December 2020 was mostly driven by management judgements as a result of the effect of further improvement of macroeconomic scenarios on modelled outcomes and increased dislocation of modelled outcomes to management expectations for high-risk sectors and due to latebreaking events not fully reflected in the underlying data. The highest increase was observed in the real estate sector, including an adjustment to reflect the uncertainty of the higher risk Chinese commercial real estate offshore exposures, booked in Hong Kong, on account of tightening liquidity and increased refinancing risks resulting in the downgrade of even some previously highly rated borrowers.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, retail management judgemental adjustments were an ECL increase of $0.5bn (31 December 2020: $1.5bn increase).\n\n- \u00b7 Pandemic-related economic recovery adjustments increased ECL by $0.2bn (31 December 2020: $0) to adjust for the effects of the volatile pace of recovery from the pandemic. This is where in management's judgement, supported by quantitative analyses of portfolio and economic metrics, modelled outcomes are overly sensitive given the limited observed deterioration in the underlying portfolio during the pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Other retail lending adjustments increased ECL by $0.3bn (31 December 2020: $0.3bn increase). These were primarily to address areas such as model recalibration and redevelopment, customer relief and data limitations.\n\n## Economic scenarios sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates\n\nManagement considered the sensitivity of the ECL outcome against the economic forecasts as part of the ECL governance process by recalculating the ECL under each scenario described above for selected portfolios, applying a 100% weighting to each scenario in turn.

The impact of defaults that might occur in the future under different economic scenarios is captured by recalculating ECL for loans at the balance sheet date.\n\nThere is a particularly high degree of estimation uncertainty in numbers representing more severe risk scenarios when assigned a 100% weighting.\n\nFor wholesale credit risk exposures, the sensitivity analysis excludes ECL and financial instruments related to defaulted (stage 3) obligors. It is generally impracticable to separate the effect of macroeconomic factors in individual assessments of obligors in default. The measurement of stage 3 ECL is relatively more sensitive to credit factors specific to the obligor than future economic scenarios, and loans to defaulted obligors are a small portion of the overall wholesale lending exposure, even if representing the majority of the allowance for ECL. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis to macroeconomic scenarios does not capture the residual estimation risk arising from wholesale stage 3 exposures.\n\nFor retail credit risk exposures, the sensitivity analysis includes ECL for loans and advances to customers related to defaulted obligors. This is because the retail ECL for secured mortgage portfolios including loans in all stages is sensitive to macroeconomic variables.\n\n## Wholesale and retail sensitivity\n\nThe wholesale and retail sensitivity analysis is stated inclusive of management judgemental adjustments, as appropriate to each scenario. The results tables exclude portfolios held by the insurance business and small portfolios, and as such cannot be directly compared to personal and wholesale lending presented in other credit risk tables. Additionally, in both the wholesale and retail analysis, the comparative period results for Downside 2 scenarios are also not directly comparable with the current period, because they reflect different risk profiles relative to the consensus scenarios for the period end.",

        "page_content": "At 31 December 2021, the most significant level of ECL sensitivity was observed in the UK, Mexico and Hong Kong. Mortgages reflected the lowest level of ECL sensitivity across most markets as collateral values remained resilient. Hong Kong mortgages had low levels of reported ECL due to the credit quality of the portfolio, and so presented sensitivity was negligible. Credit cards and other unsecured lending are more sensitive to economic forecasts, which improved during 2021.\n\n## Group ECL sensitivity results\n\nThe ECL impact of the scenarios and management judgemental adjustments are highly sensitive to movements in economic forecasts. Based upon the sensitivity tables presented above, if the Group ECL balance was estimated solely on the basis of the Central scenario, Downside scenario or the Downside 2 scenario at 31 December 2021, it would increase/(decrease) as presented in the below table.\n\n| Total Group ECL at 31 December 2021   | Retail 1 $bn   | Wholesale 1 $bn   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Reported ECL                          | 3.0            | 3.1               |\n| Scenarios                             |                |                   |\n| 100% Consensus Central scenario       | (0.2)          | (0.6)             |\n| 100% Consensus Upside scenario        | (0.5)          | (1.2)             |\n| 100% Consensus Downside scenario      | 0.2            | 0.6               |\n| 100% Downside 2 scenario              | 2.0            | 5.5               |\n\n| Total Group ECL at 31 December 2020   | Retail 1 $bn   | Wholesale $bn   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Reported ECL                          | 4.5            | 4.5             |\n| Scenarios                             |                |                 |\n| 100% Consensus Central scenario       | (0.3)          | (0.9)           |\n| 100% Consensus Upside scenario        | (1.0)          | (2.0)           |\n| 100% Consensus Downside scenario      | 0.3            | 1.0             |\n| 100% Downside 2 scenario              | 1.3            | 5.9             |\n\nFor both retail and wholesale portfolios, the reported ECL decreased since 31 December 2020. The relative sensitivity of the Group total consensus Central scenario remained relatively stable, while the Group total consensus Upside and consensus Downside sensitivities both reduced since 31 December 2020. The Group total Downside 2 scenario continues to present the highest level of sensitivity. The Group results are reflective of the improvement in economic expectations, inclusive of the continuing pandemicrelated and sector-specific uncertainty.\n\n## Reconciliation of changes in gross carrying/ nominal amount and allowances for loans and advances to banks and customers including loan commitments and financial guarantees\n\nThe following disclosure provides a reconciliation by stage of the Group's gross carrying/nominal amount and allowances for loans and advances to banks and customers, including loan commitments and financial guarantees. Movements are calculated on a quarterly basis and therefore fully capture stage movements between quarters. If movements were calculated on a year-to-date basis they would only reflect the opening and closing position of the financial instrument.\n\nThe transfers of financial instruments represents the impact of stage transfers upon the gross carrying/nominal amount and associated allowance for ECL.\n\nThe net remeasurement of ECL arising from stage transfers represents the increase or decrease due to these transfers, for example, moving from a 12-month (stage 1) to a lifetime (stage 2) ECL measurement basis. Net remeasurement excludes the underlying customer risk rating ('CRR')/probability of default ('PD') movements of the financial instruments transferring stage. This is captured, along with other credit quality movements in the 'changes in risk parameters - credit quality' line item.\n\nChanges in 'New financial assets originated or purchased', 'assets derecognised (including final repayments)' and 'changes to risk parameters - further lending/repayment' represent the impact from volume movements within the Group's lending portfolio.",

This was partly offset by $2,227m relating to underlying credit quality changes, including the credit quality impact of financial instruments transferring between stages and $49m in changes to models used for ECL calculation.\n\nSummary views of the movement in wholesale and personal lending are presented on pages 165 and 179.",

The credit quality of financial instruments is a point-in-time assessment of PD, whereas stages 1 and 2 are determined based on relative deterioration of credit quality since initial recognition. Accordingly, for non-credit-impaired financial\n\ninstruments, there is no direct relationship between the credit quality assessment and stages 1 and 2, although typically the lower credit quality bands exhibit a higher proportion in stage 2.\n\nThe five credit quality classifications each encompass a range of granular internal credit rating grades assigned to wholesale and personal lending businesses and the external ratings attributed by external agencies to debt securities, as shown in the table on page 138.\n\n## Distribution of financial instruments by credit quality at 31 December 2021\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                                                                              | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount   | Gross carrying/notional amount                  |           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n|                                                                                                              | Strong $m                        | Good $m                          | Satisfactory $m                  | Sub-standard $m                  | Credit  impaired $m              | Total $m                         | Allowance for  ECL/other  credit  provisions $m | Net $m    |\n| In-scope for IFRS 9                                                                                          |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                                 |           |\n| Loans and advances to customers  held at amortised cost                                                      | 544,695                          | 230,326                          | 233,739                          | 29,404                           | 19,067                           | 1,057,231                        | (11,417)                                        | 1,045,814 |\n| -

As such, the gross carrying value of debt instruments at FVOCI as presented above will not reconcile to the balance sheet as it excludes fair value gains and losses.\n\n## Credit-impaired loans\n\n## (Audited)\n\nWe determine that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily whether:\n\n- \u00b7 contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days;\n- \u00b7 there are other indications that the borrower is unlikely to pay, such as when a concession has been granted to the borrower for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial condition; and\n- \u00b7 the loan is otherwise considered to be in default. If such unlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is deemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due, even where regulatory rules permit default to be defined based on 180 days past due. Therefore, the definitions of credit impaired and default are aligned as far as possible so that stage 3 represents all loans that are considered defaulted or otherwise credit impaired.\n\n## Renegotiated loans and forbearance\n\nThe following table shows the gross carrying amounts of the Group's holdings of renegotiated loans and advances to customers by industry sector and by stages. Mandatory and general offer loan modifications that are not borrower-specific, for example market-wide customer relief programmes, have not been classified as renegotiated loans. For details on customer relief schemes, see page 159.\n\nA summary of our current policies and practices for renegotiated loans and forbearance is set out in 'Credit risk management' on page 137.",

The following table presents the number of personal accounts/wholesale customers and the associated drawn loan values of customers under these schemes and HSBC-specific measures for major markets at 31 December 2021. When schemes expire, accounts and customers and their associated drawn balances are no longer reported under relief regardless of their repayment status. In relation to personal lending, the majority of relief measures, including payment holidays, relate to existing lending, while in wholesale lending the relief measures comprise payment holidays, refinancing of existing facilities and new lending under government-backed schemes.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the gross carrying value of loans to personal customers under relief was $1.7bn (31 December 2020: $5.5bn). This comprised $1.0bn in relation to mortgages (31 December 2020: $4.7bn) and $0.7bn in relation to other personal lending (31 December 2020: $0.9bn). The decrease in personal customer relief during the year was driven by customers exiting relief measures. The gross carrying value of loans to wholesale customers under relief was $26.3bn (31 December 2020: $35.3bn). We continue to monitor the recoverability of loans granted under customer relief programmes, including loans to a small number of customers that were subsequently found to be ineligible for such relief. The ongoing performance of such loans remains an area of uncertainty at 31 December 2021.",

As a result of further loosening of eligibility criteria and scope of relief measures, the country is now the major contributor to the figures reported under 'Other major markets'. At 31 December 2021, the number of accounts under relief was 39,000 (31 December 2020: 26,000) with an associated drawn balance of $1,151m (31 December 2020: $452m).\n- 3  In Mexico, at 31 December 2020, there were 16,000 personal lending accounts under customer relief with an associated drawn balance of $233m.\n\nThe initial granting of customer relief does not automatically trigger a migration to stage 2 or 3. However, information provided by payment deferrals is considered in the context of other reasonable and supportable information. This forms part of the overall assessment for whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk and credit impairment to identify loans for which lifetime ECL is appropriate. An extension in payment deferral does not automatically result in a migration to stage 2 or stage 3. The key accounting and credit risk judgement to ascertain whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred is whether the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the customer are likely to be temporary over the lifetime of the loan, and whether they indicate that a concession is being made in respect of financial difficulty that would be consistent with stage 3.\n\n## Market-wide schemes\n\nThe following narrative provides further details on the major government and regulatory schemes offered in the UK, Hong Kong and the US.\n\n## UK personal lending\n\n## Mortgages\n\nCustomer relief granted on UK mortgages primarily consisted of payment holidays or partial payment deferrals.\n\nRelief was offered for an initial period of three months and could be extended for a further three months in certain circumstances. No payment was required from the customer during this period (though with a partial payment deferral the customer had expressed a desire to make a contribution) and interest continued to be charged as usual. The customer's arrears status was not worsened from utilisation of these schemes. All UK personal lending schemes expired during 2021.\n\n## Other personal lending payment holidays\n\nCustomer relief was granted for an initial period of three months and could be extended for a further three months. The maximum relief value was up to the due payment amount during the period. All UK personal lending schemes expired during 2021.\n\n## UK wholesale lending\n\nThe primary relief granted under government schemes consisted of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. Since their initial launch, the application deadline for these schemes was extended to 31 March 2021. The key features of these schemes were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The Bounce Back Loan Scheme provided small and mediumsized enterprises ('SME') with loans of up to \u00a350,000 for a\n\nmaximum period of six years. Interest was charged at 2.5% and the government paid the fees and interest for the first 12 months. No capital repayment was required by the customer for the first 12 months of the scheme. A government guarantee of 100% was provided under the scheme. Before their first payment was due customers could extend the term of the loan to 10 years, move to interest-only repayments for a period of six months (customers could use this option up to three times) and/or pause repayments for a period of six months (customers could use this option once).\n\n- \u00b7 The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme provided SMEs that had a turnover of less than \u00a345m with loans of up to \u00a35m for a maximum period of six years. Interest was charged between 3.49% and 3.99% above the UK base rate and no capital repayment was required by the customer for the first 12 months of the scheme. A government guarantee of up to 80% was provided under the scheme.\n- \u00b7 The Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme provided medium and large-sized enterprises that had a turnover in excess of \u00a345m with loans of up to \u00a3200m. The interest rate and tenor of the loan were negotiated on commercial terms. A government guarantee of 80% was provided under the scheme.\n\nUntil 31 December 2021, the Recovery Loan Scheme, launched on 6 April 2021, provided businesses of any size financial support to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic with loans of \u00a325,001 to \u00a310m subject to eligibility and viability assessments. A government guarantee of 80% was provided under the scheme.\n\nFor term loans and asset finance, businesses could borrow for three months up to six years and for overdrafts and invoice finance, three months up to three years. The scheme was extended until 30 June 2022, with the following changes coming into force from 1 January 2022: the scheme remains open to small and medium-sized enterprises and the maximum amount of finance available is \u00a32m per business. A government guarantee of 70% is provided on such loans.\n\n## Hong Kong wholesale lending\n\n## Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme for Corporate Customers\n\nThe above scheme enabled eligible customers to apply for a payment holiday of six months (or 90 days for trade finance) with no change to the existing interest rate charge. On 2 September 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ('HKMA') announced that this scheme had been extended for a further six months to April 2021 and on 4 March 2021, it was extended for a further six months (or 90 days for trade finance) to October 2021.",

        "page_content": "Given the persistence of the Covid-19 pandemic around the world and the severity of the ensuing impact on the global and local economy, HKMA - together with the Banking Sector SME Lending Coordination Mechanism - announced on 21 September 2021 that the Pre-approved Principal Payment Holiday Scheme would be extended for another six months until April 2022. HKMA and the coordination mechanism agreed that all principal payments of loans falling due between November 2021 and April 2022 by eligible corporate customers would be deferred by another six months except for repayments of trade loans, which would be deferred by 90 days.\n\n## US wholesale lending\n\n## Paycheck Protection Program\n\nThe CARES Act created the Paycheck Protection Program ('PPP') loan guarantee programme to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made under the PPP were fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, whose guarantee was backed by the full faith and credit of the US. PPP-covered loans also afforded customers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP-covered loan, plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds were used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria were satisfied. The Small Business Administration would reimburse PPP lenders for any amount of a PPP-covered loan that was forgiven, and PPP lenders would not be liable for any representations made by PPP borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness. Lenders received pre-determined fees for processing and servicing PPP loans. The schemes have now been closed.\n\n## HSBC-specific measures\n\n## UK wholesale lending\n\nHSBC offered capital repayment holidays to CMB customers. Relief was offered on a preferred term of six months. However, some were granted for three months with the option of an extension. Interest continued to be paid as usual. Schemes have now been closed for application.\n\n## Hong Kong personal lending\n\n## Mortgages\n\nCustomer relief granted on Hong Kong mortgages consisted of deferred principal repayment of up to 12 months. This relief programme was available to existing HSBC mortgage loan customers who had a good repayment record during the six months prior to application. Schemes have now been closed for application.\n\n## Hong Kong wholesale lending\n\nOn 20 May 2021, the Group announced a new SME financing scheme in Hong Kong, with HK$40bn reserved to support SME customers as the economy started to recover. The scheme has now been closed for application.\n\n## US total personal lending\n\nCustomer relief granted on US mortgages and other personal lending consisted of deferrals of up to 12 months and up to nine months respectively. Schemes have now been closed for application.\n\n## Wholesale lending\n\nThis section provides further details on the regions, countries, territories and products comprising wholesale loans and advances to customers and banks. Product granularity is also provided by stage with geographical data presented for loans and advances to customers, banks, other credit commitments, financial guarantees and similar contracts. Additionally, this section provides a reconciliation of the opening 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 closing gross carrying/nominal amounts and the associated allowance for ECL.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, wholesale lending for loans and advances to banks and customers of $662bn decreased by $11.3bn since 31 December 2020. This included adverse foreign exchange movements of $10.6bn. Excluding foreign exchange movements, the total wholesale lending decrease was driven by a $5.2bn decline in corporate and commercial balances. This was partly offset by a $3bn increase in loans and advances to banks and a $1.5bn increase in balances from non-bank financial institutions.\n\nThe primary driver of the decline in corporate and commercial balances was $11.2bn in Europe, notably $12.4bn in the UK and $1bn in Germany, partly offset by growth of $4.6bn in France.\n\nIn MENA and North America, balances declined $1.4bn and $0.9bn respectively, while they grew in Asia by $8.0bn, notably $4.3bn in mainland China, $1.6bn in Hong Kong and $1.1bn in India.\n\nLoan commitments and financial guarantees declined $26.5bn since 31 December 2020 to $415bn at 31 December 2021, including a $19.3bn decrease related to unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. This also included adverse foreign exchange movements of $12.7bn.\n\nThe allowance for ECL attributable to wholesale loans and advances to banks and customers decreased $1.5bn to $8.3bn at 31 December 2021 from $9.8bn at 31 December 2020. This included favourable foreign exchange movements of $0.2bn.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, the total decrease in the wholesale ECL allowance for loans and advances to customers and banks was driven by a $1.1bn decline in corporate and commercial allowances. The primary driver of this decrease in corporate and commercial allowance for ECL was $1.1bn in Europe, notably $1.1bn in the UK. Additionally, there were decreases of $0.2bn, $0.2bn and $0.1bn in MENA, North America and Latin America, respectively. There was an increase of $0.6bn in Asia, notably $0.4bn in Hong Kong.\n\nThe allowance for ECL attributable to loan commitments and financial guarantees of $0.4bn at 31 December 2021 decreased from $0.8bn at 31 December 2020.",

This was partly offset by $760m relating to underlying credit quality changes, including the credit quality impact of financial instruments transferring between stages and $48m in changes to models used for ECL calculation.\n\nThe net transfer of gross carrying/nominal amounts to stage 1 of $19,285m reflects the overall improvement in the economic outlook as the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak subsided. It was primarily driven by $14,393m in Europe, $8,871m in North America, $3,674m in Middle East and North Africa, and was partly offset by a net transfer out of stage 1 of $8,285m in Asia mainly driven by an increase in Downside scenario weighting for China, reflecting management's concern for potential deterioration on forward looking credit quality.",

The portfolio is globally diversified with larger concentrations in Hong Kong, the UK and the US.\n\nOur global exposure is centred largely on cities with economic, political or cultural significance. In more developed markets, our exposure mainly comprises the financing of investment assets, the redevelopment of existing stock and the augmentation of both\n\ncommercial and residential markets to support economic and population growth. In less developed commercial real estate markets, our exposures comprise lending for development assets on relatively short tenors with a particular focus on supporting larger, better capitalised developers involved in residential construction or assets supporting economic expansion.\n\nCommercial real estate lending declined $7.5bn, including adverse foreign exchange movements of $1.2bn, mainly in the UK and, to a lesser extent, within the US.\n\n## Commercial real estate lending\n\n|                                 |        |        |       |                |                |         | Of which:   | Of which:   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                 | Europe | Asia   | MENA  | North  America | Latin  America | Total   | UK          | Hong Kong   |\n|                                 | $m     | $m     | $m    | $m             | $m             | $m      | $m          | $m          |\n| Gross loans and advances        |        |        |       |                |                |         |             |             |\n| Stage 1                         | 20,317 | 56,734 | 781   | 8,328          | 1,073          | 87,233  | 14,235      | 42,951      |\n| Stage 2                         | 3,505  | 17,103 | 569   | 1,265          | 218            | 22,660  | 2,781       | 13,300      |\n| Stage 3                         | 1,062  | 543    | 206   | 9              | 249            | 2,069   | 905         | 435         |\n| POCI                            | -      | 98     | -     | -              | -              | 98      | -           | 98          |\n| At 31 Dec 2021                  | 24,884 | 74,478 | 1,556 | 9,602          | 1,540          | 112,060 | 17,921      | 56,784      |\n| -  of which: renegotiated loans | 440    | 251    | 145   | -              | -              | 836     | 436         | 170         |\n| Allowance for ECL               | (450)  | (693)  | (158) | (26)           | (130)          | (1,457) | (366)       | (604)       |\n| Gross loans and advances        |        |        |       |                |                |         |             |             |\n| Stage 1                         | 22,639 | 63,276 | 1,147 | 7,373          | 1,269          | 95,704  | 16,207      | 48,735      |\n| Stage 2                         | 5,549  | 11,686 | 436   | 4,093          | 381            | 22,145  | 4,299       | 9,105       |\n| Stage 3                         | 1,114  | 37     | 250   | 42             | 240            | 1,683   | 966         | 18          |\n| POCI                            | 1      | -      | -     | -              | -              | 1       | -           | -           |\n| At 31 Dec 2020                  | 29,303 | 74,999 | 1,833 | 11,508         | 1,890          | 119,533 | 21,472      | 57,858      |\n| -  of which: renegotiated loans | 751    | 3      | 201   | -              | -              | 955     | 744         | -           |\n| Allowance for ECL               | (650)  | (117)  | (190) | (64)           | (120)          | (1,141) | (575)       | (65)        |\n\n## Refinance risk in commercial real estate\n\nCommercial real estate lending tends to require the repayment of a significant proportion of the principal at maturity. Typically, a customer will arrange repayment through the acquisition of a new loan to settle the existing debt. Refinance risk is the risk that a\n\ncustomer, being unable to repay the debt on maturity, fails to refinance it at commercial rates. We monitor our commercial real estate portfolio closely, assessing indicators for signs of potential issues with refinancing.\n\n## Commercial real estate gross loans and advances maturity analysis\n\n|                                    |        |        |       |                |                |         | Of which:   | Of which:   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|----------------|----------------|---------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                    | Europe | Asia   | MENA  | North  America | Latin  America | Total   | UK          | Hong Kong   |\n|                                    | $m     | $m     | $m    | $m             | $m             | $m      | $m          | $m          |\n| On demand, overdrafts or revolving |        |        |       |                |                |         |             |             |\n| < 1 year                           | 12,980 | 26,736 | 478   | 5,961          | 336            | 46,491  | 10,546      | 20,466      |\n| 1-2 years                          | 4,794  | 18,192 | 159   | 1,098          | 280            | 24,523  | 3,921       | 14,399      |\n| 2-5 years                          | 5,352  | 26,668 | 631   | 2,297          | 559            | 35,507  | 2,805       | 19,562      |\n| > 5 years                          | 1,758  | 2,882  | 288   | 246            | 365            | 5,539   | 649         | 2,357       |\n| At 31 Dec 2021                     | 24,884 | 74,478 | 1,556 | 9,602          | 1,540          | 112,060 | 17,921      | 56,784      |\n| On demand, overdrafts or revolving |        |        |       |                |                |         |             |             |\n| < 1 year                           | 13,728 | 25,075 | 750   | 5,793          | 263            | 45,609  | 12,131      | 19,998      |\n| 1-2 years                          | 6,373  | 18,396 | 119   | 3,112          | 434            | 28,434  | 4,991       | 13,237      |\n| 2-5 years                          | 6,241  | 27,699 | 668   | 2,288          | 927            | 37,823  | 3,135       | 21,694      |\n| > 5 years                          | 2,961  | 3,829  | 296   | 315            | 266            | 7,667   | 1,215       | 2,929       |\n| At 31 Dec 2020                     | 29,303 | 74,999 | 1,833 | 11,508         | 1,890          | 119,533 | 21,472      | 57,858      |",

The Group's exposures related to companies whose primary activities are focused on residential, commercial and mixed-use real estate activities.  Lending is generally focused on tier 1 and 2 cities.\n\nBooked in Hong Kong are higher risk exposures to a combination of state and privately owned enterprises. This portfolio had 89% of exposure booked with a credit quality of 'satisfactory' or above, but had a higher degree of uncertainty due to tightening liquidity and increased refinancing risks. In addition, offshore exposures are typically higher risk than onshore exposures. At 31 December 2021, the Group had allowances for ECL of $560m held against mainland China commercial real estate exposures booked in Hong Kong. We will continue to monitor the prevailing situation closely.\n\n## Collateral and other credit enhancements\n\n## (Audited)\n\nAlthough collateral can be an important mitigant of credit risk, it is the Group's practice to lend on the basis of the customer's ability to meet their obligations out of cash flow resources rather than placing primary reliance on collateral and other credit risk enhancements. Depending on the customer's standing and the type of product, facilities may be provided without any collateral or other credit enhancements. For other lending, a charge over collateral is obtained and considered in determining the credit decision and pricing. In the event of default, the Group may utilise the collateral as a source of repayment.\n\nDepending on its form, collateral can have a significant financial effect in mitigating our exposure to credit risk. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is the case for reverse repurchase agreements and for certain loans and advances to customers where the loan to value ('LTV') is very low.\n\nMitigants may include a charge on borrowers' specific assets, such as real estate or financial instruments. Other credit risk mitigants include short positions in securities and financial assets held as part of linked insurance/investment contracts where the risk is predominantly borne by the policyholder. Additionally, risk may be managed by employing other types of collateral and credit risk enhancements, such as second charges, other liens and unsupported guarantees. Guarantees are normally taken from corporates and export credit agencies. Corporates would normally provide guarantees as part of a parent/subsidiary relationship and span a number of credit grades. The export credit agencies will normally be investment grade.\n\nCertain credit mitigants are used strategically in portfolio management activities. While single name concentrations arise in\n\nportfolios managed by Global Banking and Corporate Banking, it is only in Global Banking that their size requires the use of portfolio level credit mitigants. Across Global Banking, risk limits and utilisations, maturity profiles and risk quality are monitored and managed proactively. This process is key to the setting of risk appetite for these larger, more complex, geographically distributed customer groups. While the principal form of risk management continues to be at the point of exposure origination, through the lending decision-making process, Global Banking also utilises loan sales and credit default swap ('CDS') hedges to manage concentrations and reduce risk. These transactions are the responsibility of a dedicated Global Banking portfolio management team. Hedging activity is carried out within agreed credit parameters, and is subject to market risk limits and a robust governance structure. Where applicable, CDSs are entered into directly with a central clearing house counterparty. Otherwise, the Group's exposure to CDS protection providers is diversified among mainly banking counterparties with strong credit ratings.\n\nCDS mitigants are held at portfolio level and are not included in the expected credit loss calculations. CDS mitigants are not reported in the following tables.\n\n## Collateral on loans and advances\n\nCollateral held is analysed separately for commercial real estate and for other corporate, commercial and financial (non-bank) lending. The following tables include off-balance sheet loan commitments, primarily undrawn credit lines.\n\nThe collateral measured in the following tables consists of fixed first charges on real estate, and charges over cash and marketable financial instruments. The values in the tables represent the expected market value on an open market basis. No adjustment has been made to the collateral for any expected costs of recovery. Marketable securities are measured at their fair value.\n\nOther types of collateral such as unsupported guarantees and floating charges over the assets of a customer's business are not measured in the following tables. While such mitigants have value, often providing rights in insolvency, their assignable value is not sufficiently certain and they are therefore assigned no value for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe LTV ratios presented are calculated by directly associating loans and advances with the collateral that individually and uniquely supports each facility. When collateral assets are shared by multiple loans and advances, whether specifically or, more generally, by way of an all monies charge, the collateral value is pro-rated across the loans and advances protected by the collateral.\n\nFor credit-impaired loans, the collateral values cannot be directly compared with impairment allowances recognised.

Impairment allowances are calculated on a different basis, by considering other cash flows and adjusting collateral values for costs of realising collateral as explained further on page 324.\n\n## Commercial real estate loans and advances\n\nThe value of commercial real estate collateral is determined by using a combination of external and internal valuations and physical inspections. For commercial real estate, where the\n\nfacility exceeds regulatory threshold requirements, Group policy requires an independent review of the valuation at least every three years, or more frequently as the need arises.\n\nIn Hong Kong, market practice is typically for lending to major property companies to be either secured by guarantees or unsecured. In Europe, facilities of a working capital nature are generally not secured by a first fixed charge, and are therefore disclosed as not collateralised.\n\n## Wholesale lending - commercial real estate loans and advances including loan commitments by level of collateral for key countries/territories (by stage)\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                               |                                |               | Of which:                      | Of which:     | Of which:                      | Of which:     |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------|\n|                               | Total                          | Total         | UK                             | UK            | Hong Kong                      | Hong Kong     |\n|                               | Gross carrying/ nominal amount | ECL  coverage | Gross carrying/ nominal amount | ECL  coverage | Gross carrying/ nominal amount | ECL  coverage |\n|                               | $m                             | %             | $m                             | %             | $m                             | %             |\n| Stage 1                       |                                |               |                                |               |                                |               |\n| Not collateralised            | 50,603                         | 0.1           | 7,623                          | 0.4           | 23,864                         | -

For financing activities in other corporate and commercial lending, collateral value is not strongly correlated to principal repayment performance.\n\nCollateral values are generally refreshed when an obligor's general credit performance deteriorates and we have to assess the likely performance of secondary sources of repayment should it prove necessary to rely on them.\n\nAccordingly, the following table reports values only for customers with CRR 8-10, recognising that these loans and advances generally have valuations that are comparatively recent.\n\nWholesale lending -

These are summarised below:\n\n- \u00b7 Some securities issued by governments, banks and other financial institutions benefit from additional credit enhancements provided by government guarantees that cover the assets.\n- \u00b7 Debt securities issued by banks and financial institutions include asset-backed securities ('ABSs') and similar instruments, which are supported by underlying pools of financial assets. Credit risk associated with ABSs is reduced through the purchase of credit default swap ('CDS') protection.\n- \u00b7 Trading loans and advances mainly pledged against cash collateral are posted to satisfy margin requirements. There is limited credit risk on cash collateral posted since in the event of\n\ndefault of the counterparty this would be set off against the related liability. Reverse repos and stock borrowing are by their nature collateralised.\n\nCollateral accepted as security that the Group is permitted to sell or repledge under these arrangements is described on page 358 of the financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk includes financial guarantees and similar contracts granted, as well as loan and other credit-related commitments. Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may use additional credit mitigation if a guarantee is called upon or a loan commitment is drawn and subsequently defaults.\n\nFor further information on these arrangements, see Note 32 on the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Derivatives\n\nWe participate in transactions exposing us to counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk is the risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a transaction defaults before satisfactorily settling it. It arises principally from over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives and securities financing transactions and is calculated in both the trading and non-trading books. Transactions vary in value by reference to a market factor such as an interest rate, exchange rate or asset price.\n\nThe counterparty risk from derivative transactions is taken into account when reporting the fair value of derivative positions. The adjustment to the fair value is known as the credit valuation adjustment ('CVA').\n\nFor an analysis of CVAs, see Note 12 on the financial statements.\n\nThe following table reflects by risk type the fair values and gross notional contract amounts of derivatives cleared through an exchange, central counterparty or non-central counterparty.\n\nNotional contract amounts and fair values of derivatives\n\n|                                                                | 2021       | 2021       | 2021        | 2020       | 2020       | 2020        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n|                                                                | Notional   | Fair value | Fair value  | Notional   | Fair value | Fair value  |\n|                                                                | amount     | Assets     | Liabilities | amount     | Assets     | Liabilities |\n|                                                                | $m         | $m         | $m          | $m         | $m         | $m          |\n| Total OTC derivatives                                          | 21,964,665 | 246,108    | 241,136     | 22,749,280 | 372,373    | 368,010     |\n| -  total OTC derivatives cleared by central counterparties     | 10,086,344 | 59,147     | 60,686      | 9,898,260  | 74,054     | 75,253      |\n| -  total OTC derivatives not cleared by central counterparties | 11,878,321 | 186,961    | 180,450     | 12,851,020 | 298,319    | 292,757     |\n| Total exchange traded derivatives                              | 1,359,692  | 4,152      | 3,306       | 1,332,438  | 4,456      | 4,094       |\n| Gross                                                          | 23,324,357 | 250,260    | 244,442     | 24,081,718 | 376,829    | 372,104     |\n| Offset                                                         |            | (53,378)   | (53,378)    |            | (69,103)   | (69,103)    |\n| At 31 Dec                                                      |            | 196,882    | 191,064     |            | 307,726    | 303,001     |\n\nThe purposes for which HSBC uses derivatives are described in Note 15 on the financial statements.\n\nThe International Swaps and Derivatives Association ('ISDA') master agreement is our preferred agreement for documenting derivatives activity. It is common, and our preferred practice, for the parties involved in a derivative transaction to execute a credit support annex ('CSA') in conjunction with the ISDA master agreement. Under a CSA, collateral is passed between the parties to mitigate the counterparty risk inherent in outstanding positions. The majority of our CSAs are with financial institutional clients.\n\nWe manage the counterparty exposure on our OTC derivative contracts by using collateral agreements with counterparties and netting agreements. Currently, we do not actively manage our general OTC derivative counterparty exposure in the credit markets, although we may manage individual exposures in certain circumstances.\n\nWe place strict policy restrictions on collateral types and as a consequence the types of collateral received and pledged are, by value, highly liquid and of a strong quality, being predominantly cash.\n\nWhere a collateral type is required to be approved outside the collateral policy, approval is required from a committee of senior representatives from Markets, Legal and Risk.\n\nSee page 378 and Note 30 on the financial statements for details regarding legally enforceable right of offset in the event of counterparty default and collateral received in respect of derivatives.\n\n## Personal lending\n\nThis section presents further disclosures related to personal lending. It provides details of the regions, countries and products that are driving the change observed in personal loans and advances to customers, with the impact of foreign exchange separately identified. Additionally, Hong Kong and UK mortgage book LTV data is provided.\n\nThis section also provides a reconciliation of the opening 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 closing gross carrying/ nominal amounts and associated allowance for ECL. Further product granularity is also provided by stage, with geographical data presented for loans and advances to customers, loan and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, total personal lending for loans and advances to customers of $478bn increased by $17.5bn compared with 31 December 2020. This increase included adverse foreign exchange movements of $6.4bn. Excluding foreign exchange movements, there was growth of $24.0bn, primarily driven by $11.4bn in Asia and $10.2bn in Europe. The allowance for ECL attributable to personal lending, excluding off-balance sheet loan commitments and guarantees and foreign exchange movements, decreased $1.5bn to $3.1bn at 31 December 2021.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, total personal lending was primarily driven by mortgage growth, which grew by $22.8bn. Mortgages grew $10.1bn in the UK; $9.9bn in Asia, notably $6.6bn in Hong Kong and $2.1bn in Australia; and $3.4bn in Canada. This was partly offset by a decrease of $1.8bn due to domestic mass market retail banking in the US being reclassified to assets held for sale. The allowance for ECL, excluding foreign exchange, attributable to mortgages of $0.7bn decreased by $0.1bn compared with 31 December 2020.\n\nThe quality of both our Hong Kong and UK mortgage books remained high, with low levels of impairment allowances. The average LTV ratio on new mortgage lending in Hong Kong was 62%, compared with an estimated 47% for the overall mortgage portfolio. The average LTV ratio on new lending in the UK was 67%, compared with an estimated 51% for the overall mortgage portfolio.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange movements, other personal lending balances at 31 December 2021 increased by $1.2bn compared with 31 December 2020, mainly from unsecured personal lending in Hong Kong (up $1.0bn) and in Latin America (up $0.7bn), as well as from guaranteed loans in respect of residential property in France (up $0.8bn). These were offset by a decrease in credit cards mainly in the US (down $0.9bn).\n\nThe allowance for ECL, excluding foreign exchange, attributable to other personal lending of $2.4bn decreased by $1.5bn compared with 31 December 2020. Excluding foreign exchange, the allowance for ECL attributable to credit cards decreased by $0.9bn while unsecured personal lending decreased by $0.6bn.",

This excludes offset mortgages in the first direct brand and Private Bank mortgages.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the average LTV ratio in the portfolio was 40% and 99% of mortgages had an LTV ratio of 75% or less.\n\n- Of the interest-only mortgage loans that expired in 2019, 89%\n\n## UK interest-only mortgage loans\n\nwere repaid within 12 months of expiry with a total of 91% being repaid within 24 months of expiry. For those expiring during 2020, 73% were repaid within 12 months of expiry. The drop in the amount fully repaid within the 12 months is explained by the extensions granted as part of the FCA guidance on helping borrowers with maturing interest-only mortgages during the pandemic that ended in October 2021. Excluding the extensions, only $3.9m remains outstanding.\n\nThe profile of maturing UK interest-only loans is as follows:\n\n|                                          | $m     |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Expired interest-only mortgage loans     | 167    |\n| Interest-only mortgage loans by maturity |        |\n| - 2022                                   | 267    |\n| - 2023                                   | 401    |\n| - 2024                                   | 330    |\n| - 2025                                   | 420    |\n| - 2026-2030                              | 3,288  |\n| - post-2030                              | 10,333 |\n| At 31 Dec 2021                           | 15,206 |\n| Expired interest-only mortgage loans     | 169    |\n| Interest-only mortgage loans by maturity |        |\n| - 2021                                   | 356    |\n| - 2022                                   | 392    |\n| - 2023                                   | 500    |\n| - 2024                                   | 407    |\n| - 2025-2029                              | 3,317  |\n| -  post-2030                             | 9,914  |\n| At 31 Dec 2020                           | 15,055 |\n\n## Exposure to offset mortgage in first direct\n\nThe offset mortgage in first direct is a flexible way for our customers to take control of their finances. It works by grouping together the customer's mortgage, savings and current accounts to offset their credit and debit balances against their mortgage exposure.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, exposures were worth a total $7.0bn with an average LTV ratio of 35% (31 December 2020: $8.6bn exposure and 37% LTV ratio).",

This was partly offset by $951m relating to underlying net book volume movements and $455m relating to the net remeasurement impact of stage transfers.\n\nThe net transfer of gross carrying/nominal amounts to stage 1 of $1,822m reflects the overall improvement in the economic outlook as the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak subsided. It was primarily driven by $2,854m in Europe and $1,074m in North America, and was partly offset by a net transfer out of stage 1 of $2,346m in Asia, mainly driven by management judgemental adjustments primarily in Hong Kong during 1H21.\n\nPersonal lending -

The major risks faced by HSBC Holdings are credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk (in the form of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk).\n\nCredit risk in HSBC Holdings primarily arises from transactions with Group subsidiaries and its investments in those subsidiaries.\n\nIn HSBC Holdings, the maximum exposure to credit risk arises from two components:\n\n- \u00b7 financial instruments on the balance sheet (see page 315); and\n- \u00b7 financial guarantees and similar contracts, where the maximum exposure is the maximum that we would have to pay if the guarantees were called upon (see Note 32).\n\nIn the case of our derivative balances, we have amounts with a legally enforceable right of offset in the case of counterparty default that are not included in the carrying value. These offsets also include collateral received in cash and other financial assets.\n\nThe total offset relating to our derivative balances was $1.6bn at 31 December 2021 (2020: $1.7bn).\n\nThe credit quality of loans and advances and financial investments, both of which consist of intra-Group lending and US Treasury bills and bonds, is assessed as 'strong', with 100% of the exposure being neither past due nor impaired (2020: 100%). For further details of credit quality classification, see page 138.",

Treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings or capital due to non-trading book foreign exchange exposures and changes in market interest rates.\n\nTreasury risk arises from changes to the respective resources and risk profiles driven by customer behaviour, management decisions or the external environment.\n\n## Approach and policy\n\n(Audited)\n\nOur objective in the management of treasury risk is to maintain appropriate levels of capital, liquidity, funding, foreign exchange and market risk to support our business strategy, and meet our regulatory and stress testing-related requirements.\n\nOur approach to treasury management is driven by our strategic and organisational requirements, taking into account the regulatory, economic and commercial environment. We aim to maintain a strong capital and liquidity base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy, meeting both consolidated and local regulatory requirements at all times.\n\nOur policy is underpinned by our risk management framework, our internal capital adequacy assessment process ('ICAAP') and our internal liquidity adequacy assessment process ('ILAAP'). The risk framework incorporates a number of measures aligned to our assessment of risks for both internal and regulatory purposes. These risks include credit, market, operational, pensions, nontrading book foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nFor further details, refer to our Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2021 .\n\n## Treasury risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Global Treasury initiated a new flagship programme to deliver a more resilient, effective and efficient Treasury function over the next four years with a focus on safeguarding and optimising financial resources. The programme will aim to deliver modernised infrastructure and upgraded modelling capabilities alongside a broad reorganisation of the Global Treasury function.\n- \u00b7 As announced in February 2021, we intend to maintain a common equity tier 1 ('CET1') ratio above 14%, normalising within our target operating range of 14% to 14.5% by the end of 2022. For the financial year 2021, we were at the lower end of our target dividend payout ratio range of between 40% and 55% of reported earnings per ordinary share ('EPS'), driven by ECL releases and higher restructuring costs.\n- \u00b7 We continued to build our recovery and resolution capabilities, including in relation to the Bank of England ('BoE') Resolvability Assessment Framework, which had an overall compliance deadline of 1 January 2022. We submitted a self-assessment report on our resolvability to the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and the BoE on 1 October 2021. This included an assessment of how we addressed resolvability outcomes that impact treasury risk, including valuations, and capital, liquidity and funding capabilities in resolution. We will publish a\n- summary of our self-assessment report in June 2022. The BoE will similarly publish a statement relating to the resolvability of HSBC at the same time.\n- \u00b7 The BoE's Financial Policy Committee ('FPC') confirmed its guidance on the path for the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate. It has announced that it is increasing the rate from 0% to 1%, effective December 2022 in line with the usual 12 -month implementation lag. Absent a material change in the outlook for the UK's financial stability, the FPC would expect to further increase the rate to 2% in the second quarter of 2022, which would take effect 12 months later. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority ('HKMA') maintained the countercyclical capital buffer rate at 1% for Hong Kong, but it will continue to monitor credit and economic conditions closely.\n- \u00b7 The PRA has confirmed that the capitalisation of structural foreign exchange risk should align to a Pillar 1 approach. In response, we adopted this approach from 31 December 2021. As a result, market risk RWAs increased by $8.4bn, offset by a reduction in Pillar 2 requirements. In advance of this change, we undertook incremental hedging transactions to reduce structural foreign exchange risk and RWAs.\n- \u00b7 We revised the approach to calculate the Group liquidity coverage ratio ('LCR') better reflecting the free transferability of liquidity within the Group, in consideration with currency convertibility and regulatory intra-Group limits. A risk appetite has been set against the Group LCR. We first published the Group LCR as part of our 30 June 2021 disclosures. Based on the consolidation methodology, the Group LCR was 138.4% at 31 December 2021.\n- \u00b7 As part of our continuing focus on enhancing the quality of our regulatory reporting, we are progressing with a comprehensive programme to strengthen our global processes, improve consistency and enhance control standards on various aspects of regulatory reporting. Further details can be found in the subsequent sub-section 'Regulatory reporting processes and controls'.\n- \u00b7 We worked with the fiduciaries of all our pension plans to ensure the measures taken in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including remote working for plan providers and dealing appropriately with affected plan members, were properly maintained and supported. Our de-risking programmes continued to provide protection against the volatility in financial markets that resulted from the pandemic's economic impact.\n- \u00b7 We created a new team within the Global Treasury function to be accountable for monitoring and managing the financial risk and capital implications of the Group's employee defined benefit pension plans. This change creates clearer delineation of the roles and responsibilities of the first and second lines of defence.\n\nThe Group's CET1 ratio was 15.8% at 31 December 2021 and the leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation, was 5.2%. The Group continues to maintain and plan for the appropriate resources required to manage its risk and deliver its strategic objectives while supporting local economies.\n\nAll of the Group's material operating entities were above regulatory minimum levels of liquidity and funding at 31 December 2021.\n\nFor quantitative disclosures on capital ratios, own funds and RWAs, see pages 193 to 194. For quantitative disclosures on liquidity and funding metrics, see pages 196 to 197. For quantitative disclosures on interest rate risk in the banking book, see pages 200 to 201.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe Global Head of Traded and Treasury Risk Management and Risk Analytics is the accountable risk steward for all treasury risks. The Group Treasurer is the risk owner for all treasury risks, with the exception of pension risk, which is co-owned together with the Group Head of Performance, Reward and Employee Relations.",

        "page_content": "Capital risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book and non-trading book foreign exchange risk are the responsibility of the Group Executive Committee and the Group Risk Committee ('GRC'). The Global Treasury function actively manages these risks on an ongoing basis, supported by the Holdings Asset and Liability Management Committee ('ALCO') and local ALCOs, overseen by Treasury Risk Management and the Risk Management Meeting ('RMM').\n\nPension risk is overseen by a network of local and regional pension risk management meetings. The Global Pensions Risk Management Meeting provides oversight of all pension plans sponsored by HSBC globally and is chaired by the accountable risk steward.\n\n## Capital, liquidity and funding risk management processes\n\n## Assessment and risk appetite\n\nOur capital management policy is underpinned by a global capital management framework and our ICAAP. The framework incorporates key capital risk appetites including CET1, total capital, minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities ('MREL'), leverage ratio and double leverage. The ICAAP is an assessment of the Group's capital position, outlining both regulatory and internal capital resources and requirements resulting from HSBC's business model, strategy, risk profile and management, performance and planning, risks to capital, and the implications of stress testing. Our assessment of capital adequacy is driven by an assessment of risks. These risks include credit, market, operational, pensions, insurance, structural foreign exchange, interest rate risk in the banking book and Group risk driven by credit concentration risk in HSBC UK. Climate risk is also considered as part of the ICAAP, and we are continuing to develop our approach. The Group's ICAAP supports the determination of the consolidated capital risk appetite and target ratios, as well as enables the assessment and determination of capital requirements by regulators. Subsidiaries prepare ICAAPs in line with global guidance, while considering their local regulatory regimes to determine their own risk appetites and ratios.\n\nHSBC Holdings is the provider of equity capital and MREL-eligible debt to its subsidiaries, and also provides them with non-equity capital where necessary. These investments are funded by HSBC Holdings' own equity capital and MREL-eligible debt.\n\nHSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a prudent balance between the composition of its capital and its investments in subsidiaries, including management of double leverage. Double leverage reflects the extent to which equity investments in operating entities are funded by holding company debt. Where Group capital requirements are less than the aggregate of operating entity capital requirements, double leverage can be used to improve Group capital efficiency provided it is managed appropriately. In 2021, we updated the basis of preparation for the calculation of double leverage, to better reflect the economics of the risk and align with the Group accounting view. The Group recognises that double leverage can give rise to holding company cash flow risk, and the risk framework reflects the view that the holding company should be a source of support for its subsidiaries in times of stress. Double leverage is one of the constraints on managing our capital position, given the complexity of the Group's subsidiary structure and the multiple regulatory regimes under which we operate. As a matter of long-standing policy, the holding company retains a substantial holdings capital buffer comprising high-quality liquid assets ('HQLA'), which at 31 December 2021 was in excess of $13bn. The portfolio of HQLA helps to mitigate the risks associated with double leverage. Further mitigation is provided by additional tier 1 ('AT1') securities issued in excess of the regulatory requirements of our subsidiaries.\n\nWe aim to ensure that management has oversight of our liquidity and funding risks at Group and entity level by maintaining comprehensive policies, metrics and controls. We manage liquidity and funding risk at an operating entity level to make sure that obligations can be met in the jurisdiction where they fall due, generally without reliance on other parts of the Group. Operating\n\nentities are required to meet internal minimum requirements and any applicable regulatory requirements at all times. These requirements are assessed through the ILAAP, which ensures that operating entities have robust strategies, policies, processes and systems for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity risk over an appropriate set of time horizons, including intra-day. The ILAAP informs the validation of risk tolerance and the setting of risk appetite. It also assesses the capability to manage liquidity and funding effectively in each major entity. These metrics are set and managed locally but are subject to robust global review and challenge to ensure consistency of approach and application of the Group's policies and controls.\n\n## Planning and performance\n\nCapital and risk-weighted asset ('RWA') plans form part of the annual financial resource plan that is approved by the Board. Capital and RWA forecasts are submitted to the Group Executive Committee on a monthly basis, and capital and RWAs are monitored and managed against the plan. The responsibility for global capital allocation principles rests with the Group Chief Financial Officer, supported by the Group Capital Management Meeting. This is a specialist forum addressing capital management, reporting into Holdings ALCO.\n\nThrough our internal governance processes, we seek to strengthen discipline over our investment and capital allocation decisions, and to ensure that returns on investment meet management's objectives. Our strategy is to allocate capital to businesses and entities to support growth objectives where returns above internal hurdle levels have been identified and in order to meet their regulatory and economic capital needs. We evaluate and manage business returns by using a return on average tangible equity measure.\n\nFunding and liquidity plans form part of the financial resource plan that is approved by the Board. The Board-level appetite measures are the LCR and net stable funding ratio ('NSFR'), together with an internal liquidity metric which was introduced in January 2021 to supplement the LCR and NSFR. In addition, we use a wider set of measures to manage an appropriate funding and liquidity profile, including legal entity depositor concentration limits, intra-day liquidity, forward-looking funding assessments and other key measures.\n\n## Risks to capital and liquidity\n\nOutside the stress testing framework, other risks may be identified that have the potential to affect our RWAs, capital and/or liquidity position. Downside and Upside scenarios are assessed against our management objectives, and mitigating actions are assigned as necessary. We closely monitor future regulatory changes and continue to evaluate the impact of these upon our capital and liquidity requirements. These include the UK's implementation of amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation ('CRR II'), the Basel III Reforms, and the regulatory impact from the UK's withdrawal from the EU, as well as other regulatory statements including changes to internal ratings-based ('IRB') modelling requirements.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\nThe PRA has confirmed that software assets are deducted in full from CET1 capital, starting 1 January 2022. This reverses the beneficial changes to the treatment of software assets that were implemented as part of the EU's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, the CET1 capital ratio will reduce by approximately 25bps.\n\nOverall, we expect RWAs to increase by around 3% as a result of changes in regulations during 2022. These include the changes to the UK's version of the CRR II, as well as other regulatory statements including changes to IRB modelling requirements and the expiry of transitional provisions in relation to the UK's withdrawal from the EU. The CRR II changes, including the PRA's new rules on NSFR, counterparty credit risk, equity investment in funds, and leverage ratio, will be reflected in disclosures starting in the first quarter of 2022.",

        "page_content": "Further changes will occur with the introduction of the remaining Basel III Reforms on which the PRA is expected to consult in the second half of 2022. We currently do not foresee a material net impact on initial implementation. The RWA output floor under the Basel III reforms will be subject to a five-year transitional provision. Any impact from the output floor would be towards the end of the transition period.\n\n## Regulatory reporting processes and controls\n\nThe quality of regulatory reporting remains a key priority for management and regulators. Notably, the PRA published a Dear CEO letter addressed to UK regulated banks, which highlighted areas of concern over the processes firms use to deliver regulatory returns. Recent sanctions issued by the PRA demonstrate their intent in this respect. We are progressing with a comprehensive programme to strengthen our processes, improve consistency, and enhance controls on various aspects of regulatory reporting. We have commissioned a number of independent external reviews, some at the request of our regulators, including one on our credit risk RWA reporting process, which is currently ongoing. As a result of these initiatives, there may be an impact on some of our regulatory ratios, such as the CET1 and LCR.\n\n## Stress testing and recovery planning\n\nThe Group uses stress testing to evaluate the robustness of plans and risk portfolios including the impact of ECL, and to meet the stress testing requirements set by supervisors. Stress testing also informs the ICAAP and ILAAP and supports recovery planning in many jurisdictions. It is an important output used to evaluate how much capital and liquidity the Group requires in setting risk appetite for capital and liquidity risk. It is also used to re-evaluate business plans where analysis shows capital, liquidity and/or returns do not meet their target.\n\nIn addition to a range of internal stress tests, we are subject to supervisory stress testing in many jurisdictions. These include the programmes of the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve Board, the European Banking Authority, the European Central Bank and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, as well as stress tests undertaken in other jurisdictions. The results of regulatory stress testing and our internal stress tests are used when assessing our internal capital requirements through the ICAAP. The outcomes of stress testing exercises carried out by the PRA and other regulators feed into the setting of regulatory minimum ratios and buffers.\n\nThe Group and subsidiaries have established recovery plans, which set out potential options management could take in a range of stress scenarios that could result in a breach of capital or liquidity buffers. All entities monitor internal and external triggers that could threaten their capital, liquidity or funding positions. Entities have established recovery plans providing detailed actions that management would consider taking in a stress scenario should their positions deteriorate and threaten to breach risk appetite and regulatory minimum levels. This is to help ensure that our capital and liquidity position can be recovered even in an extreme stress event.\n\nOverall, recovery and resolution plans form part of the integral framework safeguarding the Group's financial stability. The Group is committed to developing its recovery and resolution capabilities further, including in relation to the BoE's Resolvability Assessment Framework.\n\n## Measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book processes\n\n## Assessment and risk appetite\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the risk of an adverse impact to earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates. It is generated by our non-traded assets and liabilities, specifically loans, deposits and financial instruments that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent. Interest rate risk that can be economically hedged may be transferred to the Markets Treasury business. Hedging is generally executed through interest rate derivatives or fixed-rate government bonds. Any interest rate risk that Markets Treasury\n\ncannot economically hedge is not transferred and will remain within the global business where the risks originate.\n\nThe Global Treasury function uses a number of measures to monitor and control interest rate risk in the banking book, including:\n\n- \u00b7 net interest income sensitivity; and\n- \u00b7 economic value of equity sensitivity\n\n## Net interest income sensitivity\n\nA principal part of our management of non-traded interest rate risk is to monitor the sensitivity of expected net interest income ('NII') under varying interest rate scenarios (i.e. simulation modelling), where all other economic variables are held constant. This monitoring is undertaken at an entity level by local ALCOs, where entities calculate both one-year and five-year NII sensitivities across a range of interest rate scenarios.\n\nNII sensitivity figures represent the effect of pro forma movements in projected yield curves based on a static balance sheet size and structure. The exception to this is where the size of the balances or repricing is deemed interest rate sensitive, for example, noninterest-bearing current account migration and fixed-rate loan early prepayment. These sensitivity calculations do not incorporate actions that would be taken by Markets Treasury or in the business that originates the risk to mitigate the effect of interest rate movements.\n\nThe NII sensitivity calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the 'up-shock' scenario. The sensitivity calculations in the 'down-shock' scenarios reflect no floors to the shocked market rates. However, customer product-specific interest rate floors are recognised where applicable.\n\n## Economic value of equity sensitivity\n\nEconomic value of equity ('EVE') represents the present value of the future banking book cash flows that could be distributed to equity holders under a managed run-off scenario. This equates to the current book value of equity plus the present value of future NII in this scenario. EVE can be used to assess the economic capital required to support interest rate risk in the banking book. An EVE sensitivity represents the expected movement in EVE due to pre-specified interest rate shocks, where all other economic variables are held constant. Operating entities are required to monitor EVE sensitivities as a percentage of capital resources.\n\nFurther details of HSBC's risk management of interest rate risk in the banking book can be found in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2021 .\n\n## Other Group risks\n\n## Non-trading book foreign exchange exposures\n\n## Structural foreign exchange exposures\n\nStructural foreign exchange exposures represent net assets or capital investments in subsidiaries, branches, joint arrangements or associates, together with any associated hedges, the functional currencies of which are currencies other than the US dollar. An entity's functional currency is normally that of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.\n\nExchange differences on structural exposures are recognised in other comprehensive income ('OCI'). We use the US dollar as our presentation currency in our consolidated financial statements because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency bloc in which we transact and fund our business. Therefore, our consolidated balance sheet is affected by exchange differences between the US dollar and all the non-US dollar functional currencies of underlying subsidiaries.\n\nOur structural foreign exchange exposures are managed with the primary objective of ensuring, where practical, that our consolidated capital ratios and the capital ratios of individual banking subsidiaries are largely protected from the effect of changes in exchange rates.\n\nWe hedge structural foreign exchange positions where it is capital efficient to do so, and subject to approved limits. This is achieved",

Hedging positions are monitored and rebalanced periodically to manage RWA or downside risks associated with HSBC's foreign currency investments.\n\nFor further details of our structural foreign exchange exposures, see page 199.\n\n## Transactional foreign exchange exposures\n\nTransactional foreign exchange exposures arise from transactions in the banking book generating profit and loss or OCI reserves in a currency other than the reporting currency of the operating entity. Transactional foreign exchange exposure generated through profit and loss is periodically transferred to Markets and Securities Services and managed within limits with the exception of limited residual foreign exchange exposure arising from timing differences or for other reasons. Transactional foreign exchange exposure generated through OCI reserves is managed by the Markets Treasury business within a limit framework to be agreed in the first half of 2022.\n\n## HSBC Holdings risk management\n\nAs a financial services holding company, HSBC Holdings has limited market risk activities. Its activities predominantly involve maintaining sufficient capital resources to support the Group's diverse activities; allocating these capital resources across the Group's businesses; earning dividend and interest income on its investments in the businesses; payment of operating expenses; providing dividend payments to its equity shareholders and interest payments to providers of debt capital; and maintaining a supply of short-term liquid assets for deployment under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe main market risks to which HSBC Holdings is exposed are banking book interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Exposure to these risks arises from short-term cash balances, funding positions held, loans to subsidiaries, investments in long-term financial assets, financial liabilities including debt capital issued and structural foreign exchange hedges. The objective of HSBC Holdings' market risk management strategy is to manage volatility in capital resources, cash flows and distributable reserves that could be caused by movements in market parameters. Market risk for HSBC Holdings is monitored by Holdings ALCO in accordance with its risk appetite statement.\n\nHSBC Holdings uses interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk and foreign currency risk arising from its long-term debt issues and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its structural foreign exchange exposures.\n\nFor quantitative disclosures on interest rate risk in the banking book, see pages 200 to 201.\n\n## Pension risk management processes\n\nOur global pensions strategy is to move from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, where local law allows and it is considered competitive to do so. We will continue to review and enhance our risk appetite metrics to assist the internal monitoring of our de-risking programmes.\n\nIn defined contribution pension plans, the contributions that HSBC is required to make are known, while the ultimate pension benefit will vary, typically with investment returns achieved by investment choices made by the employee. While the market risk to HSBC of defined contribution plans is low, the Group is still exposed to operational and reputational risk.\n\nIn defined benefit pension plans, the level of pension benefit is\n\nknown. Therefore, the level of contributions required by HSBC will vary due to a number of risks, including:\n\n- \u00b7 investments delivering a return below that required to provide the projected plan benefits;\n- \u00b7 the prevailing economic environment leading to corporate failures, thus triggering write-downs in asset values (both equity and debt);\n- \u00b7 a change in either interest rates or inflation expectations, causing an increase in the value of plan liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 plan members living longer than expected (known as longevity risk).\n\nPension risk is assessed using an economic capital model that takes into account potential variations in these factors. The impact of these variations on both pension assets and pension liabilities is assessed using a one-in-200-year stress test. Scenario analysis and other stress tests are also used to support pension risk management.\n\nTo fund the benefits associated with defined benefit plans, sponsoring Group companies, and in some instances employees, make regular contributions in accordance with advice from actuaries and in consultation with the plan's fiduciaries where relevant. These contributions are normally set to ensure that there are sufficient funds to meet the cost of the accruing benefits for the future service of active members. However, higher contributions are required when plan assets are considered insufficient to cover the existing pension liabilities. Contribution rates are typically revised annually or once every three years, depending on the plan.\n\nThe defined benefit plans invest contributions in a range of investments designed to limit the risk of assets failing to meet a plan's liabilities. Any changes in expected returns from the investments may also change future contribution requirements. In pursuit of these long-term objectives, an overall target allocation is established between asset classes of the defined benefit plan. In addition, each permitted asset class has its own benchmarks, such as stock-market or property valuation indices or liability characteristics. The benchmarks are reviewed at least once every three to five years and more frequently if required by local legislation or circumstances. The process generally involves an extensive asset and liability review.\n\nIn addition, some of the Group's pension plans hold longevity swap contracts. These arrangements provide long-term protection to the relevant plans against costs resulting from pensioners or their dependants living longer than initially expected. The most sizeable plan to do this is the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme, which holds longevity swaps covering approximately 60% of the plan's pensioner liabilities.",

The table presents them under the transitional arrangements in CRR II for capital instruments and after their expiry, known as the end point. The end point figures in the table above include the benefit of the regulatory transitional arrangements in CRR II for IFRS 9, which are more fully described below. Where applicable, they also reflect government relief schemes intended to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, our common equity tier 1 ('CET1') capital ratio decreased to 15.8% from 15.9% at 31 December 2020. RWAs decreased due to RWA reductions under the transformation programme and favourable movements in asset quality. CET1 capital fell due to higher regulatory deductions and fair value movements net of capital generation.\n\n## Own funds\n\nThe $3.5bn fall in CET1 capital was mainly as a result of:\n\n- \u00b7 a $2.9bn net increase in deductions for excess expected loss, investment in financial sector entities and defined benefit pension assets surplus;\n- \u00b7 $2.5bn unfavourable foreign currency translation differences; and\n- \u00b7 a $2.2bn decrease in fair value through other comprehensive income reserve.\n\nThese decreases were partly offset by capital generation of $3.9bn through profits net of share buy-back, foreseeable dividend and dividends paid.\n\nOur Pillar 2A requirement at 31 December 2021, as per the PRA's Individual Capital Requirement based on a point-in-time assessment, was $22.5bn, equivalent to 2.7% of RWAs, of which 1.5% was required to be met by CET1. With effect from 31 December 2021, structural foreign exchange risk is capitalised in RWAs under Pillar 1, with a consequent reduction in Pillar 2A. Going forward, structural foreign exchange risk will be assessed for Pillar 2A in the same manner as other risks capitalised under Pillar 1.",

The $6.3bn decrease (excluding foreign currency translation differences) resulted from RWA saves and favourable movements in asset quality, which more than offset increases due\n\nto lending growth and regulatory change. At 31 December 2021, our cumulative RWA saves as part of our transformation programme were $104bn, including accelerated reductions of $9.6bn from 31 December 2019.\n\n- \u00b7 the expiry of transitional provisions in relation to the UK's withdrawal from the EU.\n\nBased on our capital position at 31 December 2021, we would expect that the proposed classification of our retail banking operations in France as being held for sale would reduce our CET1 ratio by around 30bps. Separately, our recent strategic actions are likely to lead to a fall in our CET1 ratio of around 15bps, of which we expect approximately half will occur in the first quarter of 2022. These actions include the acquisitions of AXA Singapore, L&T Investment Management and HSBC Life China, and the exit of mass market retail banking in the US.",

        "page_content": "## Asset size\n\nThe $12.5bn increase in CMB RWAs reflected corporate loan growth in mainland China, Hong Kong and North America, while lending in Europe reduced.\n\nWPB RWAs rose by $5.5bn, primarily due to lending growth in Asia, largely in the mortgage portfolio. Sovereign exposures drove the $0.6bn rise in Corporate Centre RWAs.\n\nThe $12.1bn fall in GBM was mostly due to lower lending, management initiatives and mark-to-market movements in Europe, North America and Latin America, partly offset by growth in Asia.\n\nMarket risk RWAs decreased by $1.8bn, largely as a result of reduced exposures and risk mitigation actions.\n\n## Asset quality\n\nThe RWA decreases in CMB, WPB and Corporate Centre were mostly due to favourable portfolio mix changes in Asia and North America, and credit migration in Europe and North America.\n\nIn GBM, favourable portfolio mix changes in Asia and credit migration in North America were partly offset by increases in the UK due to portfolio changes, leading to an overall fall of $0.4bn.\n\n## Model updates\n\nThe $2.0bn increase in WPB was mostly due to changes to our Australian mortgages model.\n\nThis was partly offset by the $1.2bn reduction in market risk RWAs, largely from the implementation of an options risk model. The fall in CMB RWAs was driven by corporate model updates.\n\n## Methodology and policy\n\nChanges to Markets Treasury allocation methodologies decreased RWAs in Corporate Centre and increased RWAs in WPB, CMB and GBM. However, the increase in GBM was more than offset by parameter refinements across our major regions.\n\nThe $7.4bn rise in market risk included an $8.4bn increase on our adoption of a Pillar 1 approach to the capitalisation of structural foreign exchange risk, following confirmation from the PRA. This was partly offset by enhancements to foreign exchange risk calculations under the standardised approach.\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals\n\nThe sale of a US credit card portfolio led to a $0.4bn fall in WPB RWAs.\n\n## Leverage ratio 1\n\n|       |                                                                               | At              | At              |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Ref*  |                                                                               | 31 Dec 2021 $bn | 31 Dec 2020 $bn |\n| 20    | Tier 1 capital                                                                | 155.0           | 158.5           |\n| 21    | Total leverage ratio exposure                                                 | 2,962.7         | 2,897.1         |\n|       |                                                                               | %               | %               |\n| 22    | Leverage ratio                                                                | 5.2             | 5.5             |\n| EU-23 | Choice of transitional arrangements for the definition of the capital measure | Fully phased-in | Fully phased-in |\n|       | UK leverage ratio exposure - quarterly average 2                              | 2,545.6         | 2,555.5         |\n|       |                                                                               | %               | %               |\n|       | UK leverage ratio - quarterly average 2                                       | 6.0             | 6.1             |\n|       | UK leverage ratio - quarter end 2                                             | 6.2             | 6.2             |\n\n- 1  The CRR II regulatory transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 are applied in both leverage ratio calculations.\n- 2  UK leverage ratio denotes the Group's leverage ratio calculated under the PRA's UK leverage framework. This measure excludes from the calculation of exposure qualifying central bank balances and loans under the UK Bounce Back Loan Scheme.\n\nOur leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the Capital Requirements Regulation was 5.2% at 31 December 2021, down from 5.5% at 31 December 2020, due to a decrease in tier 1 capital and an increase in leverage exposure, primarily due to growth in central bank deposits and customer lending, offset by a decrease in financial investments.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, our UK minimum leverage ratio requirement of 3.25% under the PRA's UK leverage framework was supplemented by an additional leverage ratio buffer of 0.7% and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer of 0.1%. These additional buffers translated into capital values of $17.6bn and $2.5bn respectively. We exceeded these leverage requirements.\n\n## Regulatory transitional arrangements for IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'\n\nWe have adopted the regulatory transitional arrangements in CRR II for IFRS 9, including paragraph four of article 473a. Our capital and ratios are presented under these arrangements throughout the tables in this section, including in the end point figures. Without their application, our CET1 ratio would be 15.7%.\n\nThe IFRS 9 regulatory transitional arrangements allow banks to add back to their capital base a proportion of the impact that IFRS 9 has upon their loan loss allowances. The impact is defined as:\n\n- \u00b7 the increase in loan loss allowances on day one of IFRS 9 adoption; and\n- \u00b7 any subsequent increase in ECL in the non-credit-impaired book thereafter.\n\nAny add-back must be tax affected and accompanied by a recalculation of exposure and RWAs. The impact is calculated separately for portfolios using the standardised ('STD') and internal ratings-based ('IRB') approaches. For IRB portfolios, there is no add-back to capital unless loan loss allowances exceed regulatory 12-month expected losses.\n\nThe EU's CRR II 'Quick Fix' relief package enacted in June 2020 increased from 70% to 100% the relief that banks may take for loan loss allowances recognised since 1 January 2020 on the non-credit-impaired book.\n\nIn the current period, the add-back to CET1 capital amounted to $1.0bn under the STD approach with a tax impact of $0.2bn. At 31 December 2020, the add-back to the capital base under the STD approach was $1.6bn with a tax impact of $0.4bn.\n\n## Pillar 3 disclosure requirements\n\nPillar 3 of the Basel regulatory framework is related to market discipline and aims to make financial services firms more transparent by requiring publication of wide-ranging information on their risks, capital and management. Our Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2021 is published on our website at www.hsbc.com/ investors.",

The liquidity value of these assets for each entity is shown in the following table along with the individual LCR levels based on European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61. This basis may differ from local LCR measures due to differences in the way nonEU regulators have implemented the Basel III standards. Each\n\nentity maintains sufficient stable funding relative to the required stable funding assessed using the NSFR or other appropriate metrics. From 1 January 2022, we started managing funding risk based on the PRA's NSFR rules.\n\nIn addition to regulatory metrics, we enhanced our liquidity framework in 2021 to include an internal liquidity metric, which is being used to monitor and manage liquidity risk via a low-point measure across a 270-day horizon, taking into account recovery capacity.\n\nThe Group liquidity and funding position at the end of 2021 is analysed in the following sections.\n\nOperating entities' liquidity\n\n|                                                                    | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                                    | LCR %                 | HQLA $bn              | Net outflows $bn      | NSFR %                |\n| HSBC UK Bank plc (ring-fenced bank) 1                              | 241                   | 163                   | 68                    | 178                   |\n| HSBC Bank plc (non-ring-fenced bank) 2                             | 150                   | 135                   | 90                    | 107                   |\n| The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation -

In 2021, we implemented a revised approach to the application of the requirements under the European Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61. This revised approach was used to assess the limitations in the transferability of entity liquidity around the Group and resulted in an adjustment of $163bn to LCR HQLA and $9bn to LCR inflows. This reflected an increase in the adjustment of $62bn compared with the approach used for the disclosure in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020 . The change in methodology was designed to better incorporate local regulatory restrictions on the transferability of liquidity.\n\n|                                                         | At              | At              | At                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n|                                                         | 31 Dec 2021 $bn | 30 Jun 2021 $bn | 31 Dec   2020 1 $bn |\n| High-quality liquid assets (in entities)                | 880             | 844             | 857                 |\n| EC Delegated Act adjustment for transfer restrictions 2 | (172)           | (189)           | (179)               |\n| Group LCR HQLA                                          | 717             | 659             | 678                 |\n| Net outflows                                            | 518             | 494             | 487                 |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio                                | 138%            | 134%            | 139%                |\n\n## Liquid assets\n\nAfter the $163bn adjustment, the Group LCR HQLA of $717bn (31 December 2020: $678bn) was held in a range of asset classes and currencies.

        "page_content": "## Interest rate risk in the banking book in 2021\n\n## Net interest income sensitivity\n\nThe following tables set out the assessed impact to a hypothetical base case projection of our banking book NII under the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 an immediate shock of 25 basis points ('bps') to the current market-implied path of interest rates across all currencies on 1 January 2022 (effects over one year and five years);\n- \u00b7 an immediate shock of 100bps to the current market-implied path of interest rates across all currencies on 1 January 2022 (effects over one year and five years).\n\nThe sensitivities shown represent a hypothetical simulation of the base case NII, assuming a static balance sheet, no management actions from the Markets Treasury business and a simplified 50% pass-on assumption applied for material entities as described below. This incorporates the effect of interest rate\n\nbehaviouralisation, hypothetical managed rate product pricing assumptions and customer behaviour, including prepayment of mortgages under the specific interest rate scenarios. The scenarios represent interest rate shocks to the current market implied path of rates. The sensitivity calculations exclude pensions, insurance and investments in subsidiaries.\n\nThe NII sensitivity analysis performed in the case of a down-shock does not include floors to market rates, and it does not include floors on some wholesale assets and liabilities. However, floors have been maintained for deposits and loans to customers where this is contractual or where negative rates would not be applied.\n\nAs market and policy rates move, the degree to which these changes are passed on to customers will vary based on a number of factors, including the absolute level of market rates, regulatory and contractual frameworks, and competitive dynamics in particular markets. Previously we disclosed NII sensitivity using a range of different pass-on assumptions, varying by currency, product and market. To aid comparability between markets, we have simplified the basis of preparation for our disclosure, and have used a 50% pass-on assumption for major entities on certain\n\ninterest bearing deposits. Our pass-through asset assumptions are largely in line with our contractual agreements or established market practice, which typically results in a significant portion of interest rate changes being passed on. Using this basis has resulted in a modest reduction in interest rate sensitivities in comparison with the previous basis of preparation. Comparatives have not been restated.\n\nThe one-year and five-year NII sensitivities in the down-shock scenarios increased at 31 December 2021 at Group level when compared with 31 December 2020. This was driven by the changes in the forecasted yield curves and changes in balance sheet composition. The NII sensitivities are forecasted for the whole period of one and five years each quarter.\n\nThe NII sensitivities shown are hypothetical and based on simplified scenarios. Immediate interest rate rises of 25bps and 100bps would increase projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2022 by $1,309m and $5,414m, respectively. Conversely, falls of 25bps and 100bps would decrease projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2022 by $1,952m and $5,761m, respectively.\n\nThe sensitivity of NII for 12 months increased by $66m in the plus 100bps parallel shock and increased by $907m in the minus 100bps parallel shock, comparing 31 December 2021 with 31 December 2020. The increase in the sensitivity of NII for 12 months in the plus 100bps parallel shock was mainly driven by change in market sentiment, reflecting current market expectations of main policy rates and changes in pass-on assumptions referred to above.\n\nThe change in NII sensitivity for five years is also driven by the factors above.\n\nThe tables do not include Markets Treasury management actions or changes in Markets and Securities Services net trading income that may further limit the impact.\n\nFor further details on measurement of interest rate risk in the banking book, see page 191.\n\nNII sensitivity to an instantaneous change in yield curves (12 months) -

The portfolio is accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income together with the derivatives held in designated hedging relationships with these securities. The markto-market of this portfolio therefore has an impact on CET1. Stressed VaR is quantified based on the worst losses over a oneyear period going back to the beginning of 2007 and the assumed holding period is 60 days. At the end of 2021, the stressed VaR of the portfolio was $3.63bn (2020: $2.94bn). The increase was mainly driven by the extension in the duration of our mortgagebacked securities exposures in US dollars as well as increases to the hold-to-collect-and-sell portfolios in US dollars and pounds sterling, partially offset by a reduction of exposure in a variety of other currencies.\n\nAlongside our monitoring of the stressed VaR of this portfolio, we also monitor the sensitivity of reported cash flow hedging reserves to interest rate movements on a yearly basis by assessing the\n\nexpected reduction in valuation of cash flow hedges due to parallel movements of plus or minus 100bps in all yield curves. Although we allow rates to go negative in this assessment, we apply a floor on the shocks in the minus 100bps scenario set at the lower of either minus 50bps or the central bank deposit rate. Due to increases in interest rates during 2021, the effect of this flooring has reduced significantly when compared with 2020.\n\nThe following table describes the sensitivity of our cash flow hedge reported reserves to the stipulated movements in yield curves at the year end. The sensitivities are indicative and based on simplified scenarios. These particular exposures form only a part of our overall interest rate exposure.\n\nComparing 31 December 2021 with 31 December 2020, the sensitivity of the cash flow hedging reserve increased by $866m in the plus 100bps scenario and increased by $1.13bn in the minus 100bps scenario. The increase in both scenarios was mainly driven by an increase in fixed rate pound sterling hedges transacted in HSBC UK Bank plc against a change in the interest rate risk behaviouralisation profile for non-interest-bearing current accounts. The increase in the down scenario is also driven by the reduced effect of flooring as interest rates increased over the year.\n\nSensitivity of cash flow hedging reported reserves to interest rate movements\n\n|                                                    | $m      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| At 31 Dec 2021                                     |         |\n| +100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | (1,531) |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | (0.77)% |\n| -100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | 1,537   |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | 0.78%   |\n| At 31 Dec 2020                                     |         |\n| +100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | (665)   |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | (0.34)% |\n| -100 basis point parallel move in all yield curves | 409     |\n| As a percentage of total shareholders' equity      | 0.21%   |\n\n## Third-party assets in Markets Treasury\n\nThird-party assets in Markets Treasury increased by 8% compared with 31 December 2020. The net increase of $57bn is reflective of higher commercial surpluses during the year, with the increase of $115bn in 'Cash and balances at central banks' and decrease of\n\n$52bn in 'Financial investments' being largely attributed to the reduction of investments in high-quality liquid assets driven by the change in outlook for interest rate expectations across many markets, with the resulting cash deployed with central banks.\n\n## Third-party assets in Markets Treasury\n\n|                                    | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and balances at central banks | 379,106   | 263,656   |\n| Trading assets                     | 329       | 392       |\n| Loans and advances:                |           |           |\n| -  to banks                        | 47,363    | 34,555    |\n| -  to customers                    | 371       | 1,167     |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements      | 47,067    | 61,693    |\n| Financial investments              | 338,692   | 391,017   |\n| Other                              | 5,451     | 8,724     |\n| At 31 Dec                          | 818,379   | 761,204   |",

In order to manage interest rate risk, HSBC Holdings uses the projected sensitivity of its NII to future changes in yield curves and the interest rate repricing gap tables.\n\nDuring 2021, HSBC Holdings issued approximately $19.3bn of debt, replacing $5.6bn of maturing or callable debt and generating $13.7bn of net new debt. A total $3.1bn of this new debt was left unhedged and the impact can be observed in the NII sensitivity tables where the 12 months sensitivity increased compared with last year.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nHSBC Holdings' foreign exchange exposures derive almost entirely from the execution of structural foreign exchange hedges on behalf of the Group as its business-as-usual foreign exchange exposures are managed within tight risk limits. At 31 December 2021, HSBC Holdings had forward foreign exchange contracts of\n\n$25.9bn (2020: $11.2bn) to manage the Group's structural foreign exchange exposures.\n\nFor further details of our structural foreign exchange exposures, see page 199.\n\n## Sensitivity of net interest income\n\nHSBC Holdings monitors NII sensitivity over 12-month and fiveyear time horizons, reflecting the longer-term perspective on interest rate risk management appropriate to a financial services holding company. These sensitivities assume that any issuance where HSBC Holdings has an option to reimburse at a future call date is called at this date. The tables below set out the effect on HSBC Holdings' future NII based on the following scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 an immediate shock of 25 basis points ('bps') to the current market-implied path of interest rates across all currencies on 1 January 2022; and\n- \u00b7 an immediate shock of 100bps to the current market-implied path of interest rates across all currencies on 1 January 2022.\n\nThe NII sensitivities shown are indicative and based on simplified scenarios. Immediate interest rate rises of 25bps and 100bps would increase projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2022 by $29m and $113m, respectively. Conversely, falls of 25bps and 100bps would decrease projected NII for the 12 months to 31 December 2022 by $28m and $109m, respectively.\n\nNII sensitivity to an instantaneous change in yield curves (12 months)\n\n|                                                                             | $ $m   | HK$ $m   | \u00a3 $m   | \u20ac $m   | Other $m   | Total $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Change in Jan 2022 to Dec 2022 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2021) |        |          |        |        |            |            |\n| +25bps                                                                      | 16     | -        | 8      | 4      | -          | 29         |\n| -25bps                                                                      | (16)   | -        | (8)    | (4)    | -          | (28)       |\n| +100bps                                                                     | 65     | -        | 31     | 16     | -          | 113        |\n| -100bps                                                                     | (64)   | -        | (31)   | (14)   | -          | (109)      |\n| Change in Jan 2021 to Dec 2021 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2020) |        |          |        |        |            |            |\n| +25bps                                                                      | 13     | -        | 8      | 2      | -          | 23         |\n| -25bps                                                                      | (13)   | -        | (8)    | (3)    | -          | (23)       |\n| +100bps                                                                     | 50     | -        | 33     | 7      | -          | 91         |\n| -100bps                                                                     | (51)   | -        | (32)   | (13)   | -          | (95)       |\n\nNII sensitivity to an instantaneous change in yield curves (5 years)\n\n|                                                                             | Year 1 $m   | Year 2 $m   | Year 3 $m   | Year 4 $m   | Year 5 $m   | Total $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Change in Jan 2022 to Dec 2022 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2021) |             |             |             |             |             |            |\n| +25bps                                                                      | 29          | 44          | 45          | 38          | 28          | 184        |\n| -25bps                                                                      | (28)        | (44)        | (45)        | (38)        | (28)        | (183)      |\n| +100bps                                                                     | 113         | 177         | 180         | 152         | 112         | 733        |\n| -100bps                                                                     | (109)       | (174)       | (174)       | (148)       | (109)       | (715)      |\n| Change in Jan 2021 to Dec 2021 (based on balance sheet at 31 December 2020) |             |             |             |             | -           |            |\n| +25bps                                                                      | 23          | 40          | 43          | 39          | 31          | 176        |\n| -25bps                                                                      | (23)        | (42)        | (46)        | (41)        | (32)        | (184)      |\n| +100bps                                                                     | 91          | 159         | 171         | 156         | 126         | 702        |\n| -100bps                                                                     | (95)        | (169)       | (189)       | (169)       | 139         | (761)      |\n\nThe figures represent hypothetical movements in NII based on our projected yield curve scenarios, HSBC Holdings' current interest rate risk profile and assumed changes to that profile during the next five years.\n\nThe sensitivities represent our assessment of the change to a hypothetical base case based on a static balance sheet assumption, and do not take into account the effect of actions that could be taken to mitigate this interest rate risk.\n\n## Interest rate repricing gap table\n\nThe interest rate risk on the fixed-rate securities issued by HSBC Holdings is not included within the Group VaR, but is managed on a repricing gap basis.

Exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios: trading portfolios and non-trading portfolios\n\n## Market risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nThere were no material changes to our policies and practices for the management of market risk in 2021.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe following diagram summarises the main business areas where trading and non-trading market risks reside, and the market risk\n\nmeasures used to monitor and limit exposures.\n\n| Trading risk \u00b7Foreign exchange and  commodities \u00b7Interest rates \u00b7Credit spreads \u00b7Equities   | Non-trading risk \u00b7 Interest rates 1 \u00b7 Credit spreads \u00b7 Foreign exchange   | Risk types      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| GBM                                                                                         | GBM, Global Treasury,  CMB and WPB                                        | Global business |\n| Value at risk | Sensitivity  | Stress testing                                               | Value at risk | Sensitivity |  Stress testing                             | Risk measure    |\n\n- 1  The interest rate risk on the fixed-rate securities issued by HSBC Holdings is not included in the Group value at risk. The management of this risk is described on page 202.\n\nWhere appropriate, we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and non-trading portfolios. Our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimise return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite.\n\nMarket risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer for HSBC Holdings. These limits are allocated across business lines and to the Group's legal entities. Each major operating entity has an independent market risk management and control sub-function, which is",

Each operating entity is required to assess the market risks arising in its business and to transfer them either to its local Markets and Securities Services or Markets Treasury unit for management, or to separate books managed under the supervision of the local ALCO. The Traded Risk function enforces the controls around trading in permissible instruments approved for each site as well as changes that follow completion of the new product approval process. Traded Risk also restricts trading in the more complex derivative products to offices with appropriate levels of product expertise and robust control systems.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\n## Monitoring and limiting market risk exposures\n\nOur objective is to manage and control market risk exposures while maintaining a market profile consistent with our risk appetite.\n\nWe use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures including sensitivity analysis, VaR and stress testing.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We use sensitivity measures to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type. Granular sensitivity limits are set for trading desks with consideration of market liquidity, customer demand and capital constraints, among other factors.\n\n## Value at risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nVaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use of VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalise them. In addition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk. Where we do not calculate VaR explicitly, we use alternative tools as summarised in the 'Stress testing' section below.\n\nOur models are predominantly based on historical simulation that incorporates the following features:\n\n- \u00b7 historical market rates and prices, which are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, equity prices and the associated volatilities;\n- \u00b7 potential market movements that are calculated with reference to data from the past two years; and\n- \u00b7 calculations to a 99% confidence level and using a one-day holding period.\n\nThe models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures. The nature of the VaR models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in VaR without any changes in the underlying positions.\n\n## VaR model limitations\n\nAlthough a valuable guide to risk, VaR is used with awareness of its limitations. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 The use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future market moves may not encompass all potential market events, particularly those that are extreme in nature.\n- \u00b7 The use of a one-day holding period for risk management purposes of trading and non-trading books assumes that this short period is sufficient to hedge or liquidate all positions.\n- \u00b7 The use of a 99% confidence level by definition does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence.\n- \u00b7 VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not reflect intra-day exposures.\n\n## Risk not in VaR framework\n\nThe risks not in VaR ('RNIV') framework captures and capitalises material market risks that are not adequately covered in the VaR model.\n\nRisk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and are either incorporated directly in the VaR models, where possible, or quantified through either the VaR-based RNIV approach or a stress test approach within the RNIV framework. While VaR-based RNIVs are calculated by using historical scenarios, stress-type RNIVs are estimated on the basis of stress scenarios whose severity is calibrated to be in line with the capital adequacy requirements. The outcome of the VaR-based RNIV approach is included in the overall VaR calculation but excluded from the VaR measure used for regulatory back-testing. In addition, the stressed VaR measure also includes risk factors considered in the VaR-based RNIV approach.\n\nStress-type RNIVs include a deal contingent derivatives capital charge to capture risk for these transactions and a de-peg risk measure to capture risk to pegged and heavily managed currencies.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme, although plausible, events or movements in a set of financial variables. In such scenarios, losses can be much greater than those predicted by VaR modelling.\n\nStress testing is implemented at legal entity, regional and overall Group levels. A set of scenarios is used consistently across all regions within the Group. The risk appetite around potential stress losses for the Group is set and monitored against a referral limit.\n\nMarket risk reverse stress tests are designed to identify vulnerabilities in our portfolios by looking for scenarios that lead to loss levels considered severe for the relevant portfolio. These scenarios may be quite local or idiosyncratic in nature, and complement the systematic top-down stress testing.\n\nStress testing and reverse stress testing provide senior management with insights regarding the 'tail risk' beyond VaR, for which our appetite is limited.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\nTrading portfolios comprise positions held for client servicing and market-making, with the intention of short-term resale and/or to hedge risks resulting from such positions.\n\n## Back-testing\n\nWe routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by backtesting the VaR metric against both actual and hypothetical profit and loss. Hypothetical profit and loss excludes non-modelled items such as fees, commissions and revenue of intra-day transactions. The hypothetical profit and loss reflects the profit and loss that would be realised if positions were held constant from the end of one trading day to the end of the next. This measure of profit and loss does not align with how risk is dynamically hedged, and is not therefore necessarily indicative of the actual performance of the business.\n\nThe number of back-testing exceptions is used to gauge how well the models are performing. We consider enhanced internal monitoring of a VaR model if more than five profit exceptions or more than five loss exceptions occur in a 250-day period.\n\nWe back-test our VaR at set levels of our Group entity hierarchy.\n\n## Market risk in 2021\n\nFinancial markets performed well in 2021. During the first half of the year, the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccination programmes, as well as continued monetary and fiscal support, contributed to a gradual recovery of major economies. Concerns of rising inflationary pressures were mainly interpreted as transitory. While the path of monetary policies remained uncertain, central banks continued to provide liquidity. This supported risk asset valuations, while",

        "page_content": "volatility in most asset classes was subdued. In the second half of 2021, amid the emergence of new Covid-19 variants, global equities reached further record highs, as investors focused on global economic resilience and strong corporate earnings. Bond yields followed a downward trend for most of the third quarter of 2021, before reversing in the final weeks of the year, when markets began pricing in expectations of a faster pace of interest rate rises in some of the major economies, due to persistently elevated inflation. Credit markets remained strong, with credit benchmark indices for investment-grade and high-yield debt close to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWe continued to manage market risk prudently during 2021. Sensitivity exposures and VaR remained within appetite as the business pursued its core market-making activity in support of our customers. Market risk was managed using a complementary set of risk measures and limits, including stress and scenario analysis.\n\n## Value at risk of the trading portfolios\n\nTrading VaR was predominantly generated by the Markets and Securities Services business.\n\nTrading VaR at 31 December 2021 did not change materially compared with 31 December 2020 and it remained within a relatively narrow range for most of 2021. On a consolidated portfolio basis, larger contributions from credit spread risks and foreign exchange risks were offset by:\n\n- \u00b7 gains from exposures to equity risks and interest rate risks; and\n- \u00b7 reduced equity risks captured in the RNIV framework.\n\nOn a stand-alone basis, credit spread risks and interest rate risks from fixed income market-making activities were the main drivers of VaR at the end of 2021, with larger contributions compared with the end of 2020.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\nThe daily levels of total trading VaR during 2021 are set out in the graph below.\n\n## Daily VaR (trading portfolios), 99% 1 day ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group trading VaR for the year is shown in the table below.\n\n## Trading VaR, 99% 1 day 1\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                        |   Foreign exchange and  commodity $m |   Interest rate $m |   Equity $m |   Credit spread $m | Portfolio  diversification 2 $m   |   Total 3 $m |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Balance at 31 Dec 2021 |                                  9.1 |               25.9 |        15.4 |               24.8 | (36.5)                            |         38.8 |\n| Average                |                                 12.9 |               33.8 |        16.7 |               19.2 | (45.5)                            |         37.1 |\n| Maximum                |                                 31.8 |               51.7 |        24.3 |               29.4 |                                   |         53.8 |\n| Minimum                |                                  6.7 |               18.5 |        12.1 |               12.2 |                                   |         27.7 |\n| Balance at 31 Dec 2020 |                                 13.7 |               20.3 |        21.5 |               24.3 | (36.4)                            |         43.4 |\n| Average                |                                 11   |               26.6 |        27.3 |               21.6 | (38.3)                            |         48.1 |\n| Maximum                |                                 25.7 |               43.5 |        42   |               44.1 |                                   |         69.3 |\n| Minimum                |                                  5.6 |               19.1 |        13.6 |               12.6 |                                   |         33.6 |\n\n- 1  Trading portfolios comprise positions arising from the market-making and warehousing of customer-derived positions.\n- 2  Portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types. It represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types - such as interest rate, equity and foreign exchange together in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification. As the maximum and minimum occurs on different days for different risk types, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures.\n- 3  The total VaR is non-additive across risk types due to diversification effects.",

The decrease arose mainly from an increase in the diversification benefit across interest rate and credit exposures. On a stand-alone basis, interest rate VaR increased, mainly due to higher levels of market volatility observed in February 2021, while credit VaR reduced over the year driven by a reduction in credit spread exposure in the portfolio of nontrading financial instruments managed by Markets Treasury.\n\nNon-trading VaR includes the interest rate risk in the banking book transferred to and managed by Markets Treasury and the exposures generated by the portfolio of high-quality liquid assets held by Markets Treasury to meet liquidity requirements.

These assets and liabilities are treated as traded risk for the purposes of market risk management, other than a limited number of exceptions, primarily in Global Banking where the short-term acquisition and disposal of the assets are linked to other non-trading-related activities such as loan origination.\n\n## Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nWe undertake derivative activity for three primary purposes: to create risk management solutions for clients, to manage the portfolio risks arising from client business, and to manage and hedge our own risks. Most of our derivative exposures arise from sales and trading activities within GBM. The assets and liabilities included in trading VaR give rise to a large proportion of the income included in net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis. Adjustments to trading income such as valuation adjustments are not measured by the trading VaR model.\n\nFor information on the accounting policies applied to financial instruments at fair value, see Note 1 on the financial statements\n\n## Resilience risk\n\n## Overview\n\nResilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers, affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption. Resilience risk arises from failures or inadequacies in processes, people, systems or external events.\n\n## Resilience risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nThe Operational and Resilience Risk sub-function provides robust non-financial risk steward oversight of the management of risk by the Group businesses, functions and legal entities. It also provides effective and timely independent challenge. During the year, we carried out a number of initiatives to strengthen the management of non-financial risks:\n\n- \u00b7 We developed a more robust understanding of our risk and control environment, by updating our material risk taxonomy and control libraries, and refreshing material risk and control assessments.\n- \u00b7 We further strengthened our non-financial risk governance and senior leadership.\n- \u00b7 We created a consolidated view of all risk issues across the Group, enabling better senior management focus on nonfinancial risk, and the ability to identify material control issues and intervention as required.\n- \u00b7 We improved how we provide analysis and reporting of nonfinancial risks, with more risk practitioners now having access to a wider range of management information on their risks and controls.\n- \u00b7 We increased the capability of risk stewards to allow for effective stewardship to be in place across the Group.\n- \u00b7 We strengthened our approach in the comparison of issues and near misses by implementing a Group-wide harmonised approach across businesses, functions and regions.\n- \u00b7 We enhanced risk management oversight across our most material change initiatives to support growth in our strategic transformation.\n\nWe prioritise our efforts on material risks and areas undergoing strategic growth, aligning our location strategy to this need. We also remotely provide oversight and stewardship, including support of chief risk officers, in territories where we have no physical presence.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe Operational and Resilience Risk target operating model provides a globally consistent view across resilience risks, strengthening our risk management oversight while operating effectively as part of a simplified non-financial risk structure. We view resilience risk across seven risk types related to: third parties and supply chains; information, technology and cybersecurity; payments and manual processing; physical security; business interruption and contingency risk; building unavailability; and workplace safety.\n\nA principal senior management meeting for operational and resilience risk governance is the Non-Financial Risk Management Board, chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, with an escalation path to the Group Risk Management Meeting.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nOperational resilience is our ability to anticipate, prevent, adapt, respond to, recover and learn from internal or external disruption, protecting customers, the markets we operate in and economic stability. Resilience is determined by assessing whether we are",

We accept we will not be able to prevent all disruption but we prioritise investment to continually improve the response and recovery strategies for our most important business services.\n\n## Business operations continuity\n\nBusiness continuity, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, remains in place across a number of locations where the Group operates, allowing the majority of service level agreements to be maintained. There were no significant impacts to service delivery in locations where the Group operates.\n\n## Regulatory compliance risk\n\n## Overview\n\nRegulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties, inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards. Regulatory compliance risk arises from the failure to observe relevant laws, codes, rules and regulations and can manifest itself in poor market or customer outcomes and lead to fines, penalties and reputational damage to our business.\n\n## Regulatory compliance risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nWe continued to embed the structural changes made in 2020 to our wider approach to compliance risk management. The integration of the Risk and Compliance functions in May 2021 has brought together two complementary functions, which will strengthen the regulatory compliance function's mandate and our capability to drive the right standards with regard to the conduct of our business.\n\nIn June 2021, we also announced our new purpose-led approach to conduct. As part of this, we took the opportunity to align and simplify our approach, making conduct easier to understand and showing how it relates to and helps fulfil our value: 'we take responsibility'.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nFollowing the integration of the Global Risk and Compliance functions, the Group Head of Compliance and the Group Head of Financial Crime - who is also the Group Money Laundering Reporting Officer - each report to the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. They also each attend the Risk and Compliance Executive Committee, the Group RMM and the GRC. The structure of the Compliance function below this level is substantively unchanged and the Group Regulatory Conduct capability and Group Financial Crime capability both continue to work closely with the regional chief compliance officers and their respective teams to help them identify and manage regulatory and financial crime compliance risks across the Group. They also work together to ensure we achieve good conduct outcomes and provide enterprise-wide support on the Compliance risk agenda in collaboration with the Group's Risk function.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nThe Group Regulatory Conduct capability is responsible for setting global policies, standards and risk appetite to guide the Group's management of regulatory compliance risk. It also devises the required frameworks and support processes to protect against regulatory compliance risks. The Group capability provides oversight, review and challenge to the regional chief compliance officers and their teams to help them identify, assess and mitigate regulatory compliance risks, where required. The Group's regulatory compliance risk policies are regularly reviewed. Global policies and procedures require the prompt identification and escalation of any actual or potential regulatory breaches, and relevant reportable events are escalated to the Group RMM and the GRC, as appropriate.\n\n## Conduct of business\n\nOur new, simplified conduct approach, which was launched in 2021, guides us to do the right thing and to recognise the real\n\nimpact we have for our customers and the financial markets in which we operate. It complements our purpose and values, setting outcomes to be achieved for our customers and markets. It recognises cultural and behavioural drivers of good conduct outcomes and applies across all risk disciplines, operational processes and technologies. During 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 We understood and served our customers' ongoing needs, and continued to champion a strong conduct and customer-focused culture. This was demonstrated through the continued provision of support to our customers facing financial difficulties as a result of the prolonged impacts of the pandemic and the resulting uncertainty in trading conditions.\n- \u00b7 We began the integration of climate risk into the Group's risk management approach to recognise the importance of strengthened controls and oversight for our related activities.\n- \u00b7 We operated resiliently and securely to avoid harm to our customers and markets by continuing to embed conduct within our business line processes and through our non-financial and financial risk steward activities.\n- \u00b7 We continued our focus on culture and behaviours as a driver of good conduct outcomes.\n- \u00b7 We placed a particular focus on the importance of well-being and collaborative working as we continued to adapt to changing working practices as the pace of change resulting from the pandemic varied across our markets.\n- \u00b7 We continued to emphasise - and worked to create - an environment in which employees are encouraged and feel safe to speak up.\n- \u00b7 We delivered our latest annual global mandatory training course on conduct to reinforce the importance of conduct for all colleagues.\n\nThe Board continues to maintain oversight of conduct matters through the GRC.\n\nFurther details can be found under the 'Our conduct' section of www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-responsibility.\n\n## Financial crime risk\n\n## Overview\n\nFinancial crime risk is the risk of knowingly or unknowingly helping parties to commit or to further illegal activity through HSBC, including money laundering, fraud, bribery and corruption, tax evasion, sanctions breaches, and terrorist and proliferation financing. Financial crime risk arises from day-to-day banking operations involving customers, third parties and employees.\n\n## Financial crime risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nWe continuously review the effectiveness of our financial crime risk management framework, which includes consideration of the complex and dynamic nature of sanctions risk, notably with respect to the array of new regulations and designations in 2021 and in alignment with our policy, which is to comply with all applicable sanctions regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nWe also continued to make progress with several key financial crime risk management initiatives, including:\n\n- \u00b7 We deployed a key component of our intelligence-led, dynamic risk assessment capabilities for customer account monitoring in the UK, and undertook important enhancements to our traditional transaction monitoring systems globally.\n- \u00b7 We strengthened our anti-fraud capabilities, notably with respect to the early identification of first-party lending fraud and the development of new strategic detection tools.\n- \u00b7 We continued the development of leading-edge surveillance technology and capabilities to identify potential market abuse, including testing machine learning capabilities to detect unauthorised trading.",

The framework aims to enable us to comply with the letter and the spirit of applicable financial crime laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as our own policies, standards, and values relating to financial crime risks.\n\nIn 2021, the Group Risk and Compliance functions were integrated, allowing us to make better use of a broader range of perspectives from other risk disciplines.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nWe will not tolerate knowingly conducting business with individuals or entities believed to be engaged in illicit activity. We require everybody in HSBC to play their role in maintaining effective systems and controls to prevent and detect financial crime. Where we believe we have identified suspected illicit activity or vulnerabilities in our control framework, we will take appropriate mitigating action.\n\nWe continue to assess the effectiveness of our end-to-end financial crime risk management framework on an ongoing basis, and invest in enhancing our operational control capabilities and technology solutions to deter and detect criminal activity. We have simplified our framework by streamlining and de-duplicating policy requirements. We also strengthened our financial crime risk taxonomy and control libraries and our investigative and monitoring capabilities through technology deployments. We developed more targeted metrics, and have also enhanced our governance and reporting.\n\nWe are committed to working in partnership with the wider industry and the public sector in managing financial crime risk, protecting the integrity of the financial system and the communities we serve. We participate in numerous public-private partnerships and information-sharing initiatives around the world. In 2021, the UK, the EU, the US and Singapore, were particularly focused on anti-money laundering ('AML') reforms, to which we provided significant input. We played a key role in the industry responses to a number of consultation papers focused on the overall effectiveness of the global AML framework. We were also active participants in a key pilot undertaken by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which establishes a framework to enable financial institutions to share information with each other when certain financial crime risk concerns have been identified. We took part in a number of roundtables organised by the Financial Action Task Force, supporting its strategic review. We also supported its work on digitisation and beneficial ownership registers. These align with our objectives of promoting a public policy and regulatory environment that embraces the use and harnessing of technology in building a financial crime framework for the future to ensure our organisation is more resilient and secure, while benefiting our customers.\n\n## Skilled Person/Independent Consultant\n\nIn December 2012, HSBC Holdings entered into a number of agreements, including an undertaking with the UK Financial Services Authority (replaced with a Direction issued by the UK Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') in 2013 and again in 2020), as well as a cease-and-desist order with the US Federal Reserve Board ('FRB'), both of which contained certain forward-looking AML and sanctions-related obligations. Over the past several years, HSBC has retained a Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act and an Independent Consultant under the FRB cease-and-desist order to produce\n\nperiodic assessments of the Group's AML and sanctions compliance programme.\n\nThe Skilled Person issued its final report in June 2021, which contained a number of limited recommendations. Following publication of the report, the FCA determined that no further Skilled Person work is required. The Group Risk Committee will continue to retain oversight of matters relating to AML, sanctions, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. Separately, the Independent Consultant carried out its eighth annual review for the FRB and, in November 2021, issued its report, which contained a limited number of recommendations.\n\n## Model risk\n\n## Overview\n\nModel risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed, implemented or used, or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions.\n\nModel risk arises in both financial and non-financial contexts whenever business decision making includes reliance on models.\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nIn 2021, we continued to make improvements in our model risk management processes amid regulatory changes in model requirements.\n\nInitiatives during the year included:\n\n- \u00b7 In response to regulatory capital charges, we redeveloped, validated and submitted to the PRA our models for the internal ratings-based ('IRB') approach for credit risk, internal model method ('IMM') for counterparty credit risk and internal model approach ('IMA') for market risk. These new models have been built to enhanced standards using improved data as a result of investment in processes and systems.\n- \u00b7 We redeveloped and validated models impacted by changes to alternative rate setting mechanisms due to the Ibor transition.\n- \u00b7 We made further enhancements to our control framework for our Sarbanes-Oxley models to address the control weaknesses that emerged as a result of significant increases in adjustments and overlays that were applied to compensate for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on models. We also introduced a requirement for the model risk stewards to approve material models prior to use.\n- \u00b7 Our businesses and functions were more involved in the development and management of models, and hiring colleagues who had strong model risk skills. They also put an enhanced focus on key model risk drivers such as data quality and model methodology.\n- \u00b7 Our model owners in businesses and functions fully embedded the requirements included in the model risk policy and standards introduced in 2020.\n- \u00b7 We delivered a suite of training on model risk to front-line teams to improve their awareness of model risk and their adherence to the governance framework.\n- \u00b7 We rolled out new model risk appetite measures, which are more forward looking and will help our businesses and functions manage model risk more effectively.\n- \u00b7 We continued the transformation of the Model Risk Management team, with changes to the model validation processes, including new systems and processes. Key senior hires were made during the year to lead the business areas and regions to strengthen oversight and expertise within the function. We also made changes to the model inventory system to provide businesses and functions with improved functionality and more detailed information related to model risk.\n- \u00b7 We initiated a programme of development related to climate risk and models using advanced analytics and machine learning, which have become critical areas of focus that will",

We also added qualified specialist skills to the model risk teams to manage the increased model risk in these areas.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\nThe new governance structure implemented in 2020 is fully operational. Model Risk Governance committees at the Group, business and functional levels provide oversight of model risk. The committees include senior leaders from the three global businesses and the Global Risk and Compliance function, and focus on model-related concerns and are supported by key model risk metrics. The Group-level Model Risk Committee is chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and the heads of key businesses participate in those meetings.\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\nWe use a variety of modelling approaches, including regression, simulation, sampling, machine learning and judgemental scorecards for a range of business applications. These activities include customer selection, product pricing, financial crime transaction monitoring, creditworthiness evaluation and financial reporting. Global responsibility for managing model risk is delegated from the RMM to the Group Model Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer. This committee regularly reviews our model risk management policies and procedures, and requires the first line of defence to demonstrate comprehensive and effective controls based on a library of model risk controls provided by Model Risk Management.\n\nModel Risk Management also reports on model risk to senior management on a regular basis through the use of the risk map, risk appetite metrics and top and emerging risks.\n\nWe regularly review the effectiveness of these processes, including the model oversight committee structure, to help ensure appropriate understanding and ownership of model risk is embedded in the businesses and functions.\n\n## Insurance manufacturing operations risk\n\n| Overview                                           |   Page 210 |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Insurance manufacturing operations risk management |        210 |\n| Insurance manufacturing operations risk in 2021    |        212 |\n| Measurement                                        |        212 |\n| Key risk types                                     |        214 |\n| -  Market risk                                     |        214 |\n| -  Credit risk                                     |        215 |\n| -  Liquidity risk                                  |        215 |\n| -  Insurance underwriting risk                     |        216 |\n\n## Overview\n\nThe key risks for our insurance manufacturing operations are market risks, in particular interest rate and equity, credit risks and insurance underwriting and operational risks. These have a direct impact on the financial results and capital positions of the insurance operations. Liquidity risk, while significant in other parts of the Group, is relatively minor for our insurance operations.\n\n## HSBC's insurance business\n\nWe sell insurance products worldwide through a range of channels including our branches, direct channels and third-party distributors. The majority of sales are through an integrated bancassurance model that provides insurance products principally for customers with whom we have a banking relationship.\n\nThe insurance contracts we sell relate to the underlying needs of our customers, which we can identify from our point-of-sale contacts and customer knowledge. For the products we manufacture, the majority of sales are savings, universal life and protection contracts.\n\nWe choose to manufacture these insurance products in HSBC subsidiaries based on an assessment of operational scale and risk appetite. Manufacturing insurance allows us to retain the risks and rewards associated with writing insurance contracts by keeping\n\npart of the underwriting profit and investment income within the Group.\n\nWe have life insurance manufacturing subsidiaries in eight markets, which are Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China, France, the UK, Malta, Mexico and Argentina. We also have a life insurance manufacturing associate in India.\n\nWhere we do not have the risk appetite or operational scale to be an effective insurance manufacturer, we engage with a small number of leading external insurance companies in order to provide insurance products to our customers through our banking network and direct channels. These arrangements are generally structured with our exclusive strategic partners and earn the Group a combination of commissions, fees and a share of profits. We distribute insurance products in all of our geographical regions.\n\nThis section focuses only on the risks relating to the insurance products we manufacture.\n\n## Insurance manufacturing operations risk management\n\n## Key developments in 2021\n\nThe insurance manufacturing subsidiaries follow the Group's risk management framework. In addition, there are specific policies and practices relating to the risk management of insurance contracts. There were no material changes to the policies and practices over 2021, although enhancements were made to the product pricing and profitability framework to allow for the transition to IFRS 17.\n\n## Governance and structure\n\n## (Audited)\n\nInsurance manufacturing risks are managed to a defined risk appetite, which is aligned to the Group's risk appetite and risk management framework, including its three lines of defence model. For details of the Group's governance framework, see page 122. The Global Insurance Risk Management Meeting oversees the control framework globally and is accountable to the WPB Risk Management Meeting on risk matters relating to the insurance business.\n\nThe monitoring of the risks within our insurance operations is carried out by Insurance Risk teams. The Group's risk stewardship functions support the Insurance Risk teams in their respective areas of expertise.\n\n## Stress and scenario testing\n\n(Audited)\n\nStress testing forms a key part of the risk management framework for the insurance business. We participate in local and Group-wide regulatory stress tests, as well as internally developed stress and scenario tests, including Group internal stress test exercises.\n\nThe results of these stress tests and the adequacy of management action plans to mitigate these risks are considered in the Group's ICAAP and the entities' regulatory Own Risk and Solvency Assessments ('ORSAs').\n\n## Key risk management processes\n\n## Market risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nAll our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries have market risk mandates and limits that specify the investment instruments in which they are permitted to invest and the maximum quantum of market risk that they may retain. They manage market risk by using, among others, some or all of the techniques listed below, depending on the nature of the contracts written:\n\n- \u00b7 We are able to adjust bonus rates to manage the liabilities to policyholders for products with discretionary participating features ('DPF'). The effect is that a significant portion of the market risk is borne by the policyholder.\n- \u00b7 We use asset and liability matching where asset portfolios are structured to support projected liability cash flows.

We use models to assess the effect of a range of future scenarios on the values of financial assets and associated liabilities, and ALCOs employ the outcomes in determining how best to structure asset holdings to support liabilities.\n\n- \u00b7 We use derivatives to protect against adverse market movements.\n- \u00b7 We design new products to mitigate market risk, such as changing the investment return sharing portion between policyholders and the shareholder.\n- \u00b7 We exit, to the extent possible, investment portfolios whose risk is considered unacceptable.\n\n## Credit risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nOur insurance manufacturing subsidiaries also have credit risk mandates and limits within which they are permitted to operate, which consider the credit risk exposure, quality and performance of their investment portfolios. Our assessment of the creditworthiness of issuers and counterparties is based primarily upon internationally recognised credit ratings and other publicly available information.\n\nStress testing is performed on investment credit exposures using credit spread sensitivities and default probabilities.\n\nWe use a number of tools to manage and monitor credit risk. These include a credit report containing a watch-list of investments with current credit concerns, primarily investments that may be at risk of future impairment or where high concentrations to counterparties are present in the investment portfolio. Sensitivities to credit spread risk are assessed and monitored regularly.\n\n## Capital and liquidity risk\n\n## (Audited)\n\nCapital risk for our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries is assessed in the Group's ICAAP based on their financial capacity to support the risks to which they are exposed. Capital adequacy is\n\nassessed on both the Group's economic capital basis, and the relevant local insurance regulatory basis. The Group's economic capital basis is largely aligned to European Solvency II regulations, other than in Hong Kong where this is based on the emerging Hong Kong risk based capital regulations.\n\nRisk appetite buffers are set to ensure that the operations are able to remain solvent on both bases, allowing for business-as-usual volatility and extreme but plausible stress events.\n\nLiquidity risk is managed by cash flow matching and maintaining sufficient cash resources, investing in high credit-quality investments with deep and liquid markets, monitoring investment concentrations and restricting them where appropriate, and establishing committed contingency borrowing facilities.\n\nInsurance manufacturing subsidiaries complete quarterly liquidity risk reports and an annual review of the liquidity risks to which they are exposed.\n\n## Insurance underwriting risk\n\nOur insurance manufacturing subsidiaries primarily use the following frameworks and processes to manage and mitigate insurance underwriting risks:\n\n- \u00b7 a formal approval process for launching new products or making changes to products;\n- \u00b7 a product pricing and profitability framework, which requires initial and ongoing assessment of the adequacy of premiums charged on new insurance contracts to meet the risks associated with them;\n- \u00b7 a framework for customer underwriting;\n- \u00b7 reinsurance, which cedes risks above our appetite thresholds to a third-party reinsurer thereby limiting our exposure; and\n- \u00b7 oversight of expense and reserve risks by entity Actuarial Control Committees.",

Market factors include interest rates, equity and growth assets and foreign exchange rates.\n\nOur exposure varies depending on the type of contract issued. Our most significant life insurance products are contracts with discretionary participating features ('DPF'). These products typically include some form of capital guarantee or guaranteed return on the sums invested by the policyholders, to which discretionary bonuses are added if allowed by the overall performance of the funds. These funds are primarily invested in fixed interest, with a proportion allocated to other asset classes to provide customers with the potential for enhanced returns.\n\nDPF products expose HSBC to the risk of variation in asset returns, which will impact our participation in the investment performance.\n\n## Financial return guarantees\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                       | 2021                                        | 2021                                                       | 2021                   | 2020                                        | 2020                                                      | 2020                   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                       | Investment  returns implied  by guarantee % | Long-term   investment  returns on  relevant  portfolios % | Cost of  guarantees $m | Investment  returns implied  by guarantee % | Long-term  investment  returns on  relevant  portfolios % | Cost of  guarantees $m |\n| Capital               | 0.0                                         | 0.7-3.2                                                    | 220                    | 0.0                                         | 0.7-3.2                                                   | 277                    |\n| Nominal annual return | 0.1-1.9                                     | 2.3-3.6                                                    | 423                    | 0.1-1.9                                     | 2.3-3.6                                                   | 515                    |\n| Nominal annual return | 2.0-3.9                                     | 2.0-4.5                                                    | 183                    | 2.0-3.9                                     | 2.0-4.5                                                   | 180                    |\n| Nominal annual return | 4.0-5.0                                     | 2.0-4.2                                                    | 112                    | 4.0-5.0                                     | 2.0-4.2                                                   | 133                    |\n| At 31 Dec             |                                             |                                                            | 938                    |                                             |                                                           | 1,105                  |\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nChanges in financial market factors, from the economic assumptions in place at the start of the year, had a positive impact on reported profit before tax of $516m (2020: $102m). The following table illustrates the effects of selected interest rate, equity price and foreign exchange rate scenarios on our profit for the year and the total equity of our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries.\n\nWhere appropriate, the effects of the sensitivity tests on profit after tax and equity incorporate the impact of the stress on the PVIF.\n\nDue in part to the impact of the cost of guarantees and hedging strategies, which may be in place, the relationship between the\n\nprofit and total equity and the risk factors is non-linear, particularly in a low interest-rate environment. Therefore, the results disclosed should not be extrapolated to measure sensitivities to different levels of stress. For the same reason, the impact of the stress is not necessarily symmetrical on the upside and downside. The sensitivities are stated before allowance for management actions, which may mitigate the effect of changes in the market environment. The sensitivities presented allow for adverse changes in policyholder behaviour that may arise in response to changes in market rates. The differences between the impacts on profit after tax and equity are driven by the changes in value of the bonds measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, which are only accounted for in equity.\n\n## Sensitivity of HSBC's insurance manufacturing subsidiaries to market risk factors\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                                      | 2021                          | 2021                      | 2020                           | 2020                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                      | Effect on profit after tax $m | Effect on total equity $m | Effect on  profit after tax $m | Effect on total equity $m |\n| +100 basis point parallel shift in yield curves                      | (2)                           | (142)                     | (67)                           | (188)                     |\n| -100 basis point parallel shift in yield curves                      | (154)                         | (9)                       | (68)                           | 58                        |\n| 10% increase in equity prices                                        | 369                           | 369                       | 332                            | 332                       |\n| 10% decrease in equity prices                                        | (377)                         | (377)                     | (338)                          | (338)                     |\n| 10% increase in US dollar exchange rate compared with all currencies | 80                            | 80                        | 84                             | 84                        |\n| 10% decrease in US dollar exchange rate compared with all currencies | (80)                          | (80)                      | (84)                           | (84)                      |\n\nIn addition, in some scenarios the asset returns can become insufficient to cover the policyholders' financial guarantees, in which case the shortfall has to be met by HSBC. Amounts are held against the cost of such guarantees, calculated by stochastic modelling.\n\nThe cost of such guarantees is accounted for as a deduction from the present value of in-force ('PVIF') asset, unless the cost of such guarantees is already explicitly allowed for within the insurance contract liabilities.\n\nThe following table shows the total reserve held for the cost of guarantees, the range of investment returns on assets supporting these products and the implied investment return that would enable the business to meet the guarantees.\n\nThe cost of guarantees decreased to $938m (2020: $1,105m) primarily due to the increase in swap rates and positive equity performance in France and Hong Kong.\n\nFor unit-linked contracts, market risk is substantially borne by the policyholder, but some market risk exposure typically remains, as fees earned are related to the market value of the linked assets.",

It arises in two main areas for our insurance manufacturers:\n\n- \u00b7 risk associated with credit spread volatility and default by debt security counterparties after investing premiums to generate a return for policyholders and shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 risk of default by reinsurance counterparties and nonreimbursement for claims made after ceding insurance risk.\n\nThe amounts outstanding at the balance sheet date in respect of these items are shown in the table on page 212.\n\nThe credit quality of the reinsurers' share of liabilities under insurance contracts is assessed as 'satisfactory' or higher (as defined on page 138), with 100% of the exposure being neither past due nor impaired (2020: 100%).\n\nCredit risk on assets supporting unit-linked liabilities is predominantly borne by the policyholder. Therefore, our exposure is primarily related to liabilities under non-linked insurance and investment contracts and shareholders' funds. The credit quality of insurance financial assets is included in the table on page 155.

The liquidity risk exposure is wholly borne by the policyholder in the case of unitlinked business and is shared with the policyholder for non-linked insurance.\n\nThe profile of the expected maturity of insurance contracts at 31 December 2021 remained comparable with 2020. The remaining contractual maturity of investment contract liabilities is included in Note 29 on page 373.",

These parameters include mortality, morbidity, longevity, lapse and expense rates.\n\nThe principal risk we face is that, over time, the cost of the contract, including claims and benefits, may exceed the total amount of premiums and investment income received.\n\nThe tables on pages 212 and 213 analyse our life insurance risk exposures by type of contract and by geographical region.\n\nThe insurance risk profile and related exposures remain largely consistent with those observed at 31 December 2020.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\n## (Audited)\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of profit and total equity to reasonably possible changes in non-economic assumptions across all our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\n(Audited)\n\n|                                                                                                 | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Effect on profit after tax and total equity at 31 Dec                                           |           |           |\n| Effect on profit after tax and total equity at 10% increase in mortality and/or morbidity rates | (112)     | (93)      |\n| Effect on profit after tax and total equity at 10% decrease in mortality and/or morbidity rates | 115       | 98        |\n| Effect on profit after tax and total equity at 10% increase in lapse rates                      | (115)     | (111)     |\n| Effect on profit after tax and total equity at 10% decrease in lapse rates                      | 129       | 128       |\n| Effect on profit after tax and total equity at 10% increase in expense rates                    | (108)     | (117)     |\n| Effect on profit after tax and total equity at 10% decrease in expense rates                    | 107       | 115       |\n\nMortality and morbidity risk is typically associated with life insurance contracts. The effect on profit of an increase in mortality or morbidity depends on the type of business being written.\n\nSensitivity to lapse rates depends on the type of contracts being written. For a portfolio of term assurance, an increase in lapse rates typically has a negative effect on profit due to the loss of future income on the lapsed policies. However, some contract lapses have a positive effect on profit due to the existence of policy surrender charges. We are most sensitive to a change in lapse rates on unit-linked and universal life contracts.\n\nExpense rate risk is the exposure to a change in the allocated cost of administering insurance contracts. To the extent that increased expenses cannot be passed on to policyholders, an increase in expense rates will have a negative effect on our profits. This risk is generally greatest for our smaller entities.",

Despite promising developments in relation to the e/fficacy of vaccines in combating the virus, there remained significant restrictions across our markets. It was therefore important that our governance framework and practices remained flexible to ensure that the Board could e/ffectively discharge its duties.\n\nWhile the Board and its committees have operated well in a virtual environment, it was unfortunate that we were again unable to come together physically as a Board. It has been two years since the full Board was last together in person for a Board meeting, with five new Directors appointed in that time. I/uni00A0hope to hold in-person meetings as soon as it/uni00A0is safe to do so, particularly in our largest markets of Hong Kong and the UK.\n\nWe continued our focus on enhancing our governance practices throughout the year, with key decisions and areas of focus set out in further detail below.\n\n## Board changes\n\nA key aspect of my role as Group Chairman is/uni00A0ensuring that collectively the Board has the skills, knowledge and experience it requires. The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee retained a keen focus on succession planning during the year. For further details on its work, see page 237. We are currently in the process of completing a search for new non-executive Directors to join our Board, with knowledge and experience of banking and Asia a priority. The Committee is actively progressing this search and will provide an update in due course.\n\nThere were a number of changes to the Board during 2021, with Laura Cha, Heidi Miller and Henri de Castries retiring following our 2021 Annual General Meeting ('AGM') in May, and Rachel Duan and Dame Carolyn Fairbairn appointed with e/ffect from 1 September.\n\nWe also recently announced that, in line with our succession planning and having each served on the Board for six years, Irene Lee and Pauline van der Meer Mohr would step down from the Board at the conclusion of our 2022 AGM in April. Irene's existing roles on our subsidiary boards in Asia are not impacted by her retirement from the Holdings Board. On behalf of the Board, I wish to thank Irene and Pauline for their outstanding dedication and the enormous contributions they have made to/uni00A0the success of HSBC during their time on the Board. We wish them both well in their future endeavours.\n\n## Purpose, strategy and values\n\nFollowing the launch of the Group's refreshed purpose, strategy and values in March, we introduced a 'culture moment' at the beginning of each Board meeting. These discussions have allowed Board members to share their insights on the culture of the Group, and have raised awareness of employee and stakeholder perspectives in the Boardroom. This has supported the Board in helping to create greater alignment between culture and strategy, and in driving a tone from the top focused on the Group's purpose of opening up/uni00A0a world of opportunity.\n\n## Technology governance\n\nDigitise at scale is one of our four strategic pillars and reflects the increasingly important role that technology plays in delivering for our customers. It is therefore critical that our governance helps enable the Board to e/ffectively shape and oversee progress against our technology strategy. As such, we took the decision to establish the Technology Governance Working Group at the beginning of 2021 to determine the most e/ffective approach for the Board to discharge its responsibilities in relation to technology strategy and oversight.\n\nThe Co-Chairs of the Technology Governance Working Group presented to the Board in January 2022 on their work during 2021. In light of the significant role that technology will continue to play in the Group's strategy, it was recommended that the Technology Governance Working Group continues to meet throughout 2022. The Board agreed to continue with the Technology Governance Working Group in its current format through",

        "page_content": "2022, but with the scope extended to include a focus on business execution of the technology strategy. This will allow for a better understanding of the progress, challenges involved in implementing the strategy and the impact on key stakeholders.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance\n\nThe Board recognises the growing importance of ESG and oversees the ESG agenda. It was a significant year for the Group in its e/fforts to support the transition to net zero - a key pillar of our overall Group strategy - with the passing of our climate resolution at our 2021 AGM and the publication of our thermal coal phase-out policy, being two of the most notable achievements. Given its significance, the Board has decided to retain responsibility for development and oversight of our ESG strategy directly, rather than establishing a specific Board-level committee and we will include a dedicated item on our agenda for ESG matters. Within their existing responsibilities, the Group Risk Committee, Group Audit Committee and Group Remuneration Committee will also continue to have specific roles to play in overseeing and supporting the delivery of our ESG objectives.\n\nAt the management level, we have asked our team to further enhance ESG governance, with the introduction of an ESG Committee, co-chaired by our Group Chief Sustainability O/fficer, Celine Herweijer, and our Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance O/fficer, Aileen Taylor. This committee will regularly report to the Board on progress against our ESG ambitions, climate strategy and related commitments. In February 2022, the Board also approved the proposal to develop and implement a sustainability target operating model for the Group. The new operating model will help ensure that our businesses have the technical expertise, specialist resources and training to equip and support them in assisting our clients in their transition to net zero.\n\nFor further information on our climate ambition and progress against our transition to/uni00A0net zero strategic pillar, see page 45.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nWe again conducted a review of the e/ffectiveness of the Board and Board committees, which helps to support the continuous improvement of the operation of our key governance practices. Following two successive externally facilitated evaluations, we took the decision that the 2021 evaluations should be facilitated internally. The process was led by our Group\n\nCompany Secretary and Chief Governance O/fficer and involved the completion of online surveys tailored for each Board and committee, complemented by individual interviews with Directors and attendees.\n\nFurther details on the progress made against the 2020 findings, as well as the findings and recommendations from the 2021 review, can be found on page 235 and in each of the respective committee reports on pages 237/uni00A0to/uni00A0267.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nSubsidiary governance remained a key priority, as it has been since my appointment as Group Chairman, and we continued to build strong connectivity with our principal subsidiaries. In/uni00A02021, we sought to enhance the standard and consistency of governance across the Group, with the launch of our refreshed subsidiary accountability framework. The refreshed framework makes clear the Group's expectations of subsidiaries in relation to their/uni00A0governance approach and board practices through overarching principles and/uni00A0detailed provisions.\n\nA key aspect of the framework is focused on the composition of our subsidiary boards, with our most significant subsidiaries required to submit their succession plans to the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee through the course of the year. This provided clarity on plans to refresh and enhance the calibre and diversity of boards across the Group. Further details are set out in the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee report on page 237.\n\nGiven the continued uncertainty externally, we looked to strengthen the connectivity between the Group and principal subsidiaries during the year through virtual forums held between the Board and committee chairs and our counterparts at subsidiary level. We further supplemented this connectivity with the introduction of a virtual Non-Executive Director Summit, which saw all subsidiary non-executive directors invited to come together to discuss areas of common interest. This was a valuable opportunity to share and discuss material topics, including strategy, risk, data, culture, diversity, climate and technology. Following the success of the summit, we have taken the decision to make these sessions a part of our annual governance calendar.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nVarious opportunities for members of the\n\nBoard to engage with employees have been provided during 2021, including through partnerships with our employee resource groups and sessions with members of our global graduate programme. The Board greatly values the opportunity to engage with employees from across the business and markets, and of di/fferent backgrounds and seniority. We will continue to prioritise this, along with interaction with all our key stakeholders, during 2022.\n\nFor further details on the arrangements we have in place to facilitate workforce engagement, see page 233.\n\n## 2021 Annual General Meeting\n\nThe pandemic has continued to pose many challenges for the Group, as it does for many of our stakeholders. However, the Group has benefited significantly from the speed at which digital tools have been adopted since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThis has also been true of our AGM, where I/uni00A0was delighted to host our first hybrid AGM, which enabled shareholders globally to attend virtually, or in person. The use of technology enabled a broader range of shareholders to attend and participate than had been the case/uni00A0pre-pandemic.\n\nFurther details of our plans for the 2022 AGM, which will be a hybrid meeting again, will be provided when our Notice of AGM is published on 25 March 2022.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nDespite the concerns of the Covid-19 pandemic, I am hopeful that the success of vaccine roll-out will allow us to safely resume in-person engagement with each other and all stakeholders in the near future.\n\nOn behalf of myself and the Board, many thanks for your continued commitment and/uni00A0support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mark E Tucker\n\nGroup Chairman\n\n22 February 2022",

        "page_content": "## How we are governed\n\nWe are committed to high standards of corporate governance. The Group has a comprehensive range of policies and procedures in place designed to help ensure that it is well managed, with effective oversight and controls. We comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the applicable requirements of the Hong Kong Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Board's role, Directors' responsibilities and meeting attendance\n\nThe Board, led by the Group Chairman, is responsible among other matters for:\n\n- \u00b7 promoting the Group's long-term success and delivering sustainable value to shareholders;\n- \u00b7 establishing and approving the Group's strategy and objectives, and monitoring the alignment of the Group's purpose, strategy and values with the desired culture;\n- \u00b7 setting the Group's risk appetite and monitoring the Group's risk profile;\n- \u00b7 approving and monitoring capital and operating plans for achieving strategic objectives;\n- \u00b7 approving material transactions;\n- \u00b7 approving the appointment of Directors, including Board roles; and\n- \u00b7 reviewing the Group's overall corporate governance arrangements.\n\nThe Board's terms of reference are available on our website at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership-and-governance/boardresponsibilities. The Board's powers are subject to relevant laws, regulations and HSBC's articles of association.\n\nThe role of the independent non-executive Directors is to support the development of proposals on strategy, hold management to account and ensure the executive Directors are discharging their responsibilities properly, while creating the right culture to encourage constructive challenge. Further details on the independence of the Board and the value independence brings can be found in the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee report. Non-executive Directors also review the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives. The Group Chairman meets with the non-executive Directors without the executive Directors in attendance after Board meetings and otherwise, as necessary.\n\nThe roles of Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive are separate. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board by the Group Chairman, and the executive responsibility for day-to-day management of HSBC's business, which is undertaken by the Group Chief Executive.\n\nThe majority of Board members are independent non-executive Directors. At 31 December 2021, the Board comprised the Group Chairman, 10 non-executive Directors, and two executive Directors who are the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer. Two non-executive Directors will not stand for re-election at the AGM in April 2022.\n\nFor further details of the Board's career background, skills, experience and external appointments, see pages 220 to 223.\n\n## Operation of the Board\n\nThe Board is ordinarily scheduled to meet at least seven times a year. In 2021, the Board held 12 meetings. For further details on attendance at those meetings, see page 228. The Board agenda is agreed by the Group Chairman, working with both the Group Chief Executive and the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. For more information, see 'Board activities during 2021' on page 232.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the Group Chief Legal Officer and the non-executive Chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited are all regular attendees at\n\nBoard meetings. Other senior executives attend Board meetings as required.\n\nIn addition to formal Board meetings, the Board Oversight SubGroup, established by the Group Chairman in 2020, meets in advance of each Board meeting. Such meetings are an informal mechanism for a smaller group of Board members and management to discuss emerging issues and upcoming Board matters. Standing attendees comprise the Group Chairman, the Chair of the Group Audit Committee (who is also the Senior Independent Director), the Chair of the Group Risk Committee, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, and the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. Other non-executive Directors and management are invited on a rotational basis, depending on the subject to be discussed. The forum is not decision making but provides regular opportunities for Board members to communicate with senior management to deepen their understanding of, and provide input into, key issues facing the Group. For further details on how the Board engages with the wider workforce, see page 233.\n\n## Board governance enhancements due to Covid-19\n\nThe Board continued many of the governance changes introduced in 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, including meeting online during 2021. The Board was kept informed of the continuing challenges and priorities of the management team as part of the formal executive reporting received at these meetings. The following practices continued:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Chairman prepared a weekly Board update note.\n- \u00b7 The Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer produced a weekly Board report on risk matters, including in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as market highlights, industry events and results.\n- \u00b7 Immunologists and pandemic experts updated the Board on emerging issues.\n- \u00b7 The Group Chairman's Forum was held monthly. It was attended by Board committee chairs, as well as chairs of principal subsidiaries.\n\n## Technology governance\n\nA Technology Governance Working Group was established in 2021, initially for a period of 12 months, to provide recommendations to enhance the Board's oversight of technology strategy, governance and emerging risks, and to enhance connectivity with the principal subsidiaries. Given their industry expertise and experience, the working group is jointly chaired by Eileen Murray and Steven Guggenheimer. Its members include Group Risk Committee chair Jackson Tai and other non-executive Directors representing each of our US, UK, European and Asian principal subsidiaries. Key technology and business stakeholders have attended the working group to provide insights on technology and information security issues across the Group. The working group has met formally eight times since its inception, and has held additional ad hoc sessions on priority strategic topics including data and cybersecurity. The Technology Governance Working Group's recommendations were presented to the Board in January 2022 when it was decided that the working group will remain an informal committee of the Board. For further details on the future of the working group, see the Group Chairman's governance statement on page 218.",

The Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer attended over 30 meetings with investors in 2021.

        "page_content": "## Board induction and training\n\nThe Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer works with the Group Chairman to oversee appropriate induction and ongoing training programmes for the Board. On appointment, new Board members are provided with tailored and comprehensive induction programmes to fit with their individual experiences and needs, including the process for dealing with conflicts.\n\nThe induction programme is delivered through formal briefings and introductory sessions with Board members, senior management, legal counsel, auditors, tax advisers and regulators, as appropriate. Topics covered include, but are not limited to: purpose and values; culture and leadership; governance and stakeholder management; Directors' legal and regulatory duties; recovery and resolution risk; anti-money laundering and antibribery; technical and business briefings; and strategy.\n\nAn early focus on induction allows a new Board member to contribute meaningfully from appointment. The structure of the induction supports good information flows within the Board and its committees, as well as between senior management and nonexecutive Directors, providing a clear understanding of our culture and way of operating.\n\nDuring 2021 we welcomed two new non-executive Directors, Rachel Duan and Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, to our Board. We gave careful consideration to creating relevant and bespoke induction programmes for each of the new non-executive Directors, particularly given their differing geographical locations and the continuing Covid-19-related challenges for meetings in person. For illustrations of the typical induction modules, see the 'Directors' induction and ongoing development in 2021' table on the following page.\n\nNon-executive Directors continued to engage with each other through virtual meetings amid continuing Covid-19-related travel restrictions. We continue to plan and look forward to opportunities to facilitate safe and comprehensive person-to-person engagement, both in and out of Board meetings. These opportunities provide invaluable insight and understanding of our business, customers, culture and people.\n\nDirectors undertook routine training during 2021. They also participated in 'deep dive' sessions into specific areas of the Group's strategic priorities, risk appetite and approach to managing certain risks. These training sessions included external consultants who provided insights into geopolitical matters, macroeconomics and investor sentiments. Other topics of focus included: operations and technology strategy; the resolvability assessment framework; and climate change and sustainability.\n\nNon-executive Directors also discussed individual development areas with the Group Chairman during performance reviews and in conversations with the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. The Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer makes appropriate arrangements for any additional training needs identified using internal resources, or otherwise, at HSBC's expense.\n\nMembers of Board committees receive relevant training as appropriate. Directors may take independent professional advice at HSBC's expense.\n\nBoard Directors who serve on principal subsidiary boards also receive training relevant to those boards. Opportunities exist for the principal subsidiary and principal subsidiary committee chairs to share their understanding in specific areas with the Board Directors. During 2021, the Group Chairman hosted a NonExecutive Director Summit where 200 independent non-executive directors from the Group's subsidiaries attended a virtual session along with Board Directors. They received updates and training on Group-wide matters including climate change, technology, culture and the launch of the newly developed Non-Executive Director Handbook. Following its success, further Non-Executive Director Summits will take place during 2022.\n\n## Q&A with Rachel Duan\n\nQ: What is your impression and experience of the onboarding process for HSBC?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrom the very start of the process I was impressed at the level of attention given to my induction programme. Care was taken to tailor my meetings and the information provided so that it was relevant for me and thereby ensured a smooth, efficient and thoughtful process.\n\n## Q: How have you managed to get insight into the wider Group governance?\n\nBefore my joining date I was afforded many opportunities to meet colleagues, both virtually and physically. Shortly after joining, I visited our Hong Kong office to meet, among others, Peter Wong, nonexecutive chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited. This gave me the chance to gain insight into governance matters in Asia. In July 2021, I was invited to attend the Non-Executive Director Summit, which was a great introduction into the Group's and its subsidiaries' governance matters. These engagements highlighted key areas of focus for HSBC and provided clear insight into the Group's way of working.\n\n## Q: How prepared did you feel for the first Board meeting in September?\n\nMy tailored engagements and bespoke briefings started shortly after the announcement of my intention to join the HSBC Board in March, all of which helped me get my arms around this complex organisation and made me feel included and ready to execute my role in the boardroom with ease.\n\n## Q&A with Dame Carolyn Fairbairn\n\nQ: How have you got an understanding of the Board's focus on culture?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe culture at HSBC is thoughtful and inclusive. I could see from the carefully planned induction meetings which were arranged well ahead of my joining. I have been introduced to two  employee resource groups: Ability, the disability and mental health network, and Embrace, an ethnicity network, and value the opportunity to support them. Also, the Board opens every meeting with a 'culture moment', which really demonstrates how it connects closely with the corporate values, and openly expresses how these are observed.\n\n- Q: What has been your experience of preparing for membership of the Group Remuneration Committee and the Group Risk Committee?\n\nBefore I joined, I engaged closely with the committees' chairs, as well as senior management, to understand their priorities, including a new remuneration policy for the 2022 AGM and the climate agenda. I remain actively engaged with the members to ensure a smooth transition onto these committees.\n\n## Q: Did your attendance at the 2021 AGM give you a better understanding of the Group's business?\n\nAttending the 2021 AGM, ahead of my official appointment to the Board, enabled me to witness HSBC's first hybrid meeting with shareholders. I was pleased to see that the company's planning enabled as many shareholders as possible to participate in this annual event, despite the persistent Covid-19 pandemic challenges, demonstrating HSBC's inclusive culture. The questions from shareholders were insightful and gave me a good sense of what was top of investors' minds and how the company was responding to such concerns, particularly on the climate agenda.",

Topics covered included, but were not limited to: purpose and values; culture and leadership; governance and stakeholder management; Directors' legal and regulatory duties; recovery and resolution risk; anti-money laundering and anti-bribery; technical and business briefings; and strategy.\n- 2  Directors participated in business strategy, market development and business briefings, which are global, regional and/or market-specific. Examples of specific sessions held in 2021 included: 'US strategy: restructuring of the operating model' and 'Climate change: becoming net zero by 2050'.\n- 3  Directors received risk and control training. Examples of specific sessions held in 2021 included: 'Stress testing' and 'ICAAP/ILAAP'.\n- 4  All Directors received training on topics such as: 'Resolvability assessment framework', 'Climate and sustainable finance' and 'IFRS 17'.\n- 5  Global mandatory training, issued to all Directors, mirrored training undertaken by all employees, including senior management. This included: management of risk under the enterprise risk management framework, with a focus on operational risk; cybersecurity risk; health, safety and wellbeing; data privacy and the protection of data of our customers and colleagues; combating financial crime, including understanding money laundering, sanctions, fraud and bribery and corruption risks; and our values and conduct, including workplace harassment and speaking up.\n- 6  Chairman's Forum, Remuneration Committee Chairs' Forum and the Non-Executive Director Summit.\n\n## Board committees and working groups\n\nThe Board delegates oversight of certain audit, risk, remuneration, nomination and governance matters to its committees. Each standing Board committee is chaired by a non-executive Board member and has a remit to cover specific topics in accordance with their respective terms of reference. Only independent nonexecutive Directors are members of Board committees. Details of the work carried out by each of the Board committees can be found in the respective committee reports from page 237.\n\nIn addition to the Board committees, working groups are established to enhance Board governance. The Technology Governance Working Group was first convened in March 2021 to enhance the Board's oversight of technology strategy, governance\n\nand emerging risks, and to enhance connectivity with the principal subsidiaries. The working group will continue in 2022 but will remain a working group, not a formal committee of the Board. For further details, see page 227.\n\nThe Board Oversight Sub-Group is also part of the group operating rhythm ahead of Board meetings. As described on page 227, this group offers the Board and senior management an informal forum to discuss key matters before they are considered by the Board.\n\nIn addition, the Chairman's Committee is convened to provide flexibility for the Board to consider ad hoc Board and routine matters between scheduled Board meetings. All Board members are invited to attend all Chairman's Committees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Relationship between Board and senior management\n\nThe Board delegates day-to-day management of the business and implementation of strategy to the Group Chief Executive. The Group Chief Executive is supported in his management of the Group by recommendations and advice from the Group Executive Committee ('GEC'), an executive forum comprising members of senior management that include chief executive officers of the global businesses, regional chief executive officers and functional heads.\n\nThe Directors are encouraged to have contact with management at all levels, and have full access to all relevant information. Nonexecutive Directors are encouraged to visit local business operations and meet local management when they attend off-site Board meetings and when travelling for other reasons but only when it is safe to do so. While there were limited physical opportunities for Board members to meet in 2021, there were several virtual meetings with senior executives including induction meetings and subject matter 'deep dives', as well as regular working meetings.\n\nConnectivity between management and the Board is further facilitated through informal discussion held as required on an ad hoc basis, and as part of the Board Oversight Sub-Group meetings.\n\n## Executive governance\n\nThe Group's executive governance is underpinned by the Group operating rhythm, which helps facilitate end-to-end governance between senior leadership and the Board, and sets out the Board and executive engagement schedule.\n\nThe Group operating rhythm is characterised by three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 The GEC normally meets every week to discuss current and emerging issues.\n- \u00b7 On a monthly basis, the GEC reviews the performance of global businesses, principal geographical areas and legal entities. These performance reviews are supplemented by operating unit performance review meetings between the Group Chief Financial Officer and each of the chief executive officers of the global businesses, principal geographical areas and legal entities on an individual basis. The Group Chief Executive and Group Risk and Compliance Officer have standing invitations to these meetings.\n- \u00b7 The GEC holds a strategy and governance meeting two weeks in advance of each Board meeting.\n\nSeparate committees have been established to provide specialist oversight for matters delegated to the Group Chief Executive and senior management, in keeping with their responsibilities under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime. Some of these committees are dedicated sub-committees of the GEC, including the new ESG Committee, the Transformation Oversight Executive Committee and the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee, and all committees together support and facilitate collective decision taking and individual accountabilities. These committees support the Group Chief Executive and GEC members in areas such as capital and liquidity, risk management, disclosure and financial reporting, restructuring and investment considerations, transformation programmes, ESG matters and talent and development.\n\nIn addition to our regional company secretaries supporting our principal subsidiaries, we have corporate governance officers supporting our global businesses and our larger global functions to assist in effective end-to-end governance, consistency and connectivity.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nCertain subsidiaries are formally designated as principal subsidiaries by approval of the Board. In addition to their obligations under their respective local laws and regulation, principal subsidiaries have an important role in supporting effective and high standards of governance across the Group.\n\nThe designated principal subsidiaries are:\n\n| Principal subsidiary                                   | Oversight responsibility                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The Hongkong and Shanghai  Banking Corporation Limited | Asia-Pacific                                                            |\n| HSBC Bank plc                                          | Europe, Bermuda (excluding  Switzerland and UK ring-fenced  activities) |\n| HSBC UK Bank plc                                       | UK ring-fenced bank and its  subsidiaries                               |\n| HSBC Middle East Holdings BV                           | Middle East and North Africa                                            |\n| HSBC North America Holdings Inc.                       | US                                                                      |\n| HSBC Bank Canada                                       | Canada                                                                  |\n\nIn general, principal subsidiaries are responsible for overseeing the implementation of the subsidiary accountability framework for Group companies in the region for which they are responsible. The subsidiary accountability framework, approved in 2020, and refreshed by the Board in 2021, set out to improve communications and connectivity between the Group and its subsidiaries. It is subject to regular review and is occasionally updated to improve how the respective roles of principal subsidiaries and other subsidiaries are articulated. This helps to provide the Group with a shared understanding and a consistent approach towards its strategic objectives, culture and values and furthers the efforts to streamline and align corporate governance.\n\nThe Group Chairman interacts regularly with the chairs of the principal subsidiaries, including through the Chairman's Forum, which brings together the chairs of the principal subsidiaries, the chairs of the Group's audit, risk and remuneration committees and the Group Chief Executive to discuss Group-wide and regional matters. The Group Chairman hosted 11 Chairman's Forums in 2021, which were also attended by relevant executive management, to cover sessions on strategy, financial performance and investor sentiment, geopolitics, culture, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, technology and data, group recovery planning, corporate governance and implementation of the updated subsidiary accountability framework. The NonExecutive Director Summit, hosted by the Group Chairman, was also an effective subsidiary directors' engagement event. For further details, see page 229.\n\nThe chairs of the principal subsidiaries' committees are invited to attend the relevant forums to raise and discuss current and future global issues, including regulatory priorities in each of the regions. While the Audit and Risk Committee Chairs' Forums did not take place in 2021, the chairs of the Group Audit Committee and Group Risk Committee continued to have regular dialogue with the respective committees of the principal subsidiaries to ensure an awareness and coordinated approach to key issues. The annual Remuneration Committee Chairs' Forum took place in October, and provided the principal subsidiary chairs with an opportunity to discuss performance, key considerations and positioning in advance of the pay review process. A follow-up forum was held in early December to provide transparency around pay outcomes and allocation, with feedback from the discussion used to shape the final pay proposals, which were considered and approved by the Group Remuneration Committee.\n\nBoard members attend principal subsidiary meetings as guests from time to time. Similarly, principal subsidiary directors are invited to attend committee meetings at Group level, where relevant, and in particular, when the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') is in attendance. The chairs of the principal subsidiary risk committees are regular attendees at the Group Risk Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Board activities during 2021\n\nDuring 2021, the Board was focused on HSBC's strategic direction and overseeing performance and risk. It considered performance against financial and other strategic objectives, key business challenges, emerging risks, business development, investor relations and the Group's relationships with its stakeholders. The end-to-end governance framework facilitated discussion on strategy and performance by each of the global businesses and across the principal geographical areas, which enabled the Board to support executive management with its delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Board's key areas of focus in 2021 are set out by theme below.\n\n## Strategy and business performance\n\nSince the Group announced a new strategic focus and associated transformation programme in February 2020, it has set out to reshape underperforming businesses, simplify the organisation and reduce costs. The strategy aims to increase returns for investors, create capacity for future investment and build a sustainable platform for growth.\n\nThe Board, which held a dedicated strategy session in May 2021, assessed the delivery of strategic achievements throughout the year through both the perspectives of the global businesses and the regions. The Board took a holistic view by reviewing management's strategic alignment to, and outcomes against, HSBC's four strategic pillars of: focus on our strengths, digitise at scale, energise for growth and transition to net zero.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance\n\nIn 2020, the Group announced its new climate ambition to align financed emissions to net zero by 2050 and become net zero for its own operations and supply chain by 2030. The Group aims to achieve this by supporting clients on the road to a net zero carbon economy and a focus on sustainable finance opportunities. In 2021, the Board considered more climate matters at its meetings, including participating in four climate 'deep-dives' and approving the climate-related resolution for the 2021 AGM. For further details on how the Board is meeting its climate agenda ambitions, see 'Board decision making and engagement with stakeholders' on page 21 and the ESG review on page 43.\n\nThe Board has also considered other sustainability matters, including human rights, a new thermal coal phase-out policy, the operating model for sustainability and the methodology for climate-aligned financing.\n\nThe Board received regular reports on the continuing challenges presented by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which supported the Group's responses and measures to mitigate the effects, including, providing medical aid and assistance to our colleagues in India and other regions.\n\nThe Board takes overall responsibility for ESG strategy, overseeing executive management in developing the approach, execution and associated reporting. It has enhanced its oversight of ESG matters, with a dedicated agenda item on this topic introduced for 2022. Management has also enhanced its governance model with the introduction of a new ESG Committee and supporting forums, which will support senior management in the delivery of the Group's ESG strategy, key policies and material commitments by providing holistic oversight over - and management and coordination of - ESG commitments and activities.\n\n## Financial decisions\n\nThe Board approved key financial decisions throughout the year and approved the Annual Report and Accounts 2020 , the Interim Report 2021 and the first quarter and the third quarter Earnings Releases .\n\nAt the start of 2021, the Board approved the 2021 annual financial resourcing plan and in December 2021 approved the financial resourcing plan for 2022. The Board monitored the Group's performance against the approved 2021 financial resourcing plan,\n\nas well as the plans of each of the global businesses. The Board also approved the renewal of the debt issuance programme, and as announced on 26 October 2021 the buy-back programme.\n\nFollowing the decision in 2020 to cancel the fourth interim dividend for 2019, on 23 February 2021, we announced that after considering the requirements set out in the PRA's temporary approach to shareholder distributions for 2020, an interim dividend for 2020 of $0.15 per ordinary share would be paid in cash on 29 April 2021. On 2 August 2021, we announced an interim dividend of $0.07 for the 2021 half-year paid in cash on 30 September 2021. For further details of dividend payments, see page 397 and 'Board decision making and engagement with stakeholders' on page 21.\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy designed to provide sustainable dividends going forward. For the financial year 2021, we are at the lower end of our target dividend payout ratio range of between 40% and 55% of reported earnings per ordinary share ('EPS'), driven by ECL releases and higher restructuring costs. The dividend policy has the flexibility to adjust EPS for non-cash significant items such as goodwill or intangible impairments. The Board believes this payout ratio approach will allow for a good level of income to shareholders and a progressive dividend, assuming good levels of economic and earnings growth.\n\n## Risk, regulatory and legal considerations\n\nThe Board, advised by the Group Risk Committee, promotes a strong risk governance culture that shapes the Group's risk appetite and supports the maintenance of a strong risk management framework, giving consideration to the measurement, evaluation, acceptance and management of risks, including emerging risks.\n\nThe Board considered the Group's approach to risk including its regulatory obligations. A number of key frameworks, control documents, core processes and legal responsibilities were also reviewed and approved as required. These included:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's risk appetite framework and risk appetite statement;\n- \u00b7 the individual liquidity adequacy assessment process;\n- \u00b7 the individual capital adequacy assessment process;\n- \u00b7 the Group's obligations under the Modern Slavery Act and approval of the Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement;\n- \u00b7 stress testing and capabilities required to meet the PRA's resolvability assessment framework;\n- \u00b7 the revised terms of reference for the Board and Board committees; and\n- \u00b7 delegations of authority.\n\nThe Board also reviewed and monitored the implications of geopolitical developments during the year including US-China relations and the impacts to trade following the UK's departure from the EU.\n\n## Technology\n\nThroughout the year, the Board received regular updates on technology from the Group Chief Operating Officer, including updates on the refreshed technology strategy and restructuring of the technology leadership function.\n\nIn early 2021, the Technology Governance Working Group was established to oversee and enhance the Group's governance of technology. For further details on this group's work and the future of the Board's oversight of technology governance, see page 227.\n\n## People and culture\n\nThe Board continued to spend time discussing people and culturerelated topics. To set the right cultural tone, since March 2021, each Board meeting has begun with a Director or regular attendee describing a 'cultural moment' he or she had experienced, including observations of behaviours within the Group aligned to the purpose and values.

This reporting includes a culture insights report, which allows the Board to monitor culture through receipt of data on culture perceptions and using the indicators of behaviours/sentiment and business outcomes/people data. These presentations help enable the Board to monitor and assess the organisation's culture.\n\nBoard engagement with management and the wider workforce continued to remain a strong area of attention.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board continued to oversee the governance, smooth operation and oversight of the Group and its principal and material subsidiaries. Following a review of subsidiary governance, the Board oversaw the implementation of the review findings, with the support of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nThe Board also supported new governance initiatives to encourage simplification and promote effective decision making in the business. Such initiatives included the refinement of Board and committee papers, and a review to reduce unnecessary committee meetings to free management time and encourage individual accountability and decision taking.\n\nSuccession planning was considered at the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee. During the year, Laura Cha, Henri de Castries and Heidi Miller retired as independent nonexecutive Directors. The Board appointed Rachel Duan and Dame Carolyn Fairbairn as independent non-executive Directors who joined the Board in September 2021. The Board, supported by the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee, will continue to review the skills and experience of the Board as a whole to ensure that it comprises the relevant skills, diversity, experiences and competencies to discharge its responsibilities effectively.\n\nFor further details on the review, subsequent actions and changes to the Board, see the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee report on page 237.\n\nThe Board monitored its compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Hong Kong Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006 throughout the year.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThe Board continued to place great emphasis on the importance of engagement with the workforce, including colleagues affected by the continued impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the return to offices in the UK and elsewhere. The Board also considered the impact of the launch of our new purpose and values and the ongoing transformation activity, including the announcement of the disposal of our retail businesses in the US and France.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board reaffirmed that it continued to believe that the 'alternative arrangements' approach remained most appropriate for the Group in engaging and understanding the views of the workforce. The programme of engagement covered a variety of interaction styles: more bespoke sessions with smaller groups; formal presentations; Q&A opportunities; and other sessions to facilitate engagement across a breadth of experience, geographical spread and seniority. This variety of engagements enabled open dialogue and two-way discussions between Directors and employees. These sessions allowed the Board to gain valuable insight on employee perspectives, which in turn informed their deliberations and decision making at Board and committee meetings. The Board receives updates on how the Group engages with stakeholders, including the workforce, by way of the Group Chief Executive's Board report and the Group Chairman's weekly Board note. In addition, the Board's agenda regularly includes non-executive Director workforce and other stakeholder engagement updates. These help to inform the Board of employee initiatives and sentiment and allow the Board to plan for future engagement activities. For further details of how the Board considered the views of employees and other stakeholders, see the 'Board decision making and engaging with stakeholders' on page 21.\n\nThe flexibility of this approach allowed all Board members the opportunity for direct engagement - albeit often virtually during 2021 - with a broad cross-section of the workforce, spanning global businesses, functions and geographies. It also gave insights provided by management through our employee listening tools and surveys. The Board received formal updates from the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer on employee views and sentiment. These include results of employee engagement surveys, benchmarked data, and additional surveys to understand well-being throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. The Chairman's Forum meetings also discussed employee feedback from the Group's subsidiaries.\n\nSpecific engagement between the Board and the wider workforce included meetings and events with:\n\n- \u00b7 representatives of the employee resource groups and each of the non-executive Directors who have been partnered to support the designated groups: Ability, Balance, Embrace, Faith, Generations, Nurture, Pride, and Communities;\n- \u00b7 the Nurture employee resource group, which hosted online events on domestic abuse and working fathers, during which non-executive Directors discussed with a small group of employees how the Group had supported them during such challenging times and how the Board could promote further initiatives;\n- \u00b7 first and second year members of the HSBC graduate scheme, who discussed their experiences of hybrid working and HSBC's culture, purpose and values;\n- \u00b7 US executive management, who held succession and emerging talent sessions, and who also discussed our net zero ambitions, career pathways, and the delivery of our strategy; and\n- \u00b7 African heritage employee resource group leaders, who held a roundtable event to discuss inclusivity at work.",

accountability\n\nThe Board and its committees are committed to regular, independent evaluation of their effectiveness at least once every three years.\n\nIn 2020, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee invited Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited to support the Board with its annual evaluation and to conduct a follow-up review on the Board's progress against the findings and recommendations from her 2019 report.\n\nIn 2021, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee approved the conducting of an internal evaluation of the Board and its committees, with the assistance of an externally facilitated questionnaire system managed by Lintstock, an independent service provider with no other connection to the Group or any individual Director. The questions were designed by the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer and included some of the themes addressed by Dr Long's previous reviews, namely: leadership, shared perspective, culture, end-to-end governance and future thinking. A summary of the effectiveness reviews of the Board and the Board committees can be found on page 235 and in the respective committee reports on pages 237 to 267.\n\nTo gather qualitative feedback the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, together with the Deputy Group Secretary, conducted one-to-one interviews with all questionnaire respondents, including all the Board Directors, regular attendees of the relevant meetings and key advisers. The Group Chairman and committee chairs also participated in additional discussion following the consolidation of feedback in respect of the individual committees.\n\nIn general, there were consistent findings across the Board and committee reviews. These included: a desire to be more forward looking; more discussion of contextual matters such as economic, social, and geopolitical issues; maintaining a supportive and challenging relationship between the Board, its committees and senior management; providing clear governance for our subsidiaries; and a more consistent approach in leading and living the Group purpose and values.\n\nAt its January 2022 meeting, the Board considered the findings and noted the following areas of focus:  in person Board and committee meetings; succession planning; diversity in Board composition including the need for more Asian and banking experience; prioritising digital opportunities; and more Board meeting time dedicated to customers.\n\nThe Group Chairman led a discussion at which the Board agreed the actions and priorities to be implemented, which will be monitored and addressed on an ongoing basis. Similar discussions were carried out by each of the committee chairs in their respective January meetings. Progress against these actions will be included in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022.\n\nDuring 2021, a review of the Group Chairman's performance was led by the Senior Independent Director in consultation with the other independent non-executive Directors, management and key stakeholders. Non-executive Directors also undergo regular individual reviews with the Group Chairman. These reviews confirmed that the performance of the Group Chairman and each Director was effective and that each had met their time commitments during the year.\n\nThe review of executive Directors' performance, which helps determine the level of variable pay they receive each year, is contained in the Directors' remuneration report on page 268.",

This included the approval of a new senior leadership structure with an expanded Group Executive Committee and a new General Manager cohort with enterprisewide responsibilities. The Committee has supported the establishment of a flagship development programme for senior executives and the first HSBC Bank Director Programme, which aims to prepare senior talent for roles on subsidiary boards.\n\nSignificant progress has also been made in enhancing our subsidiary governance practices over recent years, with further improvements made during 2021. In accordance with the recommendation arising from the subsidiary governance review undertaken in 2020, we implemented a refreshed subsidiary accountability framework, which now applies to all HSBC subsidiaries on a proportionate basis and provides greater clarity on the Group's expectations of subsidiary boards. A key element of this has been succession planning for our principal and material subsidiary boards, with the Committee overseeing all succession plans and considering requests for exceptions from the requirements of the framework.\n\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of 2022, the Committee will continue to play an important role in overseeing our work in improving the standards of corporate governance across HSBC and achieving our ambition of world class governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mark E Tucker\n\n## Chair\n\nNomination & Corporate Governance Committee\n\n22 February 2022\n\n## Membership\n\n|                           | Member since   | Meeting attendance in  2021   |\n|---------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Mark Tucker (Chair)       | Oct 2017       | 8/8                           |\n| Laura Cha 1               | May 2014       | 4/4                           |\n| Henri de Castries 1       | Apr 2018       | 4/4                           |\n| Rachel Duan 2             | Sep 2021       | 2/2                           |\n| Dame Carolyn Fairbairn 2  | Sep 2021       | 2/2                           |\n| James Forese              | May 2020       | 8/8                           |\n| Steven Guggenheimer       | May 2020       | 8/8                           |\n| Irene Lee                 | Apr 2018       | 8/8                           |\n| Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade        | Apr 2019       | 8/8                           |\n| Eileen Murray 3           | Jul 2020       | 7/8                           |\n| Heidi Miller 1            | Apr 2018       | 4/4                           |\n| David Nish                | Apr 2018       | 8/8                           |\n| Jackson Tai               | Apr 2018       | 8/8                           |\n| Pauline van der Meer Mohr | Apr 2016       | 8/8                           |\n\n- 1  Laura Cha, Henri de Castries and Heidi Miller stepped down from the Board following the conclusion of the AGM on 28 May 2021.\n- 2  Rachel Duan and Dame Carolyn Fairbairn were appointed to the Board on 1 September 2021.\n- 3  Eileen Murray was unable to attend the December committee meeting for personal health reasons.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 leading the process for identifying and nominating candidates for appointment to the Board and its committees;\n- \u00b7 overseeing succession planning and development for the Group Executive Committee and other senior executives; and\n- \u00b7 overseeing and monitoring the corporate governance framework of the Group and ensuring that this is consistent with best practice.\n\n## Committee governance\n\nThe Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Human Resources Officer and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer routinely attended Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee meetings.\n\nRussell Reynolds Associates, which supported the Committee and the management team in relation to Board and senior executive succession planning, regularly attended meetings during the year. It has no other connection with the Group or members of the Board.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer ensured that the Committee fulfilled its governance responsibilities, considering input from various stakeholders when finalising meeting agendas and tracking progress on actions and Committee priorities.\n\n## Board composition and succession\n\nThe main focus of the Committee during 2021 was on succession planning for the Board and committees. The Committee keeps the composition of the Board and its committees under constant review and continually strives to ensure that the membership, both individually and collectively, has the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to oversee, challenge and support management in the achievement of the Group's strategic and business objectives.\n\nThere were a number of retirements from the Board during the year, with Henri de Castries, Laura Cha and Heidi Miller retiring at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM. In addition, since the year-end, we announced that Irene Lee and Pauline van der Meer Mohr would retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM.

This will ensure that the longer-term shape of the Board is well aligned to our purpose, strategy and values, and provides relevant skills, experience and knowledge of our priority markets.\n\nIn late 2020, the Committee engaged Russell Reynolds Associates to conduct a thorough and robust search to identify prospective candidates for appointment to the Board. This identified a number of potential candidates who met our agreed search criteria, which reflected prior feedback from stakeholders including investors, regulators and the management team. This was initially reviewed by the Group Chairman, with potential candidates presented and discussed by the Committee at various meetings during 2021. Following consideration by the Committee, and meetings between various members of the Committee and priority candidates to understand their interest and capacity, the Board approved the appointments of Rachel Duan and Dame Carolyn Fairbairn with effect from 1 September 2021.\n\nA search for additional non-executive Director candidates, which looks to enhance the Board's collective knowledge and experience of banking and Asia in particular, was initiated during 2021. The search will also look to further enhance diversity on the Board in line with its diversity and inclusion policy. The Committee's search was again supported by Russell Reynolds. The Committee is actively progressing this search and will provide an update in due course.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of gender, social and ethnic diversity, and the strengths this brings to Board effectiveness. There was a significant focus on diversity at Board and senior executive levels in 2021, with consultations issued by our UK regulators and the UK Listing Authority. We are well positioned against the proposals outlined in those consultations and, in line with the Board diversity and inclusion policy, remain committed to increasing diversity at Board and senior levels to ensure we reflect the markets and societies we serve. The policy, which was updated in 2021 to incorporate new targets on female representation, details our approach to achieving our diversity ambitions, and helps to ensure that diversity and inclusion factors are taken into account in succession planning. The revised Board diversity and inclusion policy is available at www.hsbc.com/whowe-are/leadership-and-governance/board-responsibilities.\n\nAt the end of 2021, we had a 38% female Board representation, with five female Board members out of 13. Our aspirational female representative target is at least 40% by the end of 2023, aligned to the recommendation in the final Hampton-Alexander Review. We continue to exceed the Parker Review target of at least one Director from an ethnic minority background by 2021, with four members of our Board self-identifying in line with the ethnicity/ ethnic definition set by Parker. Given the global and international nature of HSBC, including our strong presence and heritage in Asia, the Committee expects the composition of the Board to exceed the current Parker Review recommendations. In line with our purpose and values, the Board believes that a diverse and inclusive Board, reflective of the communities we serve, is key to effective decision making and to developing a sustainable and successful business for HSBC.\n\nFurther details on activities to improve diversity across senior management and the wider workforce, together with representation statistics, can be found on page 72.\n\n## Independence\n\nIndependence is a critical component of good corporate governance, and is a principle that is applied consistently at both Holdings and subsidiary level. The Committee has delegated authority from the Board in relation to the assessment of the independence of non-executive Directors. In accordance with the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes, the Committee has reviewed and confirmed that all non-executive Directors who have submitted themselves for election and re-election at the AGM are considered to be independent. This conclusion was reached\n\nafter consideration of all relevant circumstances that are likely to impair, or could appear to impair, independence.\n\n## Senior executive succession and development\n\nThe Group Executive Committee underwent a period of significant change during 2021 and engaged Russell Reynolds to identify the best talent for roles on the committee. The changes included the addition of three new roles, as well as the appointments of new Co-Chief Executives for our Asia-Pacific region. These appointments recognised the leadership and capabilities that the Group requires to deliver our strategic commitments.\n\nSuccession plans for the Group Executive Committee members were approved at the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee meeting in December. These reflected continued efforts to support the development and progression of diverse talent and promote the long-term success of the Group.\n\nThe Committee also discussed progress under the Asia talent programme, which aims to support the development of potential future leaders from the Group's key region. The initiative exceeded the target of appointing the top talent from the region into stretch roles as part of their development. As part of succession plans, we also identified at least one credible successor of Asia heritage for the region's key roles. Other regions across the Group have begun work to replicate the success in Asia, with updates on their efforts to be provided to the Committee during 2022.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Committee was internally facilitated in 2021. The review concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively, with a number of positive aspects of the Committee's operation and practices highlighted. Areas for improvement that were identified included the Committee's succession planning practices, and the need to review the support and guidance provided in relation to executive succession activity, including the expectations of leaders in relation to succession preparedness. The Committee discussed the outcomes of the evaluation in January 2022, and endorsed the findings and actions to be taken. The outcomes of the evaluation have been reported to the Board and the Committee will track progress on the recommendations through the year.\n\n## Subsidiary governance\n\nThe importance of robust, effective and proportionate governance at all levels of the Group is critical, with the 2020 subsidiary governance review of principal subsidiaries identifying a number of areas of good practice and areas where further improvement would be beneficial.\n\nOne of the recommended areas for improvement was a refresh of the existing subsidiary governance policy, and the subsidiary accountability framework, to provide greater clarity and guidance on the Group's expectations of various subsidiaries. The refreshed framework, which included additional principles, underpinned by provisions and detailed guidance, took effect from 1 April 2021.\n\nSubsidiary board composition and ensuring effective succession planning practices were key objectives of the refreshed framework. The subsidiary governance review also recommended that guidance should be developed and enhanced with additional provisions to support effective board composition and succession planning. It also expected that boards should use a skills matrix. In connection with the revised expectations, all principal and material subsidiaries submitted their succession plans for the Committee's review. The Committee approved a number of required exceptions from strict compliance with the framework to manage transition for a limited period, and to reflect varying market practices, laws and regulations across our markets.\n\nAs part of efforts to make greater use of the skills, expertise and experience among our senior employees for roles on subsidiary boards, the Committee approved the development of the HSBC Bank Director Programme. This programme seeks to equip our internal talent with the appropriate skills and knowledge required to serve on a HSBC subsidiary board. The initiative was developed following consultation with our principal subsidiary chairs, who",

This work had the strong support of the Group Executive Committee, and involved desktop reviews, meeting observations and interviews.\n\nOverall, the review concluded that the governance of the three global businesses operated effectively, and had improved as a\n\nresult of governance simplification initiatives sponsored by the Group Executive Committee. The main opportunities for improvement related to further simplification of governance structures. In particular, the role of the global business governance forums within regions and countries will be considered to avoid duplication by ensuring that their roles and responsibilities are clear and distinct.\n\nThe findings and recommendations from the review were discussed and endorsed by the Committee in January 2022, with oversight of the actions and next steps to be overseen by the respective global business executive committees and the Group Executive Committee.\n\n|                                                                       | Matters considered during 2021   |

These were supplemented with regular communications that we cascade through the Group, informal meetings with audit committee chairs and a breakout session on key areas for focus at the Non-Executive Director Summit in July 2021.\n\nI regularly met the whistleblowing team to discuss material whistleblowing cases and the effectiveness of whistleblowing arrangements. The GAC spent significant time considering enhancements to whistleblowing arrangements, management's responses to internal audit findings and the thematic and cultural insights that could be used to improve the speak-up culture.\n\nThe Committee received regular updates from the Group Chief Financial Officer and the Group Head of Internal Audit on functional transformation, its impact on the control environment and the capacity and capabilities of the functions. The Committee also invited the Global Finance Executive Committee for a private session, and I attended a session of the Global Internal Audit Executive Committee to discuss key topics and themes from a management perspective.\n\nRecognising the importance of providing enhanced trust in reporting to all stakeholders, the Committee provided a detailed response to the UK Government's consultation paper on 'Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance'.\n\nThe Committee implemented all the actions from the 2020 evaluation. The 2021 review determined that the GAC continued to operate effectively.\n\nEileen Murray stepped down as a member at the 2021 AGM. The Committee continues to have a wide range of financial services experience and I would like to thank all the GAC members and management for their diligent contributions and support to the work of the Committee during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## David Nish\n\nChair, Group Audit Committee, 22 February 2022\n\n## Membership\n\n|                             | Member since   | Meeting attendance  in 2021 1   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------|\n| David Nish (Chair)          | May 2016       | 11/11                           |\n| James Forese 2              | May 2020       | 10/11                           |\n| Eileen Murray 3             | Jul 2020       | 5/6                             |\n| Jackson Tai                 | Dec 2018       | 11/11                           |\n| Pauline van der Meer Mohr 4 | Apr 2020       | 10/11                           |\n\n- 1  These included two joint meetings with the Group Risk Committee.\n- 2  James Forese was unable to attend one meeting due to extreme weather conditions disrupting air travel.\n- 3  Eileen Murray was unable to attend one meeting due to personal circumstances and stepped down from the Group Audit Committee on 28 May 2021.\n- 4  Pauline van der Meer Mohr was unable to attend one meeting due to personal circumstances and another due to a prior commitment.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 monitoring and assessing the integrity of the financial statements, formal announcements and regulatory information in relation to the Group's financial performance, as well as significant accounting judgements;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the effectiveness of, and ensuring that management has appropriate internal controls over, financial reporting;\n- \u00b7 reviewing and monitoring the relationship with the external auditor and overseeing its appointment, tenure, rotation, remuneration, independence and engagement for non-audit services;\n- \u00b7 overseeing the Group's policies, procedures and arrangements for capturing and responding to whistleblower concerns and ensuring they are operating effectively; and\n- \u00b7 overseeing the work of Global Internal Audit and monitoring and assessing the effectiveness, performance, resourcing, independence and standing of the function.\n\n## Committee governance\n\nThe Committee keeps the Board informed and advises on matters concerning the Group's financial reporting requirements to ensure that the Board has exercised oversight of the work carried out by management, Global Internal Audit and the external auditor.\n\nCommittee meetings usually take place a couple of days before Board meetings to allow the Committee to report its findings and recommendations in a timely and orderly manner. This is done through the Chair who comments on matters of particular relevance. The Board also receives copies of the Committee agenda and minutes of meetings.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Head of Finance, Global Financial Controller, Group Head of Internal Audit, Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer and other members of senior management routinely attended meetings of the GAC. The external auditor attended all meetings.\n\nThe Chair held regular meetings with management, Global Internal Audit and the external auditor to discuss agenda planning and specific issues as they arose during the year outside the formal Committee process. The Committee also regularly met separately with the internal and external auditors and other senior management to discuss matters in private.\n\nThe Committee Secretary regularly met with the Chair to ensure the Committee fulfilled its governance responsibilities, and to consider input from stakeholders when finalising meeting agendas, tracking progress on actions and Committee priorities.",

The Board has determined that David Nish and Jackson Tai are 'financial experts' for the purposes of section 407 of the SarbanesOxley Act and have recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes.\n\nThe GAC Chair had regular meetings with the regulators, including the UK's PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'). These included trilateral meetings involving the Group's external auditor PwC.\n\nThe Committee assessed the adequacy of resources of the accounting and financial reporting function. It also monitored the legal and regulatory environment relevant to its responsibilities.\n\n## How the Committee discharged its responsibilities\n\n## Connectivity with principal subsidiary audit committees\n\nThe Committee maintains a close working relationship with the principal subsidiary audit committees through formal and informal channels.\n\nOn a half-year basis, principal subsidiary audit committees provide certifications to the GAC regarding the preparation of their financial statements, adherence to Group policies and escalation of any issues that require the attention of the GAC. Recognising the additional focus on prudential regulatory reporting, the GAC sought additional information via these certifications regarding the governance, review and assurance activities undertaken by the principal subsidiary audit committees in relation to prudential regulatory reporting.\n\nThe GAC Chair regularly met with the chairs of the principal subsidiary audit committees, and attended meetings to enable close links and deeper understanding on judgements around key issues. Certain chairs and audit committee members from the principal subsidiary audit committees were also invited to attend meetings of the GAC on relevant topics.\n\nAt the Non-Executive Director Summit, the GAC Chair engaged with a number of subsidiary non-executive Directors in a breakout session to discuss key focus areas, including regulatory reporting, ESG and climate reporting and whistleblowing arrangements.\n\nRegular post-meeting communications to principal subsidiary audit chairs were supplemented with informal quarterly catch-ups with a group of the audit committee chairs. These provided opportunities for the discussion of key matters impacting subsidiaries and the Group in between formal meetings.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nIn 2021, the GAC devoted significant time in overseeing management's approach to enabling a sustainable transformation of the control environment that supports financial, prudential regulatory and other regulatory reporting to meet the evolving expectations of regulators and other stakeholders. The programme will drive end-to-end organisational alignment so that principles and control standards can be designed to deliver a more integrated, standardised and automated control environment. The Committee received regular updates on the mobilisation of the programme workstreams, resourcing and engagement throughout the Group and with regulators. The oversight and implementation of the programme and its component parts will be a key focus for the Committee in 2022.\n\nThe Committee received regular updates and confirmations that management had taken, or was taking, the necessary actions to remediate any failings or weaknesses identified through the operation of the Group's framework of controls. For further details on how the Board reviewed the effectiveness of key aspects of internal control, see page 291.\n\nAs required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the GAC received updates on the Group's work on section 404 compliance and the Group's broader financial control environment during the year. This was to assess the effectiveness of the internal control system for financial reporting and any developments affecting it. Based on this work, the GAC recommended that the Board support the assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing the Group's financial reporting during the year, including the Annual Report and Accounts , Interim Report , quarterly earnings releases, analyst presentations and, where material, Pillar 3 disclosures and other items arising from the review of the Group Disclosure Committee. As part of its review, the GAC:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluated management's application of critical accounting policies and material areas in which significant accounting judgements were applied;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 focused on compliance with disclosure requirements to ensure these were consistent, appropriate and acceptable under the relevant financial and governance reporting requirements;\n- \u00b7 provided advice to the Board on the form and basis underlying the long-term viability statement; and\n- \u00b7 gave careful consideration to the key performance metrics related to strategic priorities and ensured that the performance and outlook statements were fair, balanced and reflected the risks and uncertainties appropriately.\n\nIn conjunction with the Group Risk Committee ('GRC'), the GAC considered the current position of the Group, along with the emerging and principal risks, and carried out a robust assessment of the Group's prospects, before making a recommendation to the Board on the Group's long-term viability statement. The GAC also undertook a detailed review before recommending to the Board that the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual and interim financial statements. Further details can be found on page 41.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nFollowing review and challenge of the disclosures, the Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements, taken as a whole, were fair, balanced and understandable. The financial statements provided the shareholders with the necessary information to assess the Group's position and performance, business model, strategy and risks facing the business, including in relation to the increasingly important ESG considerations.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the draft Annual Report and Accounts 2021 and results announcements to enable input and comment. It was supported by the work of the Group Disclosure Committee, which also reviewed and assessed the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 and investor communications.\n\nThis work enabled the GAC to provide positive assurance to the Board to assist them in making the statement required in compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## ESG and climate reporting\n\nDuring the year, the GAC reviewed the strategy, scope and status of ESG and climate reporting, including the climate change resolution and scenario analysis disclosure. Management updates were also informed by an HSBC-specific stakeholder feedback survey, which highlighted the appetite for more detailed ESG disclosures on climate metrics, emissions targets and plans on how these would be achieved. The Committee considered the operational, disclosure and litigation risks, which could arise from making further external commitments related to ESG and climate reporting.\n\nThe development of methodologies, tools and data to support our ESG strategy remained a key challenge. The GAC discussed management plans to enhance and assure internal and external ESG data sourcing across the Group to develop a common ESG data inventory. The Committee considered the approach to subsidiary reporting, in particular the availability of granular data to support the Group subsidiaries in fulfilling their mandatory disclosure requirements.\n\nManagement updated the Committee on the verification and assurance framework to ensure that ESG and climate disclosures were materially accurate, consistent, fair and balanced. The GAC discussed the roles and work of the three lines of defence as part of this framework, as well as proposals for PwC to perform further limited assurance over specific ESG-related metrics.\n\nThe Committee oversaw and challenged management on the proposals to further expand the ESG review section of the Annual Report and Accounts to incorporate additional disclosures. These include the integration of TCFD disclosures, which were previously published in a stand-alone supplement, and net zero disclosures in relation to the special shareholder resolution on climate change.\n\nThe GAC and the GRC held a joint meeting to review the progress made to deliver on the commitment - under the climate change special resolution - to publish a policy to phase out the financing of coal-fired power and thermal coal mining. The committees\n\ndiscussed the positions taken, and the risks associated with the policy, as well as the methodology for capturing and reporting the emissions data across the financing portfolio.\n\n## Regulatory reporting\n\nThe GAC focused on what improvements were required to regulatory reporting processes and controls, which were operating outside the Board's risk tolerance. The Committee continued to focus heavily on the quality and reliability of regulatory reporting to strengthen the end-to-end processes to meet regulatory expectations. It also challenged management on the scope of the regulatory reporting enhancement programmes. This was in response to findings from HSBC-specific external reviews and other regulatory pronouncements including the PRA's 'Dear CEO' letter on thematic findings on the reliability of regulatory reporting across the industry. The Committee Chair invited certain principal subsidiary audit committee members to GAC meetings to participate in discussions to ensure alignment and understanding of key issues and ongoing regulatory engagement.\n\nManagement discussed root cause themes, remediation of known issues and areas of increased risk identified from the risk-based read-across exercise. The Committee considered the near-term actions being taken by management, as well as the strategic remediation plan, including the costs, resources and time for implementation. It also challenged management on the delivery risks and the dependency on other ongoing programmes.\n\nManagement also highlighted potential impacts on some of the Group's regulatory ratios, such as CET1 and LCR, and adjustments required to external disclosures.\n\n## UK audit reform\n\nThe Committee spent significant time in reviewing a UK Government consultation paper - from the Department of Business,  Energy and Industrial Strategy - on 'Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance'. The GAC oversaw the development of the direct HSBC response to the consultation, as well as management's engagement across a number of industry bodies to understand wider views.\n\nIn addition, the Committee discussed the management activities being undertaken in preparation for future stages of the consultation. The GAC took steps to review its audit and assurance policy and expand assurance in certain areas, particularly regulatory reporting and ESG. The Committee also considered the impact on the future audit tender strategy, and will be looking to tender in advance of the 10-year rotation point. The Committee has proactively started engagement with the Big Four and challenger audit firms, as part of its preparations.\n\nThe Committee will continue to monitor outcomes and next steps arising from the UK Government's consultation.\n\n## External auditor\n\nThe GAC has the primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the Group's external auditor, PwC.\n\nPwC completed its seventh audit, providing robust challenge to management and sound independent advice to the Committee on specific financial reporting judgements and the control environment. The senior audit partner is Scott Berryman who has been in the role since 2019. The Committee reviewed the external auditor's approach and strategy for the annual audit and also received regular updates on the audit, including observations on the control environment. Key audit matters discussed with PwC are set out in its report on page 298.\n\n## External audit plan\n\nThe GAC reviewed the PwC external audit approach, including the materiality, risk assessment and scope of the audit. The Committee invited a number of the principal subsidiary audit partners to discuss their priorities as part of the review of the external audit plan.\n\nPwC highlighted the changes being made to their approach to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the audit. Changes for the 2022 audit included more auditing being performed centrally",

        "page_content": "across legal entities and the increased use of technology solutions, some of which are aligned to technology change and transformation activities across HSBC.\n\n## Effectiveness of external audit process\n\nThe GAC assessed the effectiveness of PwC as the Group's external auditor, using a questionnaire that focused on the overall audit process, its effectiveness and the quality of output. PwC highlighted the actions being taken in response to the HSBC effectiveness review, including the development of audit quality indicators, which would provide a balanced scorecard and transparent reporting to the GAC. These focused on the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 findings from inspections across the Group on PwC as a firm;\n- \u00b7 the hours of audit work delivered by senior PwC audit team members, the extent of specialist and expert involvement, delivery against agreed timetable and milestones and the use of technology;\n- \u00b7 any new control deficiencies in Sarbanes-Oxley locations, proportion of management identified deficiencies and delivery of audit deliverables to agreed timelines; and\n- \u00b7 outcomes and scores from annual audit surveys, independent senior partner reviews and prior period errors.\n\nThe GAC will continue to receive regular updates from PwC and management on the progress of the external audit plan and PwC performance across the audit quality indicators.\n\nThe GAC monitored the policy on hiring employees or former employees of the external auditor, and there were no breaches of the policy highlighted during the year. The external auditor attended all Committee meetings and the GAC Chair maintains regular contact with the senior audit partner and his team throughout the year.\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nThe Committee assessed any potential threats to independence that were self-identified or reported by PwC. The GAC considered PwC to be independent and PwC, in accordance with professional ethical standards and applicable rules and regulations, provided the GAC with written confirmation of its independence for the duration of 2021.\n\nThe Committee confirms it has complied with the provisions of the The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the financial statements. The Committee acknowledges the provisions contained in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code in respect of audit tendering. In conformance with these requirements, HSBC will be required to tender for the audit for the 2025 financial year end and beyond, having appointed PwC from 1 January 2015.\n\nThe Committee believed it would not be appropriate to re-tender in 2021 as a change in auditor would have a significant impact on the organisation, including on the Global Finance function and would increase operational risk. In 2021, the Committee's priority was to monitor closely the ongoing industry developments and proposals on reform of the UK external audit market and the impact this may have on any tender process. As a result, the Committee has commenced planning for the next tender process in advance of the 10-year re-tender period, likely to take place no later than early 2023.\n\nThe Committee has recommended to the Board that PwC should be reappointed as auditor. Resolutions concerning the reappointment of PwC and its audit fee for 2022 will be proposed to shareholders at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nThe Committee is responsible for setting, reviewing and monitoring the appropriateness of the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor. It also applies the Group's policy on the award of non-audit services to the external auditor. The non-audit services are carried out in accordance with the external auditor independence policy to ensure that services do not create\n\na conflict of interest. All non-audit services are either approved by the GAC, or by Group Finance when acting within delegated limits and criteria set by the GAC.\n\nDuring the period, it was identified that PwC provided an impermissible training service via a publicly available seminar in respect of the implementation of a new Indonesian IT security regulation. The attendees at this seminar included six members of staff from HSBC Indonesia. The HSBC staff who attended the course were not from the Finance function and were not in roles relevant to the audit. In addition, HSBC Indonesia is not within the scope of the Group audit. In light of the nature and scope of the original service and the mitigating factors mentioned above, we do not believe that the provision of the service has affected PwC's professional judgement or integrity in respect of the audit of the Group. Mitigating actions have been implemented by both PwC and HSBC to reinforce the controls around the provision of nonaudit services by PwC, including additional independence training and improved communication between relevant parties.\n\nThe non-audit services carried out by PwC included 69 engagements approved during the year where the fees were over $100,000 but less than $1m. Global Finance, as a delegate of GAC, considered that it was in the best interests of the Group to use PwC for these services because they were:\n\n- \u00b7 audit-related engagements that were largely carried out by members of the audit engagement team, with the work closely related to the work performed in the audit;\n- \u00b7 engagements covered under other assurance services that require obtaining appropriate audit evidence to express a conclusion designed to enhance the degree of confidence of the intended users other than the responsible party about the subject matter information; or\n- \u00b7 other permitted services to advisory attestation reports on internal controls of a service organisation primarily prepared for and used by third-party end users.\n\nTen engagements during the year were approved where the fees exceeded $1m. These were mainly engagements required by the regulator and incremental fees related to previously approved engagements, including the provision of services by PwC relating to the Section 166 Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Skilled Person report. The PRA instructed a Section 166 review of HSBC's credit risk RWAs as reported at 31 December 2020 and agreed for PwC to provide a reasonable assurance opinion on the accuracy of the regulatory reporting at that date. One new engagement outside the scope of the pre-approved services related to preliminary advanced audit procedures for the adoption of IFRS 17 in 2023.\n\n| Auditors' remuneration      |   2021 $m |   2020 $m |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total fees payable          |     129.4 |     130.2 |\n| Fees for non-audit services |      41.3 |      37.3 |\n\n## Global Internal Audit\n\nThe primary role of the Global Internal Audit function is to help the Board and management protect the assets, reputation and sustainability of the Group. Global Internal Audit does this by providing independent and objective assurance on the design and operating effectiveness of the Group's governance, risk management and control framework and processes, prioritising the greatest areas of risk.\n\nThe independence of Global Internal Audit from day-to-day line management responsibility is critical to its ability to deliver objective audit coverage by maintaining an independent and objective stance. Global Internal Audit is free from interference by any element in the organisation, including on matters of audit selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or internal audit report content. Global Internal Audit adheres to The Institute of Internal Auditors' mandatory guidance.\n\nThe Group Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chair of the GAC and there are frequent and regular meetings held between them.

        "page_content": "overall governance, risk management and control framework and processes are reported regularly to the GAC, GRC and local audit and risk committees, as appropriate. This reporting highlights key themes identified through audit activity, and the output from continuous monitoring. This includes business and regulatory developments and an independent view of emerging and horizon risk, together with details of audit coverage and any required changes to the annual audit plan.\n\nAudit coverage is achieved using a combination of business and functional audits of processes and controls, risk management frameworks and major change initiatives, as well as regulatory audits, investigations and special reviews. In addition to the ongoing importance of regulatory-focused work, key risk theme categories for 2021 audit coverage were strategy, governance and culture, financial crime, conduct and compliance, financial resilience and operational resilience. In 2021, Global Internal Audit increased coverage on the Group's transformation programme and performed project audit activity for selected complex and highpriority business cases. Global Internal Audit also continued its 'real-time audit' approach, notably to cover areas of strategic importance. 'Real-time audits' provide real-time, independent ongoing observations to management, with issues being raised for significant observations that are not addressed in a timely manner. In addition, in 2021, Global Internal Audit implemented its revised 'culture audit' approach which assesses the impact of culture in supporting or inhibiting sustainable performance against strategic aspirations and managing risk within risk appetite. The approach combines internal audit and behavioural science principles, which align to regulator culture assessments and industry best practice.\n\nExecutive management is responsible for ensuring that issues raised by the Global Internal Audit function are addressed within an appropriate and agreed timetable. Confirmation to this effect must be provided to Global Internal Audit, which validates closure on a risk basis.\n\nConsistent with previous years, the 2022 audit planning process includes assessing the inherent risks and strength of the control environment across the audit entities representing the Group. Results of this assessment are combined with a top-down analysis of risk themes by risk category to ensure that themes identified are addressed in the annual plan. Risk theme categories for the 2022 audit work continue to be strategy, governance and culture, financial crime, conduct and compliance, financial resilience and operational resilience. In 2022, a quarterly assessment of key risk themes will form the basis of thematic reporting and plan updates and will ultimately drive the 2023 planning process. The annual audit plan and material plan updates made in response to changes in the Group's structure and risk profile are approved by the GAC.\n\nBased on regular internal audit reporting to the GAC, private sessions with the Group Head of Internal Audit, the Global Professional Practices annual assessment and quarterly quality assurance updates, the GAC is satisfied with the effectiveness of the Global Internal Audit function and the appropriateness of its resources.\n\nGlobal Internal Audit maintains a close working relationship with HSBC's external auditor, PwC. The external auditor is kept informed of Global Internal Audit's activities and results, and is afforded free access to all internal audit reports and supporting records.\n\n## Principal activities and significant issues considered during 2021\n\n## Collaborative oversight by GAC and GRC\n\nThe GAC and GRC worked closely to ensure there were procedures to manage risk and oversee the internal control framework. They also worked together to ensure any common areas of responsibility were addressed appropriately with intercommittee communication or joint discussions with the Chairs.\n\nThe Chairs are members of both committees and engage on the agendas of each other's committees to further enhance connectivity, coordination and flow of information.\n\nAreas of joint focus for the GAC and GRC during 2021 were:\n\n## Sustainable control environment\n\nAs discussed in the 'Internal controls' section of this report, the GAC oversaw management's approach to create a sustainable transformation of the control environment. The programme, and its impact on the internal control environment as a whole, was also discussed by the GRC.\n\nIn conjunction with the GRC, the GAC monitored the remediation of significant deficiencies and weaknesses in controls raised by management and the external auditor. The GAC will continue to monitor the progress of remediation as well as efforts to integrate requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with the operational risk framework as part of the sustainable control environment programme. The committees will also continue to monitor the regulatory reporting enhancements programmes to bring regulatory reporting processes within the risk appetite.\n\nIn 2021, the GAC and GRC Chairs worked closely with the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer and the Group Head of Internal Audit to:\n\n- \u00b7 ensure that risks and issues highlighted at the GAC from audit reports were appropriately captured and reported as part of the wider internal controls discussion at the GRC; and\n- \u00b7 coordinate the approach and oversight required for the remediation of very high risk and high risk issues identified by Global Internal Audit, as well as the establishment of a single repository of issues across HSBC.\n\nThe GAC and the GRC also held a joint meeting to consider data strategy and data management. Further details can be found in the GRC report on page 250.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nIn addition to the GRC's overall review of the Group's risk appetite and risk management framework, the GAC gave particular focus to risk measures impacting financial reporting. This included the review of the financial reporting, tax and pension risk appetite statements. The GAC and the GRC also considered how the approach to financial reporting risk appetite could be evolved to drive a reduction in the exposure to this risk over the medium term and provide better visibility to financial and prudential regulatory reporting separately.\n\nThe committees worked collaboratively in reviewing ESG and climate risks, as well as the financial and regulatory reporting impacts. For further details, see the 'ESG and climate reporting' section of this report on page 80.\n\nGiven the continued impact from the Covid-19 pandemic, the GAC and the GRC reviewed the risks arising from models used for the estimation of expected credit losses under IFRS 9. The committees challenged the underlying economic scenarios, additional scenarios added by management and the reasonableness of the weightings applied to each scenario in order to understand the impact on the financial statements.\n\n## Whistleblowing and speak-up culture\n\nAn important part of HSBC's values is ensuring that colleagues have the confidence to speak up when they observe unlawful or unethical behaviour. HSBC provides a variety of channels for colleagues to raise concerns, including through the Group's whistleblowing channel, HSBC Confidential (see page 87 for further information). The GAC is responsible for the oversight of the effectiveness of the Group's whistleblowing arrangements. The Group Head of Compliance provides periodic reporting to the GAC on the efficacy of the whistleblowing arrangements, providing an assessment of controls and detailing the results of internal audit assessments. The Committee is also briefed on culture and conduct risks and associated management actions arising from whistleblowing cases. The Chair of the GAC acts as the Group's whistleblowers' champion, with responsibility for ensuring and overseeing the integrity, independence and effectiveness of HSBC's policies and procedures on whistleblowing and the protection of whistleblowers. The Chair met with the Group Head of Conduct, Policy and Whistleblowing",

The transitions involve significant  operational complexity for financial institutions, and  industry approaches to transition continue to  develop. Areas of focus | The GAC noted management's early adoption of 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform  - Phase 2' amendments to IFRSs in relation to benchmark reform, including the disclosures necessary to support adoption of the reliefs. The Committee considered the risks and financial reporting impacts arising from  the Ibor transition. Management discussed actions being taken to mitigate the  risks, which included new product development and a client outreach  programme, to ensure we were ready to migrate and able to  explain the changes  and outcomes arising from the transition to clients. Management advised about  the operational challenges, such as the updates to current systems and processes  that were required to support the accounting for the Ibor transition, and our  external dependency on market and client readiness. In particular, management  drew attention to the potentially material impact on hedge accounting |\n\n## Committee evaluation and effectiveness\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Board committees, including the GAC, was conducted internally in 2021. Led by the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, the review concluded that the GAC continued to operate effectively. Management of meetings and reporting to the Board on discussions, in particular, were rated highly.\n\nThe review also made certain recommendations for continual improvement. The GAC was recommended to review the composition of the GAC to broaden the skillset, ensure clarity in roles and improve the coordination between the GAC and other Board committees and working groups relating to technology and ESG. Succession planning was also highlighted as a priority. The Committee considered the outcomes of the evaluation and accepts the findings. The evaluation outcomes were reported to the Board and the Committee will track progress against the recommendations during 2022.\n\n## Focus of future activities\n\nAt the beginning of each year, the Committee discusses its key priorities for the year ahead. In 2022, the Committee will continue to focus strongly on the remediation of controls, particularly those supporting regulatory reporting. The Committee will continue to monitor the execution of the Group's transformation programme and its impact on the risk and control environment. It will also monitor the interdependencies between the transformation programme and the implementation of large-scale regulatory change programmes, such as the Basel III reforms, the Ibor transition and IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'. A key priority will be to further embed ESG and climate-related disclosures to meet increasing expectations of stakeholders, in particular the implementation of robust processes and controls to support these disclosures. The Committee will focus on the audit tender strategy in preparation for the next re-tender, and will consider the impact of potential changes to the UK external audit market on HSBC's approach to audit and assurance.",

The outlook began to stabilise by the second quarter, with the roll-out of global vaccine programmes, and the GRC monitored the impact of new strains, including the Omicron variant.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the GRC provided oversight on the management of Covid-19-related financial risks, including the Group's release of expected credit loss reserves in response to the improving macroeconomic conditions. The Committee worked closely with the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer in strengthening the Group's risk management framework to be even more forward looking, granular and risk connected. The GRC continued its oversight of people and operational challenges presented by the pandemic and market conditions.\n\nThroughout the year, the GRC played a central role in reviewing and challenging management on the Group's regulatory submissions and programmes, including the Bank of England's requirements for the resolvability assessment framework. The GRC had primary non-executive responsibility for reviewing the outcomes of regulatory stress tests, including the Bank of England's biennial exploratory scenario on the financial risk from climate risk, and the 2021 solvency stress test. The GRC reviewed and challenged the Group's thermal coal phase-out policy and approach to climate-aligned finance in a joint meeting with the GAC. The Committee continued its oversight of the Group's preparations to meet the PRA's requirements on operational resilience.\n\nThe GRC continued to strengthen its composition, skills and experience to ensure that it remains well positioned to promote proactive risk governance. On 1 September 2021, we welcomed Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, a seasoned macroeconomic and political environment expert. Heidi Miller and Pauline van der Meer Mohr left the GRC on 28 May 2021. I extended our gratitude to each for their valued commitments and support to the GRC.\n\nThe GRC convened 11 formal meetings, two of which were joint meetings with the GAC, and 13 education and special meetings to review and challenge some of our most important responsibilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Jackson Tai\n\nChair\n\nGroup Risk Committee\n\n22 February 2022\n\n## Membership\n\n| Jackson Tai (Chair)            | Member since Sep 2016   | Meeting attendance  in 2021 1 11/11   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Dame Carolyn Fairbairn 2       | Sep 2021                | 3/3                                   |\n|                                | May 2020                |                                       |\n| Steven Guggenheimer            |                         | 11/11                                 |\n| Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade Kuribre\u00f1a   | May 2019                | 11/11                                 |\n| Heidi Miller 3 Eileen Murray 4 | Sep 2014 Jul 2020       | 6/6 9/11                              |\n| David Nish 5                   | Feb 2020                | 10/11                                 |\n| Pauline van der Meer Mohr 6    | Apr 2018                | 5/6                                   |\n\n- 1  These included two joint meetings with the Group Audit Committee.\n- 2  Dame Carolyn Fairbairn joined the GRC on 1 September 2021.\n- 3  Heidi Miller stepped down from the GRC on 28 May 2021.\n- 4  Eileen Murray was unable to attend two meetings due to personal circumstances.\n- 5  David Nish was unable to attend one meeting due to a prior commitment.\n- 6  Pauline van der Meer Mohr was unable to attend one meeting due to personal circumstances, and stepped down from the GRC on 28 May 2021.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\nThe GRC has overall non-executive responsibility for the oversight of risk-related matters and the risks impacting the Group. The GRC's key responsibilities are:\n\n- \u00b7 overseeing and advising the Board on all risk-related matters, including financial risks, non-financial risks and the effectiveness of the Group's conduct framework;\n- \u00b7 advising the Board on risk appetite-related matters, and key regulatory submissions;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's enterprise risk management framework and internal controls systems (other than internal financial controls overseen by the GAC); and\n- \u00b7 reviewing and challenging the Group's stress testing exercises.\n\n## Committee governance\n\nThe Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Chief Operating Officer, Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, Group Chief Legal Officer, Group Head of Internal Audit, Group Head of Finance and Group Head of Risk Strategy are standing attendees and regularly attend GRC meetings to contribute their subject matter expertise and insight. The Chair and members of the GRC also hold private meetings with the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer, the Group Head of Internal Audit and external auditor, PwC, following scheduled GRC meetings.\n\nThe participation of our senior business leaders, including the Group Chief Executive who attended 9 GRC meetings in 2021, reaffirmed the ownership and accountability of risks in the first line of defence and strengthened our holistic three lines of defence review of our most pressing risks.\n\nThe Chair meets regularly with the Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer to discuss priorities, track progress on key actions and plan GRC meeting agendas. The Chair also has regular meetings with members of senior management to discuss specific risk matters that arise during the year outside formal meetings. The Chair meets regularly with the GRC Secretary and other members of the Corporate Governance and Secretariat to ensure the GRC meets its governance responsibilities, and to consider input from stakeholders when finalising meeting agendas, tracking progress on actions and GRC priorities.

In particular, Directors' education meetings and GRC Chair's preview meetings strengthened the understanding of more technical topics and promoted constructive challenge. Areas covered included stress testing, ICAAP and ILAAP preparations, as well as recovery and resolution planning. Further details on these sessions are included in the 'Principal activities and significant issues considered during 2021' table starting on page 251.\n\n## Connectivity with principal subsidiary risk committees\n\nDuring 2021 the GRC continued to actively engage with principal subsidiary risk committees through the scheduled participation of principal subsidiary risk committee chairs at GRC meetings, and through two connectivity meetings with the principal subsidiary risk committee chairs. This participation and connectivity promoted the sharing of information and best practices between the GRC and principal subsidiary risk committees.\n\nThe GRC also received reports on the key risks facing particular principal subsidiaries at its regular meetings and continued to review certifications from the principal subsidiary risk committees. The certifications confirmed that the principal subsidiary risk committees had challenged management on the quality of the information provided, reviewed the actions proposed by management to address any emerging issues and that the risk management and internal control systems have been operating effectively.\n\nThe principal subsidiary risk committee chairs have attended regular GRC meetings, education meetings and special review meetings. The engagement facilitated the GRC's holistic review of regulatory submissions including stress tests, the Group recovery plan and the resolution self-assessment. The interactions furthered the GRC's understanding of the risk profile of the principal subsidiaries, leading to more comprehensive review and challenge by the GRC.\n\n## Collaborative oversight by the GRC and the GAC\n\nThe GRC collaborated with the GAC to address any areas of significant overlap and to oversee risk more comprehensively, through inter-committee communication and joint meetings. The GRC and GAC Chairs are members of both committees to strengthen connectivity and the flow of information between the committees.\n\n## Joint meetings with the GAC\n\nThe GRC and the GAC convened a meeting on data strategy and data management in April 2021, with the attendance and support of the Group Chief Executive and the chief executive officers of the three global businesses. The committees reviewed the Group's data strategy and the work required to embed its data policies, define its technology landscape and build a data-led culture. The committees challenged the first and second lines of defence on\n\nhow they are pursuing a data-driven strategy across four key areas for the Group. In the process the committees reviewed the regulatory landscape in relation to the Group's use of data, and the roles of the first and second lines of defence as co-owners of the management of data risk. The committees also reviewed the Group's approach to harnessing and using data to better unlock value for our customers.\n\nThe GRC and the GAC convened a joint meeting in November 2021 to review HSBC's thermal coal phase-out policy and the Group's approach to climate-aligned finance. The committees reviewed the progress made to deliver on the commitment to publish a policy to phase out the financing of coal-fired power and thermal coal mining by 2030 in EU/OECD markets, and by 2040 in other markets. The committees recommended the thermal coal phase-out policy and the approach to climate-aligned finance to the Board for approval.\n\n## Sustainable control environment\n\nThe GRC continued to review and challenge the Group's internal controls to improve the control environment. The GRC reviewed entity level controls, which form the basis of HSBC's control environment, as well as the results and remediation plans of a selfassessment performed by entity level control owners. At the request of the GRC Chair, with support of the GAC Chair, the GRC received an update on the thematic analysis and remediation plans for any overdue very high risk and high risk issues identified by Global Internal Audit.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nDuring 2021, the GRC and the GAC reviewed and challenged the Group's risk appetite and risk management framework relating to financial risk. In the process the committees discussed risk tolerance for financial reporting risk and financial reporting and tax risk, as well as improvement and remediation plans to enhance the broad regulatory reporting control environment.\n\n## Collaborative oversight by the GRC and the Technology Governance Working Group\n\nThe GRC worked closely with the Technology Governance Working Group to ensure appropriate alignment in the review, discussion, challenge and conclusions on technology risk-related matters. The GRC organised a technology-specific session with the working group in advance of the broader discussion at the joint GRC and GAC meeting on data strategy and data management. This ensured that the GRC benefited from the working group's expertise and challenge in advance of the GRC and GAC discussion. The GRC also arranged for the Technology Governance Working Group Co-Chairs to lead discussions on data, models and infrastructure at the GRC climate biennial exploratory scenario premeetings.\n\nCoordination and collaboration between the GRC and the Technology Working Group is supported by cross-membership. The GRC Chair is a member of the Technology Working Group and the Co-Chairs of the Technology Working Group are members of the GRC.",

Risk appetite The Group risk appetite statement defines the  Group's risk appetite and tolerance thresholds and  forms the basis of the first and second lines of  defence's management of risks, the

financial and non-financial management information at each GRC meeting. The GRC  continued to promote the development of more granular risk appetite statements  that are more forward looking and risk responsive. The Committee continued to  strengthen the linkage between risk appetite statements with the Group's corporate  strategy, stress testing, annual operating plan, as well as the Group's move towards  stronger, sustainably higher returns for stakeholders, so that it may serve customers  well.

This included strengthening the focus of meeting agendas, and further increasing the GRC's engagement with the Risk and Compliance functions and principal subsidiary risk committee chairs.\n\nContinuing the commitment to regular evaluation, the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer performed an annual review of the effectiveness of the GRC in December 2021. The evaluation concluded that the GRC continued to operate effectively and in line with regulatory requirements, and identified enhancements, including a review of GRC composition, to help strengthen the GRC's ability to effectively review and challenge the Group's risk profile. Other recommendations included: strengthening the focus of agendas with an ongoing emphasis on emerging risks; continued enhancement to papers and presentations; optimising the use of member time spent outside of formal governance; and even stronger coordination of the roles of the Board committees. As with the GAC, succession planning will also remain a priority. The outcomes of the evaluation have been reported to the Board, and the GRC will track the progress in implementing recommendations during 2022.\n\n## Focus of future activities\n\nThe GRC's focus for 2022 will include the following activities. It will:\n\n- \u00b7 oversee the continued strengthening of the Group's risk appetite and risk management framework;\n- \u00b7 continue to review the Group's work to enhance its credit risk capabilities and culture;\n- \u00b7 continue to oversee financial crime and fraud;\n- \u00b7 oversee the delivery against climate change commitments and enhancing climate risk capabilities;\n- \u00b7 continue the oversight of the delivery of technology-related programmes including the adoption of Cloud platforms, and enhancement of the Group's IT systems/platform; and\n- \u00b7 oversee key regulatory actions, including the implementation of the Group's operational resilience strategy on a global basis, recovery and resolution, and stress testing submissions and capabilities.",

We continued to execute our strategy at pace. The decisions the Committee has taken reflect the improvement in the Group's performance and progress towards its strategic targets. I have summarised our decisions in this statement.\n\nAt the 2022 Annual General Meeting ('AGM'), we will be seeking shareholder approval for a renewed Directors' remuneration policy. Our current policy received 97% of votes cast in favour at our 2019 AGM and its implementation received strong support with more than 96% of votes cast in favour in both 2020 and 2021. The Committee reviewed the remuneration policy, considering carefully whether it provides a fair and competitive remuneration opportunity to incentivise long-term performance. We also noted that the UK regulatory requirements currently restrict us from using a structure with a greater focus on variable pay and lower fixed pay.\n\nBased on this review, engagement with our largest shareholders, and the premise that the policy, within our regulatory framework, supports the execution of our strategy, we have decided to roll forward our current policy with no changes to the fixed or variable pay structure and approach.\n\n## Membership\n\n|                                   | Member since   | Meeting attendance in  2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Pauline van der Meer Mohr (Chair) | Jan 2016       | 6/6                           |\n| Rachel Duan                       | Sept 2021      | 2/2                           |\n| Dame Carolyn Fairbairn            | Sept 2021      | 2/2                           |\n| James Forese                      | May 2020       | 6/6                           |\n| Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade Kuribre\u00f1a      | May 2021       | 4/4                           |\n| Henri de Castries 1               | May 2017       | 2/3                           |\n| Irene Lee 1                       | Apr 2018       | 3/3                           |\n| David Nish 1                      | May 2017       | 2/2                           |\n\n- 1  David Nish stepped down from the Committee on 23 February 2021; Henri de Castries and Irene Lee stepped down from the Committee on 28 May 2021.\n\n## Performance in 2021\n\n## Financial performance\n\nThe Group's financial performance improved in 2021 and all regions were profitable. Reported profit before tax of $18.9bn was up $10.1bn from 2020. Adjusted profit before tax of $21.9bn was up $9.6bn, with net ECL releases more than offsetting the impact of lower revenue, which reflected continuing external pressures during 2021. We continued to demonstrate strong cost control. Despite inflationary pressures and continued investment in technology, our adjusted costs were $32.1bn. Our return on tangible equity ('RoTE') improved from 3.1% in 2020 to 8.3%. We also achieved a $104bn RWA reduction in legacy assets and lowreturn areas and we have now achieved 95% of the $110bn reduction targeted by the end of 2022. We were able to restart our dividend payments to shareholders and we remain well placed to fund growth and step up capital returns.\n\n## Workforce pay\n\n## Support for our colleagues\n\nThe well-being of our people remained a critical focus, specifically as the operating environment continued to be challenging for many colleagues and their families. The pandemic, which remains a presence in all of our lives, continued to impact our customers, colleagues and communities and we have continued to provide support to our colleagues.\n\nWhile we have sustained our employee engagement scores, which remain above pre-pandemic levels, we are monitoring carefully the well-being of our people. Our survey results showed that overall well-being has remained stable with 82% of our colleagues reporting positive mental health. We are moving to a hybrid working model wherever possible, giving people the flexibility to work in a way that balances the needs of our customers, their teams and their personal preferences.\n\nTo help people to develop skills for the changing world around us, we launched Future Skills in September 2021, supporting colleagues to explore new personal, digital, data and sustainability skills through a series of learning activities and events.\n\n## Group variable pay pool\n\n2021 was characterised by a sharp economic rebound and an extraordinarily competitive labour market. Our financial performance was strong, and it is critical for our long-term performance that we continue to attract and retain the talent necessary to deliver our strategic priorities. As a Committee, we reflected on this throughout the year, and particularly when we reviewed and agreed the Group variable pay pool of $3,495m, a year-on-year increase of 31%.\n\nIn deciding the Group variable pay pool, we reviewed performance against financial and non-financial metrics set out in the Group risk framework, including conduct. We took into account the improvement in the Group's financial performance with adjusted profit before tax up 79%, our strong capital position, the reinstatement of dividends and the capital return to shareholders through the up to $2bn buy-back announced in October 2021. Subsequently, the Group has announced that it intends to initiate a further up to $1bn share buy-back, to commence after the existing",

        "page_content": "buy-back has concluded. We also took into account the operating environment and the challenges created by a very competitive market for talent manifesting through higher than normal voluntary attrition rates.\n\nThe pool was determined in line with our countercyclical funding methodology, whereby variable pay as a percentage of profits generally reduces as performance increase. In 2020, the variable pay pool was reduced by 20% when the adjusted profit before tax was down 45% to recognise the need to remain competitive in retaining talent even in challenging circumstances. In 2021, our countercyclical approach meant that while the adjusted profit before tax was up 79%, the pool increased by 31%.\n\nAs part of the year-end pay review, the Committee considered the remuneration outcomes. Overall, total compensation across all our businesses was up relative to 2020. For our junior colleagues, the increase is slightly lower, as their outcomes last year were broadly stable in order to protect their outcomes against material year-onyear volatility. Outcomes correlated well with performance and behaviours, with the largest increase in variable pay for those who performed most strongly and who acted as role models for our values. Fixed pay increases were targeted towards junior colleagues to help address the impact of rising inflation in many of our locations. The outcomes were in line with our pay principles and the approach decided by the Committee for 2021.\n\n## Key remuneration decisions for Directors\n\n## Executive Directors' annual performance assessment\n\nThe financial measures in the executive Directors' 2021 scorecards were growing revenue in Asia, meeting the Group's adjusted cost target and our strategic priority of reducing RWAs in legacy assets and low-return areas. Strategic performance measures were customer satisfaction, employee engagement and diversity and personal objectives aligned with delivery of our strategy.\n\nOverall, the Committee considered the executive Directors delivered a strong performance. The adjusted cost performance was above the minimum set for the year. As noted earlier, strong performance in RWA reduction, with 95% of our end-2022 target already achieved, led to a maximum payout against the RWA performance metrics. We did not meet the target for revenue growth in Asia, primarily due to the impact of low interest rates on certain business lines.\n\nWe also made good progress on strategic measures, by improving customer satisfaction, maintaining the high level of employee engagement from 2020, exceeding our gender representation target in senior leadership roles and executing our strategy at pace (see page 268 for details).\n\n## Executive Directors' annual incentive scorecard outcome\n\nThis resulted in an overall annual incentive outcome of 57.30% for Noel Quinn and 60.43% for Ewen Stevenson (further details are provided on page 262). These are slightly below the 2020 scorecard outcomes and results in an annual incentive award of \u00a31.59m for Noel Quinn (2020: \u00a31.60m before voluntarily waiver of cash bonus) and \u00a30.98m for Ewen Stevenson (2020: \u00a30.90m before voluntary waiver of cash bonus).\n\n## Long-term incentive ('LTI') for executive Directors\n\nNoel Quinn and Ewen Stevenson will receive LTI awards of \u00a34.13m and \u00a32.41m respectively, in respect of their performance for 2021 and subject to a three-year forward-looking performance period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2024. The Committee decided to retain the RoTE, relative total shareholder return ('TSR'), capital reallocation to Asia and transition to net zero measures in the LTI scorecard given their strong alignment with the Group's strategy. Details of the measures and targets are set out on page 271.\n\n## Executive Directors' fixed pay for 2022\n\nWe have increased the base salary of our executive Directors by 3.5%, effective from 1 March 2022. The Committee considered the increase was necessary to ensure that the total remuneration opportunity of our executive Directors does not fall further behind\n\ndesired levels based on the size, complexity and international peer group of the Group. This was discussed with shareholders during our engagement with them on the new Directors' remuneration policy. The increase is in line with the average salary increase for our wider workforce.\n\n## New Directors' remuneration policy\n\nWe are proposing to roll forward our current remuneration policy for shareholder approval at the 2022 AGM. During the year, we undertook a review of the policy based on the key principles that it should be easy to understand, align reward with stakeholder interests, incentivise long-term performance, be competitive and meet expectations of investors and regulators.\n\nAs part of the review, the Committee considered whether the current policy provides a remuneration opportunity that is appropriate given the size and complexity of the Group's operations and is commensurate with its aim of fairly remunerating executives for delivering its strategic priorities. The review clearly demonstrated that over time, HSBC's overall remuneration opportunity has fallen significantly behind desired levels to reflect the calibre of the executives and positioning against international peers. The Committee also noted that the UK regulatory requirements currently restrict us from using a remuneration structure with a greater focus on variable pay for performance, which is typically used by our international peers.\n\nWe engaged with our shareholders to take into account their views on our policy and remuneration structure. As ever, we found engagement with our shareholders to be very helpful and we were pleased with the level of feedback and support received. Noting the strong support from shareholders for our current policy and on the basis that it supports the execution of our strategy within our regulatory framework, we are proposing to roll forward our current policy for shareholders' approval at the 2022 AGM. We will keep the issue on appropriate positioning of our executive Directors' total remuneration opportunity under review for the duration of the policy. Further details of the remuneration policy and how each element supports the Group's strategy are set out on page 257.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee I would like to thank our shareholders for their engagement and feedback. The Committee looks forward to maintaining an open and transparent dialogue in 2022.\n\n## Our annual report on remuneration\n\nThe section on Directors' remuneration policy provides an overview of our remuneration policy for our Directors, for which we are seeking shareholder approval at the 2022 AGM.\n\nIn the annual report section, we provide details of decisions made for executive Directors in respect of their 2021 remuneration for which, along with this statement, we will seek shareholder approval with an advisory vote at the 2022 AGM.\n\nWe also provide details of our remuneration framework for our Group colleagues. In the additional remuneration disclosure section of this report, we provide other related disclosures.\n\nAs Chair of the Committee, I hope you will support our remuneration policy and the 2021 Directors' remuneration report.\n\nFinally, as announced in January, I will step down as Chair of this Committee and from the Board at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM. An update on my successor will be announced in due course.\n\n## Pauline van der Meer Mohr\n\n## Chair\n\nGroup Remuneration Committee\n\n22 February 2022",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration policy\n\nThis section sets outs the Directors' remuneration policy proposed for shareholders' approval at the AGM on 29 April 2022. We have made no changes to the remuneration structure or to the maximum opportunity payable for each element of remuneration and are seeking to roll forward our current policy. Minor changes have been made to provide the Committee with sufficient flexibility to implement the policy as intended over its term. Subject to receiving shareholder approval, the policy is intended to apply immediately for three years to the end of the AGM in 2025, although we may seek shareholders' approval for a new policy during the period depending on regulatory developments, changes to our strategy or competitive pressures.\n\n## Remuneration policy - key principles\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the Board the Directors' remuneration policy to be put forward for approval by shareholders.\n\nThe guiding principles that form the basis of our review of the remuneration policy for Directors are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The rationale and operation of the policy should be easy to understand and transparent.\n- \u00b7 There should be a strong alignment between reward and the interests of our stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and employees.\n- \u00b7 The policy should maintain a focus on long-term performance.\n- \u00b7 The total compensation package should be competitive to ensure we can retain and attract talent to deliver our strategic priorities.\n- \u00b7 The structure should meet the expectations of investors and our regulators.\n\n## Setting the policy\n\nThe Committee undertook a detailed review of the Group's remuneration policy during 2021 to assess whether it continues to be appropriate based on the size and complexity of its operations, investor feedback, best practice and market developments. Input was received from the Group Chairman and management while ensuring that conflicts of interest were suitably mitigated. Input was also provided by the Committee's appointed independent advisers throughout the process.\n\nAs highlighted in the 2020 Directors' remuneration report, the Committee - while conscious of external sentiment - planned to focus the review on whether overall remuneration levels remain appropriate and support the delivery of our strategic priorities.\n\nThe Committee has become increasingly concerned that, over time, the remuneration opportunity of our executive Directors has fallen behind desired levels to reflect their calibre and positioning against our international peers. This is supported by benchmarked data for comparable roles in organisations similar in size, geographical presence and with whom we compete for talent.\n\nThe Committee noted that UK regulatory requirements restrict us from using a remuneration structure with a greater focus on variable pay for performance, which is typically used by our international peers. Our preference would be to use such a structure to improve the total compensation opportunity of our executive Directors. This view was supported by a number of our shareholders, who also expressed a preference for a structure with lower fixed pay and higher variable pay opportunity, but understood that UK regulatory rules impact our ability to use such a structure.\n\nThe Committee also noted that our current policy and its implementation have received strong support from shareholders over the last few years. This was reaffirmed during our engagement with shareholders on the new policy.\n\nBased on the review and taking into account the feedback received during our discussions with shareholders, we are proposing to roll forward our current policy for shareholders' approval at the 2022 AGM. We will keep the issues on appropriate positioning of our executive Directors' total remuneration opportunity under review throughout the duration of the policy.\n\n## Other matters considered as part of policy review\n\nWe also reviewed the remuneration structure, fixed and variable pay mix, the deferral and post-vesting retention periods and our shareholding guidelines to ensure there is strong alignment between reward and interests of our stakeholders. We also considered whether a formal post-employment shareholding policy should be introduced. For this purpose, the Committee took into consideration the following features of our existing policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Shares delivered to executive Directors as part of the fixed pay allowance ('FPA') have a five-year retention period, which continues to apply following a departure of an executive Director.\n- \u00b7 Shares delivered as part of an annual incentive award are subject to a one-year retention period, which continues to apply following a departure of an executive Director.\n- \u00b7 LTI awards have a seven-year vesting period with a one-year post-vesting retention period, which is not accelerated on departure. The weighted average holding period of an LTI award within HSBC is therefore six years, in excess of the fiveyear holding period typically implemented by FTSE-listed companies. When an executive Director ceases employment, if they are treated as a good leaver under our policy, any LTI awards granted will continue to be released over a period of up to eight years, subject to the outcome of performance conditions.\n\nReflecting on the above, and the in-employment shareholding requirement of up to 400% of salary for executive Directors, we agreed our existing policy structure achieves the objective of ensuring there is ongoing alignment of executive Directors' interests with shareholder experience post-cessation of their employment. We discussed this with major shareholders during our consultation on the new policy.",

The Committee can adjust the payout based on the outcome of the performance measures, if it considers that the  payout determined does not appropriately reflect the overall position and performance of the Group for the relevant performance |\n|                     | The scorecard outcome may also be subject to a risk and compliance modifier and/or a capital underpin under which the  Committee will have the discretion to adjust down the overall scorecard outcome, taking into account performance against those  factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                     | The Committee has the discretion to:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |",

The Committee reviews the Group reward strategy to ensure it continues to support HSBC's overall ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate the best people, who are aligned to HSBC's values and committed to maintaining a long-term career within the Group. Full details of our remuneration framework for our colleagues are disclosed on page 279.\n\nOur executive Directors' remuneration policy aligns with our remuneration policy for our colleagues as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Externally sourced market data is used to help guide pay decisions for colleagues, including executive Directors.\n- \u00b7 The base salary increases for executive Directors take into consideration base salary increases of colleagues across the Group, and relevant market conditions.\n- \u00b7 The cash in lieu of pension allowance for executive Directors will not exceed the maximum contribution (as a percentage of salary) that can be made for the majority of colleagues in the relevant jurisdiction.\n- \u00b7 All colleagues are eligible to be considered for an annual incentive award based on their performance and behaviour ratings. The variable pay for all colleagues, including executive Directors, is funded from a Group variable pay pool that is determined by reference to Group performance. Colleagues who receive a variable pay award above a certain level have a portion of their award deferred over a period of three to seven years.",

Our management engages with colleagues, either on a Group-wide basis or in the context of smaller focus groups, to solicit feedback generally on a wide range of matters, including pay. Our annual survey on pay seeks the views of all colleagues on their performance and pay outcomes. The Committee reviews the outcomes of the survey and determines the key remuneration priorities for the forthcoming year. Many of our colleagues are also shareholders and therefore have the opportunity to vote on the policy at the 2022 AGM.\n\nAs part of our annual calendar, the Committee Chair also hosts a forum attended by the chairs of our principal subsidiaries boards and remuneration committees. This event allows the Committee to understand local market factors and feedback gathered from employees, within the regions where we operate, on pay and\n\nperformance matters. This helps both management and the Committee to determine the prioritisation of pay budgets, and allows the Committee to ensure that funding is directed to the areas of need in support of the Group's strategic ambitions.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee has requested that a detailed review of the reward strategy be conducted to reflect the changes in the Group's strategy, and our employee value proposition as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as to ensure that we are well positioned versus developments in the market, both within financial services and more broadly. This will include engagement with colleagues to ensure their feedback on the various elements of our reward strategy can be taken into account as part of the Committee's decision making.

Deloitte LLP's engagement with the Committee was extended during 2021. Deloitte provided benchmarking data on remuneration policy matters and independent advice to the Committee. Deloitte also provided tax compliance and other advisory services to the Group. Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.\n\nThe Committee also received advice from Willis Towers Watson on market data and remuneration trends. Willis Towers Watson was appointed by management after considering invited proposals from similar consultancy firms. It provides actuarial support to Global Finance and benchmarking data and services related to benefits administration for our Group employees. The Committee was satisfied the advice provided by Deloitte and Willis Towers Watson was objective and independent in 2021.\n\nFor 2021, total fees of \u00a3176,550 and \u00a335,060 were incurred in relation to remuneration advice provided by Deloitte and Willis Towers Watson, respectively. This was based on pre-agreed fees and a time-and-materials basis.\n\n## Attendees and interaction with other Board committees\n\nDuring the year, Noel Quinn as the Group Chief Executive provided regular briefings to the Committee. In addition, the Committee engaged with and received updates from the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Mark Tucker, Group Chairman;\n- \u00b7 Elaine Arden, Group Chief Human Resources Officer;\n- \u00b7 Jenny Craik, Group Head of Performance Management, Reward and Employee Relations;\n- \u00b7 Alexander Lowen, Former Group Head of Performance Management and Reward;\n- \u00b7 Pam Kaur, Group Chief Risk and Compliance Officer;\n- \u00b7 Colin Bell, former Group Chief Compliance Officer;\n- \u00b7 Bob Hoyt, Group Chief Legal Officer;\n- \u00b7 Shawn Chen, Group General Counsel for Litigation and Regulatory Enforcement; and\n- \u00b7 Aileen Taylor, Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer.\n\nThe Committee also received feedback and input from the Group Risk Committee and Group Audit Committee on risk, conduct and compliance-related matters relevant to remuneration.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Committee was internally facilitated for 2021. The review concluded that the Committee continued to operate effectively, with a number of positive aspects of the Committee's operation and practices highlighted. Areas identified for focus during 2022 included:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee needs to receive suitable and relevant data and insight to support its discussion and decision making on pay, including for the wider workforce.\n- \u00b7 It should facilitate the right level of preparation for its members.\n- \u00b7 The Committee should consider how best the Committee's advisers and other external consultants could add value and insights on developing market context and stakeholder views to its discussions.\n\nThe Committee discussed the outcomes of the evaluation in January 2022, and endorsed the findings and actions to be taken. The outcomes of the evaluation have been reported to the Board and the Committee will track progress on the recommendations through the year.\n\n## Voting results from Annual General Meeting\n\nThe table below shows the voting results from our last AGM.\n\n## 2021 Annual General Meeting voting results\n\n|                     | For           | Against     | Withheld   |\n|---------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|\n| Remuneration report | 97.30 %       | 2.70%       | --         |\n| (votes cast)        | 8,898,898,415 | 246,557,676 | 12,404,292 |\n| Remuneration policy | 97.36 %       | 2.64%       | --         |\n| (2019) (votes cast) | 9,525,856,097 | 258,383,075 | 47,468,297 |",

For 2021, both executive Directors met this requirement.\n\nThe level of award is determined by applying the outcome of their annual incentive scorecard to the maximum opportunity. The scorecard measures, weighting and targets were determined at the start of the financial year taking into account the Group's plan for 2021 and the Group's strategic priorities and commitments.\n\nThe financial targets were set at the start of the financial year when there was significant uncertainty and challenging circumstances, including the emergence of new Covid-19 variants and ongoing low interest rates. For strategic measures, the performance assessment involved considering performance against targets set in line with our commitments, such as employee diversity, survey results for employee experience and customer satisfaction measures, as well as an assessment of the progress made and momentum generated to achieve our strategic priorities.\n\nThe Group's financial performance improved in 2021. In particular, the Committee noted:\n\n- \u00b7 reported profit before tax was $18.9bn, which represented an increase of 115% compared with 2020 and an increase of 42% compared with 2019;\n- \u00b7 strong cost controls were demonstrated, despite inflationary pressures and continued investment in technology, with adjusted costs at $32.15bn;\n- \u00b7 RoTE was 8.3%; and\n\n## Annual incentive assessment\n\n|                                                          |                           |                           |                           | Noel Quinn     | Noel Quinn      | Noel Quinn   | Ewen Stevenson   | Ewen Stevenson   | Ewen Stevenson   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                          | Minimum  (25%  payout)    | Maximum  (100%  payout)   | Performance               | Weighting  (%) | Assessment  (%) | Outcome (%)  | Weighting  (%)   | Assessment  (%)  | Outcome  (%)     |\n| Adjusted cost ($bn)                                      | 32.27                     | 31.47                     | 32.15                     | 20.00          | 36.25           | 7.25         | 20.00            | 36.25            | 7.25             |\n| Revenue growth in Asia (%)                               | 0.44%                     | 0.89%                     | -5.96 %                   | 20.00          | -               | -            | 15.00            | -                | -                |\n| RWA reduction in legacy assets/low- return areas ($bn) 1 | 38.35                     | 42.40                     | 43.00                     | 20.00          | 100.00          | 20.00        | 15.00            | 100.00           | 15.00            |\n| Customer satisfaction                                    | See following section for | See following section for | See following section for | 15.00          | 67.00           | 10.05        | 15.00            | 67.00            | 10.05            |\n| Employee experience                                      | non-financial performance | non-financial performance | non-financial performance | 15.00          | 75.00           | 11.25        | 15.00            | 75.00            | 11.25            |\n| Personal objectives                                      | commentary                | commentary                | commentary                | 10.00          | 87.50           | 8.75         | 20.00            | 84.40            | 16.88            |\n| Total                                                    |                           |                           |                           | 100.00         |                 | 57.30        | 100.00           |                  | 60.43            |\n| Maximum annual incentive  opportunity (\u00a3000)             |                           |                           |                           |                |                 | \u00a32,776       |                  |                  | \u00a31,619           |\n| Annual incentive outcome (\u00a3000)                          |                           |                           |                           |                |                 | \u00a31,590       |                  |                  | \u00a3978             |\n\n- \u00b7 there was a more positive shareholder experience, including share price performance and shareholder returns through dividends and capital returns.\n\nAs set out in the scorecard assessment table below, while cost performance was towards the lower end of the target range, it was broadly in line with the Group's revised adjusted cost guidance of $32bn, reflecting increases in technology investment and inflationary pressures. Adjusted revenue in Asia was down, due mainly to the impact of interest rate cuts. However, wealth and trade revenues grew, while loans and advances increased by $33bn for the year, indicating that demand remains high. We made strong progress towards our core objective of reducing RWAs in low-return franchises, achieving $104bn by the end of 2021 and more than 95% of our cumulative target for the end of 2022. We also made good progress on strategic measures, by improving customer satisfaction, maintaining the high level of employee engagement from 2020 and exceeding our gender representation target in senior leadership roles.\n\nOverall, this level of performance resulted in a payout of 57.30% of the maximum for Noel Quinn and 60.43% for Ewen Stevenson.\n\nThe annual incentive scorecard is subject to a risk and compliance modifier, which provides the Committee with the discretion to adjust down the overall scorecard outcome, taking into account information such as any risk metrics being outside of tolerance for a significant period of time and any risk management failures that have resulted in significant customer detriment, reputational damage and/or regulatory censure. Taking into account the Group's performance against the risk metrics, inputs from the Group Risk Committee and overall performance of the executive Directors, the Committee determined that the application of the risk modifier was not required for 2021.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed these outcomes in the context of a number of internal and external considerations to determine whether it should exercise its discretion to reduce the formulaic outcome. The Committee determined that the 2021 formulaic outcome appropriately rewards the executive Directors for their performance within the context of Group's financial performance and overall stakeholder experience.",

The awards, in general, match the performance, vesting and retention periods attached to the awards forfeited. The values included in the table for 2020 relate to his 2017 LTI award granted by the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc ('RBS'), now renamed as NatWest Group plc ('NatWest'), for performance year 2016, which was determined by applying the performance assessment outcome of 56.25% as disclosed in NatWest's Annual Report and Accounts 2019 (page 91) to the maximum number of shares subject to performance conditions. This resulted in a payout equivalent to 78.09% of NatWest award shares that were forfeited and replaced with HSBC shares. A total of 313,608 shares were granted in respect of his 2017 LTI replacement award at a share price of \u00a36.643. The HSBC share price was \u00a35.845 when the awards ceased to be subject to performance conditions, with no value attributable to share price appreciation. The value included in the table for 2021 relates to Ewen Stevenson's 2018 LTI replacement award granted by NatWest for performance year 2017 and was subject to a pre-vest performance test assessed and disclosed by NatWest in its Annual Report and Accounts 2020 (page 135). As no adjustment was proposed for Ewen Stevenson by NatWest, a total of 177,883 shares granted in respect of his 2018 LTI replacement award ceased to be subject to performance conditions. These awards were granted at a share price of \u00a36.643 and the HSBC share price was \u00a34.240 when the awards ceased to be subject to performance conditions, with no value attributable to share price appreciation.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe values of the significant benefits in the single figure table are set out in the following table. 1\n\n|                                     |   Noel Quinn |      |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|------|\n| (\u00a3000)                              |         2021 | 2020 |\n| Insurance benefit (non-taxable)     |           67 |   51 |\n| Car and driver (UK and Hong Kong) 2 |           87 |  139 |\n\n## Long-term incentive awards\n\n(Audited)\n\n## Long-term incentive in respect of 2021\n\nAfter taking into account performance for 2021, the Committee decided to grant Noel Quinn and Ewen Stevenson LTI awards of \u00a34,131,000 and \u00a32,410,000, respectively.\n\nThe 2021 LTI awards will have a three-year performance period starting 1 January 2022. During this period, performance will be assessed based on four equally weighted measures: two financial measures to incentivise value creation for our shareholders; a measure linked to our climate ambitions; and a measure for relative total shareholder return ('TSR'). This is consistent with the measures used for our last LTI award.\n\nRoTE is a key measure of our financial performance and how we generate returns that deliver value for our shareholders. The target range for this measure is aligned with our medium-term objective of achieving a RoTE of 10% or more.\n\nCapital reallocation to Asia remains one of the key levers of our strategy and business transformation plan. This measure will be assessed based on the share of Group tangible equity allocated to\n\nAsia at the end of the performance period. The target range for this measure is aligned with our long-term strategic plan.\n\nThe transition to net zero scorecard measures are aligned to our strategic priority of bringing carbon emissions in our own operations to net zero by 2030 and supporting our customers in the transition to a more sustainable future, by providing and facilitating $750bn to $1tn of sustainable finance and investment over the same time period. Targets are linked to this climate ambition and performance will be assessed based on the reduction in our carbon footprint and the financing we provide to our clients in their net zero transition.\n\nRelative TSR rewards executive Directors based on comparison of the TSR performance of the Group and a relevant peer group. No changes were made to the peer group for this LTI award. The Committee will review the TSR peer group for future LTI awards to ensure the peer group remains appropriate, taking into account the progress in the execution of our strategic shifts in our geographical and business mix, notably future growth investment in Asia and wealth business.\n\nThe LTI continues to be subject to a risk and compliance modifier, which gives the Committee the discretion to adjust down the",

If the CET1 ratio at the end of the performance period is below the CET1 risk tolerance level set in the risk appetite statement, then the assessment for these measures will be reduced to nil.\n\naccordance with regulatory requirements, the number of shares to be awarded will be adjusted to reflect the expected dividend yield of the shares over the vesting period.\n\nTo the extent performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period, the awards will vest in five equal annual instalments commencing from around the third anniversary of the grant date.

In accordance with the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM, the LTI award was determined at 293% of salary for Noel Quinn and 286% of salary for Ewen Stevenson. The number of shares to be granted was determined by taking HSBC's closing share price of \u00a34.262 taken on 26 February 2021, and applying a discount based on HSBC's expected dividend yield of 5% per annum for the vesting period (\u00a33.324).\n\nThe above table does not include details of shares issued as part of the fixed pay allowance and shares issued as part of the 2020 annual incentive award that vested on grant and were not subject to any further service or performance conditions.

Morgan Chase & Co., Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and UBS Group.\n\n## Executive Directors' interests in shares\n\n## (Audited)\n\nThe shareholdings of executive Directors in 2021, including the shareholdings of their connected persons, at 31 December 2021 (or the date they stepped down from the Board, if earlier) are set out below. The following table shows the comparison of shareholdings with the company shareholding guidelines. There have been no changes in the shareholdings of the executive Directors from 31 December 2021 to the date of this report.\n\nIndividuals have five years from their appointment date to build up the recommended levels of shareholding. In line with investor guidance, for executive Directors, unvested shares which are not subject to forward-looking performance conditions (on a net of tax basis) will count towards their shareholding requirement under the new policy proposed for shareholder approval at the 2022 AGM.\n\nThe Committee reviews compliance with the shareholding requirement and has full discretion in determining if any unvested shares should be taken into consideration for assessing compliance with this requirement, taking into account shareholder expectations and guidelines. The Committee also has full discretion in determining any penalties for non-compliance.\n\nWith regard to post-employment shareholding arrangements,\n\nwe believe that our remuneration structure achieves the objective of ensuring there is ongoing alignment of executive Directors' interests with shareholder experience post-cessation of their employment due to the following features of the policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Shares delivered to executive Directors as part of the FPA have a five-year retention period, which continues to apply following a departure of an executive Director.\n- \u00b7 Shares delivered as part of an annual incentive award are subject to a one-year retention period, which continues to apply following a departure of an executive Director.\n- \u00b7 LTI awards have a seven-year vesting period with a one-year post-vesting retention period, which is not accelerated on departure. The weighted average holding period of an LTI award within HSBC is therefore six years, in excess of the fiveyear holding period typically implemented by FTSE-listed companies. When an executive Director ceases employment as a good leaver under our policy, any LTI awards granted will continue to be released over a period of up to eight years, subject to the outcome of performance conditions.\n\nHSBC operates an anti-hedging policy under which individuals are not permitted to enter into any personal hedging strategies in relation to HSBC shares subject to a vesting and/or retention period.",

For Group Executives, their shareholding requirement is 250% of salary and unvested shares that are not subject to forward-looking performance conditions (on a net of tax basis) are counted towards their shareholding requirement.\n\n## Total pension entitlements\n\n## (Audited)\n\nNo employees who served as executive Directors during the year have a right to amounts under any HSBC final salary pension scheme for their services as executive Directors or are entitled to additional benefits in the event of early retirement. There is no retirement age set for Directors, but the normal retirement age for colleagues is 65.\n\n## Payments to past Directors\n\n## (Audited)\n\nDetails of the 2018 LTI outcome, in which John Flint (former Group Chief Executive) and Marc Moses (former Group Chief Risk Officer) participated, are outlined on page 272. No payments were made to, or in respect of, former Directors in the year in excess of the minimum threshold of \u00a350,000 set for this purpose.\n\n## Payments for loss of office\n\n## (Audited)\n\nNo payments for loss of office were made to, or in respect of, former or current Directors in the year.\n\n## External appointments\n\nDuring 2021, executive Directors did not receive any fees from external appointments.\n\n## Implementation of remuneration policy in 2022 for executive Directors\n\nThe base salary of our executive Directors will increase by 3.5% with effect from 1 March 2022. The Committee determined the increase was necessary to ensure that the total remuneration opportunity of our executive Directors does not fall further behind desired levels based on the size, complexity and international peer group of the Group. This was discussed with shareholders during our engagement with them on the new Directors' remuneration policy.\n\nThe increase is in line with the average salary increase of our wider workforce. There is no other change to the remuneration elements of our executive Directors.\n\nThe following table summarises how the maximum opportunity for each element of our remuneration policy for executive Directors will be implemented in 2022.\n\n## Implementation of remuneration policy in 2022\n\n|                         | Summary of operation                                                                             | Noel Quinn                                      | Ewen Stevenson                                  |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Base salary             | 3.5% increase with effect from 1 March 2022 (in line  with the increase for the wider workforce) | \u00a31,336,000                                      | \u00a3779,000                                        |\n| Fixed pay allowance     | No change                                                                                        | \u00a31,700,000                                      | \u00a31,085,000                                      |\n| Cash in lieu of pension | No change                                                                                        | 10% of base salary                              | 10% of base salary                              |\n| Benefits                | No change                                                                                        | Same benefit provisions will be made available  | Same benefit provisions will be made available  |\n| Annual incentive        | No change in maximum opportunity                                                                 | Maximum opportunity will be 215% of base salary | Maximum opportunity will be 215% of base salary |\n| Long-term incentive     | No change in maximum opportunity                                                                 | Maximum opportunity will be 320% of base salary | Maximum opportunity will be 320% of base salary |\n\n## 2022 annual incentive scorecards\n\nThe 2022 annual incentive scorecard measures for our executive Directors have been set to deliver growth and business transformation. The targets for the measures have been set, reflecting on the Group's plan for 2022 and the macroeconomic uncertainty, including the interest rate environment and inflation.\n\nThe Committee will continue to retain discretion to adjust the formulaic outcomes of scorecards, taking into account factors such as Group profits, wider business performance and stakeholder experience, to ensure executive reward is aligned with underlying Group performance and the broader stakeholder experience.\n\nThe weightings and performance measures for the 2022 annual incentive award for executive Directors are disclosed below. The performance targets are commercially sensitive and it would be\n\ndetrimental to the Group's interests to disclose them at the start of the financial year. Subject to commercial sensitivity, we will disclose the targets for a given year in the Annual Report and Accounts for that year in the Directors' remuneration report.\n\nExecutive Directors will be eligible for an annual incentive award of up to 215% of base salary.\n\nThe 2022 annual incentive scorecards for members of our Group Executive Committee include similar measures as for the executive Directors to drive performance in each of our businesses, functions and regions that contribute to the overall success of the Group. The Group Executives' LTI awards in respect of 2021 will also be subject to the same three-year forward-looking scorecard measures and targets as set out on page 271.",

The 2022 annual incentive scorecard is subject to a risk and compliance modifier, which allows the\n\nCommittee the discretion to adjust down the overall scorecard outcome to ensure that the Group operates soundly when achieving its financial targets. For this purpose, the Committee will receive information including any risk thresholds outside of tolerance for a significant period of time and any risk management failures that have resulted in significant customer detriment, reputational damage and/or regulatory censure.\n\n## Non-executive Directors\n\n(Audited)\n\nThe following table shows the total fees and benefits of non-executive Directors for 2021, together with comparative figures for 2020.\n\n| Fees and benefits (Audited)     | Fees 1   | Fees 1   | Benefits 2   | Benefits 2   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|\n| (\u00a3000)                          | 2021     | 2020     | 2021         | 2020         | 2021    | 2020    |\n| Henri de Castries 3             | 82       | 202      | 22           | 1            | 104     | 203     |\n| Laura Cha 3, 4                  | 242      | 587      | 18           | -            | 260     | 587     |\n| Rachel Duan 5                   | 67       | -        | -            | -            | 67      | -       |\n| Dame Carolyn Fairbairn 6        | 80       | -        | -            | -            | 80      | -       |\n| James Forese 7                  | 572      | 160      | -            | -            | 572     | 160     |\n| Steven Guggenheimer 8           | 250      | 134      | -            | -            | 250     | 134     |\n| Irene Lee 9                     | 556      | 546      | -            | -            | 556     | 546     |\n| Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade Kuribre\u00f1a 10 | 223      | 202      | -            | 4            | 223     | 206     |\n| Heidi Miller 3, 11              | 251      | 632      | 19           | 7            | 270     | 639     |\n| Eileen Murray 12                | 266      | 120      | -            | -            | 266     | 120     |\n| David Nish 13                   | 482      | 480      | 10           | 8            | 492     | 488     |\n| Jackson Tai                     | 350      | 355      | -            | 12           | 350     | 367     |\n| Mark Tucker 14                  | 1,500    | 1,500    | 33           | 52           | 1,533   | 1,552   |\n| Pauline van der Meer Mohr 15    | 291      | 312      | -            | 2            | 291     | 314     |\n| Total (\u00a3000)                    | 5,212    | 5,230    | 102          | 79           | 5,314   | 5,309   |\n| Total ($000)                    | 7,169    | 6,958    | 140          | 105          | 7,309   | 7,063   |\n\n- 1 Fees are in line with the Directors' remuneration policy that was approved at the 2019 AGM.

For Group Performance Share Plan ('GPSP') awards, this is the end of the financial year preceding the date of grant. GPSP awards shown in 2012 to 2015 are therefore related to awards granted in 2013 to 2016.\n- 3  The GPSP was replaced by the LTI in 2016 and the value for GPSP is nil for 2016 as no GPSP award was made for 2016. LTI awards have a threeyear performance period and the first LTI award was made in February 2017. The value of the LTI awards expected to vest will be included in the total single figure of remuneration of the year in which the performance period ends. Noel Quinn did not receive the 2018 LTI award that had a performance period ended on 31 December 2021.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe following chart shows the change in:\n\n- \u00b7 total staff pay between 2020 and 2021; and\n- \u00b7 dividends and share buy-backs in respect of 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn 2021, total spend on pay was up from 2020, and the distribution to shareholders also increased from 2020 with the reinstatement of dividends (following the suspension of dividend payments during 2020) and the capital return to shareholders through the up to $2bn share buy-back announced in October 2021. In addition, the Group has announced the intention to initiate a further up to $1bn buy-back, to commence after the existing buy-back has concluded. Dividends include an approximation of the amount payable on 28 April 2022 in relation to the second interim dividend of $0.18 per ordinary share.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Supporting colleagues in 2021\n\nThe well-being of our people remained a critical focus, in particular as the operating environment continued to be challenging for many colleagues and their families. The pandemic was a key influence on our activities during the year and our country-based approach allowed us to respond quickly and flexibly to specific situations in each of our markets. In India, we took urgent steps during the second wave of the pandemic to help our colleagues and their dependants with access to support via a Covid-19 taskforce consisting of employee volunteers working in collaboration with partners. Our offices in India were set up to manage vaccination drives for employees and their families and we provided financial support to local non-profit organisations delivering the relief effort on the ground.\n\nOur global well-being programme covered three pillars: mental, physical and financial well-being. Despite the immense challenges, sentiment remained high. A total of 82% of colleagues rated their mental well-being as positive, 75% rated their physical well-being positively and 64% of colleagues reported their financial wellbeing as positive in our December survey.\n\nOur survey suggests that work-life balance has improved, with 76% of colleagues saying they can integrate their work and personal life positively, compared with 74% in 2020.\n\nThe pandemic offered us the opportunity to take the best of what we learnt and rethink the future of work. To support our approach, we created three guiding principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer focus: We aim to make sure the way we work helps deliver the best commercial outcomes for our customers.\n- \u00b7 Team commitment: We will connect with each other, build our community and collaborate.\n- \u00b7 Flexibility: We will provide our colleagues with more choice on how, when and where we work, suitable to the roles we do.\n\nConsidering the challenges colleagues faced, it was encouraging to see that check-ins happened regularly, with 60% of colleagues having frequent conversations with their managers, an increase\n\nfrom 56% in 2020. Our colleagues tell us that these have a positive impact on their performance, development and well-being, and are important in motivating them to perform at their best.\n\nWe also measure our colleagues' sentiment on performance and pay matters through our annual pay review surveys. In the most recent survey, a significant proportion of the respondents' comments indicated they believed they were paid fairly for what they do. It also highlighted challenges on market positions and potential retention issues in certain areas. Noting this sentiment of our colleagues, the extraordinarily competitive market for talent and material improvement in the Group's financial performance, we agreed a Group variable pay pool of $3,495m. This was determined using our countercyclical funding methodology under which a ceiling is used to limit the increase in variable pay pool at higher levels of performance. Therefore, while adjusted profit before tax rose 79%, the year-on-year increase in Group variable pay pool was 31%, following a reduction of 20% in 2020. In addition, fixed pay increases were targeted towards junior colleagues to help address the impact of rising inflation in many of our locations.\n\nThroughout the year we also recognise our colleagues for demonstrating our values. The 'At Our Best' recognition online platform allows for real-time recognition and communication of positive behaviours by colleagues, in line with our refreshed purpose and values. We ran a special 'Spotlight on valuing difference' campaign to recognise the exceptional actions of our colleagues in being empathetic, championing inclusivity, listening and seeking out different perspectives. An additional points budget was allocated and there were over 130,000 recognitions during the campaign.\n\n## Remuneration structure for Group employees\n\nTotal compensation, which comprises fixed and variable pay, is the key focus of our remuneration framework, with variable pay differentiated by performance and demonstration of values-aligned behaviours. We set out below the key features and design characteristics of our remuneration framework, which apply on a Group-wide basis, subject to compliance with local laws:\n\n## Overview of remuneration structure for employees\n\n| Remuneration components  and objectives                                                                                          | Application for Group employees                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Approach for executive  Directors                                                                                                                                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed pay Attract and retain  employees with market  competitive pay for the  role, skills and experience  required.             | \u00b7 May include salary, fixed pay allowance, cash in lieu of pension and other cash allowances in  accordance with local market practice.  \u00b7 Based on predetermined criteria, non-discretionary, transparent and not reduced based on  performance. \u00b7 Represents a higher proportion of total compensation for more junior employees. \u00b7 May change to reflect an individual's position, role or grade, cost of living in the country,                                                                                                                                | \u00b7 Consistent with approach  for Group colleagues  except fixed pay  allowance paid in shares.                                                                                      |\n| Benefits Support the physical,  mental and financial health  of a diverse workforce in  accordance with local  market practice.  | \u00b7 Benefits may include, but are not limited to, the provision of a pension, medical insurance, life  insurance, health assessment and relocation support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \u00b7 Provision of medical  insurance, life insurance,  car and tax return  assistance.

We also use a countercyclical funding methodology, with both a floor and a ceiling, with the payout ratio generally  reducing as performance increases to avoid pro-cyclicality. The floor recognises that even in challenging times, remaining competitive is  important. The ceiling recognises that at higher levels of performance it is not always necessary to continue to increase the variable pay  pool, thereby limiting the risk of inappropriate behaviour to drive financial performance.

The year-on-year percentage change in fees noted in the table below is primarily driven by any\n\npro-rated fees received by the non-executive Director for 2021 and/or 2020 based on time served by them on the Board and the relevant Board committees and any additional responsibilities taken on by the non-executive Director during each year. The value of benefits received by the non-executive Directors reflect the taxable expense reimbursements claimed, and the associated gross-up tax, in relation to attending the Board meetings in each year. Non-executive Directors who joined after 1 January 2021 are not included.\n\n## Annual percentage change in remuneration\n\n| Director/employees                                 | Base salary/fees   | 2020 Benefits   | Annual  incentive   | Base salary/fees   | 2021 Benefits   | Annual  incentive 2   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Executive Directors                                |                    |                 |                     |                    |                 |                       |\n| Noel Quinn 1                                       | 151.7%             | 353.7%          | 20.2%               | 1.7%               | -48.9%          | 99.0%                 |\n| Ewen Stevenson                                     | 2.6%               | -25.0%          | -58.4%              | 1.8%               | -75.0%          | 117.3%                |\n| Non-executive Directors 3                          |                    |                 |                     |                    |                 |                       |\n| Kathleen Casey (retired on 24 April 2020)          | -65.0%             | 200.0%          | -                   | -                  | -               | -                     |\n| Laura Cha 4                                        | 97.0%              | -               | -                   | -58.8%             | -               | -                     |\n| Henri de Castries 4,5                              | 4.1%               | -75.0%          | -                   | -59.4%             | 2,100.0%        | -                     |\n| James Forese 6                                     | -                  | -               | -                   | 257.5%             | -               | -                     |\n| Steven Guggenheimer 7                              | -                  | -               | -                   | 86.6%              | -               | -                     |\n| Irene Lee                                          | 20.3%              | -100.0%         | -                   | 1.8%               | -               | -                     |\n| Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade Kuribre\u00f1a 8                     | 28.7%              | 100.0%          | -                   | 10.4%              | -100.0%         | -                     |\n| Heidi Miller 4,5                                   | 1.1%               | -100.0%         | -                   | -60.3%             | 171.4%          | -                     |\n| Eileen Murray 7                                    | -                  | -               | -                   | 121.7%             | -               | -                     |\n| David Nish                                         | 108.7%             | -50.0%          | -                   | 0.4%               | 25.0%           | -                     |\n| Sir Jonathan Symonds (retired on 18 February 2020) | -86.5%             | -4.8%           | -                   | -                  | -               | -                     |\n| Jackson Tai 8                                      | -10.8%             | -78.9%          | -                   | -1.4%              | -100.0%         | -                     |\n| Mark Tucker                                        | -                  | -77.5%          | -                   | -                  | -36.5%          | -                     |\n| Pauline van der Meer Mohr 8                        | 17.7%              | -75.0%          | -                   | -6.7%              | -100.0%         | -                     |\n| Employee group 9                                   | 2.0%               | 2.3%            | -20.0%              | 1.0%               | 1.3%            | 25.2%                 |\n\n- 1  Noel Quinn succeeded John Flint as interim Group Chief Executive with effect from 5 August 2019 and was appointed permanently into the role on 17 March 2020. The annual percentage change in 2020 for Noel Quinn is based on remuneration reported in his 2019 single figure of remuneration (for the period 5 August 2019 to 31 December 2019) and his 2020 single figure of remuneration (for the period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020). Based on his annualised 2019 compensation as an executive Director, his percentage change in salary, benefits and annual incentive was 2.1%, 85.2% and -50.9%, respectively for 2020.\n- 2  Noel Quinn and Ewen Stevenson both voluntarily waived the cash portion of their 2020 annual incentive. The year-on-year percentage change between 2020 and 2021 would be -1% for Noel Quinn and 9% for Ewen Stevenson without this cash waiver.\n- 3  In some instances, non-executive Directors may have served only part of the year resulting in large year-on-year percentage changes in fees and/ or benefits. Page 275 provides the underlying single figure of remuneration for non-executive Directors used to calculate the figures above.\n- 4  Retired from the Board during 2021 and therefore fees received during 2021 were lower than the fees received in 2020.\n- 5  There was no change to the benefit provided. The year-on-year change reflected the increase in taxable expense reimbursement claimed in 2021 for attending Board and other meetings at HSBC Holdings' registered offices.\n- 6  In 2021, James Forese was appointed as non-executive Chair of HSBC North America Holdings, Inc. Fees for 2021 included fees in relation to this role.\n- 7  Joined the Board during 2020 and therefore received fees for only part of 2020.\n- 8   Received no taxable benefits in 2021, resulting in a 100% reduction from 2021.\n- 9  Employee group consists of individuals employed by HSBC Group Management Services Ltd, the employing entity of the executive Directors, as no individuals are employed directly by HSBC Holdings.\n\n## Pay ratio\n\nThe following table shows the ratio between the total pay of the Group Chief Executive and the lower quartile, median and upper quartile pay of our UK employees.\n\n## Total pay ratio\n\n|      | Method   | Lower  quartile   | Median   | Upper  quartile   |\n|------|----------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|\n| 2021 | A        | 154:1             | 90:1     | 46:1              |\n| 2020 | A        | 139:1             | 85:1     | 43:1              |\n| 2019 | A        | 169:1             | 105:1    | 52:1              |\n\nTotal pay and benefits amounts used to calculate the ratio\n\n|      |        | Lower quartile           | Lower quartile   | Median                   | Median        | Upper quartile           | Upper quartile   |\n|------|--------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| (\u00a3)  | Method | Total  pay and  benefits | Total  salary    | Total  pay and  benefits | Total  salary | Total  pay and  benefits | Total  salary    |\n| 2021 | A      | 31,727                   | 27,666           | 54,678                   | 41,500        | 106,951                  | 84,000           |\n| 2020 | A      | 29,833                   | 23,264           | 48,703                   | 36,972        | 96,386                   | 75,000           |\n| 2019 | A      | 28,920                   | 24,235           | 46,593                   | 41,905        | 93,365                   | 72,840           |\n\nThe increase in median ratio is primarily driven by a higher annual incentive payout than 2020 when the Group Chief Executive voluntarily decided to waive the cash portion of his annual incentive award and we protected the outcomes for junior colleagues against material year-on-year volatility when the Group variable pay pool was down 20%. The 2021 annual incentive award of the Group Chief Executive was higher than in 2020, reflecting the improvement in the financial performance of the Group and execution of our strategy at pace.\n\nThe total pay and benefits for the median employee for 2021 was \u00a354,678, a 12.3% increase compared with 2020.",

        "page_content": "Our UK workforce comprises a diverse mix of employees across different businesses and levels of seniority, from junior cashiers in our retail branches to senior executives managing our global business units. We aim to deliver market-competitive pay for each role, taking into consideration the skills and experience required for the business. Our approach to pay is designed to attract and motivate the very best people, regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, disability or any other factor unrelated to performance or experience. We actively promote learning and development opportunities for our employees to provide a framework for them to develop their career. To help people to develop skills for the changing world around us, we launched Future Skills in September 2021, supporting colleagues to explore new personal, digital, data and sustainability skills through a series of learning activities and events. As an individual progresses in their career we would expect their total compensation opportunity to also increase, reflecting their role and responsibilities.\n\nPay structure varies across roles in order to deliver an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay. Junior employees have a greater portion of their pay delivered in a fixed component, which does not vary with performance and allows them to predictably meet their day-to-day needs. Our senior management, including executive Directors, generally have a higher portion of their total compensation opportunity structured as variable pay and linked to the performance of the Group, given their role and ability to influence the strategy and performance of the Group. Executive Directors also have a higher proportion of their variable pay delivered in shares, which vest over a period of seven years with a post-vesting retention period of one year. During this deferral and retention period, the awards are linked to the share price so the value of award realised by them after the vesting and retention period will be aligned to the performance of the Group.\n\nWe are satisfied that the median pay ratio is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for our UK workforce, taking into account the diverse mix of our UK employees, the compensation structure mix applicable to each role and our objective of delivering market competitive pay for each role subject to Group, business and individual performance.\n\nOur ratios have been calculated using the option 'A' methodology prescribed under the UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018. Under this option, the ratios are calculated using full-time equivalent pay and benefits of all employees providing services in the UK at 31 December 2021. We believe this approach provides accurate information and representation of the ratios. The ratio has been computed taking into account the pay and benefits of over 37,000 UK employees, other than the\n\nindividual performing the role of Group Chief Executive. We calculated our lower quartile, median and upper quartile pay and benefits information for our UK employees using:\n\n- \u00b7 full-time equivalent annualised fixed pay, which includes salary and allowances, at 31 December 2021;\n- \u00b7 variable pay awards for 2021;\n- \u00b7 return on deferred cash awards granted in prior years. The deferred cash portion of the annual incentive granted in prior years includes a right to receive notional returns for the period between the grant date and vesting date, which is determined by reference to a rate of return specified at the time of grant. A payment of notional return is made annually and the amount is disclosed on a paid basis in the year in which the payment is made;\n- \u00b7 gains realised from exercising awards from taxable employee share plans; and\n- \u00b7 full-time equivalent value of taxable benefits and pension contributions.\n\nFor this purpose, full-time equivalent fixed pay and benefits for each employee have been calculated by using each employee's fixed pay and benefits at 31 December 2021. Where an employee works part-time, fixed pay and benefits are grossed up, where appropriate, to full-time equivalent. One-off benefits provided on a temporary basis to employees on secondment to the UK have not been included in calculating the ratios as these are not permanent in nature and in some cases, depending on individual circumstances, may not truly reflect a benefit to the employee.\n\nTotal pay and benefits for the Group Chief Executive used for this purpose is the total remuneration for Noel Quinn as reported in the single figure of remuneration table. Total remuneration does not include an LTI as he has not received an LTI award with a performance period that ended during 2021. In a year in which the value of an LTI is included in the single figure table of remuneration, the ratios could be higher.\n\nGiven the different business mix, size of the business, methodologies for computing pay ratios, estimates and assumptions used by other companies to calculate their respective pay ratios, as well as differences in employment and compensation practices between companies, the ratios reported may not be comparable to those reported by other listed peers on the FTSE 100 and our international peers.",

HSBC would offer a guaranteed variable remuneration award in exceptional circumstances for new hires, and for the first year of employment only. It would typically involve a critical new hire, and would also depend on factors such as the seniority of the individual, whether the new hire candidate has any competing offers and the timing of the hire during the performance year.\n- 2  Includes payments such as payment in lieu of notice, statutory severance, outplacement service, legal fees, ex-gratia payments and settlements (excludes pre-existing benefit entitlements triggered on terminations).\n\nindividuals identified as MRTs for HSBC Holdings.\n\nRemuneration information for individuals who are only identified as MRTs at HSBC Bank plc, HSBC UK Bank plc or other soloregulated entity levels is included, where relevant, in those entities' disclosures.\n\nThe 2021 variable pay information included in the following tables is based on the market value of awards. For share awards, the market value is based on HSBC Holdings' share price at the date of grant (unless indicated otherwise). For cash awards, it is the value of awards expected to be paid to the individual over the deferral period.",

The Group will continue to review whether to revert to paying quarterly dividends in future years, and a further update\n\nwill be given at or ahead of the 2022 results announcement in February 2023.\n\nA dividend of \u00a30.01 per Series A sterling preference share was approved on 22 February 2022 for payment on 15 March 2022.\n\n## Share capital\n\n## Issued share capital\n\nThe nominal value of HSBC Holdings' issued share capital paid up at 31 December 2021 was $10,315,760,219.50 divided into 20,631,520,439 ordinary shares of $0.50 each and one noncumulative preference share of \u00a30.01, representing approximately 100.00% and 0.00% respectively of the nominal value of HSBC Holdings' total issued share capital paid up at 31 December 2021. The 1,450,000 non-cumulative preference shares of $0.01 each were redeemed on 13 January 2021.\n\n## Rights, obligations and restrictions attaching to shares\n\nThe rights and obligations attaching to each class of ordinary and non-cumulative preference shares in our share capital are set out in full in our Articles of Association. The Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution of the shareholders and can be found on our website at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/ leadership-and-governance/board-responsibilities.",

There are no voting restrictions on the issued ordinary shares, all of which are fully paid. On a show of hands, each member present has the right to one vote at general meetings. On a poll, each member present or voting by proxy is entitled to one vote for every $0.50 nominal value of share capital held.\n\nThere are no specific restrictions on transfers of ordinary shares, which are governed by the general provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.\n\nInformation on the policy adopted by the Board for paying interim dividends on the ordinary shares may be found in the 'Shareholder information' section on page 397.\n\n## Dividend waivers\n\nHSBC Holdings' employee benefit trusts, which hold shares in HSBC Holdings in connection with the operation of its share plans, have lodged standing instructions to waive dividends on shares held by them that have not been allocated to employees. Shares held by custodians in connection with the vesting of employee share awards also lodged instructions to waive dividends.

Appointments are made on merit and candidates are considered against objective criteria, having regard to the benefits of a diverse Board. Appointments are made in accordance with HSBC Holdings' Articles of Association. The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee report sets out further details of the Board selection process. The number of Directors (other than any alternate Directors) must not be fewer than five nor exceed 25.\n\nThe Board may at any time appoint any person as a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an addition to the existing Board. The Board may appoint any Director to hold any employment or executive office, and may revoke or terminate any such appointment.\n\nNon-executive Directors are appointed for an initial three-year term and, subject to continued satisfactory performance based upon an assessment by the Group Chairman and the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee, are proposed for re-election by shareholders at each AGM. They typically serve two three-year terms. The Board may invite a Director to serve additional periods but any term beyond six years is subject to review with an explanation to be provided in the Annual Report and Accounts .\n\nShareholders vote at each AGM on whether to elect and re-elect individual Directors. All Directors that stood for election and reelection at the 2021 AGM were elected and re-elected by shareholders.\n\nNone of the Directors who retired during the year or who are not offering themselves for re-election at the 2022 AGM have raised concerns about the operation of the Board or the management of the company.\n\nNo executive Director is involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome.\n\n## Commitments\n\nThe terms and conditions of the appointments of non-executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment, which includes the expectations of them and the estimated time required to perform their role. Letters of appointment of each non-executive Director are available for inspection at the registered office of HSBC Holdings. The anticipated time commitment for non-executive Directors serving on the Board and as a member of any committees is no more than 75 days per annum. Directors who in addition chair a large committee should expect to commit up to 100 days per annum. Any additional time commitment connected with Board-related appointments will be confirmed separately.\n\nBoard approval is required for any non-executive Directors' external commitments, with consideration given to time commitments and conflicts of interest.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Board has an established policy and set of procedures to ensure that the Board's management of the Directors' conflicts of\n\ninterest policy operates effectively. The Board has the power to authorise conflicts where they arise, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and HSBC Holdings' Articles of Association. Details of all Directors' conflicts of interest are recorded in the register of conflicts, which is maintained by the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer's office. The Board agreed for 2022 onwards that the conflicts register be reviewed annually by the Board and quarterly by the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee. Upon appointment, new Directors are advised of the policy and procedures for managing conflicts. Directors are required to notify the Board of any actual or potential conflicts of interest and to update the Board with any changes to the facts and circumstances surrounding such conflicts. Directors are requested to review and confirm their own and their respective closely associated persons' outside interests and appointments twice a year. The Board has considered, and authorised (with or without conditions) where appropriate, potential conflicts as they have arisen during the year in accordance with the said policy and procedures. All non-executive Directors are re-vetted by the compliance team every three years from appointment and as part of such process all conflicts checks are refreshed.\n\n## Directors' indemnity\n\nThe Articles of Association of HSBC Holdings contain a qualifying third-party indemnity provision, which entitles Directors and other officers to be indemnified out of the assets of HSBC Holdings against claims from third parties in respect of certain liabilities.\n\nHSBC Holdings has granted, by way of deed poll, indemnities to the Directors, including former Directors, against certain liabilities arising in connection with their position as a Director of HSBC Holdings or of any Group company. Directors are indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n\nThe indemnities that constitute a 'qualifying third-party indemnity provision', as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006, remained in force for the whole of the financial year (or, in the case of Directors appointed during 2021, from the date of their appointment). The deed poll is available for inspection at the registered office of HSBC Holdings.\n\nAdditionally, Directors have the benefit of Directors' and officers' liability insurance.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnities have also been granted to the Trustees of the Group's pension schemes, which were in force for the whole of the financial year and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\n## Contracts of significance\n\nDuring 2021, none of the Directors had a material interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract of significance with any HSBC company. During the year, all Directors were reminded of their obligations in respect of transacting in HSBC securities and following specific enquiry all Directors have confirmed that they have complied with their obligations.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nThe Board is directly accountable to, and gives high priority to communicating with, HSBC's shareholders. Information about HSBC and its activities is provided to shareholders in its Interim Reports and the Annual Report and Accounts as well as on www.hsbc.com.\n\nTo complement regular publications, there is continual dialogue between members of the Board and institutional investors throughout the year. For examples of such engagement see the Group Chairman's governance statement on page 218 and the Remuneration Committee Chair's letter on page 254.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to develop an understanding of the views of shareholders. Enquiries from individuals on matters relating to their shareholdings and HSBC's business are welcomed.\n\nAny individual or institutional investor can make an enquiry by contacting the investor relations team, Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financial Officer and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. Our Senior Independent Director is also available to shareholders if they have concerns that",

Information on how to participate, both in advance and on the day, can be found in the Notice of the 2022 AGM, which will be sent to shareholders on 25 March 2022 and be available on www.hsbc.com/agm. A live webcast will be available on www.hsbc.com. A recording of the proceedings will be available on www.hsbc.com shortly after the conclusion of the AGM.

Shareholders may send enquiries to the Board in writing via the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, HSBC Holdings plc, 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ or by sending an email to shareholderquestions@hsbc.com.\n\n## General meetings and resolutions\n\nShareholders may require the Directors to call a general meeting other than an AGM, as provided by the UK Companies Act 2006. A valid request to call a general meeting may be made by members representing at least 5% of the paid-up capital of HSBC Holdings as carries the right of voting at its general meetings (excluding any paid-up capital held as treasury shares). A request must state the general nature of the business to be dealt with at the meeting and may include the text of a resolution that may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the meeting. At any general meeting convened on such request, no business may be transacted except that stated by the requisition or proposed by the Board.\n\nShareholders may request the Directors to send a resolution to shareholders for consideration at an AGM, as provided by the UK Companies Act 2006. A valid request must be made by (i) members representing at least 5% of the paid-up capital of HSBC Holdings as carries the right of voting at its general meetings (excluding any paid-up capital held as treasury shares), or (ii) at least 100 members who have a right to vote on the resolution at the AGM in question and hold shares in HSBC Holdings on which there has been paid up an average sum, per member, of at least \u00a3100.\n\nThe request must be received by the company not later than (i) six weeks before the AGM in question; or (ii) if later, the time at which the notice of AGM is published.\n\nA request may be in hard copy form or in electronic form, and must be authenticated by the person or persons making it. A request may be made in writing to HSBC Holdings at its UK address, referred to in the paragraph above or by sending an email to shareholderquestions@hsbc.com.\n\n## Events after the balance sheet date\n\nFor details of events after the balance sheet date, see Note 37 on the financial statements.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThe Group is not party to any significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate following a change of control of the Group. The Group does not have agreements with any Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover bid.\n\n## Branches\n\nThe Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services through branches and offices in the UK and overseas.\n\n## Research and development activities\n\nDuring the ordinary course of business the Group develops new products and services within the global businesses.\n\n## Political donations\n\nHSBC does not make any political donations or incur political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those words. We have\n\nno intention of altering this policy. However, the definitions of political donations, political parties, political organisations and political expenditure used in the UK Companies Act 2006 are very wide. As a result, they may cover routine activities that form part of the normal business activities of the Group and are an accepted part of engaging with stakeholders. To ensure that neither the Group nor any of its subsidiaries inadvertently breaches the UK Companies Act 2006, authority is sought from shareholders at the AGM to make political donations.\n\nHSBC provides administrative support to two political action committees ('PACs') in the US funded by voluntary political contributions by eligible employees. We do not control the PACs, and all decisions regarding the amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by the respective steering committee of each PAC, which are comprised of eligible employees. The PACs recorded combined political donations of $15,500 during 2021 (2020: $100,750).\n\n## Charitable contributions\n\nFor details of charitable contributions, see page 77.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing the effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems, and for determining the level and type of risks the Group is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives.\n\nTo meet this requirement and to discharge its obligations under the FCA Handbook and the PRA Handbook, procedures have been designed: for safeguarding assets against unauthorised use or disposal; for maintaining proper accounting records; and for ensuring the reliability and usefulness of financial information used within the business or for publication.\n\nThese procedures provide reasonable assurance against material misstatement, errors, losses or fraud. They are designed to provide effective internal control within the Group and accord with the Financial Reporting Council's guidance for Directors issued in 2014, on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting. The procedures have been in place throughout the year and up to 22 February 2022, the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 .\n\nThe key risk management and internal control procedures include the following:\n\n## Global principles\n\nThe Group's Global Principles set an overarching standard for all other policies and procedures and are fundamental to the Group's risk management structure. They inform and connect our purpose, values, strategy and risk management principles, guiding us to do the right thing and treat our customers and our colleagues fairly at all times.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nThe risk management framework supports our Global Principles. It outlines the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks. It applies to all categories of risk and supports a consistent approach in identifying, assessing, managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities.\n\n## Delegation of authority within limits set by the Board\n\nSubject to certain matters reserved for the Board, the Group Chief Executive has been delegated authority limits and powers within which to manage the day-to-day affairs of the Group, including the right to sub-delegate those limits and powers. Each relevant Group Executive Committee member or executive Director has delegated authority within which to manage the day-to-day affairs of the business or function for which he or she is accountable.\n\nDelegation of authority from the Board requires those individuals to maintain a clear and appropriate apportionment of significant responsibilities and to oversee the establishment and maintenance of systems of control that are appropriate to their business or function.

        "page_content": "are delegated with limits to line management of Group companies. However, credit proposals with specified higher-risk characteristics require the concurrence of the appropriate global function. Credit and market risks are measured and reported at subsidiary company level and aggregated for risk concentration analysis on a Group-wide basis.\n\n## Risk identification and monitoring\n\nSystems and procedures are in place to identify, assess, control and monitor the material risk types facing HSBC as set out in the risk management framework. The Group's risk measurement and reporting systems are designed to help ensure that material risks are captured with all the attributes necessary to support wellfounded decisions, that those attributes are accurately assessed and that information is delivered in a timely manner for those risks to be successfully managed and mitigated.\n\n## Changes in market conditions/practices\n\nProcesses are in place to identify new risks arising from changes in market conditions/practices or customer behaviours, which could expose the Group to heightened risk of loss or reputational damage. The Group employs a top and emerging risks framework, which contains an aggregate of all current and forward-looking risks and enables it to take action that either prevents them materialising or limits their impact.\n\nDuring 2021 due to the prolonged impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the  global economy, banks continued to play an expanded role to support society and customers. The pandemic and its impact on the global economy have impacted many of our customers' business models and income, requiring significant levels of support from both governments and banks.\n\nTo meet the additional challenges, we supplemented our existing approach to risk management with additional tools and practices and these continue to be in place. We continue our focus on the quality and timeliness of the data used to inform management decisions, through measures such as early warning indicators, prudent active risk management of our risk appetite, and ensuring regular communication with our Board and other key stakeholders.\n\n## Responsibility for risk management\n\nAll employees are responsible for identifying and managing risk within the scope of their role as part of the three lines of defence model. This is an activity-based model to delineate management accountabilities and responsibilities for risk management and the control environment. The second line of defence sets the policy and guidelines for managing specific risk areas, provides advice and guidance in relation to the risk, and challenges the first line of defence (the risk owners) on effective risk management.\n\nThe Board delegated authority to the Group Audit Committee ('GAC') and it reviewed the independence, autonomy and effectiveness of the Group's policies and procedures on whistleblowing, including the procedures for the protection of staff who raise concerns of detrimental treatment.\n\n## Strategic plans\n\nStrategic plans are prepared for global businesses, global functions and geographical regions within the framework of the Group's overall strategy. Financial resource plans, informed by detailed analysis of risk appetite describing the types and quantum of risk that the Group is prepared to take in executing its strategy, are prepared and adopted by all major Group operating companies and set out the key business initiatives and the likely financial effects of those initiatives.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and internal control is reviewed regularly by the Board, the GRC and the GAC.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group continued to focus on operational resilience and invest in the non-financial risk infrastructure. There was a particular focus on material and emerging risks and areas undergoing strategic growth.\n\nThe GRC and the GAC received confirmation that executive management has taken or is taking the necessary actions to\n\nremedy any failings or weaknesses identified through the operation of the Group's framework of controls. In response to the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic, our business continuity responses have been successfully implemented and the majority of service level agreements continue to be maintained.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nHSBC is required to comply with section 404 of the US SarbanesOxley Act of 2002 and assess its effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting at 31 December 2021. In 2014, the GAC endorsed the adoption of the COSO 2013 framework for the monitoring of risk management and internal control systems to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nThe key risk management and internal control procedures over financial reporting include the following:\n\n## Entity level controls\n\nThe primary mechanism through which comfort over risk management and internal control systems is achieved is through assessments of the effectiveness of controls to manage risk, and the reporting of issues on a regular basis through the various risk management and risk governance forums. Entity level controls are a defined suite of internal controls that have a pervasive influence over the entity as a whole and meet the principles of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO') framework. They include controls related to the control environment, such as the Group's values and ethics, the promotion of effective risk management and the overarching governance exercised by the Board and its non-executive committees. The design and operational effectiveness of entity level controls are assessed annually as part of the assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. If issues are significant to the Group, they are escalated to the GRC and also to the GAC, if concerning financial reporting matters.\n\n## Process level transactional controls\n\nKey process level controls that mitigate the risk of financial misstatement are identified, recorded and monitored in accordance with the risk framework. This includes the identification and assessment of relevant control issues against which action plans are tracked through to remediation. Further details on HSBC's approach to risk management can be found on page 121. The GAC has continued to receive regular updates on HSBC's ongoing activities for improving the effective oversight of end-to-end business processes, and management continued to identify opportunities for enhancing key controls, such as through the use of automation technologies.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Group's financial reporting process is controlled using documented accounting policies and reporting formats, supported by detailed instructions and guidance on reporting requirements, issued to all reporting entities within the Group in advance of each reporting period end. The submission of financial information from each reporting entity is supported by a certification by the responsible financial officer and analytical review procedures at reporting entity and Group levels.\n\n## Disclosure Committee\n\nChaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Disclosure Committee supports the discharge of the Group's obligations under relevant legislation and regulation including the UK and Hong Kong listing rules, the UK Market Abuse Regulation and US Securities and Exchange Commission rules. In so doing, the Disclosure Committee is empowered to determine whether a new event or circumstance should be disclosed, including the form and timing of such disclosure, and review certain material disclosures made or to be made by the Group. The membership of the Disclosure Committee consists of senior management, including the Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Chief Legal Officer and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer. The Group's brokers, external auditors and its external legal counsel also attend as required. The integrity of disclosures is underpinned by structures and processes within the Global Finance and Global Risk and Compliance functions that support rigorous analytical",

As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer have certified that the Group's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at the end of the period covered by the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 .\n\nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and internal control over financial reporting was conducted with reference to the COSO 2013 framework. Based on the assessment performed, the Directors concluded that for the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group's internal control over financial reporting was effective.\n\nPwC has audited the effectiveness of HSBC's internal control over financial reporting and has given an unqualified opinion.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Board, having made appropriate enquiries, is satisfied that the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue operations for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report, and it therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nFor further details, see page 41.\n\n## Employees\n\nAt 31 December 2021, HSBC had a total workforce equivalent to 220,000 full-time employees compared with 226,000 at the end of 2020 and 235,000 at the end of 2019. Our main centres of employment were India with approximately 38,000 employees, the UK with 35,000, mainland China with 30,000, Hong Kong with 28,000, Mexico with 16,000 and the US with 7,000.\n\nOur business spans many cultures, communities and continents. We aim to provide an environment where our colleagues can fulfil their potential by building their skills and capabilities while focusing on the development of a diverse and inclusive culture. We use confidential employee surveys to assess progress and make changes. We want to provide an open culture, where our colleagues feel connected, supported to speak up and where our leaders encourage and use feedback. Where we make organisational changes, we support our people, in particular where there are job impacts.\n\n## Employee relations\n\nWe consult with and, where appropriate, negotiate with employee representative bodies where we have them. It is our policy to maintain well-developed communications and consultation programmes with all employee representative bodies. There have been no material disruptions to our operations from labour disputes during the past five years.\n\nWe are committed to complying with the applicable employment law and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. HSBC's global employment practices and relations policy provides the framework and controls through which we seek to uphold that commitment.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nOur customers, colleagues and communities span many cultures and continents. We value difference, and believe that diversity makes us strong. We are dedicated to building a diverse and connected workforce where everyone feels a sense of belonging.\n\nOur Group People Committee, which is made up of Group Executive Committee members, governs our diversity and inclusion agenda. It meets regularly to agree actions to improve diverse representation and build a more inclusive culture where our colleagues can bring the best of themselves to work, and deliver more equal outcomes for our stakeholders. Members of our Group Executive Committee are held to account for the actions they take on diversity via aspirational targets contained within their performance scorecards. Every colleague at HSBC must treat each other with dignity and respect to ensure an inclusive environment. Our policies make it clear that we do not tolerate unlawful discrimination, bullying or harassment on any grounds.\n\nTo align our approach to inclusion best practices, we participate in global diversity benchmarks that help us to identify improvement opportunities. We also track a large number of diversity and inclusion metrics, which enable us to pinpoint inclusion barriers, and take action where required. Our gender diversity statistics are set out on page 72.\n\nFurther details of our diversity and inclusion activity, together with our Gender and Ethnicity Pay Gap Report 2021, can be found at www.hsbc.com/ diversitycommitments.\n\n## Employment of people with a disability\n\nWe strongly believe in providing equal opportunities for all employees. The employment of people with a disability is included in this commitment. The recruitment, training, development and promotion of people with a disability are based on the aptitudes and abilities of the individual. Should employees become disabled during their employment with us, efforts are made to continue their employment. Where necessary, we will provide appropriate training, facilities and reasonable equipment.\n\n## Employee development\n\nWe aim to build a dynamic, inclusive culture where the best want to develop the skills and experiences that help them fulfil their potential. This determines how we develop our people and recruit, identify and nurture talent. A range of resources bring this to life including:\n\n- \u00b7 HSBC University, our platform for learning and development with specific business and technical academies;\n- \u00b7 our My HSBC Career portal, which offers career development information and resources; and\n- \u00b7 HSBC Talent Marketplace, our new online platform that uses AI to provide opportunities to learn as we work.\n\nEach year, every employee is asked to complete global mandatory training. It plays a critical role in shaping our culture by ensuring everyone is focused on issues that are fundamental to working at HSBC, from sustainability, to financial crime risk, to our intolerance of bullying and harassment.\n\nAs the opportunities we face change, we provide development to key populations through business and technical academies. This includes our risk academy, which helps us to develop broad capabilities in traditional areas of risk like financial crime but also in emerging risk issues like climate risk and the ethics of AI and Big Data.\n\nOur approach to learning is skills based. Our academies work with our businesses to identify the key skills and capabilities we need in the future. Alongside this, we help colleagues identify, assess and develop the skills that match their ambition and aspirations. In 2021, as part of our Future Skills programme a 'Focus 4' campaign encouraged colleagues to identify four future skills they want to prioritise in their development plans. Over four themed weeks, various events introduced colleagues to areas such as data, digital and sustainability skills, as well as personal skills like critical thinking and resilience.\n\nOur new platform for learning content is Degreed. This helps colleagues identify, assess and develop key skills through internal and external training materials in a way that suits them. Content can range from quick videos, articles or podcasts to packaged programmes or learning pathways.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the HSBC Talent MarketPlace, an AI-based platform, which matches colleagues to projects and experiences based on their aspirations. By December, this had been rolled out to nearly 50,000 colleagues in the US, India, Singapore and the UK, and will be rolled out globally in 2022.\n\nEffective people management and impactful leadership remain critical to our ability to energise for growth. In 2021, we launched a refreshed executive development curriculum for our most senior population. This combines internal programmes and business school activities with targeted technical programmes on key topics and skills.",

We have adopted global policies, mandatory procedures, and incident and information reporting systems across the organisation that reflect our core values and\n\nare aligned to international standards. Our global health and safety performance is subject to ongoing monitoring and assurance. Our chief operating officers have overall responsibility for engendering a positive health and safety culture and ensuring that global policies, procedures and systems are put into practice locally. They also have responsibility for ensuring all local legal requirements are met.\n\nWe delivered a range of programmes in 2021 to help us understand and manage our health and safety risks:\n\n- \u00b7 We continued to provide enhancements to our workplaces globally to minimise the risks of Covid-19, including enhanced cleaning, improved ventilation and social distancing measures.\n- \u00b7 We updated our advice and risk assessment methodology on working from home, providing more awareness and best practices on good ergonomics and well-being to be adopted as we transitioned to new ways of working.\n- \u00b7 We delivered health and safety training and awareness to 220,000 of our employees and contractors globally, ensuring roles and responsibilities were clear and understood.\n- \u00b7 We completed the annual safety inspection on all of our buildings globally, subject to local Covid-19 restrictions, to ensure we were meeting our standards and continuously improving our safety performance.\n- \u00b7 We continued to focus on enhancing the safety culture in our supply chain through our SAFER Together programme, covering the five key elements of best practice safety culture, including speaking up about safety, and recognising excellence. Our 2021 safety climate survey results showed a continued high level of positive safety culture, significantly above the industry average.\n- \u00b7 We commenced a targeted guidance and training programme for our construction partners in our key markets globally to help them understand and deliver industry leading health and safety performance, with over 130 construction workers receiving safety passporting training.\n- \u00b7 Our Eat Well Live Well programme continued educating and informing our colleagues on how to make healthy food and drink choices. We enhanced the programme to provide digital educational and information resources, including a suite of videos and recipe ideas. The programme was a key component of HSBC's winning entry in the 2021 Global Healthy Workplace Awards.\n- \u00b7 We put in place effective storm preparation controls and processes to ensure the protection of our people and operations. In 2021, there were 38 named storms that passed over 1,935 of our buildings, resulting in 0 injuries or material business impact.\n\n## Employee health and safety\n\n|                                                    | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Rate of workplace fatalities per 100,000 employees | -      | -      | -      |\n| Number of major injuries to employees 1            | 14     | 15     | 29     |\n| All injury rate per 100,000 employees              | 64     | 88     | 189    |\n\n- 1  Fractures, dislocation, concussion, loss of consciousness, overnight admission to hospital.\n\n## HSBC Holdings Savings-Related Share Option Plan (UK)\n\n|             |                    |                     |        |                          |             | HSBC Holdings ordinary shares   | HSBC Holdings ordinary shares   | HSBC Holdings ordinary shares   | HSBC Holdings ordinary shares   | HSBC Holdings ordinary shares         |\n|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------|--------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| from        | Dates of awards to | Exercise price from | to     | Usually exercisable from | to          | At 1 Jan 2021                   | Granted during year             | Exercised during year 1         | Lapsed during year              | At 31 Dec 2021                        |\n|             |                    | (\u00a3)                 | (\u00a3)    |                          |             |                                 |                                 |                                 |                                 |                                       |\n| 20 Sep 2015 | 22 Sep 2021        | 2.6270              | 5.9640 | 1 Nov 2019               | 30 Apr 2027 | 130,952,539                     | 15,410,381                      |                                 |                                 | 3,878,418    19,287,652   123,196,850 |\n\n## Remuneration\n\nHSBC's pay and performance strategy is designed to reward competitively the achievement of long-term sustainable performance and attract and motivate the very best people, regardless of gender, ethnicity, age, disability or any other factor unrelated to performance or experience with the Group, while performing their role in the long-term interests of our stakeholders.\n\nFor further details of the Group's approach to remuneration, see page 278.\n\n## Employee share plans\n\nShare options and discretionary awards of shares granted under HSBC share plans align the interests of employees with the creation of shareholder value. The following table sets out the particulars of outstanding options, including those held by employees working under employment contracts that are regarded as 'continuous contracts' for the purposes of the Hong Kong Employment Ordinance. The options were granted at nil consideration. No options have been granted to substantial shareholders and suppliers of goods or services, nor in excess of the individual limit for each share plan. No options were cancelled by HSBC during the year.\n\nA summary for each plan of the total number of the options that were granted, exercised or lapsed during 2021 is shown in the following table. Further details required to be disclosed pursuant to Chapter 17 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited are available on our website at www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/leadership-andgovernance/remuneration and on the website of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited at www.hkex.com.hk, or can be obtained upon request from the Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer, 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ.\n\nParticulars of options held by Directors of HSBC Holdings are set out on page 273.\n\nNote 5 on the financial statements gives details of share-based payments, including discretionary awards of shares granted under HSBC share plans.\n\n## All-employee share plans\n\nHSBC operates all-employee share option plans under which options are granted over HSBC ordinary shares. Subject to leaver provisions, options are normally exercisable after three or five years. During 2021, options were granted by reference to the average market value of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares on the five business days immediately preceding the invitation date, then applying a discount of 20%. The closing price for HSBC Holdings ordinary shares quoted on the London Stock Exchange on 21 September 2021, the day before the options were granted and as derived from the Daily Official List, was \u00a33.5975.\n\nThe HSBC Holdings Savings-Related Share Option Plan (UK) will expire on 24 April 2030, by which time the plan may be extended with approval from shareholders, unless the Directors resolve to terminate the plan at an earlier date.\n\nThe HSBC International Employee Share Purchase Plan was introduced in 2013 and now includes employees based in 28 jurisdictions, although no options are granted under this plan.\n\nDuring 2021, approximately 190,000 employees were offered participation in these plans.",

Under that law, the Directors have prepared the parent company ('Company') and Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. The company has also prepared financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) N0 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRSs as issued by IASB). Under company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and Group, and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- \u00b7 state whether applicable UK-adopted international accounting standards, international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRSs issued by IASB have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 as they appear on the Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts 2021, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 'Report of the Directors: Corporate governance report' on pages 220 to 223 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 , confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union and IFRSs issued by IASB, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the Group; and\n\n- \u00b7 the management report represented by the Report of the Directors includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\nThe Group Audit Committee has responsibility, delegated to it from the Board, for overseeing all matters relating to external financial reporting. The Group Audit Committee report on page 240 sets out how the Group Audit Committee discharges its responsibilities.\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nIn accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors' report includes a statement, in the case of each Director in office as at the date the Report of the Directors is approved, that:\n\n- \u00b7 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware; and\n- \u00b7 they have taken all the steps they ought to have taken as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\nMark E Tucker\n\nGroup Chairman\n\nHSBC Holdings plc\n\nRegistered number 617987\n\n22 February 2022",

Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) and ISAs are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nDuring the period, we identified that PricewaterhouseCoopers provided an impermissible training service via a publicly available seminar in respect of the implementation of a new Indonesian IT security regulation. The attendees at this seminar included six members of staff from HSBC Indonesia. The HSBC staff who attended the course were not from the Finance function and were not in roles relevant to our audit. In addition, HSBC Indonesia is not within the scope of the group audit. We confirm that based on our assessment of the breach, nature and scope of the service and our communication with the GAC, that the provision of this service has not compromised  our professional judgement or integrity and as such believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party in possession of these facts would conclude that our integrity and objectivity has not been impaired and accordingly we remain independent for the purposes of the audit.\n\nOther than the matter referred to above, to the best of our knowledge, we declare that no other non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were provided to the company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.\n\nOther than those disclosed in Note 6, we have provided no non-audit services to the company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u00b7 This was the third year that it has been my responsibility to form this opinion on behalf of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ('PwC'), who you first appointed on 31 March 2015 in relation to that year's audit. In addition to forming this opinion, in this report we have also provided information on how we approached the audit, how it changed from the previous year and details of the significant discussions that we had with the GAC.\n- 1  We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 (the 'Annual Report'), which comprise: the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated and company income statements and the consolidated and company statements of comprehensive income for the year then ended, the consolidated and company statements of cash flows for the year then ended, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended, and the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. Certain notes to the financial statements have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as '(Audited)'. The relevant disclosures are included in the Risk review section on pages 127 to 216 and the Directors' remuneration report disclosures on pages 268 to 276.",

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nCompared to last year the number of key audit matters has reduced from eight to four. The following are no longer considered to be key audit matters.\n\n- \u00b7 Impact of Covid-19 (group and company) - Given the impact of Covid-19 on working practices and international travel, the majority of our interactions continued to be undertaken virtually, including those with the partners and teams for Significant Subsidiaries and operations centres, and with HSBC Board members and management. Similarly, a substantial part of our audit testing was performed remotely. We used established practices throughout 2021 for interacting and undertaking our audit testing virtually, consistent with the hybrid working models at both PwC network teams and HSBC.\n- \u00b7 IT access management (group) - Management has remediated a number of the control deficiencies in relation to IT access management.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of financial instruments (group) - The financial instruments where significant pricing inputs are unobservable, the most material of which are the private equity investments held by Global Banking and Markets and the Insurance business, experienced reduced market volatility during the year that impacted the determination of the fair value.\n- \u00b7 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets (group) - The risk of impairment at the period end is reduced due to the significant surplus between the recoverable amounts and the carrying value for the goodwill and intangible asset balances at the year end, after the full impairment recognised for the WPB LatAm goodwill in 2021.\n\nThe remaining four key audit matters are consistent with last year.",

The significant assumptions that we focused on in our audit included those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on ECL. These included assumptions made in determining forward looking economic scenarios and their probability weightings and estimating material management judgemental adjustments.\n\nThe impact of Covid-19, including the nature and extent of government support, supply chain constraints and increasing energy prices, and more recent factors, including developments in China's commercial real estate sector, have resulted in unprecedented economic conditions that vary between territories and industries, leading to uncertainty around judgements made in determining the severity and probability weighting of macroeconomic variable ('MEV') forecasts across the different economic scenarios used in ECL models.\n\nThe modelling methodologies used to estimate ECL are developed using historical experience. The impact of the unprecedented economic conditions has also resulted in certain limitations in the reliability of these methodologies to forecast the extent and timing of future customer defaults and therefore estimate ECL. In addition, modelling methodologies do not incorporate all factors that are relevant to estimating ECL, such as differentiating the impact on industry sectors of economic conditions. These limitations are addressed with management judgemental adjustments, the measurement of which is inherently judgemental and subject to a high level of estimation uncertainty.\n\nManagement makes other assumptions which are less judgemental or for which variations have a less significant impact on ECL. These assumptions include:\n\n- \u00b7 The methodologies used in quantitative scorecards for determining customer risk ratings ('CRRs');\n- \u00b7 Estimating expected cash flows and collateral valuations for credit impaired wholesale exposures;\n- \u00b7 Model methodologies themselves; and\n- \u00b7 Quantitative and qualitative criteria used to assess significant increases in credit risk.\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe held discussions with the GAC covering governance and controls over ECL, with a significant focus on the  continuing impact of Covid-19 and other economic conditions, including recent developments in China's commercial real estate sector. We discussed a number of areas, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The severity of MEV forecasts in economic scenarios, and their related probability weightings, across territories;\n- \u00b7 Management judgemental adjustments and the nature and extent of analysis used to support those adjustments;\n- \u00b7 The criteria and conditions used to assess to what extent management judgemental adjustments continue to be needed;\n- \u00b7 Management's policies, governance and controls over model validation and monitoring; and\n- \u00b7 The disclosures made in relation to ECL, in particular the impact of adjustments on determining ECL and the resulting estimation uncertainty.\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe assessed the design and effectiveness of governance and controls over the estimation of ECL. We observed management's review and challenge in governance forums for (1) the determination of MEV forecasts and their probability weightings for different economic scenarios, and (2) the assessment of ECL for Retail and Wholesale portfolios, including the assessment of model limitations and any resulting management judgemental adjustments.\n\nWe also tested controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 Model validation and monitoring;\n- \u00b7 Credit reviews that determine customer risk ratings for wholesale customers;\n- \u00b7 The identification of credit impaired events;\n- \u00b7 The input of critical data into source systems and the flow and transformation of critical data from source systems to impairment models and management judgemental adjustments; and\n- \u00b7 The calculation and approval of management judgemental adjustments to modelled outcomes.\n\nWe involved our economic experts in assessing the significant assumptions made in determining the severity and probability weighting of MEV forecasts. These assessments considered the sensitivity of ECL to variations in the severity and probability weighting of MEVs for different economic scenarios. We involved our modelling experts in assessing the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and methodologies used for models and management judgemental adjustments. We independently reperformed the calculations for a sample of those models and management judgemental adjustments. We further considered whether the judgements made in selecting the significant assumptions would give rise to indicators of possible management bias.\n\nIn addition, we performed substantive testing over:\n\n- \u00b7 The compliance of ECL methodologies and assumptions with the requirements of IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 The appropriateness and application of the quantitative and qualitative criteria used to assess significant increases in credit risk;\n- \u00b7 A sample of critical data used in ECL models and to estimate management judgemental adjustments as at 31 December 2021;\n- \u00b7 Assumptions and critical data for a sample of credit impaired wholesale exposures; and\n- \u00b7 A sample of CRRs applied to wholesale exposures.\n\nWe evaluated and tested the Credit Risk disclosures made in the Annual Report.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk disclosures, page 137.\n- \u00b7 GAC Report, page 245.\n- \u00b7 Note 1.2(d): Financial instruments measured at amortised cost, page 321.\n- \u00b7 Note 1.2(i): Impairment of amortised cost and FVOCI financial assets, page 323.",

        "page_content": "Impairment of investment in associate - Bank of Communications Co., Ltd ('BoCom') (group)\n\n## Nature of the key audit matter\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the fair value of the investment in BoCom, based on the share price, was US$15.1bn lower than the carrying value ('CV') of US$23.6bn.\n\nThis is an indicator of potential impairment. An impairment test was performed by management, with supporting sensitivity analysis, using the higher of fair value and value in use ('VIU'). The VIU was US$1.2bn in excess of the CV. On this basis, management concluded no impairment was required.\n\nThe methodology in the VIU model is dependent on various assumptions, both short term and long term in nature. These assumptions, which are subject to estimation uncertainty, are derived from a combination of management's judgement, analysts' forecasts and market data. The significant assumptions that we focused our audit on were those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on the VIU. Specifically, these included:\n\n- \u00b7 The discount rate;\n- \u00b7 Short term assumptions for operating income growth rate, cost-income ratio, expected credit losses and effective tax rates;\n- \u00b7 Long term assumptions for profit and asset growth rates, expected credit losses, and effective tax rates; and\n- \u00b7 Capital related assumptions (risk-weighted assets, capital adequacy ratio and tier 1 capital adequacy ratio).\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed the appropriateness of the VIU methodology and significant assumptions with the GAC, giving consideration to the macroeconomic environment, the outlook for the Chinese banking market and the fair value, which has been lower than the carrying value for approximately 10 years. We also discussed the disclosures made in relation to BoCom, including reasonably possible alternatives for the significant assumptions, the use of sensitivity analysis to explain estimation uncertainty and the changes in certain assumptions that would result in the VIU being equal to the CV.\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe tested controls in place over significant assumptions and the model used to determine the VIU. We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, to estimate the VIU. In respect of the significant assumptions, our testing included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Challenging the appropriateness of the significant assumptions and, where relevant, their interrelationships;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining evidence for data supporting significant assumptions including historic experience, external market information, third-party sources including analyst reports, information from BoCom management and historical publicly available BoCom financial information;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the sensitivity of the VIU to reasonable variations in certain significant assumptions, both individually and in aggregate;\n- \u00b7 Determining a reasonable range for the discount rate used within the model, with the assistance of our valuation experts, and comparing it to the discount rate used by management; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing whether the judgements made in deriving the significant assumptions give rise to indicators of possible management bias.\n\nWe observed the quarterly meetings in March, May, September, and November 2021 between management and BoCom management, held specifically to identify facts and circumstances impacting assumptions relevant to the determination of the VIU.\n\nRepresentations were obtained from management that assumptions used were consistent with information currently available to the group.       .\n\nWe evaluated and tested the disclosures made in the Annual Report in relation to BoCom.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n- \u00b7 GAC Report, page 245.\n- \u00b7 Note 1.2(a): Critical accounting estimates and judgements, page 320.\n- \u00b7 Note 18 Interests in associates and joint ventures, page 359.",

These external factors, as well as HSBC's strategy, impact the financial position and performance of subsidiaries within the group. These factors were considered by management in determining if there were potential indicators of impairment that required an impairment assessment for investment in subsidiaries.\n\nManagement compared the net assets to the carrying value of each direct subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc. Where the net assets did not support the carrying value or the subsidiary made a loss during the period, management estimated the recoverable amount using the higher of value in use ('VIU') or fair value less cost to sell. Management predominantly used VIU in its impairment tests, unless it believed that fair value would result in a higher recoverable amount for any subsidiary. The impairment test resulted in a partial reversal of an impairment charge of US$3.1bn in relation to the investment in HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited ('HOHU'). This resulted in investment in subsidiaries of US$163bn at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe methodology used to estimate the recoverable amount is dependent on various assumptions, both short term and long term in nature. These assumptions, which are subject to estimation uncertainty, are derived from a combination of management's judgement, experts engaged by management and market data. The significant assumptions that we focused our audit on were those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on the recoverable amount. Specifically, these included HSBC's strategic planning cycle for 2022 to 2026 including revenue forecasts and cost reduction targets, regulatory capital requirements, long term growth rates and discount rates.\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed the partial reversal of the impairment charge for HOHU, the appropriateness of methodologies used and significant assumptions with the GAC, giving consideration to the macroeconomic outlook and HSBC's strategy. We considered reasonably possible alternatives for significant assumptions.\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe tested controls in place over significant assumptions and the model used to determine the recoverable amounts. We assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, and tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, to estimate the recoverable amounts. In respect of the significant assumptions, our testing included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Challenging the achievability of management's strategic planning cycle  and the prospects for HSBC's businesses, as well as considering the achievement of historic forecasts;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining and evaluating evidence where available for critical data relating to significant assumptions, from a combination of historic experience and external market and other financial information;\n- \u00b7 Assessing whether the cash flows included in the model were in accordance with the relevant accounting standard;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the sensitivity of the VIU to reasonable variations in significant assumptions, both individually and in aggregate; and\n- \u00b7 Determining a reasonable range for the discount rate used within the model, with the assistance of our valuation experts, and comparing it to the discount rate used by management.\n\nWe evaluated and tested the disclosures made in the Annual Report in relation to investment in subsidiaries.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Note 19: Investments in subsidiaries, page 362.\n\nValuation of defined benefit pensions obligations (group)\n\n## Nature of the key audit matter\n\nThe group has a defined benefit obligation of US$42.8bn, of which US$32.3bn relates to HSBC Bank (UK) pension scheme.\n\nThe valuation of the defined benefit obligation for HSBC Bank (UK) pension scheme is dependent on a number of actuarial assumptions. Management uses an actuarial expert to determine the valuation of the defined benefit obligation. The valuation methodology uses a number of market based inputs and other financial and demographic assumptions. The significant assumptions that we focused our audit on were those with greater levels of management judgement and for which variations had the most significant impact on the liability. Specifically, these included the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality rate.\n\n## Matters discussed with the Group Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed with the GAC the methodologies and significant assumptions used by management to determine the value of the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe tested governance and controls in place over the methodologies and the significant assumptions, including those in relation to the use of management's experts. We also evaluated the objectivity and competence of management's expert involved in the valuation of the defined benefit obligation.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, to estimate the liability. In respect of the significant assumptions, we used our actuarial experts to understand the judgements made by management and their actuarial expert in determining the significant assumptions and compared these assumptions to our independently compiled expected ranges based on market observable indices and the knowledge and opinions of our actuarial experts.\n\nWe evaluated and tested the disclosures made in the Annual Report in relation to the defined benefit pension obligation.\n\n## Relevant references in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021\n\n- \u00b7 GAC Report, page 246.\n- \u00b7 Note 1.2(k): Critical accounting estimates and judgements, page 327.\n- \u00b7 Note 5: Employee compensation and benefits, page 331.",

        "page_content": "## How we tailored the audit scope\n\nWe performed a risk assessment, giving consideration to relevant external and internal factors, including Covid-19, climate change, geopolitical and economic risks, relevant accounting and regulatory developments, HSBC's strategy and the changes taking place across the group. We also considered our knowledge and experience obtained in prior year audits. As part of considering the impact of climate change in our risk assessment, we evaluated management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, which is set out on page 45, including their conclusion that there is no material impact on the financial statements. In particular, we considered management's assessment of the impact on ECL on loans and advances to customers, the financial statement line item we determined to be most likely to be impacted by climate risk. Management's assessment gave consideration to a number of matters, including the climate stress testing performed in 2021.\n\nUsing our risk assessment, we tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate. We continually assessed risks and changed the scope of our audit where necessary.\n\nOur risk assessment and scoping identified certain entities (collectively the Significant Subsidiaries) for which we obtained audit opinions. We obtained full scope audit opinions for the consolidated financial position and performance of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank plc, and HSBC North America Holdings Limited. We also obtained full scope audit opinions for the company financial position and performance of HSBC UK Bank plc, HSBC Bank Canada and HSBC Mexico S.A. We obtained audit opinions over specific balances for HSBC Bank Middle East Limited - UAE Operations. The audits for HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK Bank plc were performed by other PwC teams in the UK. All other audits were performed by other PwC network firms.\n\nWe continued with our approach for rotating certain smaller locations in and out of scope over a number of reporting periods. These locations, which are subject to local external audits, are individually relatively small compared to the group. Notwithstanding their size, the rotational approach is designed to ensure that over time these locations are subject to audit work as part of the group audit. HSBC Bank Malaysia was removed from the scope of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited audit for 2021 and India was included.\n\n## Group-wide audit approach\n\nHSBC has entity level controls that have a pervasive influence across the group, as well as other global and regional governance and controls over aspects of financial reporting, such as those operated by the Global Risk function for expected credit losses. A significant amount of IT and operational processes and controls relevant to financial reporting are undertaken in operations centres run by Digital Business Services ('DBS') across different locations. Financial reporting processes and controls are performed centrally in HSBC's Group Finance function and the four Finance operations centres, including the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, the consolidation of the group's results, the preparation of the financial statements, and management's oversight controls relevant to the group's financial reporting.\n\nFor these areas, we either performed audit work ourselves, or directed and provided oversight of the audit work performed by PwC teams in the UK, Poland, China, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India and the Philippines. A substantial part of our audit testing in these locations was performed remotely. Some of this work was relied upon by the PwC teams auditing the Significant Subsidiaries. This audit work, together with analytical review procedures and assessing the outcome of local external audits, also mitigated the risk of material misstatement for balances in entities that were not part of a Significant Subsidiary.\n\n## Significant Subsidiaries audit approach\n\nWe asked the partners and teams reporting to us on the Significant Subsidiaries to work to assigned materiality levels reflecting the size of the operations they audited. The performance materiality levels ranged from US$48m to US$690m. Certain Significant Subsidiaries were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was less than our overall group materiality.\n\nWe designed global audit approaches for the products and services that substantially make up HSBC's global businesses, such as lending, deposits and derivatives. These approaches were provided to the partners and teams performing audit testing for the Significant Subsidiaries.\n\nWe were in active dialogue throughout the year with the partners and teams responsible for the audits of the Significant Subsidiaries, including consideration of how they planned and performed their work. We attended Audit Committee meetings for some of the Significant Subsidiaries. We also attended meetings with management in each of these Significant Subsidiaries at the year-end. Given the impact of Covid-19 on working practices and international travel, the majority of our interactions continued to be undertaken virtually.\n\nThe audit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited in Hong Kong relied upon work performed by other teams in Hong Kong and the PwC network firms in India, mainland China and Singapore. Similarly, the audit of HSBC Bank plc in the UK relied upon work performed by other teams in the UK and the PwC network firms in France and Germany. We considered how the audit partners and teams for the Significant Subsidiaries instructed and provided oversight to the work performed in these locations. Collectively, Significant Subsidiaries covered 85% of total assets and 75% of total operating income.\n\n## Using the work of others\n\nWe continued to make use of evidence provided by others. This included testing of controls performed by Global Internal Audit and management themselves in some low risk areas. We used the work of PwC experts, for example, economic experts for our work around the severity and probability weighting of macroeconomic variables used as part of the expected credit loss allowance and actuaries on the estimates used in determining pension liabilities. An increasing number of controls are operated on behalf of HSBC by third parties. We obtained audit evidence from work that is scoped and provided by other auditors that are engaged by those third parties. For example, we obtained a report evidencing the testing of external systems and controls supporting HSBC's payroll and HR processes.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.",

This would result in an overall  materiality of US$2bn and was therefore reduced below the  group materiality level.                                                                                                          |\n| Rationale for benchmark  applied | We believe a standard benchmark of 5% of adjusted profit  before tax is an appropriate quantitative indicator of  materiality, although certain items could also be material for  qualitative reasons. This benchmark is standard for listed  entities and consistent with the wider industry. We selected  adjusted profit because, as discussed on page 28,  management believes it best reflects the performance of  HSBC and how the group is run. We excluded the  adjustments made by management on page 28 for certain  customer redress programmes and fair value movements of | A benchmark of total assets has been used, as the  company's primary purpose is to act as a holding company  with investments in the group's subsidiaries, not to generate  operating profits and therefore a profit based measure is not  relevant. |\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to US$725m for the group financial statements and US$690m for the company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors, including the history of misstatements, our risk assessment and aggregation risk, and the effectiveness of controls. We concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the GAC that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above US$48m (group audit) (2020: US$45m) and US$48m (company audit) (2020: US$45m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Performing a risk assessment to identify factors that could impact the going concern basis of accounting, including the impact of external risks including geopolitical, Covid-19 and climate change risks.\n- \u00b7 Understanding and evaluating the group's financial forecasts and the group's stress testing of liquidity and regulatory capital, including the severity of the stress scenarios that were used.\n- \u00b7 Understanding and evaluating credit rating agency ratings and actions.\n- \u00b7 Reading and evaluating the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements in relation to going concern.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the directors' reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information, which includes reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') recommendations. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information, including the TCFD reporting and other information related to climate change, is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic report and Report of the Directors, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.",

        "page_content": "Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic Report and Report of the Directors'\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Report of the Directors' for the year ended 31 December 2021 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Report of the Directors'.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The directors' confirmation that they have carried out an assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- \u00b7 The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group's and company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the group's and company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group's and company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- \u00b7 The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the GAC.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.\n\n## Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in the Directors' responsibility statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) and ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to the Board of Directors and Shareholders of HSBC Holdings plc\n\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of financial crime laws and regulations and regulatory compliance, including regulatory reporting requirements and conduct of business, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce costs, creating fictitious trades to hide losses or to improve financial performance, and management bias in accounting estimates. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the Significant Subsidiaries auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of correspondence with and reports from the regulators, including the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA');\n- \u00b7 Reviewed reporting to the GAC and GRC in respect of compliance and legal matters;\n- \u00b7 Review a sample of legal correspondence with legal advisors;\n- \u00b7 Enquiries of management and review of internal audit reports, insofar as they related to the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 Obtain legal confirmations from legal advisors relating to material litigation and compliance matters;\n- \u00b7 Assessment of matters reported on the group's whistleblowing programmes and the results of management's investigation of such matters; insofar as they related to the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates, in particular in relation to the determination of expected credit losses, the impairment assessments of the investment in BoCom, valuation of defined benefit pensions obligations and investment in subsidiaries (see related key audit matters);\n- \u00b7 Obtaining confirmations from third parties to confirm the existence of a sample of transactions and balances; and\n- \u00b7 Identifying and testing journal entries, including those posted with certain descriptions, posted and approved by the same individual, backdated journals or posted by infrequent and unexpected users.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements in accordance with ISAs (UK) is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's and company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's and company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group and company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group and company audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we",

      |        388 |\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies\n\n## 1.1 Basis of preparation\n\n## (a) Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings comply with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and have also applied international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union. These financial statements are also prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'), including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, as there are no applicable differences from IFRSs as issued by the IASB for the periods presented. There were no unendorsed standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2021 affecting these consolidated and separate financial statements.\n\n## Standards adopted during the year ended 31 December 2021\n\nThere were no new accounting standards or interpretations that had a significant effect on HSBC in 2021. Accounting policies have been consistently applied.\n\n## (b)    Differences between IFRSs and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThere are no significant differences between IFRSs and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards in terms of their application to HSBC, and consequently there would be no significant differences had the financial statements been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards. The 'Notes on the financial statements', taken together with the 'Report of the Directors', include the aggregate of all disclosures necessary to satisfy IFRSs and Hong Kong reporting requirements.\n\n## (c) Future accounting developments\n\n## Minor amendments to IFRSs\n\nThe IASB has not published any minor amendments effective from 1 January 2021 that are applicable to HSBC. However, the IASB has published a number of minor amendments to IFRSs that are effective from 1 January 2022 and 1 January 2023. HSBC expects they will have an insignificant effect, when adopted, on the consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of HSBC Holdings.\n\n## New IFRSs\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' was issued in May 2017, with amendments to the standard issued in June 2020. The standard sets out the requirements that an entity should apply in accounting for insurance contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it holds. Following the amendments, IFRS 17 is effective from 1 January 2023. The standard has been endorsed for use in the EU but has not yet been endorsed for use in the UK. The Group is in the process of implementing IFRS 17. Industry practice and interpretation of the standard are still developing. Therefore, the likely financial impact of its implementation remains uncertain. However, we have the following expectations as to the impact compared with our current accounting policy for insurance contracts, which is set out in policy 1.2(j) below:\n\n- \u00b7 Under IFRS 17, there will be no present value of in-force business ('PVIF') asset recognised. Instead the estimated future profit will be included in the measurement of the insurance contract liability as the contractual service margin ('CSM'), representing  unearned profit, and this will be gradually recognised in revenue as services are provided over the duration of the insurance contract. While the profit over the life of an individual contract will be unchanged, its emergence will be later under IFRS 17. The removal  of the PVIF asset and the recognition of  CSM, which is a liability, will reduce  equity. The PVIF asset will be eliminated to equity on transition, together with other adjustments to assets and liabilities to reflect IFRS 17 measurement requirements and any consequential amendments to financial assets in the scope of IFRS 9.",

    {
        "page_content": "- \u00b7 IFRS 17 requires increased use of current market values in the measurement of insurance liabilities. Changes in market conditions for certain products measured under the general measurement approach are immediately recognised in profit or loss, while changes in market conditions for other products measured under the variable fee approach are included in the measurement of CSM.\n- \u00b7 In accordance with IFRS 17, directly attributable costs will be incorporated in the CSM and recognised in the results of insurance services as a reduction in reported revenue, as profit is recognised over the duration of insurance contracts.  Costs that are not directly attributable will remain in operating expenses. This will result in a reduction in reported operating expenses compared with the current accounting policy.\n- \u00b7 We intend to provide an update on the likely financial impacts at or around our 2022 interim results announcement, when we expect that this will be reasonably estimable.\n\n## (d) Foreign currencies\n\nHSBC's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major currency bloc in which HSBC transacts and funds its business. The US dollar is also HSBC Holdings' functional currency because the US dollar and currencies linked to it are the most significant currencies relevant to the underlying transactions, events and conditions of its subsidiaries, as well as representing a significant proportion of its funds generated from financing activities.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, except non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost, which are translated using the rate of exchange at the initial transaction date. Exchange differences are included in other comprehensive income or in the income statement depending on where the gain or loss on the underlying item is recognised. In the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not US dollars are translated into the Group's presentation currency at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date, while their results are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange for the reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, exchange differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## (e) Presentation of information\n\nCertain disclosures required by IFRSs have been included in the sections marked as ('Audited') in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Disclosures concerning the nature and extent of risks relating to insurance contracts and financial instruments are included in the 'Risk review' on pages 120 to 216.\n- \u00b7 The 'Own funds disclosure' is included in the 'Risk review' on page 193.\n- \u00b7 Disclosures relating to HSBC's securitisation activities and structured products are included in the 'Risk review' on pages 120 to 216.\n\nHSBC follows the UK Finance Disclosure Code. The UK Finance Disclosure Code aims to increase the quality and comparability of UK banks' disclosures and sets out five disclosure principles together with supporting guidance agreed in 2010. In line with the principles of the UK Finance Disclosure Code, HSBC assesses good practice recommendations issued from time to time by relevant regulators and standard setters, and will assess the applicability and relevance of such guidance, enhancing disclosures where appropriate.\n\n## (f) Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial information requires the use of estimates and judgements about future conditions. In view of the inherent uncertainties and the high level of subjectivity involved in the recognition or measurement of items, highlighted as the 'critical accounting estimates and judgements' in section 1.2 below, it is possible that the outcomes in the next financial year could differ from those on which management's estimates are based. This could result in materially different estimates and judgements from those reached by management for the purposes of these financial statements. Management's selection of HSBC's accounting policies that contain critical estimates and judgements reflects the materiality of the items to which the policies are applied and the high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty involved.\n\n## (g) Segmental analysis\n\nHSBC's Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Group Chief Executive, who is supported by the rest of the Group Executive Committee ('GEC'), which operates as a general management committee under the direct authority of the Board. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group Chief Executive and the GEC.\n\nMeasurement of segmental assets, liabilities, income and expenses is in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Segmental income and expenses include transfers between segments, and these transfers are conducted at arm's length. Shared costs are included in segments on the basis of the actual recharges made.\n\n## (h) Going concern\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Directors are satisfied that the Group and parent company have the resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Directors have considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions, including future projections of profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and capital resources. These considerations include stressed scenarios that reflect the uncertainty that the global Covid-19 pandemic has had on HSBC's operations, as well as considering potential impacts from other top and emerging risks, and the related impact on profitability, capital and liquidity.\n\n## 1.2 Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## (a) Consolidation and related policies\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nWhere an entity is governed by voting rights, HSBC consolidates when it holds - directly or indirectly - the necessary voting rights to pass resolutions by the governing body. In all other cases, the assessment of control is more complex and requires judgement of other factors, including having exposure to variability of returns, power to direct relevant activities, and whether power is held as agent or principal.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The amount of non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. This election is made for each business combination.",

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\nHSBC Holdings' investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units ('CGUs') for the purpose of impairment testing, which is undertaken at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. HSBC's CGUs are based on geographical regions subdivided by global business, except for Global Banking and Markets, for which goodwill is monitored on a global basis.\n\nImpairment testing is performed at least once a year, or whenever there is an indication of impairment, by comparing the recoverable amount of a CGU with its carrying amount.\n\nGoodwill is included in a disposal group if the disposal group is a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated or it is an operation within such a CGU. The amount of goodwill included in a disposal group is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe review of goodwill and non-financial assets (see Note 1.2(n)) for impairment reflects management's best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as follows:\n\n| Judgements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 The accuracy of forecast cash flows is subject to a  high degree of uncertainty in volatile market  conditions. Where such circumstances are  determined to exist, management re-tests goodwill  for impairment more frequently than once a year  when indicators of impairment exist. This ensures  that the assumptions on which the cash flow  forecasts are based continue to reflect current  market conditions and management's best | \u00b7 The future cash flows of the CGUs are sensitive to the cash flows projected for the periods for  which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of  sustainable cash flows thereafter. Forecasts are compared with actual performance and verifiable  economic data, but they reflect management's view of future business prospects at the time of  the assessment. \u00b7 The rates used to discount future expected cash flows can have a significant effect on their  valuation, and are based on the costs of equity assigned to individual CGUs. The cost of equity  percentage is generally derived from a capital asset pricing model and market implied cost of  equity, which incorporates inputs reflecting a number of financial and economic variables, |\n\n## HSBC sponsored structured entities\n\nHSBC is considered to sponsor another entity if, in addition to ongoing involvement with the entity, it had a key role in establishing that entity or in bringing together relevant counterparties so the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur. HSBC is generally not considered a sponsor if the only involvement with the entity is merely administrative.\n\nInterests in associates and joint arrangements\n\nJoint arrangements are investments in which HSBC, together with one or more parties, has joint control. Depending on HSBC's rights and obligations, the joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture. HSBC classifies investments in entities over which it has significant influence, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint arrangements, as associates.\n\nHSBC recognises its share of the assets, liabilities and results in a joint operation. Investments in associates and interests in joint ventures are recognised using the equity method. The attributable share of the results and reserves of joint ventures and associates is included in the consolidated financial statements of HSBC based on either financial statements made up to 31 December or pro-rated amounts adjusted for any material transactions or events occurring between the date the financial statements are available and 31 December.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates is not tested separately for impairment, but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe most significant critical accounting estimates relate to the assessment of impairment of our investment in Bank of Communications Co. Limited ('BoCom'), which involves estimations of value in use:\n\n| Judgements   | Estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|              | \u00b7 Management's best estimate of BoCom's earnings are based on management's  explicit forecasts over the short to medium term and the capital maintenance  charge, which is management's forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in  order for BoCom to meet capital requirements over the forecast period, both of  which are subject to uncertain factors. |\n|              | \u00b7 Key assumptions used in estimating BoCom's value in use, the sensitivity of the  value in use calculations to different assumptions and a sensitivity analysis that  shows the changes in key assumptions that would reduce the excess of value in use  over the carrying amount (the 'headroom') to nil are described in Note 18.                                  |\n\n## (b) Income and expense\n\nOperating income\n\n## Interest income and expense\n\nInterest income and expense for all financial instruments, excluding those classified as held for trading or designated at fair value, are recognised in 'Interest income' and 'Interest expense' in the income statement using the effective interest method. However, as an exception to this, interest on debt instruments issued by HSBC for funding purposes that are designated under the fair value option to reduce an accounting mismatch and on derivatives managed in conjunction with those debt instruments is included in interest expense.\n\nInterest on credit-impaired financial assets is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.",

        "page_content": "## Non-interest income and expense\n\nHSBC generates fee income from services provided at a fixed price over time, such as account service and card fees, or when HSBC delivers a specific transaction at a point in time, such as broking services and import/export services. With the exception of certain fund management and performance fees, all other fees are generated at a fixed price. Fund management and performance fees can be variable depending on the size of the customer portfolio and HSBC's performance as fund manager. Variable fees are recognised when all uncertainties are resolved. Fee income is generally earned from short-term contracts with payment terms that do not include a significant financing component.\n\nHSBC acts as principal in the majority of contracts with customers, with the exception of broking services. For most brokerage trades, HSBC acts as agent in the transaction and recognises broking income net of fees payable to other parties in the arrangement.\n\nHSBC recognises fees earned on transaction-based arrangements at a point in time when it has fully provided the service to the customer. Where the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognised on a systematic basis over the life of the agreement.\n\nWhere HSBC offers a package of services that contains multiple non-distinct performance obligations, such as those included in account service packages, the promised services are treated as a single performance obligation. If a package of services contains distinct performance obligations, such as those including both account and insurance services, the corresponding transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated stand-alone selling prices.\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and usually the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities.\n\nNet income/(expense) from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis': This comprises net trading income, which includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities held for trading and other financial instruments managed on a fair value basis, together with the related interest income, expense and dividends, excluding the effect of changes in the credit risk of liabilities managed on a fair value basis. It also includes all gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are managed in conjunction with financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 'Net income/(expense) from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss': This includes interest income, interest expense and dividend income in respect of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss; and those derivatives managed in conjunction with the above that can be separately identifiable from other trading derivatives.\n- \u00b7 'Changes in fair value of designated debt instruments and related derivatives': Interest paid on debt instruments and interest cash flows on related derivatives is presented in interest expense where doing so reduces an accounting mismatch.\n- \u00b7 'Changes in fair value of other financial instruments mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss': This includes interest on instruments that fail the solely payments of principal and interest test, see (d) below.\n\nThe accounting policies for insurance premium income are disclosed in Note 1.2(j).\n\n## (c) Valuation of financial instruments\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is generally its transaction price (that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received). However, if there is a difference between the transaction price and the fair value of financial instruments whose fair value is based on a quoted price in an active market or a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, HSBC recognises the difference as a trading gain or loss at inception (a 'day 1 gain or loss'). In all other cases, the entire day 1 gain or loss is deferred and recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction until the transaction matures, is closed out, the valuation inputs become observable or HSBC enters into an offsetting transaction. The fair value of financial instruments is generally measured on an individual basis. However, in cases where HSBC manages a group of financial assets and liabilities according to its net market or credit risk exposure, the fair value of the group of financial instruments is measured on a net basis but the underlying financial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the financial statements, unless they satisfy the IFRS offsetting criteria.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data. However, certain financial instruments are classified on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable, and for them, the measurement of fair value is more judgemental:\n\n## Judgements\n\n## Estimates\n\n- \u00b7 An instrument in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if, in the opinion of management, a significant proportion of the instrument's inception profit or greater than 5% of the instrument's valuation is driven by unobservable inputs.\n- \u00b7 'Unobservable' in this context means that there is little or no current market data available from which to determine the price at which an arm's length transaction would be likely to occur. It generally does not mean that there is no data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value (consensus pricing data may, for example, be used).\n\n## (d) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect the contractual cash flows and which contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Such financial assets include most loans and advances to banks and customers and some debt securities. In addition, most financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. HSBC accounts for regular way amortised cost financial instruments using trade date accounting. The carrying value of these financial assets at initial recognition includes any directly attributable transactions costs.\n\nHSBC may commit to underwriting loans on fixed contractual terms for specified periods of time. When the loan arising from the lending commitment is expected to be held for trading, the commitment to lend is recorded as a derivative. When HSBC intends to hold the loan, the loan commitment is included in the impairment calculations set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Details on the Group's level 3 financial instruments and the sensitivity of their valuation to the effect of applying reasonable possible alternative assumptions in determining their fair value are set out in Note 12.",

        "page_content": "## Non-trading reverse repurchase, repurchase and similar agreements\n\nWhen debt securities are sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them at a predetermined price ('repos'), they remain on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded in respect of the consideration received. Securities purchased under commitments to resell ('reverse repos') are not recognised on the balance sheet and an asset is recorded in respect of the initial consideration paid. Non-trading repos and reverse repos are measured at amortised cost. The difference between the sale and repurchase price or between the purchase and resale price is treated as interest and recognised in net interest income over the life of the agreement.\n\nContracts that are economically equivalent to reverse repo or repo agreements (such as sales or purchases of debt securities entered into together with total return swaps with the same counterparty) are accounted for similarly to, and presented together with, reverse repo or repo agreements.\n\n## (e) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets held for a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling and which contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI'). These comprise primarily debt securities. They are recognised on the trade date when HSBC enters into contractual arrangements to purchase and are normally derecognised when they are either sold or redeemed. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value and changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses) are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Upon disposal, the cumulative gains or losses in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement as 'Gains less losses from financial instruments'. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are included in the impairment calculations set out below and impairment is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (f) Equity securities measured at fair value with fair value movements presented in other comprehensive income\n\nThe equity securities for which fair value movements are shown in other comprehensive income are business facilitation and other similar investments where HSBC holds the investments other than to generate a capital return. Gains or losses on the derecognition of these equity securities are not transferred to profit or loss. Otherwise, equity securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss (except for dividend income, which is recognised in profit or loss).\n\n## (g) Financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial instruments, other than those held for trading, are classified in this category if they meet one or more of the criteria set out below and are so designated irrevocably at inception:\n\n- \u00b7 The use of the designation removes or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch.\n- \u00b7 A group of financial assets and liabilities or a group of financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.\n- \u00b7 The financial liability contains one or more non-closely related embedded derivatives.\n\nDesignated financial assets are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on trade date, and are normally derecognised when the rights to the cash flows expire or are transferred. Designated financial liabilities are recognised when HSBC enters into contracts with counterparties, which is generally on settlement date, and are normally derecognised when extinguished. Subsequent changes in fair values are recognised in the income statement in 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis' or 'Net income/(expense) from assets and liabilities of insurance businesses, including related derivatives, measured at fair value through profit or loss' except for the effect of changes in the liabilities' credit risk, which is presented in 'Other comprehensive income', unless that treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.\n\nUnder the above criterion, the main classes of financial instruments designated by HSBC are:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments for funding purposes that are designated to reduce an accounting mismatch: The interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain fixed-rate debt securities issued has been matched with the interest and/or foreign exchange exposure on certain swaps as part of a documented risk management strategy.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets and financial liabilities under unit-linked and non-linked investment contracts: A contract under which HSBC does not accept significant insurance risk from another party is not classified as an insurance contract, other than investment contracts with discretionary participation features ('DPF'), but is accounted for as a financial liability. Customer liabilities under linked and certain nonlinked investment contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries are determined based on the fair value of the assets held in the linked funds. If no fair value designation was made for the related assets, at least some of the assets would otherwise be measured at either fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost. The related financial assets and liabilities are managed and reported to management on a fair value basis. Designation at fair value of the financial assets and related liabilities allows changes in fair values to be recorded in the income statement and presented in the same line.\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities that contain both deposit and derivative components: These financial liabilities are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis.\n\n## (h) Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, interest rates or other indices. Derivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes embedded derivatives in financial liabilities, which are bifurcated from the host contract when they meet the definition of a derivative on a stand-alone basis.\n\nWhere the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value, the contractual interest is shown in 'Interest expense' together with the interest payable on the issued debt.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWhen derivatives are not part of fair value designated relationships, if held for risk management purposes they are designated in hedge accounting relationships where the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. HSBC uses these derivatives or, where allowed, other non-derivative hedging instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as appropriate to the risk being hedged.",

        "page_content": "## Fair value hedge\n\nFair value hedge accounting does not change the recording of gains and losses on derivatives and other hedging instruments, but results in recognising changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk that would not otherwise be recognised in the income statement. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued and the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement on a recalculated effective interest rate, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of derivative hedging instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge relationship is recognised immediately in the income statement within 'Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis'. The accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the same periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedge relationship is discontinued, or partially discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. The effective portion of gains and losses on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and other gains and losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement on the disposal, or part disposal, of the foreign operation.\n\n## Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nNon-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not applied.\n\n## (i) Impairment of amortised cost and FVOCI financial assets\n\nExpected credit losses ('ECL') are recognised for loans and advances to banks and customers, non-trading reverse repurchase agreements, other financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months, or less, where the remaining life is less than 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance (or provision) is required for ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument ('lifetime ECL'). Financial assets where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be 'stage 1'; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk are in 'stage 2'; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment so are considered to be in default or otherwise credit impaired are in 'stage 3'. Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets ('POCI') are treated differently, as set out below.\n\n## Credit impaired (stage 3)\n\nHSBC determines that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily whether:\n\n- \u00b7 contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days;\n- \u00b7 there are other indications that the borrower is unlikely to pay, such as when a concession has been granted to the borrower for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's financial condition; and\n- \u00b7 the loan is otherwise considered to be in default.\n\nIf such unlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is deemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due, even where regulatory rules permit default to be defined based on 180 days past due. Therefore, the definitions of credit impaired and default are aligned as far as possible so that stage 3 represents all loans that are considered defaulted or otherwise credit impaired.\n\nInterest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost amount, i.e. gross carrying amount less ECL allowance.\n\n## Write-off\n\nFinancial assets (and the related impairment allowances) are normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where loans are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of security. In circumstances where the net realisable value of any collateral has been determined and there is no reasonable expectation of further recovery, write-off may be earlier.\n\n## Renegotiation\n\nLoans are identified as renegotiated and classified as credit impaired when we modify the contractual payment terms due to significant credit distress of the borrower. Renegotiated loans remain classified as credit impaired until there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment of future cash flows and retain the designation of renegotiated until maturity or derecognition.\n\nA loan that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially different terms, or if the terms of an existing agreement are modified such that the renegotiated loan is a substantially different financial instrument. Any new loans that arise following derecognition events in these circumstances are considered to be POCI and will continue to be disclosed as renegotiated loans.\n\nOther than originated credit-impaired loans, all other modified loans could be transferred out of stage 3 if they no longer exhibit any evidence of being credit impaired and, in the case of renegotiated loans, there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment of future cash flows over the minimum observation period, and there are no other indicators of impairment. These loans could be transferred to stage 1 or 2 based on the mechanism as described below by comparing the risk of a default occurring",

Any amount written off as a result of the modification of contractual terms would not be reversed.\n\n## Loan modifications other than renegotiated loans\n\nLoan modifications that are not identified as renegotiated are considered to be commercial restructuring. Where a commercial restructuring results in a modification (whether legalised through an amendment to the existing terms or the issuance of a new loan contract) such that HSBC's rights to the cash flows under the original contract have expired, the old loan is derecognised and the new loan is recognised at fair value. The rights to cash flows are generally considered to have expired if the commercial restructure is at market rates and no payment-related concession has been provided. Mandatory and general offer loan modifications that are not borrower-specific, for example market-wide customer relief programmes, have not been classified as renegotiated loans and generally have not resulted in derecognition, but their stage allocation is determined considering all available and supportable information under our ECL impairment policy. Changes made to these financial instruments that are economically equivalent and required by interest rate benchmark reform do not result in the derecognition or a change in the carrying amount of the financial instrument, but instead require the effective interest rate to be updated to reflect the change of the interest rate benchmark.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (stage 2)\n\nAn assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition is performed at each reporting period by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. The assessment explicitly or implicitly compares the risk of default occurring at the reporting date compared with that at initial recognition, taking into account reasonable and supportable information, including information about past events, current conditions and future economic conditions. The assessment is unbiased, probability-weighted, and to the extent relevant, uses forward-looking information consistent with that used in the measurement of ECL. The analysis of credit risk is multifactor. The determination of whether a specific factor is relevant and its weight compared with other factors depends on the type of product, the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower, and the geographical region. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a single set of criteria that will determine what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk, and these criteria will differ for different types of lending, particularly between retail and wholesale. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, all financial assets are deemed to have suffered a significant increase in credit risk when 30 days past due. In addition, wholesale loans that are individually assessed, which are typically corporate and commercial customers, and included on a watch or worry list, are included in stage 2.\n\nFor wholesale portfolios, the quantitative comparison assesses default risk using a lifetime probability of default ('PD'), which encompasses a wide range of information including the obligor's customer risk rating ('CRR'), macroeconomic condition forecasts and credit transition probabilities. For origination CRRs up to 3.3, significant increase in credit risk is measured by comparing the average PD for the remaining term estimated at origination with the equivalent estimation at the reporting date. The quantitative measure of significance varies depending on the credit quality at origination as follows:\n\n| Origination CRR   | Significance trigger - PD to increase by   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 0.1-1.2           | 15bps                                      |\n| 2.1-3.3           | 30bps                                      |\n\nFor CRRs greater than 3.3 that are not impaired, a significant increase in credit risk is considered to have occurred when the origination PD has doubled. The significance of changes in PD was informed by expert credit risk judgement, referenced to historical credit migrations and to relative changes in external market rates.\n\nFor loans originated prior to the implementation of IFRS 9, the origination PD does not include adjustments to reflect expectations of future macroeconomic conditions since these are not available without the use of hindsight. In the absence of this data, origination PD must be approximated assuming through-the-cycle PDs and through-the-cycle migration probabilities, consistent with the instrument's underlying modelling approach and the CRR at origination. For these loans, the quantitative comparison is supplemented with additional CRR deterioration-based thresholds, as set out in the table below:\n\n| Origination CRR   | Additional significance criteria - number of CRR grade notches deterioration  required to identify as significant credit deterioration (stage 2) (> or equal to)   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0.1               | 5 notches                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 1.1-4.2           | 4 notches                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 4.3-5.1           | 3 notches                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 5.2-7.1           | 2 notches                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 7.2-8.2           | 1 notch                                                                                                                                                            |\n| 8.3               | 0 notch                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Further information about the 23-grade scale used for CRR can be found on page 138.\n\nFor certain portfolios of debt securities where external market ratings are available and credit ratings are not used in credit risk management, the debt securities will be in stage 2 if their credit risk increases to the extent they are no longer considered investment grade. Investment grade is where the financial instrument has a low risk of incurring losses, the structure has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term, and adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the longer term may, but will not necessarily, reduce the ability of the borrower to fulfil their contractual cash flow obligations.\n\nFor retail portfolios, default risk is assessed using a reporting date 12-month PD derived from credit scores, which incorporates all available information about the customer. This PD is adjusted for the effect of macroeconomic forecasts for periods longer than 12 months and is considered to be a reasonable approximation of a lifetime PD measure. Retail exposures are first segmented into homogeneous portfolios, generally by country, product and brand. Within each portfolio, the stage 2 accounts are defined as accounts with an adjusted 12-month PD greater than the average 12-month PD of loans in that portfolio 12 months before they become 30 days past due. The expert credit risk judgement is that no prior increase in credit risk is significant. This portfolio-specific threshold identifies loans with a PD higher than would be expected from loans that are performing as originally expected, and higher than what would have been acceptable at origination. It therefore approximates a comparison of origination to reporting date PDs.\n\n## Unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk (stage 1)\n\nECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL') are recognised for financial instruments that remain in stage 1.",

        "page_content": "## Purchased or originated credit impaired\n\nFinancial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses are considered to be POCI. This population includes the recognition of a new financial instrument following a renegotiation where concessions have been granted for economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulty that otherwise would not have been considered. The amount of change-in-lifetime ECL is recognised in profit or loss until the POCI is derecognised, even if the lifetime ECL are less than the amount of ECL included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.\n\n## Movement between stages\n\nFinancial assets can be transferred between the different categories (other than POCI) depending on their relative increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Financial instruments are transferred out of stage 2 if their credit risk is no longer considered to be significantly increased since initial recognition based on the assessments described above. Except for renegotiated loans, financial instruments are transferred out of stage 3 when they no longer exhibit any evidence of credit impairment as described above. Renegotiated loans that are not POCI will continue to be in stage 3 until there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of non-payment of future cash flows, observed over a minimum one-year period and there are no other indicators of impairment. For loans that are assessed for impairment on a portfolio basis, the evidence typically comprises a history of payment performance against the original or revised terms, as appropriate to the circumstances. For loans that are assessed for impairment on an individual basis, all available evidence is assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nThe assessment of credit risk and the estimation of ECL are unbiased and probability-weighted, and incorporate all available information that is relevant to the assessment including information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date. In addition, the estimation of ECL should take into account the time value of money.\n\nIn general, HSBC calculates ECL using three main components: a probability of default, a loss given default ('LGD') and the exposure at default ('EAD').\n\nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD instead. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.\n\nThe EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money.\n\nHSBC makes use of the Basel II IRB framework where possible, with recalibration to meet the differing IFRS 9 requirements as set out in the following table:\n\n| Model   | Regulatory capital                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | IFRS 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD      | \u00b7 Through the cycle (represents long-run average PD throughout a  full economic cycle) \u00b7 The definition of default includes a backstop of 90+ days past  due, although this has been modified to 180+ days past due for                                        | \u00b7 Point in time (based on current conditions, adjusted to take into  account estimates of future conditions that will impact PD) \u00b7 Default backstop of 90+ days past due for all portfolios                                                   |\n| EAD     | \u00b7 Cannot be lower than current balance                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | \u00b7 Amortisation captured for term products                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| LGD     | \u00b7 Downturn LGD (consistent losses expected to be suffered during  a severe but plausible economic downturn) \u00b7 Regulatory floors may apply to mitigate risk of underestimating  downturn LGD due to lack of historical data  \u00b7 Discounted using cost of capital | \u00b7 Expected LGD (based on estimate of loss given default including  the expected impact of future economic conditions such as  changes in value of collateral) \u00b7 No floors \u00b7 Discounted using the original effective interest rate of the loan |\n| Other   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \u00b7 Discounted back from point of default to balance sheet date                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\nWhile 12-month PDs are recalibrated from Basel II models where possible, the lifetime PDs are determined by projecting the 12-month PD using a term structure. For the wholesale methodology, the lifetime PD also takes into account credit migration, i.e. a customer migrating through the CRR bands over its life.\n\nThe ECL for wholesale stage 3 is determined on an individual basis using a discounted cash flow ('DCF') methodology. The expected future cash flows are based on the credit risk officer's estimates as at the reporting date, reflecting reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections of future recoveries and expected future receipts of interest. Collateral is taken into account if it is likely that the recovery of the outstanding amount will include realisation of collateral based on the estimated fair value of collateral at the time of expected realisation, less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral. The cash flows are discounted at a reasonable approximation of the original effective interest rate. For significant cases, cash flows under four different scenarios are probability-weighted by reference to the economic scenarios applied more generally by the Group and the judgement of the credit risk officer in relation to the likelihood of the workout strategy succeeding or receivership being required. For less significant cases, the effect of different economic scenarios and work-out strategies is approximated and applied as an adjustment to the most likely outcome.\n\n## Period over which ECL is measured\n\nExpected credit loss is measured from the initial recognition of the financial asset. The maximum period considered when measuring ECL (be it 12-month or lifetime ECL) is the maximum contractual period over which HSBC is exposed to credit risk. For wholesale overdrafts, credit risk management actions are taken no less frequently than on an annual basis and therefore this period is to the expected date of the next substantive credit review. The date of the substantive credit review also represents the initial recognition of the new facility. However, where the financial instrument includes both a drawn and undrawn commitment and the contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not serve to limit HSBC's exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice period, the contractual period does not determine the maximum period considered. Instead, ECL is measured over the period HSBC remains exposed to credit risk that is not mitigated by credit risk management actions. This applies to retail overdrafts and credit cards, where the period is the average time taken for stage 2 exposures to default or close as performing accounts, determined on a portfolio basis and",

In addition, for these facilities it is not possible to identify the ECL on the loan commitment component separately from the financial asset component. As a result, the total ECL is recognised in the loss allowance for the financial asset unless the total ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as a provision.\n\n## Forward-looking economic inputs\n\nHSBC applies multiple forward-looking global economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecast distributions representative of its view of forecast economic conditions. This approach is considered sufficient to calculate unbiased expected loss in most economic environments. In certain economic environments, additional analysis may be necessary and may result in additional scenarios or adjustments, to reflect a range of possible economic outcomes sufficient for an unbiased estimate. The detailed methodology is disclosed in 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates' on page 144.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe calculation of the Group's ECL under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below:\n\n## Judgements\n\n## Estimates\n\n- \u00b7 Defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk\n- \u00b7 Determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of overdrafts and credit cards\n- \u00b7 Selecting and calibrating the PD, LGD and EAD models, which support the calculations, including making reasonable and supportable judgements about how models react to current and future economic conditions\n- \u00b7 Selecting model inputs and economic forecasts, including determining whether sufficient and appropriately weighted economic forecasts are incorporated to calculate unbiased expected loss\n- \u00b7 Making management adjustments to account for late breaking events, model and data limitations and deficiencies, and expert credit judgements\n\n## (j)   Insurance contracts\n\nA contract is classified as an insurance contract where HSBC accepts significant insurance risk from another party by agreeing to compensate that party on the occurrence of a specified uncertain future event. An insurance contract may also transfer financial risk, but is accounted for as an insurance contract if the insurance risk is significant. In addition, HSBC issues investment contracts with discretionary participation features ('DPF'), which are also accounted for as insurance contracts as required by IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts'.\n\n## Net insurance premium income\n\nPremiums for life insurance contracts are accounted for when receivable, except in unit-linked insurance contracts where premiums are accounted for when liabilities are established. Reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the direct insurance contracts to which they relate.\n\n## Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movements in liabilities to policyholders\n\nGross insurance claims for life insurance contracts reflect the total cost of claims arising during the year, including claim handling costs and any policyholder bonuses allocated in anticipation of a bonus declaration.\n\nMaturity claims are recognised when due for payment. Surrenders are recognised when paid or at an earlier date on which, following notification, the policy ceases to be included within the calculation of the related insurance liabilities. Death claims are recognised when notified.\n\nReinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.\n\n## Liabilities under insurance contracts\n\nLiabilities under non-linked life insurance contracts are calculated by each life insurance operation based on local actuarial principles. Liabilities under unit-linked life insurance contracts are at least equivalent to the surrender or transfer value, which is calculated by reference to the value of the relevant underlying funds or indices.\n\n## Future profit participation on insurance contracts with DPF\n\nWhere contracts provide discretionary profit participation benefits to policyholders, liabilities for these contracts include provisions for the future discretionary benefits to policyholders. These provisions reflect the actual performance of the investment portfolio to date and management's expectation of the future performance of the assets backing the contracts, as well as other experience factors such as mortality, lapses and operational efficiency, where appropriate. The benefits to policyholders may be determined by the contractual terms, regulation, or past distribution policy.\n\n## Investment contracts with DPF\n\nWhile investment contracts with DPF are financial instruments, they continue to be treated as insurance contracts as required by IFRS 4. The Group therefore recognises the premiums for these contracts as revenue and recognises as an expense the resulting increase in the carrying amount of the liability.\n\nIn the case of net unrealised investment gains on these contracts, whose discretionary benefits principally reflect the actual performance of the investment portfolio, the corresponding increase in the liabilities is recognised in either the income statement or other comprehensive income, following the treatment of the unrealised gains on the relevant assets. In the case of net unrealised losses, a deferred participating asset is recognised only to the extent that its recoverability is highly probable. Movements in the liabilities arising from realised gains and losses on relevant assets are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Present value of in-force long-term insurance business\n\nHSBC recognises the value placed on insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF, which are classified as long-term and inforce at the balance sheet date, as an asset. The asset represents the present value of the equity holders' interest in the issuing insurance companies' profits expected to emerge from these contracts written at the balance sheet date. The present value of in-force business ('PVIF') is determined by discounting those expected future profits using appropriate assumptions in assessing factors such as future mortality, lapse rates and levels of expenses, and a risk discount rate that reflects the risk premium attributable to the respective\n\n- \u00b7 The section 'Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates', marked as audited from page 144, sets out the assumptions used in determining ECL, and provides an indication of the sensitivity of the result to the application of different weightings being applied to different economic assumptions",

The PVIF asset is presented gross of attributable tax in the balance sheet and movements in the PVIF asset are included in 'Other operating income' on a gross of tax basis.\n\n## (k) Employee compensation and benefits\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nHSBC enters into both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payment arrangements with its employees as compensation for the provision of their services.\n\nThe vesting period for these schemes may commence before the legal grant date if the employees have started to render services in respect of the award before the legal grant date, where there is a shared understanding of the terms and conditions of the arrangement. Expenses are recognised when the employee starts to render service to which the award relates.\n\nCancellations result from the failure to meet a non-vesting condition during the vesting period, and are treated as an acceleration of vesting recognised immediately in the income statement. Failure to meet a vesting condition by the employee is not treated as a cancellation, and the amount of expense recognised for the award is adjusted to reflect the number of awards expected to vest.\n\n## Post-employment benefit plans\n\nHSBC operates a number of pension schemes including defined benefit, defined contribution and post-employment benefit schemes.\n\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as the employees render service.\n\nDefined benefit pension obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. The net charge to the income statement mainly comprises the service cost and the net interest on the net defined benefit asset or liability, and is presented in operating expenses. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit asset or liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets excluding interest and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The net defined benefit asset or liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets (see policy (c)), after applying the asset ceiling test, where the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nThe cost of obligations arising from other post-employment plans are accounted for on the same basis as defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe most significant critical accounting estimates relate to the determination of key assumptions applied in calculating the defined benefit pension obligation for the principal plan.\n\n| Judgements   | Estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|              | \u00b7 A range of assumptions could be applied, and different assumptions could  significantly alter the defined benefit obligation and the amounts recognised in  profit or loss or OCI.                                                                                                |\n|              | \u00b7 The calculation of the defined benefit pension obligation includes assumptions with  regard to the discount rate, inflation rate, pension payments and deferred pensions,  pay and mortality.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised in the same statement as the related item appears.\n\nCurrent tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable profit for the year and on any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. HSBC provides for potential current tax liabilities that may arise on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, and the amounts attributed to such assets and liabilities for tax purposes. Deferred tax is calculated using the tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the assets will be realised or the liabilities settled.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are calculated based on tax rates and laws enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets depends on judgements and estimates.\n\n| Judgements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 In assessing the probability and sufficiency of future taxable profit, we  consider the availability of evidence to support the recognition of deferred  tax assets. taking into account the inherent risk in long-term forecasting  and drivers of recent history of tax losses where applicable, taking into  account the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and  tax planning strategies including corporate reorganisations. Specific  judgements supporting deferred tax assets are described in Note 7. | The recognition of deferred tax assets is sensitive to estimates of future  cash flows projected for periods for which detailed forecasts are available  and to assumptions regarding the long-term pattern of cash flows  thereafter, on which forecasts of future taxable profit are based, and  which affect the expected recovery periods and the pattern of utilisation  of tax losses and tax credits.

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\n## (m)  Provisions, contingent liabilities and guarantees\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive obligation that has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe recognition and measurement of provisions requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below:\n\n## Judgements\n\n## Estimates\n\n- \u00b7 Determining whether a present obligation exists. Professional advice is taken on the assessment of litigation and similar obligations.\n- \u00b7 Provisions for legal proceedings and regulatory matters typically require a higher degree of judgement than other types of provisions. When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty associated with determining whether a present obligation exists, and estimating the probability and amount of any outflows that may arise. As matters progress, management and legal advisers evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, revising previous estimates as appropriate. At more advanced stages, it is typically easier to make estimates around a better defined set of possible outcomes.\n\n## Contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities, which include certain guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security, and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings or regulatory matters, are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the probability of settlement is remote.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nLiabilities under financial guarantee contracts that are not classified as insurance contracts are recorded initially at their fair value, which is generally the fee received or present value of the fee receivable.\n\nHSBC Holdings has issued financial guarantees and similar contracts to other Group entities. HSBC elects to account for certain guarantees as insurance contracts in HSBC Holdings' financial statements, in which case they are measured and recognised as insurance liabilities. This election is made on a contract-by-contract basis, and is irrevocable.\n\n## (n) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nSoftware under development is tested for impairment at least annually. Other non-financial assets are property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and right-of-use assets. They are tested for impairment at the individual asset level when there is indication of impairment at that level, or at the CGU level for assets that do not have a recoverable amount at the individual asset level. In addition, impairment is also tested at the CGU level when there is indication of impairment at that level. For this purpose, CGUs are considered to be the principal operating legal entities divided by global business.\n\nImpairment testing compares the carrying amount of the non-financial asset or CGU with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use. The carrying amount of a CGU comprises the carrying value of its assets and liabilities, including non-financial assets that are directly attributable to it and non-financial assets that can be allocated to it on a reasonable and consistent basis. Non-financial assets that cannot be allocated to an individual CGU are tested for impairment at an appropriate grouping of CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU, which is determined by independent and qualified valuers where relevant, and the value in use, which is calculated based on appropriate inputs (see Note 21).\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the impairment can be allocated on a pro-rata basis to the non-financial assets by reducing their carrying amounts to the higher of their respective individual recoverable amount or nil. Impairment is not allocated to the financial assets in a CGU.\n\nImpairment loss recognised in prior periods for non-financial assets is reversed when there has been a change in the estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the non-financial assets would not exceed the amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe review of goodwill and other non-financial assets for impairment reflects management's best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as described in the Critical accounting estimates and judgements in Note 1.2(a).\n\n- \u00b7 Provisions for legal proceedings and regulatory matters remain very sensitive to the assumptions used in the estimate. There could be a wider range of possible outcomes for any pending legal proceedings, investigations or inquiries. As a result it is often not practicable to quantify a range of possible outcomes for individual matters. It is also not practicable to meaningfully quantify ranges of potential outcomes in aggregate for these types of provisions because of the diverse nature and circumstances of such matters and the wide range of uncertainties involved.",

'Pension risk management processes' on page 192 contains details of the policies and practices associated with these pension plans, some of which are defined benefit plans. The largest defined benefit plan is the HBUK section of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme ('the principal plan'), created as a result of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme being fully sectionalised in 2018 to meet the requirements of the Banking Reform Act.\n\nHSBC holds on its balance sheet the net surplus or deficit, which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date for each plan. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through potential future refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, HSBC has considered its current right to obtain a future refund or a reduction in future contributions together with the rights of third parties such as trustees.\n\n## The principal plan\n\nThe principal plan has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section. The defined benefit section was closed to future benefit accrual in 2015, with defined benefits earned by employees at that date continuing to be linked to their salary while they remain employed by HSBC. The plan is overseen by an independent corporate trustee, who has a fiduciary responsibility for the operation of the plan. Its assets are held separately from the assets of the Group.\n\nThe investment strategy of the plan is to hold the majority of assets in bonds, with the remainder in a diverse range of investments. It also includes some interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk, inflation swaps to reduce inflation risk and longevity swaps to reduce the impact of longer life expectancy.\n\nThe latest funding valuation of the plan at 31 December 2019 was carried out by Colin G Singer of Willis Towers Watson Limited, who is a Fellow of the UK Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. At that date, the market value of the plan's assets was \u00a331.1bn ($41.1bn) and this exceeded the value placed on its liabilities on an ongoing basis by \u00a32.5bn ($3.3bn), giving a funding level of 109%. These figures include defined contribution assets amounting to \u00a32.4bn ($3.2bn). The main differences between the assumptions used for assessing the defined benefit liabilities for this funding valuation and those used for IAS 19 are more prudent assumptions for discount rate, inflation rate and life expectancy. The next funding valuation will have an effective date of 31 December 2022.\n\nAlthough the plan was in surplus at the valuation date, HSBC continued to make separately committed lump sum contributions and the final such contribution of \u00a3160m ($218m) was paid in 2021. The main employer of the principal plan is HSBC UK Bank plc, with additional support from HSBC Holdings plc. The HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme is fully sectionalised and no entities outside the ring fence participate in the HBUK section.\n\nThe actuary also assessed the value of the liabilities if the plan were to have been stopped and an insurance company asked to secure all future pension payments. This is generally larger than the amount needed on the ongoing basis described above because an insurance company would use more prudent assumptions and include an explicit allowance for the future administrative expenses of the plan. Under this approach, the amount of assets needed was estimated to be \u00a333bn ($44bn) at 31 December 2019.\n\n## Guaranteed minimum pension equalisation\n\nFollowing a judgment issued by the High Court of Justice of England and Wales in 2018, we estimated the financial effect of equalising benefits in respect of guaranteed minimum pension ('GMP') equalisation, and any potential conversion of GMPs into non-GMP benefits, to be an approximate 0.9% increase in the principal plan's liabilities, or \u00a3187m ($239m). This was recognised in the income statement in 2018. A further judgment by the High Court on 20 November 2020 ruled that GMPs should also be equalised for those who had previously transferred benefits from the principal plan to another arrangement, with \u00a313m ($17m) consequently being recognised in 2020. We continue to assess the impact of GMP equalisation.",

The key applicable tax rates for 2021 include Hong Kong (16.5%), the US (21%) and the UK (19%). If the Group's profits were taxed at the statutory rates of the countries in which the profits arose, then the tax rate for the year would have been 22.3% (2020: 19.7%). The effective tax rate for the year of 22.3% was lower than in the previous year (2020: 30.5%). The impact of non-recognition of deferred tax was smaller in 2021 than in 2020, which decreased the effective tax rate by 10.8%. This was partly offset by changes in the geographical composition of profits, which resulted in tax at applicable local statutory rates being 2.5% greater for 2020 than for 2021.\n\nThe signing of a framework agreement for the planned sale of the French retail banking business resulted in a tax deduction (tax value of $434m) for a provision for loss on disposal, which was recorded in the French tax return. A deferred tax liability of the same amount arises as a consequence of the temporary difference between the French tax basis and IFRSs in respect of this provision.\n\nDuring 2021, legislation to increase the main rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25% from 1 April 2023 was enacted, increasing the Group's 2021 tax charge by $132m due to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances.\n\nAccounting for taxes involves some estimation because tax law is uncertain and its application requires a degree of judgement, which authorities may dispute. Liabilities are recognised based on best estimates of the probable outcome, taking into account external advice where appropriate. We do not expect significant liabilities to arise in excess of the amounts provided. HSBC only recognises current and deferred tax assets where recovery is probable.",

Management's assessment of the likely availability of future taxable profits against which to recover deferred tax assets is based on the most recent financial forecasts approved by management, which cover a five-year period and are extrapolated where necessary, and takes into consideration the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and past business performance.\n\nThe Group's net deferred tax asset of $4.6bn (2020: $4.5bn) included $2.6bn (2020: $2.4bn) of deferred tax assets relating to the US and a net deferred asset of $0.0bn (2020: $0.00) in France.\n\nThe net US deferred tax asset of $2.6bn included $1.1bn related to US tax losses that expire in 13 to 17 years. Management expects the US deferred tax asset to be substantially recovered in seven to eight years, with the majority recovered in the first five years.\n\nThe net deferred tax asset in France of $0.0bn included $0.4bn related to tax losses which are expected to be substantially recovered within 10 years.\n\nFollowing the signing of a framework agreement in 2021 for the planned sale of the French retail banking business, that business is now excluded from our deferred tax analysis as its sale is considered probable. Although the French consolidated tax group recorded a tax loss in both 2020 and 2021, this would have been taxable profit if the effects of the retail banking business and other non-recurring items, mainly related to the restructuring of the European business, were excluded. The French net deferred tax asset is supported by forecasts of taxable profit, also taking into consideration the history of profitability in the remaining businesses. No net deferred tax asset was recognised as at 31 December 2020 as management did not consider there to be convincing evidence of sufficient future taxable profits within the French consolidated tax group to support recognition.\n\nThe Group's net deferred tax liability of $4.7bn (2020: $4.3bn) included a net UK deferred tax asset of $0.8bn (2020: $0.6bn), of which $0.2bn related to UK banking tax losses which are expected to be substantially recovered within one year. The net UK deferred tax asset of $0.8bn excludes a $3.0bn deferred tax liability arising on the UK pension scheme surplus, the reversal of which is not taken into account when estimating future taxable profits. The UK deferred tax assets are supported by forecasts of taxable profit, also taking into consideration the history of profitability in the relevant businesses.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax\n\nThe amount of gross temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the balance sheet was $16.9bn (2020: $15.6bn). This amount included unused UK tax losses of $10.5bn (2020: $9.3bn), of which $5.8bn (2020: $4.3bn) arose after 1 April 2017 and can be recovered against the future taxable profits of any of the Group's UK tax resident subsidiaries. The remaining balance can only be recovered against future taxable profits of HSBC Holdings plc. No deferred tax was recognised on any of these losses due to the absence of convincing evidence regarding the availability of sufficient future taxable profits against which to recover them, taking into account the recent history of taxable losses within the UK group. Deferred tax asset recognition is reassessed at each balance sheet date based on the available evidence. Of the total amounts unrecognised, $10.9bn (2020: $11.5bn) had no expiry date, $0.7bn (2020: $0.7bn) was scheduled to expire within 10 years and the remaining balance is expected to expire after 10 years.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Group's investments in subsidiaries and branches where HSBC is able to control the timing of remittance or other realisation and where remittance or realisation is not probable in the foreseeable future. The aggregate temporary differences relating to unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on investments in subsidiaries and branches is $12.7bn (2020: $12.1bn) and the corresponding unrecognised deferred tax liability was $0.8bn (2020: $0.7bn).",

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the basic earnings, which require no adjustment for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares.",

Global business results are assessed by the CODM on the basis of adjusted performance that removes the effects of significant items and currency translation from reported results. Therefore, we present these results on an adjusted basis as required by IFRSs. The 2020 and 2019 adjusted performance information is presented on a constant currency basis. The 2020 and 2019 income statements are converted at the average rates of exchange for 2021, and the balance sheets at 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019 at the prevailing rates of exchange on 31 December 2021.\n\nOur operations are closely integrated and, accordingly, the presentation of data includes internal allocations of certain items of income and expense. These allocations include the costs of certain support services and global functions to the extent that they can be meaningfully attributed to global businesses. While such allocations have been made on a systematic and consistent basis, they necessarily involve a degree of subjectivity. Costs that are not allocated to global businesses are included in Corporate Centre.\n\nWhere relevant, income and expense amounts presented include the results of inter-segment funding along with inter-company and interbusiness line transactions. All such transactions are undertaken on arm's length terms. The intra-Group elimination items for the global businesses are presented in Corporate Centre.\n\n## Our global businesses\n\nWe provide a comprehensive range of banking and related financial services to our customers in our three global businesses.

For inactive markets, HSBC sources alternative market information, with greater weight given to information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. Examples of the factors considered are price observability, instrument comparability, consistency of data sources, underlying data accuracy and timing of prices.\n\nFor fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework includes development or validation by independent support functions of the model logic, inputs, model outputs and adjustments. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence before becoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis.\n\nChanges in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process and are disaggregated into high-level categories including portfolio changes, market movements and other fair value adjustments.\n\nThe majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GBM. GBM's fair value governance structure comprises its Finance function, Valuation Committees and a Valuation Committee Review Group. Finance is responsible for establishing procedures governing valuation and ensuring fair values are in compliance with accounting standards. The fair values are reviewed by the Valuation Committees, which consist of independent support functions. These committees are overseen by the Valuation Committee Review Group, which considers all material subjective valuations.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at fair value\n\nIn certain circumstances, HSBC records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific instrument. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which are either based on quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an active market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread that is appropriate to HSBC's liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Group's own credit spread is computed as follows: for each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar securities for the same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using an appropriate market discount curve. The difference in the valuations is attributable to the Group's own credit spread. This methodology is applied consistently across all securities.\n\nStructured notes issued and certain other hybrid instruments are included within trading liabilities and are measured at fair value. The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC issues structured notes.\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC, recorded in other comprehensive income, reverse over the contractual life of the debt, provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nFair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - valuation technique using quoted market price. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets that HSBC can access at the measurement date.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - valuation technique using observable inputs. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs. These are financial instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.",

Transfers into and out of levels of the fair value hierarchy are primarily attributable to observability of valuation inputs and price transparency.\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nWe adopt the use of fair value adjustments when we take into consideration additional factors not incorporated within the valuation model that would otherwise be considered by a market participant. We classify fair value adjustments as either 'risk-related' or 'modelrelated'. The majority of these adjustments relate to GBM. Movements in the level of fair value adjustments do not necessarily result in the recognition of profits or losses within the income statement. For example, as models are enhanced, fair value adjustments may no longer be required. Similarly, fair value adjustments will decrease when the related positions are unwound, but this may not result in profit or loss.\n\nGlobal Banking and Markets fair value adjustments\n\n|                                       | 2021   | 2021                | 2020   | 2020                |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|---------------------|--------|---------------------|\n|                                       | GBM $m | Corporate Centre $m | GBM $m | Corporate Centre $m |\n| Type of adjustment                    |        |                     |        |                     |\n| Risk-related                          | 868    | 42                  | 1,170  | 28                  |\n| -  bid-offer                          | 412    | -                   | 514    | -                   |\n| -  uncertainty                        | 66     | 1                   | 106    | 1                   |\n| -  credit valuation adjustment        | 228    | 35                  | 445    | 27                  |\n| -  debt valuation adjustment          | (92)   | -                   | (120)  | -                   |\n| -  funding fair value adjustment      | 254    | 6                   | 204    | -                   |\n| -  other                              | -      | -                   | 21     | -                   |\n| Model-related                         | 57     | -                   | 74     | -                   |\n| -  model limitation                   | 57     | -                   | 70     | -                   |\n| -  other                              | -      | -                   | 4      | -                   |\n| Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves) | 106    | -                   | 104    | -                   |\n| At 31 Dec                             | 1,031  | 42                  | 1,348  | 28                  |\n\nWe continue to observe losses on the disposals of certain uncollateralised over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives as part of our commitments to reduce RWAs in GBM, as set out in our business update in February 2020. Based on our analysis, these losses are not considered to give rise to an adjustment within the IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' framework.\n\nThe reduction in fair value adjustments was driven by increased liquidity, lower volatility and an improved credit environment. Movement in funding fair value adjustment included a change in measurement from Libor to a Libor replacement risk-free rate.\n\n## Bid-offer\n\nIFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' requires the use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value. Valuation models will typically generate mid-market values. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if substantially all residual net portfolio market risks were closed using available hedging instruments or by disposing of or unwinding the position.",

        "page_content": "## Uncertainty\n\nCertain model inputs may be less readily determinable from market data and/or the choice of model itself may be more subjective. In these circumstances, an adjustment may be necessary to reflect the likelihood that market participants would adopt more conservative values for uncertain parameters and/or model assumptions than those used in HSBC's valuation model.\n\n## Credit and debt valuation adjustments\n\nThe credit valuation adjustment ('CVA') is an adjustment to the valuation of over-the-counter ('OTC') derivative contracts to reflect the possibility that the counterparty may default and that HSBC may not receive the full market value of the transactions.\n\nThe debt valuation adjustment ('DVA') is an adjustment to the valuation of OTC derivative contracts to reflect the possibility that HSBC may default, and that it may not pay the full market value of the transactions.\n\nHSBC calculates a separate CVA and DVA for each legal entity, and for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure. With the exception of central clearing parties, all third-party counterparties are included in the CVA and DVA calculations, and these adjustments are not netted across Group entities.\n\nHSBC calculates the CVA by applying the probability of default ('PD') of the counterparty, conditional on the non-default of HSBC, to HSBC's expected positive exposure to the counterparty and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Conversely, HSBC calculates the DVA by applying the PD of HSBC, conditional on the non-default of the counterparty, to the expected positive exposure of the counterparty to HSBC and multiplying the result by the loss expected in the event of default. Both calculations are performed over the life of the potential exposure.\n\nFor most products HSBC uses a simulation methodology, which incorporates a range of potential exposures over the life of the portfolio, to calculate the expected positive exposure to a counterparty. The simulation methodology includes credit mitigants, such as counterparty netting agreements and collateral agreements with the counterparty.\n\nThe methodologies do not, in general, account for 'wrong-way risk'. Wrong-way risk is an adverse correlation between the counterparty's probability of default and the mark-to-market value of the underlying transaction. The risk can either be general, perhaps related to the currency of the issuer country, or specific to the transaction concerned. When there is significant wrong-way risk, a trade-specific approach is applied to reflect this risk in the valuation.\n\n## Funding fair value adjustment\n\nThe funding fair value adjustment ('FFVA') is calculated by applying future market funding spreads to the expected future funding exposure of any uncollateralised component of the OTC derivative portfolio. The expected future funding exposure is calculated by a simulation methodology, where available, and is adjusted for events that may terminate the exposure, such as the default of HSBC or the counterparty. The FFVA and DVA are calculated independently.\n\n## Model limitation\n\nModels used for portfolio valuation purposes may be based upon a simplified set of assumptions that do not capture all current and future material market characteristics. In these circumstances, model limitation adjustments are adopted.\n\n## Inception profit (Day 1 P&L reserves)\n\nInception profit adjustments are adopted when the fair value estimated by a valuation model is based on one or more significant unobservable inputs. The accounting for inception profit adjustments is discussed in Note 1.\n\n## Fair value valuation bases\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value using a valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs -

        "page_content": "Level 3 instruments are present in both ongoing and legacy businesses. Loans held for securitisation, derivatives with monolines, certain 'other derivatives' and predominantly all Level 3 asset-backed securities are legacy positions. HSBC has the capability to hold these positions.\n\n## Private equity including strategic investments\n\nThe fair value of a private equity investment (including strategic investments) is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investee's financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors; by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an active market; the price at which similar companies have changed ownership; or from published net asset values ('NAV') received. If necessary, adjustments are made to the NAV of funds to obtain the best estimate of fair value.\n\n## Asset-backed securities\n\nWhile quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of the asset-backed securities ('ABSs'), valuation models are used to substantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to quoted market prices are required. For certain ABSs, such as residential mortgage-backed securities, the valuation uses an industry standard model with assumptions relating to prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and performance, as appropriate. The valuations output is benchmarked for consistency against observable data for securities of a similar nature.\n\n## Structured notes\n\nThe fair value of Level 3 structured notes is derived from the fair value of the underlying debt security, and the fair value of the embedded derivative is determined as described in the paragraph below on derivatives. These structured notes comprise principally equity-linked notes issued by HSBC, which provide the counterparty with a return linked to the performance of equity securities and other portfolios.\n\nExamples of the unobservable parameters include long-dated equity volatilities and correlations between equity prices, and interest and foreign exchange rates.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nOTC derivative valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon 'no arbitrage' principles. For many vanilla derivative products, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry. For more complex derivative products, there may be some differences in market practice. Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data wherever possible, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing. Certain inputs may not be observable in the market directly, but can be determined from observable prices via model calibration procedures or estimated from historical data or other sources.\n\n## Reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\n\nMovement in Level 3 financial instruments\n\n|                                                                                                                    | Assets                 | Assets          | Assets                                                                                   | Assets           | Liabilities          | Liabilities               | Liabilities   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n|                                                                                                                    | Financial  investments | Trading  assets | Designated  and otherwise  mandatorily  measured at  fair value  through profit  or loss | Derivatives      | Trading  liabilities | Designated  at fair value | Derivatives   |\n|                                                                                                                    | $m                     | $m              | $m                                                                                       | $m               | $m                   | $m                        | $m            |\n| At 1 Jan 2021                                                                                                      | 3,654                  | 2,499           | 11,477                                                                                   | 2,670            | 162                  | 5,306                     | 4,188         |\n| Total gains/(losses) recognised in profit or loss                                                                  | (10)                   | (378)           | 1,753                                                                                    | 2,237            | 16                   | (836)                     | 2,583         |\n| -

The key unobservable inputs would be price and correlation. The valuation approach includes using a range of inputs that include company specific financials, traded comparable companies multiples, published net asset values and qualitative assumptions, which are not directly comparable or quantifiable.\n\n## Prepayment rates\n\nPrepayment rates are a measure of the anticipated future speed at which a loan portfolio will be repaid in advance of the due date. They vary according to the nature of the loan portfolio and expectations of future market conditions, and may be estimated using a variety of evidence, such as prepayment rates implied from proxy observable security prices, current or historical prepayment rates and macroeconomic modelling.\n\n## Market proxy\n\nMarket proxy pricing may be used for an instrument when specific market pricing is not available but there is evidence from instruments with common characteristics. In some cases it might be possible to identify a specific proxy, but more generally evidence across a wider range of instruments will be used to understand the factors that influence current market pricing and the manner of that influence.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure of the anticipated future variability of a market price. It varies by underlying reference market price, and by strike and maturity of the option. Certain volatilities, typically those of a longer-dated nature, are unobservable and are estimated from observable data. The range of unobservable volatilities reflects the wide variation in volatility inputs by reference market price. The core range is significantly narrower than the full range because these examples with extreme volatilities occur relatively rarely within the HSBC portfolio.\n\n## Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two market prices and is expressed as a number between minus one and one. It is used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market price. There is a wide range of instruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations and cross-asset correlations is used. In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset correlations.\n\nUnobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade prices, proxy correlations and examination of historical price relationships. The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table reflects the wide variation in correlation inputs by market price pair.",

        "page_content": "## Credit spread\n\nCredit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality. In a discounted cash flow model, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an asset. Credit spreads may be implied from market prices and may not be observable in more illiquid markets.\n\n## Inter-relationships between key unobservable inputs\n\nKey unobservable inputs to Level 3 financial instruments may not be independent of each other. As described above, market variables may be correlated. This correlation typically reflects the manner in which different markets tend to react to macroeconomic or other events. Furthermore, the effect of changing market variables on the HSBC portfolio will depend on HSBC's net risk position in respect of each variable.\n\n## HSBC Holdings\n\nBasis of valuing HSBC Holdings' financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\n|                                                                                       | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Valuation technique using observable inputs: Level 2                                  |           |           |\n| Assets at 31 Dec                                                                      |           |           |\n| -

Accordingly, their carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value. They include cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from and transmission to other banks, Hong Kong Government certificates of indebtedness and Hong Kong currency notes in circulation, all of which are measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Valuation\n\nFair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It does not reflect the economic benefits and costs that HSBC expects to flow from an instrument's cash flow over its expected future life. Our valuation methodologies and assumptions in determining fair values for which no observable market prices are available may differ from those of other companies.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks and customers\n\nTo determine the fair value of loans and advances to banks and customers, loans are segregated, as far as possible, into portfolios of similar characteristics. Fair values are based on observable market transactions, when available. When they are unavailable, fair values are estimated using valuation models incorporating a range of input assumptions. These assumptions may include: value estimates from third-party brokers reflecting over-the-counter trading activity; forward-looking discounted cash flow models, taking account of expected",

From time to time, we may engage a third-party valuation specialist to measure the fair value of a pool of loans.\n\nThe fair value of loans reflects expected credit losses at the balance sheet date and estimates of market participants' expectations of credit losses over the life of the loans, and the fair value effect of repricing between origination and the balance sheet date. For creditimpaired loans, fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows over the time period they are expected to be recovered.\n\n## Financial investments\n\nThe fair values of listed financial investments are determined using bid market prices. The fair values of unlisted financial investments are determined using valuation techniques that incorporate the prices and future earnings streams of equivalent quoted securities.\n\n## Deposits by banks and customer accounts\n\nThe fair values of on-demand deposits are approximated by their carrying value. For deposits with longer-term maturities, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flows, applying current rates offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.\n\n## Debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities\n\nFair values in debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities are determined using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date where available, or by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments.\n\n## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements - non-trading\n\nFair values of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements that are held on a non-trading basis provide approximate carrying amounts. This is due to the fact that balances are generally short dated.\n\n## HSBC Holdings\n\nThe methods used by HSBC Holdings to determine fair values of financial instruments for the purposes of measurement and disclosure are described above.\n\nFair values of HSBC Holdings' financial instruments not carried at fair value on the balance sheet\n\n|                                           | 2021               | 2021            | 2020               | 2020            |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n|                                           | Carrying amount $m | Fair value 1 $m | Carrying amount $m | Fair value 1 $m |\n| Assets at 31 Dec                          |                    |                 |                    |                 |\n| Loans and advances to HSBC undertakings   | 25,108             | 25,671          | 10,443             | 10,702          |\n| Financial investments - at amortised cost | 26,194             | 26,176          | 17,485             | 17,521          |\n| Liabilities at 31 Dec                     |                    |                 |                    |                 |\n| Amounts owed to HSBC undertakings         | 111                | 111             | 330                | 330             |\n| Debt securities in issue                  | 67,483             | 69,719          | 64,029             | 67,706          |\n| Subordinated liabilities                  | 17,059             | 21,066          | 17,916             | 22,431          |\n\n## 14 Financial assets designated and otherwise mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                                           | 2021                         | 2021                                    | 2021     | 2020                         | 2020                                    | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                           | Designated at  fair value $m | Mandatorily  measured at fair  value $m | Total $m | Designated at fair  value $m | Mandatorily  measured at fair  value $m | Total $m |\n| Securities                                | 2,251                        | 42,062                                  | 44,313   | 2,492                        | 39,088                                  | 41,580   |\n| -  treasury and other eligible bills      | 599                          | 31                                      | 630      | 635                          | 26                                      | 661      |\n| -  debt securities                        | 1,652                        | 5,177                                   | 6,829    | 1,857                        | 5,250                                   | 7,107    |\n| -  equity securities                      | -                            | 36,854                                  | 36,854   | -                            | 33,812                                  | 33,812   |\n| Loans and advances to banks and customers | -                            | 4,307                                   | 4,307    | -                            | 2,988                                   | 2,988    |\n| Other                                     | -                            | 1,184                                   | 1,184    | -                            | 985                                     | 985      |\n| At 31 Dec                                 | 2,251                        | 47,553                                  | 49,804   | 2,492                        | 43,061                                  | 45,553   |",

Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities include market-making and risk management. Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the purpose of generating revenue based on spread and volume. Risk management activity is undertaken to manage the risk arising from client transactions, with the principal purpose of retaining client margin. Other derivatives classified as held for trading include non-qualifying hedging derivatives.\n\nSubstantially all of HSBC Holdings' derivatives entered into with subsidiaries are managed in conjunction with financial liabilities designated at fair value.\n\n## Derivatives valued using models with unobservable inputs\n\nThe difference between the fair value at initial recognition (the transaction price) and the value that would have been derived had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is as shown in the following table:\n\nUnamortised balance of derivatives valued using models with significant unobservable inputs\n\n|                                                          | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Unamortised balance at 1 Jan                             | 104       | 73        |\n| Deferral on new transactions                             | 311       | 232       |\n| Recognised in the income statement during the year:      | (308)     | (205)     |\n| -  amortisation                                          | (177)     | (116)     |\n| -  subsequent to unobservable inputs becoming observable | (4)       | (4)       |\n| -  maturity, termination or offsetting derivative        | (127)     | (85)      |\n| Exchange differences                                     | (1)       | 4         |\n| Other                                                    | -         | -         |\n| Unamortised balance at 31 Dec 1                          | 106       | 104       |",

The assets in scope of this strategy are high-quality fixed-rate debt securities, which may be sold to meet liquidity and funding requirements.\n\nThe interest rate risk of the HSBC fixed-rate debt securities issued is managed in a non-dynamic risk management strategy.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nHSBC's cash flow hedging instruments consist principally of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps that are used to manage the variability in future interest cash flows of non-trading financial assets and liabilities, arising due to changes in market interest rates and foreign-currency basis.\n\nHSBC applies macro cash flow hedging for interest rate risk exposures on portfolios of replenishing current and forecasted issuances of non-trading assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates, including rolling such instruments. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected for each portfolio of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate cash flows representing both principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios are used to determine the effectiveness and ineffectiveness. Macro cash flow hedges are considered to be dynamic hedges.\n\nHSBC also hedges the variability in future cash flows on foreign-denominated financial assets and liabilities arising due to changes in foreign exchange market rates with cross-currency swaps, which are considered dynamic hedges.",

Hedging could be undertaken for Group structural exposure to changes in the US dollar to foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign exchange contracts or by financing with foreign currency borrowings. The aggregate positions at the reporting date and the performance indicators of both live and de-designated hedges are summarised below. There were no amounts reclassified to the profit and loss account during the accounting periods presented.\n\n## Hedges of net investment in foreign operations\n\n|                                                          | Carrying value        | Carrying value             |                    |                               |                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description of hedged risk                               | Derivative  assets $m | Derivative  liabilities $m | Nominal  amount $m | Amounts  recognised in OCI $m | Hedge ineffectiveness  recognised in income  statement $m |\n| 2021                                                     |                       |                            |                    |                               |                                                           |\n| Pound sterling-denominated structural foreign exchange   | 229                   | -                          | 15,717             | (126)                         | -                                                         |\n| Swiss franc-denominated structural foreign exchange      | -                     | (8)                        | 809                | 101                           | -                                                         |\n| Hong Kong dollar-denominated structural foreign exchange | 7                     | -                          | 4,992              | 5                             | -                                                         |\n| Other structural foreign exchange 1                      | 7                     | -                          | 4,387              | 6                             | -                                                         |\n| Total                                                    | 243                   | (8)                        | 25,905             | (14)                          | -                                                         |\n| 2020                                                     |                       |                            |                    |                               |                                                           |\n| Pound sterling-denominated structural foreign exchange   | -                     | 733                        | 10,500             | (167)                         | -                                                         |\n| Swiss franc-denominated structural foreign exchange      | -                     | -                          | -                  | 111                           | -                                                         |\n| Hong Kong dollar-denominated structural foreign exchange | -                     | -                          | -                  | -                             | -                                                         |\n| Other structural foreign exchange 1                      | -                     | -                          | -                  | -                             | -                                                         |\n| Total                                                    | -                     | 733                        | 10,500             | (56)                          | -                                                         |",

        "page_content": "## Interest rate benchmark reform: Amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 'Financial Instruments'\n\nHSBC has applied both the first set of amendments ('Phase 1') and the second set of amendments ('Phase 2') to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 applicable to hedge accounting. The hedge accounting relationships that are affected by Phase 1 and Phase 2 amendments are presented in the balance sheet as 'Financial assets designated and otherwise mandatorily measured at fair value through other comprehensive income', 'Loans and advances to customers', 'Debt securities in issue' and 'Deposits by banks'. The notional value of the derivatives impacted by the Ibor reform, including those designated in hedge accounting relationships, is disclosed on page 127 in the section 'Financial instruments impacted by the Ibor reform'. For further details on Ibor transition, see 'Top and emerging risks' on page 126.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group transitioned all of its hedging instruments referencing sterling Libor, European Overnight Index Average rate ('Eonia') and Japanese yen Libor. The Group also transitioned some of the hedging instruments referencing US dollar Libor. There is no significant judgement applied for these benchmarks to determine whether and when the transition uncertainty has been resolved.\n\nThe most significant Ibor benchmark in which the Group continues to have hedging instruments is US dollar Libor. It is expected that the transition out of US dollar Libor hedging derivatives will be largely completed by the end of 2022. These transitions do not necessitate new approaches compared with any of the mechanisms used so far for transition and it will not be necessary to change the transition risk management strategy.\n\nFor some of the Ibors included under the 'Other' header in the table below, judgement has been needed to establish whether a transition is required, since there are Ibor benchmarks that are subject to computation methodology improvements and insertion of fallback provisions without full clarity being provided by their administrators on whether these Ibor benchmarks will be demised.\n\nThe notional amounts of interest rate derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships do not represent the extent of the risk exposure managed by the Group but they are expected to be directly affected by market-wide Ibor reform and in scope of Phase 1 amendments and are shown in the table below. The cross-currency swaps designated in hedge accounting relationships and affected by Ibor reform are not significant and have not been presented below.\n\n## Hedging instrument impacted by Ibor reform\n\n|                   | Hedging instrument      | Hedging instrument      | Hedging instrument      | Hedging instrument      | Hedging instrument      | Hedging instrument   | Hedging instrument   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                   | Impacted by Ibor reform | Impacted by Ibor reform | Impacted by Ibor reform | Impacted by Ibor reform | Impacted by Ibor reform | Not impacted         | Notional             |\n|                   | \u20ac 2                     | \u00a3                       | $                       | Other 3                 | Total                   | by Ibor reform       | amount 1 $m          |\n|                   | $m                      | $m                      | $m                      | $m                      | $m                      | $m                   |                      |\n| Fair value hedges | 6,178                   | -

For example, in the case of securitisations and covered bonds, the amount of liabilities issued plus mandatory over-collateralisation is less than the book value of the pool of assets available for use as collateral. This is also the case where assets are placed with a custodian or a settlement agent that has a floating charge over all the assets placed to secure any liabilities under settlement accounts.\n\nThese transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary for collateralised transactions including, where relevant, standard securities lending and borrowing, repurchase agreements and derivative margining. HSBC places both cash and non-cash collateral in relation to derivative transactions.\n\nHong Kong currency notes in circulation are secured by the deposit of funds in respect of which the Hong Kong Government certificates of indebtedness are held.\n\nFinancial assets pledged as collateral which the counterparty has the right to sell or repledge\n\n|                       | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Trading assets        | 69,719    | 64,225    |\n| Financial investments | 12,416    | 16,915    |\n| At 31 Dec             | 82,135    | 81,140    |\n\n## Collateral received\n\nThe fair value of assets accepted as collateral relating primarily to standard securities lending, reverse repurchase agreements, swaps of securities and derivative margining that HSBC is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was $476,455m (2020: $447,101m). The fair value of any such collateral sold or repledged was $271,582m (2020: $246,520m).\n\nHSBC is obliged to return equivalent securities. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard securities lending, reverse repurchase agreements and derivative margining.\n\n## Assets transferred\n\nThe assets pledged include transfers to third parties that do not qualify for derecognition, notably secured borrowings such as debt securities held by counterparties as collateral under repurchase agreements and equity securities lent under securities lending agreements, as well as swaps of equity and debt securities. For secured borrowings, the transferred asset collateral continues to be recognised in full while a related liability, reflecting the Group's obligation to repurchase the assets for a fixed price at a future date, is also recognised on the balance sheet. Where securities are swapped, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full. There is no associated liability as the non-cash collateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet. The Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction, and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged assets. With the exception of 'Other sales' in the following table, the counterparty's recourse is not limited to the transferred assets.\n\nTransferred financial assets not qualifying for full derecognition and associated financial liabilities\n\n|                                                   | Carrying amount of:   | Carrying amount of:       | Fair value of:        | Fair value of:            |                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                   | Transferred assets $m | Associated liabilities $m | Transferred assets $m | Associated liabilities $m | Net position $m |\n| At 31 Dec 2021                                    |                       |                           |                       |                           |                 |\n| Repurchase agreements                             | 51,135                | 48,180                    |                       |                           |                 |\n| Securities lending agreements                     | 43,644                | 2,918                     |                       |                           |                 |\n| Other sales (recourse to transferred assets only) | 3,826                 | 3,826                     | 3,830                 | 3,842                     | (12)            |\n| At 31 Dec 2020                                    |                       |                           |                       |                           |                 |\n| Repurchase agreements                             | 52,413                | 51,092                    |                       |                           |                 |\n| Securities lending agreements                     | 38,364                | 124                       |                       |                           |                 |\n| Other sales (recourse to transferred assets only) | 3,564                 | 3,478                     | 3,619                 | 3,564                     | 55              |",

Significant influence in BoCom was established with consideration of all relevant factors, including representation on BoCom's Board of Directors and participation in a resource and experience sharing agreement ('RES'). Under the RES, HSBC staff have been seconded to assist in the maintenance of BoCom's financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of BoCom's net assets. An impairment test is required if there is any indication of impairment.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the fair value of the Group's investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately 10 years. As a result, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount, which confirmed that there was no impairment at 31 December 2021 as the recoverable amount as determined by a value-in-use ('VIU') calculation was higher than the carrying value.\n\n|       | At 31 Dec 2021   | At 31 Dec 2021   | At 31 Dec 2021   | At 31 Dec 2020   | At 31 Dec 2020   | At 31 Dec 2020   |\n|-------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|       | VIU              | Carrying value   | Fair value       | VIU              | Carrying value   | Fair value       |\n|       | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              | $bn              |\n| BoCom | 24.8             | 23.6             | 8.5              | 21.8             | 21.2             | 7.5              |\n\nCompared with 31 December 2020, the extent to which the VIU exceeds the carrying value ('headroom') increased by $0.6bn. The increase in headroom was principally due to the impact on the VIU from BoCom's actual performance, which was better than earlier estimates, revisions to management's best estimates of BoCom's future earnings in the short to medium term, and the net impact of revisions to certain long-term assumptions.\n\nIn future periods, the VIU may increase or decrease depending on the effect of changes to model inputs. The main model inputs are described below and are based on factors observed at period-end. The factors that could result in a change in the VIU and an impairment include a short-term underperformance by BoCom, a change in regulatory capital requirements or an increase in uncertainty regarding the future performance of BoCom resulting in a downgrade of the forecast of future asset growth or profitability. An increase in the discount rate could also result in a reduction of VIU and an impairment. At the point where the carrying value exceeds the VIU, impairment would be recognised.\n\nIf the Group did not have significant influence in BoCom, the investment would be carried at fair value rather than the current carrying value.\n\n## Basis of recoverable amount\n\nThe impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of BoCom, determined by a VIU calculation, with its carrying amount. The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management's best estimates of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders prepared in accordance with IAS 36. Significant management judgement is required in arriving at the best estimate. There are two main components to the VIU calculation. The first component is management's best estimate of BoCom's earnings, which is based on explicit forecasts over the short to medium term. This results in forecast earnings growth that is lower than recent historical actual growth and also reflects the uncertainty arising from the current economic outlook. Reflecting management's intent to continue to retain its investment, earnings beyond the short to medium term are then extrapolated into perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to derive a terminal value, which comprises the majority of the VIU. The second component is the capital maintenance charge ('CMC'), which is management's forecast of the earnings that need to be withheld in order for BoCom to meet capital requirements over the forecast period, meaning that CMC is deducted when arriving at management's estimate of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders. The principal inputs to the CMC calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets and the expected capital requirements. An increase in the CMC as a result of a change to these principal inputs would reduce VIU. Additionally, management considers other qualitative factors, to ensure that the inputs to the VIU calculation remain appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\n## Key assumptions in value-in-use calculation\n\nWe used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term profit growth rate: 3% (2020: 3%) for periods after 2025, which does not exceed forecast GDP growth in mainland China and is consistent with forecasts by external analysts.\n- \u00b7 Long-term asset growth rate: 3% (2020: 3%) for periods after 2025, which is the rate that assets are expected to grow to achieve longterm profit growth of 3%.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate: 10.03% (2020: 11.37%) based on a capital asset pricing model ('CAPM'), using market data. The discount rate used is within the range of 8.7% to 10.1% (2020 equivalent range: 10.9% to 11.9%) indicated by the CAPM. The lower rate reflects the impact of a relative reduction in the volatility of Chinese banks' equity prices and a decrease in mainland China's credit risk due to its relatively quick recovery from the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. While the CAPM range sits at the lower end of the range adopted by selected external analysts of 9.9% to 13.5% (2020: 10.3% to 15.0%), we continue to regard the CAPM range as the most appropriate basis for determining this assumption.\n- \u00b7 Expected credit losses as a percentage of customer advances ('ECL'): ranges from 0.98% to 1.12% (2020: 0.98% to 1.22%) in the short to medium term, reflecting reported credit experience through the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in mainland China followed by an expected reversion to recent historical levels. For periods after 2025, the ratio is 0.97% (2020: 0.88%), which is higher than BoCom's average ECL in recent years prior to the Covid-19 outbreak.\n- \u00b7 Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets: ranges from 61.0% to 62.4% (2020: 61.0% to 62.0%) in the short to medium term, reflecting reductions that may arise from a subsequent lowering of ECL and a continuation of the trend of strong retail loan growth. For periods after 2025, the ratio is 61.0% (2020: 61.0%). These rates are similar to BoCom's actual results in recent years and forecasts disclosed by external analysts.\n- \u00b7 Operating income growth rate: ranges from 5.1% to 6.2% (2020: 3.5% to 6.7%) in the short to medium term, and is lower than BoCom's actual results in recent years and the forecasts disclosed by external analysts, reflecting BoCom's most recent actual results, global trade tensions and industry developments in mainland China.\n- \u00b7 Cost-income ratio: ranges from 35.5% to 36.1% (2020: 36.3% to 36.8%) in the short to medium term. These ratios are similar to BoCom's actual results in recent years and forecasts disclosed by external analysts.\n- \u00b7 Effective tax rate ('ETR'): ranges from 6.8% to 15.0% (2020: 7.8% to 16.5%) in the short to medium term, reflecting BoCom's actual results and an expected increase towards the long-term assumption through the forecast period. For periods after 2025, the rate is 15.0% (2020: 16.8%), which is higher than the recent historical average, and aligned to the minimum tax rate as proposed by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.\n- \u00b7 Capital requirements: capital adequacy ratio ('CAR') of 12.5% (2020: 11.5%) and tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 9.5% (2020: 9.5%), based on BoCom's capital risk appetite and capital requirements respectively. The CAR assumption was updated to 12.5% from 11.5% following the approval of BoCom's capital management plan in March 2021.\n\nThe following table shows the change to each key assumption in the VIU calculation that on its own would reduce the headroom to nil:\n\n## Key assumption\n\n## Changes to key assumption to reduce headroom to nil\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term profit growth rate\n- \u00b7 Decrease by 28 basis points\n- \u00b7 Long-term asset growth rate\n- \u00b7 Increase by 23 basis points\n- \u00b7 Discount rate\n- \u00b7 Increase by 36 basis points\n- \u00b7 Expected credit losses as a percentage of customer advances\n- \u00b7 Increase by 4 basis points\n- \u00b7 Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets\n- \u00b7 Increase by 194 basis points\n- \u00b7 Operating income growth rate\n- \u00b7 Decrease by 39 basis points\n- \u00b7 Cost-income ratio\n- \u00b7 Increase by 109 basis points\n- \u00b7 Long-term effective tax rate\n- \u00b7 Increase by 322 basis points\n- \u00b7 Capital requirements - capital adequacy ratio\n- \u00b7 Increase by 40 basis points\n- \u00b7 Capital requirements - tier 1 capital adequacy ratio\n- \u00b7 Increase by 195 basis points\n\nThe following table further illustrates the impact on VIU of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions. This reflects the sensitivity of the VIU to each key assumption on its own and it is possible that more than one favourable and/or unfavourable change may occur at the same time. The selected rates of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions are largely based on external analysts' forecasts, which can change period to period.",

The range is based on impacts set out in the table above arising from the favourable/unfavourable change in the earnings in the short to medium term, the long-term expected credit losses as a percentage of customer advances, and a 50bps increase/decrease in the discount rate. The discount rate has been included this year, reflecting the relative materiality of movements in this assumption. All other long-term assumptions and the basis of the CMC have been kept unchanged when determining the reasonably possible range of the VIU.\n\n## Selected financial information of BoCom\n\nThe statutory accounting reference date of BoCom is 31 December.

The principal countries of operation are the same as the countries and territories of incorporation except for HSBC Life (International) Limited, which operates mainly in Hong Kong.\n\nHSBC is structured as a network of regional banks and locally incorporated regulated banking entities. Each bank is separately capitalised in accordance with applicable prudential requirements and maintains a capital buffer consistent with the Group's risk appetite for the relevant country or region. HSBC's capital management process is incorporated in the annual operating plan, which is approved by the Board.\n\nHSBC Holdings is the primary provider of equity capital to its subsidiaries and also provides them with non-equity capital where necessary. These investments are substantially funded by HSBC Holdings' issuance of equity and non-equity capital, and by profit retention. The net increase in investments in subsidiaries was partly due to the reversal of impairment of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited of $3.1bn. The cumulative impairment for HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited as at 31 December 2021 is $7.2bn. It is reasonably possible that outcomes in the future may be different from the assumptions made as at December 2021 that could require a material change to the carrying amount of HSBC Overseas Holdings (UK) Limited. The carrying value is $33.1bn as at 31 December 2021 (2020:$30.7bn).\n\nAs part of its capital management process, HSBC Holdings seeks to maintain a balance between the composition of its capital and its investment in subsidiaries. Subject to this, there is no current or foreseen impediment to HSBC Holdings' ability to provide funding for such investments. During 2021, consistent with the Group's capital plan, the Group's subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among",

It is currently funded entirely by commercial paper ('CP') issued to HSBC. At 31 December 2021, HSBC held $1.8bn of CP (2020: $2.1bn).\n\n## Multi-seller conduit\n\nHSBC's multi-seller conduit was established to provide access to flexible market-based sources of finance for its clients. Currently, HSBC bears risk equal to the transaction-specific facility offered to the multi-seller conduit, amounting to $6.7bn at 31 December 2021 (2020: $9.6bn). First loss protection is provided by the originator of the assets, and not by HSBC, through transaction-specific credit enhancements. A layer of secondary loss protection is provided by HSBC in the form of programme-wide enhancement facilities.\n\n## Securitisations\n\nHSBC uses structured entities to securitise customer loans and advances it originates in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The loans and advances are transferred by HSBC to the structured entities for cash or synthetically through credit default swaps, and the structured entities issue debt securities to investors.\n\n## HSBC managed funds\n\nHSBC has established a number of money market and non-money market funds. Where it is deemed to be acting as principal rather than agent in its role as investment manager, HSBC controls these funds.\n\n## Other\n\nHSBC has entered into a number of transactions in the normal course of business, which include asset and structured finance transactions where it has control of the structured entity. In addition, HSBC is deemed to control a number of third-party managed funds through its involvement as a principal in the funds.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe term 'unconsolidated structured entities' refers to all structured entities not controlled by HSBC. The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities.",

A review for indicators of impairment is undertaken at each subsequent quarter-end and at 31 December 2021.\n\nAs a result of the 1 October 2021 annual impairment test, we recognised $0.6bn of goodwill impairment related to the Latin America WPB CGU. Impairment resulted from a combination of factors, including our macroeconomic outlook and the impact of inflationary pressure on judgements made to estimate value in use ('VIU'). Significant inputs to the VIU calculation are discussed in more detail within 'Basis of the recoverable amount' below. Management considered the sensitivity of certain assumptions, in particular the discount rate, and the outcome of reasonably possible alternative scenarios. This resulted in full impairment of goodwill allocated to Latin America WPB.\n\nImpairment results and key assumptions in VIU calculations - impaired CGU at 1 October 2021\n\n|                     |   Carrying amount $bn |   of which  goodwill $bn |   Value in use $bn |   Impairment $bn |   Discount rate % |   Growth rate  beyond initial  cash flow  projections % |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Latin America - WPB |                   2.3 |                      0.6 |                1.7 |              0.6 |              14.5 |                                                     4.8 |\n\n## Basis of the recoverable amount\n\nThe recoverable amount of all CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated was equal to its value in use at each respective testing date.

        "page_content": "## Management's judgement in estimating the cash flows of a CGU\n\nThe cash flow projections for each CGU are based on forecast profitability plans approved by the Board and minimum capital levels required to support the business operations of a CGU. The Board challenges and endorses planning assumptions in light of internal capital allocation decisions necessary to support our strategy, current market conditions and macroeconomic outlook including climate risk. For the 1 October 2021 impairment test, cash flow projections until the end of 2026 were considered, in line with our internal planning horizon. As required by IFRSs, estimates of future cash flows exclude estimated cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives before an entity has a constructive obligation to carry out the plan, and would therefore have recognised a provision for restructuring costs.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe rate used to discount the cash flows is based on the cost of equity assigned to each CGU, which is derived using a capital asset pricing model ('CAPM') and market implied cost of equity. CAPM depends on a number of inputs reflecting financial and economic variables, including the risk-free rate and a premium to reflect the inherent risk of the business being evaluated. These variables are based on the market's assessment of the economic variables and management's judgement. The discount rates for each CGU are refined to reflect the rates of inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates. In addition, for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, management supplements this process by comparing the discount rates derived using the internally generated CAPM, with the cost of equity rates produced by external sources for businesses operating in similar markets.\n\n## Long-term growth rate\n\nThe long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective within the Group of business units making up the CGUs. These growth rates reflect inflation for the countries within which the CGU operates or from which it derives revenue.\n\n## Sensitivities of key assumptions in calculating VIU\n\nAt 1 October 2021, Europe - WPB was sensitive to reasonably possible adverse changes in key assumptions supporting the recoverable amount. In making an estimate of reasonably possible changes to assumptions, management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the VIU calculation, such as the external range of discount rates observable, historical performance against forecast and risks attaching to the key assumptions underlying cash flow projections. A reasonable change in a single key assumption may not result in impairment, although taken together a combination of reasonable changes in key assumptions could result in a recoverable amount that is lower than the CGU's carrying amount.\n\n|                      | Input                   | Key assumptions                                                                                          | Associated risks                                                                       | Reasonably possible change                                                                     |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash-generating unit |                         |                                                                                                          |                                                                                        |                                                                                                |\n| Europe - WPB         | Forecast  profitability | \u00b7 Level of interest rates and yield  curves. \u00b7 Competitors' position within the  market.                 | \u00b7 Uncertain regulatory  environment. \u00b7 Customer remediation  and regulatory actions.   | \u00b7 Forecast profitability projections  decrease by 30%.

Recoverable amounts are determined by calculating an estimated VIU or fair value, as appropriate, for each CGU. No significant impairment was recognised during the year.\n\nIn 2020, having considered the pervasive macroeconomic deterioration caused by the outbreak of Covid-19, along with the impact of forecast profitability in some businesses, we recognised $1.3bn of capitalised software impairment related principally to businesses within HSBC Bank plc, our non-ring-fenced bank in Europe, and to a lesser degree businesses within HSBC USA Inc. This impairment reflected underperformance and deterioration in the future forecasts of these businesses, substantially relating to prior periods in HSBC Bank plc.\n\n## Key assumptions in VIU calculation\n\nWe used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\n- \u00b7 Management's judgement in estimating future cash flows: We considered past business performance, current market conditions and our macroeconomic outlook to estimate future earnings. As required by IFRSs, estimates of future cash flows exclude estimated cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives before an entity has a constructive obligation to carry out",

        "page_content": "the plan, and would therefore have recognised a provision for restructuring costs. For some businesses, this means that the benefit of certain strategic actions may not be included in the impairment assessment, including capital releases.\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term growth rates: The long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows in perpetuity because of the long-term perspective of the businesses within the Group.\n- \u00b7 Discount rates: Rates are based on a combination of CAPM and market-implied calculations considering market data for the businesses and geographies in which the Group operates.\n\n## Future software capitalisation\n\nWe will continue to invest in digital capabilities to meet our strategic objectives. However, software capitalisation within businesses where impairment was identified will not resume until the performance outlook for each business indicates future profits are sufficient to support capitalisation. The cost of additional software investment in these businesses will be recognised as an operating expense until such time.\n\n## Sensitivity of estimates relating to non-financial assets\n\nAs explained in Note 1.2(a), estimates of future cash flows for CGUs are made in the review of goodwill and non-financial assets for impairment. Non-financial assets include other intangible assets shown above, and owned property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (see Note 22). The most significant sources of estimation uncertainty are in respect of the goodwill balances disclosed above. There are no non-financial asset balances relating to individual CGUs which involve estimation uncertainty that represents a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the results and financial position of the Group within the next financial year.\n\nNon-financial assets are widely distributed across CGUs within the legal entities of the Group, including Corporate Centre assets that cannot be allocated to CGUs and are therefore tested for impairment at consolidated level. The recoverable amounts of other intangible assets, owned property, plant and equipment, and right-of-use assets cannot be lower than individual asset fair values less costs to dispose, where relevant. At 31 December 2021 none of the CGUs were sensitive to reasonably possible adverse changes in key assumptions supporting the recoverable amount. In making an estimate of reasonably possible changes to assumptions, management considers the available evidence in respect of each input to the VIU calculation, such as the external range of discount rates observable, historical performance against forecast and risks attaching to the key assumptions underlying cash flow projections.\n\n## Present value of in-force long-term insurance business\n\nWhen calculating the present value of in-force long-term ('PVIF') insurance business, expected cash flows are projected after adjusting for a variety of assumptions made by each insurance operation to reflect local market conditions, and management's judgement of future trends and uncertainty in the underlying assumptions is reflected by applying margins (as opposed to a cost of capital methodology) including valuing the cost of policyholder options and guarantees using stochastic techniques.\n\nActuarial Control Committees of each key insurance entity meet on a quarterly basis to review and approve PVIF assumptions. All changes to non-economic assumptions, economic assumptions that are not observable and model methodologies must be approved by the Actuarial Control Committee.\n\n## Movements in PVIF\n\n|                                                            | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 Jan                                                   | 9,435     | 8,945     |\n| Change in PVIF of long-term insurance business             | 130       | 382       |\n| -  value of new business written during the year           | 1,090     | 776       |\n| -  expected return 1                                       | (903)     | (1,003)   |\n| -  assumption changes and experience variances (see below) | (105)     | 604       |\n| -  other adjustments                                       | 48        | 5         |\n| Exchange differences and other movements                   | (112)     | 108       |\n| At 31 Dec                                                  | 9,453     | 9,435     |\n\n## Assumption changes and experience variances\n\nIncluded within this line item are:\n\n- \u00b7 $59m (2020: $132m), directly offsetting interest rate-driven changes to the valuation of liabilities under insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 $(324)m (2020: $247m), reflecting the future expected sharing of returns with policyholders on contracts with discretionary participation features ('DPF'), to the extent this sharing is not already included in liabilities under insurance contracts; and\n- \u00b7 $160m (2020: $225m), driven by other assumptions changes and experience variances.\n\n## Key assumptions used in the computation of PVIF for main life insurance operations\n\nEconomic assumptions are set in a way that is consistent with observable market values.

Legal proceedings include civil court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings brought against HSBC companies (whether by way of claim or counterclaim) or civil disputes that may, if not settled, result in court, arbitration or tribunal proceedings. Regulatory matters refer to investigations, reviews and other actions carried out by, or in response to the actions of, regulators or law enforcement agencies in connection with alleged wrongdoing by HSBC.\n\nCustomer remediation refers to HSBC's activities to compensate customers for losses or damages associated with a failure to comply with regulations or to treat customers fairly. Customer remediation is often initiated by HSBC in response to customer complaints and/or industry developments in sales practices and is not necessarily initiated by regulatory action. Further details of customer remediation are set out in this note.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, $173m (2020: $328m) of the customer remediation provision related to the estimated liability for redress in respect of the possible mis-selling of payment protection insurance ('PPI') policies in previous years. Of the $328m balance at 31 December 2020, $192m was utilised during 2021 and the provision was increased by $37m.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, a provision of $87m (2020: $302m) was held relating to the estimated liability for redress payable to customers following a review of historical collections and recoveries practices in the UK. During 2021, redress payments and incurred operating costs totalled $197m, in addition to the net release of $18m of provision. This release reflect the actual number of customers impacted and cost of redress paid, which were lower than has been previously estimated.\n\nFor further details of the impact of IFRS 9 on undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantees, presented in 'Contractual commitments', see Note 32. This provision results from the adoption of IFRS 9 and has no comparatives. Further analysis of the movement in the expected credit loss provision is disclosed within the 'Reconciliation of allowances for loans and advances to banks and customers including loan commitments and financial guarantees' table on page 153.\n\n## 28 Subordinated liabilities\n\n## HSBC's subordinated liabilities\n\n|                                    | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At amortised cost                  | 20,487    | 21,951    |\n| -  subordinated liabilities        | 18,640    | 20,095    |\n| -  preferred securities            | 1,847     | 1,856     |\n| Designated at fair value (Note 24) | 10,100    | 10,844    |\n| -  subordinated liabilities        | 10,100    | 10,844    |\n| -  preferred securities            | -         | -         |\n| At 31 Dec                          | 30,587    | 32,795    |\n| Issued by HSBC subsidiaries        | 9,112     | 10,223    |\n| Issued by HSBC Holdings            | 21,475    | 22,572    |\n\nSubordinated liabilities rank behind senior obligations and generally count towards the capital base of HSBC. Capital securities may be called and redeemed by HSBC subject to prior notification to the PRA and, where relevant, the consent of the local banking regulator. If not redeemed at the first call date, coupons payable may reset or become floating rate based on relevant market rates. On subordinated liabilities other than floating rate notes, interest is payable at fixed rates of up to 10.176%.\n\nThe balance sheet amounts disclosed in the following table are presented on an IFRS basis and do not reflect the amount that the instruments contribute to regulatory capital, principally due to regulatory amortisation and regulatory eligibility limits.",

The proceeds of these were lent to the respective guarantors by the limited partnerships in the form of subordinated notes. They qualified as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC under CRR II until 31 December 2021 by virtue of the application of grandfathering provisions. The capital security guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc also qualified as additional tier 1 capital for HSBC Bank plc (on a solo and a consolidated basis) under CRR II until 31 December 2021 by virtue of the same grandfathering process. Since 31 December 2021, these securities have no longer qualified as regulatory capital for HSBC or HSBC Bank plc.\n\nThese preferred securities, together with the guarantee, are intended to provide investors with rights to income and capital distributions and distributions upon liquidation of the relevant issuer that are equivalent to the rights that they would have had if they had purchased non-cumulative perpetual preference shares of the relevant issuer. There are limitations on the payment of distributions if such payments are prohibited under UK banking regulations or other requirements, if a payment would cause a breach of HSBC's capital adequacy requirements, or if HSBC Holdings or HSBC Bank plc has insufficient distributable reserves (as defined).\n\nHSBC Holdings and HSBC Bank plc have individually covenanted that, if prevented under certain circumstances from paying distributions on the preferred securities in full, they will not pay dividends or other distributions in respect of their ordinary shares, or repurchase or redeem their ordinary shares, until the distribution on the preferred securities has been paid in full.\n\nIf the consolidated total capital ratio of HSBC Holdings falls below the regulatory minimum required or if the Directors expect it to do so in the near term, provided that proceedings have not been commenced for the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of HSBC Holdings, the holders' interests in the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Holdings will be exchanged for interests in preference shares issued by HSBC Holdings that have economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to the preferred securities and their guarantee.\n\nIf the preferred securities guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc are outstanding in November 2048, or if the total capital ratio of HSBC Bank plc (on a solo or consolidated basis) falls below the regulatory minimum required, or if the Directors expect it to do so in the near term, provided that proceedings have not been commenced for the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of HSBC Bank plc, the holders' interests in the preferred security guaranteed by HSBC Bank plc will be exchanged for interests in preference shares issued by HSBC Bank plc that have economic terms which are in all material respects equivalent to the preferred security and its guarantee.\n\n## Tier 2 securities\n\nTier 2 capital securities are either perpetual or dated subordinated securities on which there is an obligation to pay coupons. These capital securities are included within HSBC's regulatory capital base as tier 2 capital under CRR II, either as fully eligible capital or by virtue of the application of grandfathering provisions. In accordance with CRR II, the capital contribution of all tier 2 securities is amortised for regulatory purposes in their final five years before maturity.",

These balances are included in the maturity analysis as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Trading assets and liabilities (including trading derivatives but excluding reverse repos, repos and debt securities in issue) are included in the 'Due not more than 1 month' time bucket, because trading balances are typically held for short periods of time.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity (such as equity securities) are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified based on the contractual notice period, which the counterparty of the instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket.\n- \u00b7 Non-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket.\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments included within assets and liabilities of disposal groups held for sale are classified on the basis of the contractual maturity of the underlying instruments and not on the basis of the disposal transaction.\n- \u00b7 Liabilities under insurance contracts are irrespective of contractual maturity included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket in the maturity table provided below. An analysis of the expected maturity of liabilities under insurance contracts based on undiscounted cash flows is provided on page 215. Liabilities under investment contracts are classified in accordance with their contractual maturity. Undated investment contracts are included in the 'Due over 5 years' time bucket, although such contracts are subject to surrender and transfer options by the policyholders.\n- \u00b7 Loan and other credit-related commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.",

For this reason, balances in the following table do not agree directly with those in our consolidated balance sheet. Undiscounted cash flows payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities are classified according to their contractual maturities. Trading liabilities and derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the 'Due not more than 1 month' time bucket and not by contractual maturity.\n\nIn addition, loans and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees are generally not recognised on our balance sheet. The undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under loan and other credit-related commitments and financial guarantees are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be called.",

HSBC Holdings also raises funds in the debt capital markets to meet the Group's minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. HSBC Holdings uses this liquidity to meet its obligations, including interest and principal repayments on external debt liabilities, operating expenses and collateral on derivative transactions.\n\nHSBC Holdings is also subject to contingent liquidity risk by virtue of credit-related commitments and guarantees and similar contracts issued relating to its subsidiaries. Such commitments and guarantees are only issued after due consideration of HSBC Holdings' ability to finance the commitments and guarantees and the likelihood of the need arising.\n\nHSBC Holdings actively manages the cash flows from its subsidiaries to optimise the amount of cash held at the holding company level. During 2021, consistent with the Group's capital plan, the Group's subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or payments. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things, their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating performance.\n\nHSBC Holdings currently has sufficient liquidity to meet its present requirements.\n\nLiquidity risk in HSBC Holdings is overseen by Holdings ALCO. This risk arises because of HSBC Holdings' obligation to make payments to debt holders as they fall due and to pay its operating expenses. The liquidity risk related to these cash flows is managed by matching external debt obligations with internal loan cash flows and by maintaining an appropriate liquidity buffer that is monitored by Holdings ALCO.\n\nThe balances in the following table are not directly comparable with those on the balance sheet of HSBC Holdings as the table incorporates, on an undiscounted basis, all cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments (except for derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives). Undiscounted cash flows payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities are classified according to their contractual maturities. Derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the 'On demand' time bucket.\n\nIn addition, loan commitments and financial guarantees and similar contracts are generally not recognised on our balance sheet. The undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under financial guarantees and similar contracts are classified on the basis of the earliest date on which they can be called.",

This security was called by HSBC Holdings on 10 December 2020 and was redeemed and cancelled on 13 January 2021. Between the date of exercise of the call option and the redemption, this security was considered as an other liability.\n\n## HSBC Holdings 6.20% non-cumulative US dollar preference shares, Series A of $0.01\n\nThe 6.20% non-cumulative US dollar preference shares, Series A of $0.01 each were redeemed on 13 January 2021.\n\n## HSBC Holdings non-cumulative preference share of \u00a30.01\n\nThe one non-cumulative sterling preference share of \u00a30.01 ('sterling preference share') has been in issue since 29 December 2010 and is held by a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings. Dividends are paid quarterly at the sole and absolute discretion of the Board. The sterling preference share carries no rights of conversion into ordinary shares of HSBC Holdings and no right to attend or vote at shareholder meetings of HSBC Holdings. These securities can be redeemed by HSBC Holdings at any time, subject to prior approval by the PRA.\n\n## Other equity instruments\n\nHSBC Holdings has included three types of additional tier 1 capital securities in its tier 1 capital. Two are presented in this Note and they are the HSBC Holdings US dollar non-cumulative preference shares outlined above (which were redeemed in January 2021) and the contingent convertible securities described below. These are accounted for as equity because HSBC does not have an obligation to transfer cash or a variable number of its own ordinary shares to holders under any circumstances outside its control. See Note 28 for additional tier 1 securities accounted for as liabilities.\n\n## Additional tier 1 capital - contingent convertible securities\n\nHSBC Holdings continues to issue contingent convertible securities that are included in its capital base as fully CRR II-compliant additional tier 1 capital securities on an end point basis. These securities are marketed principally and subsequently allotted to corporate investors and fund managers. The net proceeds of the issuances are typically used for HSBC Holdings' general corporate purposes and to further strengthen its capital base to meet requirements under CRR II. These securities bear a fixed rate of interest until their initial call dates. After the initial call dates, if they are not redeemed, the securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on credit spreads, fixed at issuance, above prevailing market rates. Interest on the contingent convertible securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of HSBC Holdings, and HSBC Holdings has sole and absolute discretion at all times to cancel for any reason (in whole or part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any payment date. Distributions will not be paid if they are prohibited under UK banking regulations or if the Group has insufficient reserves or fails to meet the solvency conditions defined in the securities' terms.\n\nThe contingent convertible securities are undated and are repayable at the option of HSBC Holdings in whole typically at the initial call date or on any fifth anniversary after this date. In addition, the securities are repayable at the option of HSBC in whole for certain regulatory or tax reasons. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA. These securities rank pari passu with HSBC Holdings' sterling preference shares and therefore rank ahead of ordinary shares. The contingent convertible securities will be converted into fully paid ordinary shares of HSBC Holdings at a predetermined price, should HSBC's consolidated non-transitional CET1 ratio fall below 7.0%. Therefore, in accordance with the terms of the securities, if the non-transitional CET1 ratio breaches the 7.0% trigger, the securities will convert into ordinary shares at fixed contractual conversion prices in the issuance currencies of the relevant securities, subject to antidilution adjustments.",

As a significant portion of guarantees and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not indicative of future liquidity requirements.

        "page_content": "## Notes on the financial statements\n\nThe majority of the guarantees have a term of less than one year, while guarantees with terms of more than one year are subject to HSBC's annual credit review process.\n\nContingent liabilities arising from legal proceedings, regulatory and other matters against Group companies are excluded from this note but are disclosed in Notes 27 and 34.\n\n## Financial Services Compensation Scheme\n\nT he Financial Services Compensation Scheme ('FSCS') provides compensation, up to certain limits, to eligible customers of financial services firms that are unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against them. The FSCS may impose a further levy on HSBC UK to the extent the industry levies imposed to date are not sufficient to cover the compensation due to customers in any future possible collapse. The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of a collapse cannot be estimated reliably. It is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recovery of assets by the FSCS, changes in the level of protected products (including deposits and investments) and the population of FSCS members at the time.\n\n## Associates\n\nHSBC's share of associates' contingent liabilities, contractual commitments and guarantees amounted to $63.5bn at 31 December 2021 (2020: $53.1bn). No matters arose where HSBC was severally liable.\n\n## 33 Finance lease receivables\n\nHSBC leases a variety of assets to third parties under finance leases, including transport assets (such as aircraft), property and general plant and machinery. At the end of lease terms, assets may be sold to third parties or leased for further terms. Rentals are calculated to recover the cost of assets less their residual value, and earn finance income.\n\n|                                                  | 2021                             | 2021                       | 2021             | 2020                             | 2020                       | 2020             |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|\n|                                                  | Total future minimum payments $m | Unearned finance income $m | Present value $m | Total future minimum payments $m | Unearned finance income $m | Present value $m |\n| Lease receivables:                               |                                  |                            |                  |                                  |                            |                  |\n| No later than one year                           | 3,298                            | (303)                      | 2,995            | 3,108                            | (257)                      | 2,851            |\n| One to two years                                 | 2,303                            | (242)                      | 2,061            | 2,476                            | (196)                      | 2,280            |\n| Two to three years                               | 1,645                            | (192)                      | 1,453            | 2,055                            | (143)                      | 1,912            |\n| Three to four years                              | 1,225                            | (146)                      | 1,079            | 1,380                            | (109)                      | 1,271            |\n| Four to five years                               | 795                              | (113)                      | 682              | 787                              | (80)                       | 707              |\n| Later than one year and no later than five years | 5,968                            | (693)                      | 5,275            | 6,698                            | (528)                      | 6,170            |\n| Later than five years                            | 4,044                            | (528)                      | 3,516            | 4,221                            | (451)                      | 3,770            |\n| At 31 Dec                                        | 13,310                           | (1,524)                    | 11,786           | 14,027                           | (1,236)                    | 12,791           |\n\n## 34 Legal proceedings and regulatory matters\n\nHSBC is party to legal proceedings and regulatory matters in a number of jurisdictions arising out of its normal business operations. Apart from the matters described below, HSBC considers that none of these matters are material. The recognition of provisions is determined in accordance with the accounting policies set out in Note 1 . While the outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are inherently uncertain, management believes that, based on the information available to it, appropriate provisions have been made in respect of these matters as at 31 December 2021 (see Note 27). Where an individual provision is material, the fact that a provision has been made is stated and quantified, except to the extent that doing so would be seriously prejudicial. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters as a class of contingent liabilities.\n\n## Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC\n\nVarious non-US HSBC companies provided custodial, administration and similar services to a number of funds incorporated outside the US whose assets were invested with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC ('Madoff Securities'). Based on information provided by Madoff Securities as at 30 November 2008, the purported aggregate value of these funds was $8.4bn, including fictitious profits reported by Madoff. Based on information available to HSBC, the funds' actual transfers to Madoff Securities minus their actual withdrawals from Madoff Securities during the time HSBC serviced the funds are estimated to have totalled approximately $4bn. Various HSBC companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of Madoff Securities' fraud.\n\nUS litigation: The Madoff Securities Trustee has brought lawsuits against various HSBC companies and others in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'US Bankruptcy Court'), seeking recovery of transfers from Madoff Securities to HSBC in an amount not yet pleaded or determined. Following an initial dismissal of certain claims, which was later reversed on appeal, the cases were remanded to the US Bankruptcy Court, where they are now pending.\n\nFairfield Sentry Limited, Fairfield Sigma Limited and Fairfield Lambda Limited (together, 'Fairfield') (in liquidation since July 2009) have brought a lawsuit in the US against fund shareholders, including HSBC companies that acted as nominees for clients, seeking restitution of redemption payments. In December 2018, the US Bankruptcy Court dismissed certain claims by the Fairfield liquidators and granted a motion by the liquidators to file amended complaints. In May 2019, the liquidators appealed certain issues from the US Bankruptcy Court to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (the 'New York District Court'), and these appeals remain pending.\n\nIn January 2020, the Fairfield liquidators filed amended complaints on the claims remaining in the US Bankruptcy Court. In December 2020, the US Bankruptcy Court dismissed the majority of those claims. In March 2021, the liquidators and defendants appealed the US Bankruptcy Court's decision to the New York District Court, and these appeals are currently pending. Meanwhile, proceedings before the US Bankruptcy Court with respect to the remaining claims that were not dismissed are ongoing.\n\nUK litigation: The Madoff Securities Trustee has filed a claim against various HSBC companies in the High Court of England and Wales, seeking recovery of transfers from Madoff Securities to HSBC in an amount not yet pleaded or determined. The deadline for service of the claim has been extended to September 2022 for UK-based defendants and November 2022 for all other defendants.",

        "page_content": "Cayman Islands litigation: In February 2013, Primeo Fund ('Primeo') (in liquidation since April 2009) brought an action against HSBC Securities Services Luxembourg ('HSSL') and Bank of Bermuda (Cayman) Limited (now known as HSBC Cayman Limited), alleging breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty and claiming damages and equitable compensation. The trial concluded in February 2017 and, in August 2017, the court dismissed all claims against the defendants. In September 2017, Primeo appealed to the Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands and, in June 2019, the Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands dismissed Primeo's appeal. In August 2019, Primeo filed a notice of appeal to the UK Privy Council. Two hearings before the UK Privy Council took place during 2021. Judgment was given against HSBC in respect of the first hearing and judgment is pending in respect of the second hearing.\n\nLuxembourg litigation: In April 2009, Herald Fund SPC ('Herald') (in liquidation since July 2013) brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking restitution of cash and securities that Herald purportedly lost because of Madoff Securities' fraud, or money damages. The Luxembourg District Court dismissed Herald's securities restitution claim, but reserved Herald's cash restitution and money damages claims. Herald has appealed this judgment to the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, where the matter is pending. In late 2018, Herald brought additional claims against HSSL and HSBC Bank plc before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking further restitution and damages.\n\nIn October 2009, Alpha Prime Fund Limited ('Alpha Prime') brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking the restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. In December 2018, Alpha Prime brought additional claims before the Luxembourg District Court seeking damages against various HSBC companies. These matters are currently pending before the Luxembourg District Court.\n\nIn December 2014, Senator Fund SPC ('Senator') brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. In April 2015, Senator commenced a separate action against the Luxembourg branch of HSBC Bank plc asserting identical claims before the Luxembourg District Court. In December 2018, Senator brought additional claims against HSSL and HSBC Bank plc Luxembourg branch before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking restitution of Senator's securities or money damages. These matters are currently pending before the Luxembourg District Court.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes, and any resulting financial impact, of the various Madoff-related proceedings described above, including but not limited to the multiple jurisdictions in which the proceedings have been brought. Based upon the information currently available, management's estimate of the possible aggregate damages that might arise as a result of all claims in the various Madoff-related proceedings is around $600m, excluding costs and interest. Due to uncertainties and limitations of this estimate, any possible damages that might ultimately arise could differ significantly from this amount.\n\n## Anti-money laundering and sanctions-related matters\n\nIn December 2012, HSBC Holdings entered into a number of agreements, including an undertaking with the UK Financial Services Authority (replaced with a Direction issued by the UK Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA') in 2013 and again in 2020) as well as a ceaseand-desist order with the US Federal Reserve Board ('FRB'), both of which contained certain forward-looking anti-money laundering ('AML') and sanctions-related obligations. Over the past several years, HSBC has retained a Skilled Person under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act and an Independent Consultant under the FRB cease-and-desist order to produce periodic assessments of the Group's AML and sanctions compliance programme. The Skilled Person completed its engagement in the second quarter of 2021, and the FCA has determined that no further Skilled Person work is required. Separately, the Independent Consultant continues to work pursuant to the FRB cease-and-desist order. The roles of each of the FCA Skilled Person and the FRB Independent Consultant are discussed on page 209.\n\nIn December 2021, the FCA concluded its investigation into HSBC's compliance with UK money laundering regulations and financial crime systems and control requirements. The FCA imposed a fine on HSBC Bank plc, which has been paid.\n\nSince November 2014, a number of lawsuits have been filed in federal courts in the US against various HSBC companies and others on behalf of plaintiffs who are, or are related to, victims of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. In each case, it is alleged that the defendants aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of various sanctioned parties in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act. Currently, nine actions remain pending in federal courts in New York or the District of Columbia. The courts have granted HSBC's motions to dismiss in five of these cases; appeals remain pending in two cases, and the remaining three dismissals are also subject to appeal. The four remaining actions are at an early stage.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.\n\n## London interbank offered rates, European interbank offered rates and other benchmark interest rate investigations and litigation\n\nEuro interest rate derivatives: In December 2016, the European Commission ('EC') issued a decision finding that HSBC, among other banks, engaged in anti-competitive practices in connection with the pricing of euro interest rate derivatives in early 2007. The EC imposed a fine on HSBC based on a one-month infringement. In September 2019, the General Court of the European Union (the 'General Court') issued a decision largely upholding the EC's findings on liability but annulling the fine. HSBC and the EC both appealed the General Court's decision to the European Court of Justice (the 'Court of Justice'). In June 2021, the EC adopted a new fining decision for an amount that was 5% less than the previously annulled fine, and it subsequently withdrew its appeal to the Court of Justice. HSBC has appealed the EC's June 2021 fining decision to the General Court, and its appeal to the Court of Justice on liability also remains pending.\n\nUS dollar Libor: Beginning in 2011, HSBC and other panel banks have been named as defendants in a number of private lawsuits filed in the US with respect to the setting of US dollar Libor. The complaints assert claims under various US laws, including US antitrust and racketeering laws, the US Commodity Exchange Act ('US CEA') and state law. The lawsuits include individual and putative class actions, most of which have been transferred and/or consolidated for pre-trial purposes before the New York District Court. HSBC has reached class settlements with five groups of plaintiffs, and the court has approved these settlements. HSBC has also resolved several of the individual actions, although a number of other US dollar Libor-related actions remain pending against HSBC in the New York District Court.\n\nIntercontinental Exchange ('ICE') Libor: Between January and March 2019, HSBC and other panel banks were named as defendants in three putative class actions filed in the New York District Court on behalf of persons and entities who purchased instruments paying interest indexed to US dollar ICE Libor from a panel bank. The complaints allege, among other things, misconduct related to the suppression of this benchmark rate in violation of US antitrust and state law. In July 2019, the three putative class actions were consolidated, and the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. In March 2020, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in its entirety and, in February 2022, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the plaintiffs' appeal.",

        "page_content": "Singapore interbank offered rate ('Sibor'), Singapore swap offer rate ('SOR') and Australia bank bill swap rate ('BBSW'): In July and August 2016, HSBC and other panel banks were named as defendants in two putative class actions filed in the New York District Court on behalf of persons who transacted in products related to the Sibor, SOR and BBSW benchmark rates. The complaints allege, among other things, misconduct related to these benchmark rates in violation of US antitrust, commodities and racketeering laws, and state law.\n\nIn the Sibor/SOR litigation, in October 2021, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited reached a settlement in principle with the plaintiffs to resolve this action. The settlement remains subject to court approval.\n\nIn the BBSW litigation, in November 2018, the court dismissed all foreign defendants, including all HSBC entities, on personal jurisdiction grounds. In April 2019, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which the defendants moved to dismiss. In February 2020, the court again dismissed the plaintiffs' amended complaint against all HSBC entities.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters, which could be significant.\n\n## Foreign exchange-related investigations and litigation\n\nIn December 2021, the EC issued a settlement decision finding that a number of banks, including HSBC, had engaged in anti-competitive practices in an online chatroom between 2011 and 2012 in the foreign exchange spot market. The EC imposed a \u20ac174.3m fine on HSBC in connection with this matter, which is fully provisioned.\n\nIn January 2018, following the conclusion of the US Department of Justice's ('DoJ') investigation into HSBC's historical foreign exchange activities, HSBC Holdings entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Division of the DoJ (the 'FX DPA'), regarding fraudulent conduct in connection with two particular transactions in 2010 and 2011. In January 2021, the FX DPA expired and, in August 2021, the charges deferred by the FX DPA were dismissed.\n\nIn December 2016, Brazil's Administrative Council of Economic Defense initiated an investigation into the onshore foreign exchange market and identified a number of banks, including HSBC, as subjects of its investigation.\n\nIn June 2020, the Competition Commission of South Africa, having initially referred a complaint for proceedings before the South African Competition Tribunal in February 2017, filed a revised complaint against 28 financial institutions, including HSBC Bank plc and HSBC Bank USA, for alleged anti-competitive behaviour in the South African foreign exchange market. In December 2021, a hearing on HSBC Bank plc's and HSBC Bank USA's applications to dismiss the revised complaint took place before the South African Competition Tribunal, where a decision remains pending.\n\nBeginning in 2013, various HSBC companies and other banks have been named as defendants in a number of putative class actions filed in, or transferred to, the New York District Court arising from allegations that the defendants conspired to manipulate foreign exchange rates. HSBC has reached class settlements with two groups of plaintiffs, including direct and indirect purchasers of foreign exchange products, and the court has granted final approval of these settlements. A putative class action by a group of retail customers of foreign exchange products remains pending.\n\nIn November and December 2018, complaints alleging foreign exchange-related misconduct were filed in the New York District Court and the High Court of England and Wales against HSBC and other defendants by certain plaintiffs that opted out of the direct purchaser class action settlement in the US. These matters remain pending. Additionally, lawsuits alleging foreign exchange-related misconduct remain pending against HSBC and other banks in courts in Brazil and Israel. It is possible that additional civil actions will be initiated against HSBC in relation to its historical foreign exchange activities.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters, which could be significant.\n\n## Precious metals fix-related litigation\n\nGold: Beginning in March 2014, numerous putative class actions were filed in the New York District Court and the US District Courts for the District of New Jersey and the Northern District of California, naming HSBC and other members of The London Gold Market Fixing Limited as defendants. The complaints, which were consolidated in the New York District Court, allege that, from January 2004 to June 2013, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of gold and gold derivatives for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and New York state law. In October 2020, HSBC reached a settlement in principle with the plaintiffs to resolve the consolidated action. The settlement remains subject to court approval.\n\nBeginning in December 2015, numerous putative class actions under Canadian law were filed in the Ontario and Quebec Superior Courts of Justice against various HSBC companies and other financial institutions. The plaintiffs allege that, among other things, from January 2004 to March 2014, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of gold and gold derivatives in violation of the Canadian Competition Act and common law. These actions are ongoing.\n\nSilver: Beginning in July 2014, numerous putative class actions were filed in federal district courts in New York, naming HSBC and other members of The London Silver Market Fixing Limited as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2007 to December 2013, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver and silver derivatives for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and New York state law. The actions were consolidated in the New York District Court and remain pending, following the conclusion of pre-class certification discovery.\n\nIn April 2016, two putative class actions under Canadian law were filed in the Ontario and Quebec Superior Courts of Justice against various HSBC companies and other financial institutions. The plaintiffs in both actions allege that, from January 1999 to August 2014, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver and silver derivatives in violation of the Canadian Competition Act and common law. These actions are ongoing.\n\nPlatinum and palladium: Between late 2014 and early 2015, numerous putative class actions were filed in the New York District Court, naming HSBC and other members of The London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Limited as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2008 to November 2014, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of platinum group metals ('PGM') and PGMbased financial products for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws and the US CEA. In March 2020, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' third amended complaint but granted the plaintiffs leave to re-plead certain claims. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant.",

        "page_content": "## Film finance litigation\n\nIn July and November 2015, two actions were brought by individuals against HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited ('PBGB') in the High Court of England and Wales seeking damages on various alleged grounds, including breach of duty to the claimants, in connection with their participation in certain Ingenious film finance schemes. In December 2018 and June 2019, two further actions were brought against PBGB in the High Court of England and Wales by multiple claimants in connection with lending provided by PBGB to third parties in respect of certain Ingenious film finance schemes in which the claimants participated. In January 2022, HSBC UK Bank plc (as successor to PBGB) reached a settlement in principle with the claimant group to resolve these actions. The settlement remains subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation.\n\nIn June 2020, two separate claims were issued against HSBC UK Bank plc (as successor to PBGB) in the High Court of England and Wales by two separate groups of investors in Eclipse film finance schemes in connection with PBGB's role in the development of such schemes. These actions are ongoing.\n\nIn April 2021, HSBC UK Bank plc (as successor to PBGB) was served with a claim issued in the High Court of England and Wales in connection with PBGB's role in the development of the Zeus film finance schemes. This action is at an early stage.\n\nIt is possible that additional actions or investigations will be initiated against HSBC UK Bank plc as a result of PBGB's historical involvement in the provision of certain film finance-related services.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters, which could be significant.\n\n## Other regulatory investigations, reviews and litigation\n\nHSBC Holdings and/or certain of its affiliates are subject to a number of other investigations and reviews by various regulators and competition and law enforcement authorities, as well as litigation, in connection with various matters relating to the firm's businesses and operations, including:\n\n- \u00b7 investigations by tax administration, regulatory and law enforcement authorities in Argentina, India and elsewhere in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money laundering and unlawful cross-border banking solicitation;\n- \u00b7 an investigation by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission regarding interest rate swap transactions related to bond issuances, among other things, as well as the use of non-HSBC approved messaging platforms for business communications;\n- \u00b7 an investigation by the PRA in connection with depositor protection arrangements in the UK;\n- \u00b7 an investigation by the FCA in connection with collections and recoveries operations in the UK;\n- \u00b7 an investigation by the UK Competition and Markets Authority concerning the financial services sector;\n- \u00b7 a putative class action brought in the New York District Court relating to the Mexican government bond market;\n- \u00b7 two group actions pending in the US courts and a claim issued in the High Court of England and Wales in connection with HSBC Bank plc's role as a correspondent bank to Stanford International Bank Ltd from 2003 to 2009; and\n- \u00b7 litigation brought against various HSBC companies in the US courts relating to residential mortgage-backed securities, based primarily on (a) claims brought against HSBC Bank USA in connection with its role as trustee on behalf of various securitisation trusts; and (b) claims against several HSBC companies seeking that the defendants repurchase various mortgage loans.\n\nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters, which could be significant.\n\n## 35 Related party transactions\n\nRelated parties of the Group and HSBC Holdings include subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, post-employment benefit plans for HSBC employees, Key Management Personnel ('KMP') as defined by IAS 24, close family members of KMP and entities that are controlled or jointly controlled by KMP or their close family members. KMP are defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of HSBC Holdings. These individuals also constitute 'senior management' for the purposes of the Hong Kong Listing Rules. In applying IAS 24, it was determined that for this financial reporting period all KMP included Directors, former Directors and senior management listed on pages 220 to 226 except for the roles of Group Chief Legal Officer, Group Head of Internal Audit, Group Chief Human Resources Officer, Group Chief Sustainability Officer, Group Head of Strategy, Group Chief Communications Officer and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance Officer who do not meet the criteria for KMP as provided for in the standard.\n\nParticulars of transactions with related parties are tabulated below. The disclosure of the year-end balance and the highest amounts outstanding during the year is considered to be the most meaningful information to represent the amount of the transactions and outstanding balances during the year.",

At 31 December 2021, HSBC's post-employment benefit plans had placed deposits of $476m (2020: $452m) with its banking subsidiaries, earning interest payable to the schemes of nil (2020: nil). The above outstanding balances arose from the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and security, as for comparable transactions with third-party counterparties.\n\nThe combined HSBC Bank (UK) Pension Scheme enters into swap transactions with HSBC to manage inflation and interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities and selected assets. At 31 December 2021, the gross notional value of the swaps was $7.4bn (2020: $7.7bn). These swaps had a positive fair value to the scheme of $1.0bn (2020: $1.0bn); and HSBC had delivered collateral of $1.0bn (2020: $1.0bn) to the scheme in respect of these arrangements. All swaps were executed at prevailing market rates and within standard market bid/offer spreads.",

HSBC Holdings incurs a charge for these employees equal to the contributions paid into the scheme on their behalf. Disclosure in relation to the scheme is made in Note 5.\n\n## 36 Business disposals\n\nIn 2021, we accelerated the pace of execution on our strategic ambition to be the preferred international financial partner for our clients with the announcements of the planned sale of our retail banking businesses in France, as well as the exit of domestic mass market retail banking in the US.\n\n## Planned sale of the retail banking business in France\n\nOn 25 November 2021, HSBC Continental Europe signed a framework agreement with Promontoria MMB SAS ('My Money Group') and its subsidiary Banque des Cara\u00efbes SA, regarding the planned sale of HSBC Continental Europe's retail banking business in France. This followed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on 18 June 2021 and the conclusion of the information and consultation processes of the parties with their respective works councils.\n\nIn parallel, several other agreements have been entered into aiming to ensure continuity of service for HSBC Continental Europe's retail banking customers who hold asset management products with HSBC Global Asset Management (France) and HSBC REIM (France), and protection and/or life-wrapped insurance products with HSBC Assurances Vie (France).\n\nThe sale, which is subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other relevant conditions, includes: HSBC Continental Europe's French retail banking business; the Cr\u00e9dit Commercial de France ('CCF') brand; and HSBC Continental Europe's 100% ownership interest in HSBC SFH (France) and its 3% ownership interest in Cr\u00e9dit Logement. The sale would generate an estimated loss before tax including related transaction costs for the Group of $2.3bn, together with an additional $0.7bn impairment of goodwill.\n\nThe signing of the framework agreement for the planned sale of the French retail banking business resulted in a tax deduction (tax value of $0.4bn) for a provision for loss on disposal, which was recorded in the French tax return. A deferred tax liability of the same amount arises as a consequence of the temporary difference between the French tax return and IFRS in respect of this provision. There was no tax impact in respect of goodwill impairment recognised in the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. The vast majority of the estimated loss for the write-down of the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell will be recognised when it is classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5, which is currently anticipated to be in 2022. Subsequently, the disposal group classified as held for sale will be remeasured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell at each reporting period. Any remaining gain or loss not previously recognised will be recognised at the date of derecognition, which is currently anticipated to be in 2023.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the value of the total assets of the business to be sold was $27.4bn, including $24.9bn of loans and advances to customers, and the value of customer accounts was $22.6bn.\n\n## US retail banking business\n\nOn 26 May 2021, we announced that we will exit our US mass market retail banking business, including our Personal and Advance propositions, as well as retail business banking, and will rebrand approximately 20 to 25 of our retail branches into international wealth centres to serve our Premier and Jade customers. In conjunction with the execution of this strategy, HSBC Bank USA, N.A. entered into definitive sale agreements with Citizens Bank and Cathay Bank to sell approximately 90 of our retail branches along with substantially all residential mortgage, unsecured and retail business banking loans and all deposits in our branch network not associated with our Premier, Jade and Private Banking customers. Certain assets under management associated with our mass market retail banking business were also transferred. The sale agreement with Cathay Bank completed on 4 February 2022 and the sale agreement with Citizens Bank completed on 18 February 2022. The remaining branches not sold or rebranded will be closed.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, loans and advances to customers of $2.4bn and customer accounts of $8.8bn related to these transactions met the criteria to be classified as held for sale.",

In all other cases, the assessment of control is more complex and requires judgement of other factors, including having exposure to variability of returns, power to direct relevant activities, and whether power is held as an agent or principal. HSBC's consolidation policy is described in Note 1.2(a).\n- 1 Management has determined that these undertakings are excluded from consolidation in the Group accounts as these entities do not meet the definition of subsidiaries in accordance with IFRS.

The Group will continue to review whether to revert to paying quarterly dividends in future years, and a further update will be given at or ahead of the 2022 results announcement in February 2023.\n\nFor the financial year 2021, we are at the lower end of our target dividend payout ratio range of between 40% and 55% of reported earnings per ordinary share ('EPS'), driven by ECL releases and higher restructure costs. The dividend policy has the flexibility to adjust EPS for non-cash significant items such as goodwill or intangibles impairments and may be supplemented from time to time by buybacks or special dividends, should the Group find itself in an excess capital position absent compelling investment opportunities to deploy that excess.\n\nDividends are declared in US dollars and, at the election of the shareholder, paid in cash in one of, or in a combination of, US dollars, pounds sterling and Hong Kong dollars.\n\n## Other equity instruments\n\n## Additional tier 1 capital - contingent convertible securities\n\nHSBC continues to issue contingent convertible securities that are included in its capital base as fully CRR II-compliant additional tier 1 capital securities. For further details on these securities, please refer to Note 31 on the financial statements.\n\nHSBC issued $1,000m 4.000% and $1,000m 4.700% Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities on 9 March 2021.\n\n## 2021 Annual General Meeting\n\nWith the exception of the shareholder requisitioned Resolution 16, which the Board recommended that shareholders vote against, all resolutions considered at the 2021 Annual General Meeting held at 11:00am on 28 May 2021 at Queen Elizabeth Hall, Southbank Centre, Belvedere Road, London SE1 8XX, UK were passed on a poll.",

The summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of shares. In particular, the summary deals with shareholders who are resident solely in the UK for UK tax purposes and only with holders who hold the shares as investments and who are the beneficial owners of the shares, and does not address the tax treatment of certain classes of holders such as dealers in securities. Holders and prospective purchasers should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in shares in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any national, state or local laws.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\nCurrently, no tax is withheld from dividends paid by HSBC Holdings.\n\n## UK resident individuals\n\nUK resident individuals are generally entitled to a tax-free annual allowance in respect of dividends received. The amount of the allowance for the tax year beginning 6 April 2021 is \u00a32,000. To the extent that dividend income received by an individual in the relevant tax year does not exceed the allowance, a nil tax rate will apply. Dividend income in excess of this allowance will be taxed at 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers. From 6 April 2022, these rates will each be increased by 1.25% to 8.75%, 33.75% and 39.35% respectively.\n\n## UK resident companies\n\nShareholders that are within the charge to UK corporation tax should generally be entitled to an exemption from UK corporation tax on any dividends received from HSBC Holdings. However, the exemptions are not comprehensive and are subject to anti-avoidance rules.\n\nIf the conditions for exemption are not met or cease to be satisfied, or a shareholder within the charge to UK corporation tax elects for an otherwise exempt dividend to be taxable, the shareholder will be subject to UK corporation tax on dividends received from HSBC Holdings at the rate of corporation tax applicable to that shareholder.\n\n## Scrip dividends\n\nThere were no scrip dividends issued during the year. As announced on 23 February 2021, the Group has decided to discontinue the scrip dividend option.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\nThe computation of the capital gains tax liability arising on disposals of shares in HSBC Holdings by shareholders subject to UK tax on capital gains can be complex, partly depending on whether, for example, the shares were purchased since April 1991, acquired in 1991 in exchange for shares in The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, or acquired subsequent to 1991 in exchange for shares in other companies.\n\nFor capital gains tax purposes, the acquisition cost for ordinary shares is adjusted to take account of subsequent rights and capitalisation issues. Any capital gain arising on a disposal of shares in HSBC Holdings by a UK company may also be adjusted to take account of indexation allowance if the shares were acquired before 1 January 2018, although the level of indexation allowance that is given in calculating the gain would be frozen at the value that would be applied to a disposal of those shares in December 2017. If in doubt, shareholders are recommended to consult their professional advisers.\n\n## Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nTransfers of shares by a written instrument of transfer generally will be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid for the transfer (rounded up to the next \u00a35), and such stamp duty is generally payable by the transferee. An agreement to transfer shares, or any interest therein, normally will give rise to a charge to stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration. However, provided an instrument of transfer of the shares is executed pursuant to the agreement and duly stamped before the date on which the stamp duty reserve tax becomes payable, under the current published practice of HMRC it will not be necessary to pay the stamp duty reserve tax, nor to apply for such tax to be cancelled. Stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable by the transferee.\n\nPaperless transfers of shares within CREST, the UK's paperless share transfer system, are liable to stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration. In CREST transactions, the tax is calculated and payment made automatically. Deposits of shares into CREST generally will not be subject to stamp duty reserve tax, unless the transfer into CREST is itself for consideration. Following the case HSBC pursued before the European Court of Justice (Case C-569/07 HSBC Holdings plc and Vidacos Nominees Ltd v The Commissioners for HM Revenue and Customs) and a subsequent case in relation to depositary receipts, HMRC accepted that the charge to stamp duty reserve tax at 1.5% on the issue of shares (and transfers integral to capital raising) to a depositary receipt issuer or a clearance service was incompatible with European Union law, and would not be imposed.\n\nFollowing the UK's departure from the European Union and the expiry of the transition period, the 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax charge on issues of shares to overseas clearance services and depositary receipt issuers is still disapplied, but no assurance can be given that legislation will not be amended in the future to reintroduce the charge.\n\n## Taxation - US residents\n\nThe following is a summary, under current law, of the principal UK tax and US federal income tax considerations that are likely to be material to the ownership and disposition of shares or American Depositary Shares ('ADSs') by a holder that is a US holder, as defined below, and who is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes.\n\nThe summary does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of shares or ADSs. In particular, the summary deals only with US holders that hold shares or ADSs as capital assets, and does not address the tax treatment of holders that are subject to special tax rules. These include banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, persons that hold shares or ADSs as part of an integrated investment (including a 'straddle' or 'hedge') comprised of a share or ADS and one or more other positions, and persons that own directly or indirectly 10% or more (by vote or value) of the stock of HSBC Holdings. This discussion is based on laws, treaties, judicial decisions and regulatory interpretations in effect on the date hereof, all of which are subject to change.\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, a 'US holder' is a beneficial holder that is a citizen or resident of the United States, a US domestic corporation or otherwise is subject to US federal income taxes on a net income basis in respect thereof.\n\nHolders and prospective purchasers should consult their own advisers regarding the tax consequences of an investment in shares or ADSs in light of their particular circumstances, including the effect of any national, state or local laws.\n\nAny US federal tax advice included in the Annual Report and Accounts 2021 is for informational purposes only. It was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding US federal tax penalties.",

        "page_content": "## Taxation of dividends\n\nCurrently, no tax is withheld from dividends paid by HSBC Holdings. For US tax purposes, a US holder must include cash dividends paid on the shares or ADSs in ordinary income on the date that such holder or the ADS depositary receives them, translating dividends paid in UK pounds sterling into US dollars using the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. A US holder that elects to receive shares in lieu of a cash dividend must include in ordinary income the fair market value of such shares on the dividend payment date, and the tax basis of those shares will equal such fair market value.\n\nSubject to certain exceptions for positions that are held for less than 61 days, and subject to a foreign corporation being considered a 'qualified foreign corporation' (which includes not being classified for US federal income tax purposes as a passive foreign investment company), certain dividends ('qualified dividends') received by an individual US holder generally will be subject to US taxation at preferential rates. Based on the company's audited financial statements and relevant market and shareholder data, HSBC Holdings was not and does not anticipate being classified as a passive foreign investment company. Accordingly, dividends paid on the shares or ADSs generally should be treated as qualified dividends.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\nGains realised by a US holder on the sale or other disposition of shares or ADSs normally will not be subject to UK taxation unless at the time of the sale or other disposition the holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or permanent establishment and the shares or ADSs are or have been used, held or acquired for the purposes of such trade, profession, vocation, branch or agency or permanent establishment. Such gains will be included in income for US tax purposes, and will be long-term capital gains if the shares or ADSs were held for more than one year. A long-term capital gain realised by an individual US holder generally will be subject to US tax at preferential rates.\n\n## Inheritance tax\n\nShares or ADSs held by an individual whose domicile is determined to be the US for the purposes of the United States United Kingdom Double Taxation Convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the 'Estate Tax Treaty') and who is not for such purposes a national of the UK will not, provided any US federal estate or gift tax chargeable has been paid, be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual's death or on a lifetime transfer of shares or ADSs except in certain cases where the shares or ADSs (i) are comprised in a settlement (unless, at the time of the settlement, the settlor was domiciled in the US and was not a national of the UK), (ii) are part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment of an enterprise, or (iii) pertain to a UK fixed base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal services. In such cases, the Estate Tax Treaty generally provides a credit against US federal tax liability for the amount of any tax paid in the UK in a case where the shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to US federal estate or gift tax.\n\n## Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax - ADSs\n\nIf shares are transferred to a clearance service or American Depositary Receipt ('ADR') issuer (which will include a transfer of shares to the depositary) under the current published HMRC practice, UK stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax will be payable. The stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is generally payable on the consideration for the transfer and is payable at the aggregate rate of 1.5%.\n\nThe amount of stamp duty reserve tax payable on such a transfer will be reduced by any stamp duty paid in connection with the same transfer.\n\nNo stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS, provided that the ADR and any separate instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remain at all times outside the UK, and provided further that any such\n\ntransfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the UK. No stamp duty reserve tax will be payable on a transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS effected by the transfer of an ADR.\n\n## US information reporting and backup withholding tax\n\nDistributions made on shares or ADSs and proceeds from the sale of shares or ADSs that are paid within the US, or through certain financial intermediaries to US holders, are subject to US information reporting and may be subject to a US 'backup' withholding tax. General exceptions to this rule happen when the US holder: establishes that it is a corporation (other than an S corporation) or other exempt holder; or provides a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Holders that are not US taxpayers generally are not subject to US information reporting or backup withholding tax, but may be required to comply with applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not US taxpayers in order to avoid the application of such US information reporting requirements or backup withholding tax to payments received within the US or through certain financial intermediaries.\n\n## Approach to ESG reporting\n\nThe information set out in the ESG review on pages 42 to 88, taken together with other information relating to ESG issues included in this Annual Report and Accounts 2021 , aims to provide key ESG information and data relevant to our operations for the year ended 31 December 2021. The data is compiled for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2021 unless otherwise specified. Measurement techniques and calculations are explained next to data tables where necessary. There are no significant changes from the previous reporting period in terms of scope, boundary or measurement of our reporting of ESG matters. Where relevant, rationale is provided for any restatement of information or data that has been previously published. We have also considered our obligations under the Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide contained in Appendix 27 to The Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited ('ESG Guide') and under LR9.8.6R(8) of the Financial Conduct Authority's ('FCA') Listing Rules. We will continue to develop and refine our reporting and disclosures on ESG matters in line with feedback received from our investors and other stakeholders, and in view of our obligations under the ESG Guide and the FCA's Listing Rules.\n\n## ESG Guide\n\nWe comply with the 'comply or explain' provisions in the ESG Guide, save for certain items, which we describe in more detail below:\n\n- \u00b7 A1(b) on relevant laws/regulations relating to air and greenhouse gas emissions, discharges into water and land, and generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not believe that there are relevant laws and regulations in these areas that have significant impacts on HSBC.\n- \u00b7 A1.3 on total hazardous waste produced, A1.4 on total nonhazardous waste produced: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider hazardous waste to be a material issue for our stakeholders. As such, we report only on total waste produced, which includes hazardous and nonhazardous waste.\n- \u00b7 A1.6 on handling hazardous and non-hazardous waste: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider this to be a material issue for our stakeholders. Notwithstanding this, we continue to focus on the reduction and recycling of all waste. Building on the success of our previous operational environmental strategy, we are identifying key opportunities where we can lessen our wider environmental impact, including waste management. For further details, please see our ESG review on page 51.\n- \u00b7 A2.4 on sourcing water issue: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider this to be a material issue for",

Notwithstanding this, we have implemented measures to further reduce water consumption through the installation of flow restrictors, auto-taps and low or zero flush sanitary fittings and continue to track our water consumption.\n\n- \u00b7 A2.5 on packaging material, B2.2 on lost days due to work injury, B6(b) on issues related to health and safety and labelling relating to products and services provided, B6.1 on percentage of total products sold or shipped subject to recalls for safety and health reasons and B6.4 in recall procedures: Taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider these to be material issues for our stakeholders.\n\nThis is aligned with the materiality reporting principle that is set out in the ESG Guide. See 'How we decide what to measure' on page 44 for further information on how we determine what matters are material to our stakeholders.\n\n## TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures\n\nAs noted on page 19, we have considered our 'comply or explain' obligation under the FCA's Listing Rules, and confirm that we have made disclosures consistent with the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures in this Annual Report and Accounts 2021 save for certain items, which we describe below:\n\n## Targets setting\n\nMetrics and targets (c) relating to short-term targets: Given that climate scenarios are mainly focused on medium- to long-term horizons, rather than short term, we have set interim 2030 targets for on-balance sheet financed emissions for the oil and gas, and power and utilities sectors. HSBC intends to review the financed emissions baseline and targets annually, where relevant, to help ensure that they are aligned with market practice and current climate science.\n\n## Impacts on financial planning and performance\n\nStrategy (b) relating to financial planning and performance: We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of climate-related issues on financial planning, how these serve as an input to the financial planning process, the impact of climate-related issues on our financial performance (for example, revenues and costs) and financial position (for example, assets and liabilities), in each case due to transitional challenges including data and system limitations.\n\nMetrics and targets (a) relating to internal carbon prices and climate-related opportunities metrics: We do not currently fully disclose the proportion of revenue or proportion of assets, or other business activities aligned with climate-related opportunities, including revenue from products and services, forward-looking metrics consistent with our business or strategic planning time horizons, or internal carbon prices, in each case due to transitional challenges including data and system limitations.\n\nWe expect the data and system limitations related to financial planning and performance, internal carbon prices and climaterelated opportunities metrics to be addressed in the medium term as more reliable data becomes available and technology solutions are implemented.\n\n## Impacts of transition and physical risk\n\nStrategy (c) relating to quantitative scenario analysis: We do not currently fully disclose the impacts of transition and physical risk quantitatively, due to transitional challenges including data limitations and evolving science and methodologies.\n\nMetrics and targets (a) relating to detailed climate-related risk exposure metrics for retail and wholesale: We do not fully disclose metrics used to assess the impact of climate-related risks on retail lending, parts of wholesale lending and other financial intermediary business activities (specifically credit exposure, equity and debt holdings, or trading positions, each broken down by industry, geography, credit quality, average tenor). This is due to transitional challenges including data limitations.\n\nMetrics and targets (c) on targets related to physical risk: We do not currently disclose targets used to measure and manage\n\nphysical risk. This is due to transitional challenges including data limitations.\n\nWe expect the data limitations related to quantitative scenario analysis, specific risk metrics and physical risk targets to be addressed in the medium term as more reliable data becomes available and technology solutions are implemented.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions disclosure\n\nMetrics and targets (b) relating to scope 3 emissions metrics: We currently disclose partial scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions including business travel and financed emissions. In relation to financed emissions, we are disclosing scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for the oil and gas, and the power and utilities sectors. Future disclosure on scope 3 financed emissions (customers) and supply chain emissions (suppliers), and related risks is reliant on both our customers and suppliers publicly disclosing their carbon emissions and related risks. We aim to disclose financed emissions for additional sectors by 2023.\n\nOur approach to disclosure of financed emissions for additional sectors can be found on: www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-andresponsible-business/esg-reporting-centre.\n\n## Other matters\n\nStrategy (b) relating to acquisitions/divestments and access to capital: We have considered the impact of climate-related issues on our businesses, strategy, and financial planning, but not specifically in relation to acquisitions/divestments or access to capital. Due to transitional challenges such as process limitations, we do not disclose the climate-related impact in these areas. We will aim to further enhance our processes in relation to acquisitions/divestments and access to capital in the medium term.\n\nMetrics and targets (c) relating to water usage target: We have described the targets used by the organisation to manage climaterelated risks and opportunities and performance against targets. However, taking into account the nature of our business, we do not consider water usage to be a material target for our business and, therefore, we have not included a target in this year's disclosure.\n\nWith respect to our obligations under LR9.8.6R(8) of the FCA's Listing Rules, as part of considering what to measure and publicly report, we perform an assessment to ascertain the appropriate level of detail to be included in the climate-related financial disclosures that are set out in our Annual Report and Accounts . Our assessment takes into account factors such as the level of our exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, the scope and objectives of our climate-related strategy, transitional challenges, and the nature, size and complexity of our business. See 'How we decide what to measure' on page 44 for further information.\n\n## Cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements\n\nThe Annual Report and Accounts 2021 contains certain forwardlooking statements with respect to HSBC's financial condition; results of operations and business, including the strategic priorities; financial, investment and capital targets; and ESG targets, commitments and ambitions described herein.\n\nStatements that are not historical facts, including statements about HSBC's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Words such as 'may', 'will', 'should', 'expects', 'targets', 'anticipates', 'intends', 'plans', 'believes', 'seeks', 'estimates', 'potential' and 'reasonably possible', or the negative thereof, other variations thereon or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current plans, information, data, estimates and projections, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on them. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. HSBC makes no commitment to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring or existing after the date of any forward-looking statements. Written and/or oral forward-looking statements may also be made in the periodic reports to the US Securities and",

Readers are cautioned that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ, in some instances materially, from those anticipated or implied in any forward-looking statement. These include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, such as new recessions and fluctuations in employment and creditworthy customers beyond those factored into consensus forecasts (including, without limitation, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic); the Covid-19 pandemic, which may continue to have adverse impacts on our income due to lower lending and transaction volumes, lower wealth and insurance manufacturing revenue, and volatile interest rates in markets where we operate, as well as, more generally, the potential for material adverse impacts on our financial condition, results of operations, prospects, liquidity, capital position and credit ratings; deviations from the market and economic assumptions that form the basis for our ECL measurements (including, without limitation, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic); potential changes in HSBC's dividend policy; changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, including the accounting impact resulting from financial reporting in respect of hyperinflationary economies; volatility in equity markets; lack of liquidity in wholesale funding or capital markets, which may affect our ability to meet our obligations under financing facilities or to fund new loans, investments and businesses; geopolitical tensions or diplomatic developments producing social instability or legal uncertainty, such as diplomatic tensions, including between China and the US, the UK, the EU, India and other countries, and developments in Hong Kong and Taiwan, alongside other potential areas of tension, which may affect the Group by creating regulatory, reputational and market risks; the efficacy of government, customer, and HSBC's actions in managing and mitigating ESG risks, in particular climate risk, nature-related risks and human rights risks, each of which can impact HSBC both directly and indirectly through our customers and which may result in potential financial and non-financial impacts; illiquidity and downward price pressure in national real estate markets; adverse changes in central banks' policies with respect to the provision of liquidity support to financial markets; heightened market concerns over sovereign creditworthiness in overindebted countries; adverse changes in the funding status of public or private defined benefit pensions; societal shifts in customer financing and investment needs, including consumer perception as to the continuing availability of credit; exposure to counterparty risk, including third parties using us as a conduit for illegal activities without our knowledge; the discontinuation of certain key Ibors and the development of near risk-free benchmark rates, as well as the transition of legacy Ibor contracts to near risk free benchmark rates, which exposes HSBC to material execution risks, and increases some financial and non-financial risks; and price competition in the market segments we serve;\n- \u00b7 changes in government policy and regulation, including the monetary, interest rate and other policies of central banks and other regulatory authorities in the principal markets in which we operate and the consequences thereof (including, without limitation, actions taken as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic); initiatives to change the size, scope of activities and interconnectedness of financial institutions in connection with the implementation of stricter regulation of financial institutions in key markets worldwide; revised capital and liquidity benchmarks, which could serve to deleverage bank balance sheets and lower returns available from the current business model and portfolio mix; changes to tax laws and tax rates applicable to HSBC, including the imposition of levies or taxes designed to change business mix and risk appetite; the practices, pricing or responsibilities of financial institutions\n\nserving their consumer markets; expropriation, nationalisation, confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to foreign ownership; the UK's relationship with the EU following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which may continue to be characterised by uncertainty, particularly with respect to the regulation of financial services,  despite the signing of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and the EU; passage of the Hong Kong national security law and restrictions on telecommunications, as well as the US Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which have caused tensions between China, the US and the UK; general changes in government policy that may significantly influence investor decisions; the costs, effects and outcomes of regulatory reviews, actions or litigation, including any additional compliance requirements; and the effects of competition in the markets where we operate including increased competition from non-bank financial services companies; and\n\n- \u00b7 factors specific to HSBC, including our success in adequately identifying the risks we face, such as the incidence of loan losses or delinquency, and managing those risks (through account management, hedging and other techniques); our ability to achieve our financial, investment, capital and ESG targets, commitments and ambitions (including with respect to the commitments set forth in our thermal coal phase-out policy and our targets to reduce our on-balance sheet financed emissions in the oil and gas and power and utilities sectors), which may result in our failure to achieve any of the expected benefits of our strategic priorities; model limitations or failure, including, without limitation, the impact that the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic have had on the performance and usage of financial models, which may require us to hold additional capital, incur losses and/or use compensating controls, such as judgemental post model adjustments, to address model limitations; changes to the judgements, estimates and assumptions we base our financial statements on; changes in our ability to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests; a reduction in the credit ratings assigned to us or any of our subsidiaries, which could increase the cost or decrease the availability of our funding and affect our liquidity position and net interest margin; changes to the reliability and security of our data management, data privacy, information and technology infrastructure, including threats from cyber-attacks, which may impact our ability to service clients and may result in financial loss, business disruption and/ or loss of customer services and data; changes in insurance customer behaviour and insurance claim rates; our dependence on loan payments and dividends from subsidiaries to meet our obligations; changes in accounting standards, including the implementation of IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', which may have a material impact on the way we prepare our financial statements and (with respect to IFRS 17) may negatively affect the profitability of HSBC's insurance business; changes in our ability to manage third-party, fraud and reputational risks inherent in our operations; employee misconduct, which may result in regulatory sanctions and/or reputational or financial harm; changes in skill requirements, ways of working and talent shortages, which may affect our ability to recruit and retain senior management and diverse and skilled personnel; and changes in our ability to develop sustainable finance and climate-related products consistent with the evolving expectations of our regulators, and our capacity to measure the climate impact from our financing activity (including as a result of data limitations and changes in methodologies), which may affect our ability to achieve our climate ambition, our targets to reduce financed emissions in our oil and gas and power and utilities portfolio and the commitments set forth in our thermal coal phase-out policy, and increase the risk of greenwashing. Effective risk management depends on, among other things, our ability through stress testing and other techniques to prepare for events that cannot be captured by the statistical models it uses; our success in addressing operational, legal and regulatory, and litigation challenges; and other risks and uncertainties we identify in 'Top and emerging risks' on pages 124 to 131.",
