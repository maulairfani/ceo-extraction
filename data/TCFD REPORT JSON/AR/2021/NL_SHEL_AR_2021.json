        "page_content": "## ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nThe Shell plc Annual Report (this Report) serves as the Annual Report and Accounts in accordance with UK requirements for the year ended December 31, 2021, for Shell plc (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Shell). This Report presents the Consolidated Financial Statements of Shell (page 228), the Parent Company Financial Statements of Shell (pages 306-313) and the Financial Statements of/uni00A0the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (pages 317-319). Except for/uni00A0these Financial Statements, the numbers presented throughout this Report may not sum precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not/uni00A0precisely reflect the absolute figures due to rounding.\n\nThe Financial Statements contained in this Report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS/uni00A0as defined above includes interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. Financial reporting terms used in this Report/uni00A0are in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThis Report contains certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such/uni00A0as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of the company, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in/uni00A0respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which/uni00A0is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe companies in which Shell plc directly or indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In addition to the term 'Shell', in this Report 'Shell Group', 'we', 'us' and 'our' are also used to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. 'Subsidiaries' and 'Shell subsidiaries' refer to those entities over which the Company has control, either directly or indirectly. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as 'joint ventures' and 'joint operations', respectively. 'Joint ventures' and 'joint operations' are collectively referred to as 'joint arrangements'. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as 'associates'. The term 'Shell interest' is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Shell subsidiaries' data include their interests in joint operations./uni00A0\n\nAs used in this Report, 'Accountable' is intended to mean: required or/uni00A0expected to justify actions or decisions. The Accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. 'Responsible' is/uni00A0intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or/uni00A0decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is/uni00A0responsible for its operational performance and compliance with/uni00A0the/uni00A0Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement/uni00A0on/uni00A0Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and/uni00A0Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and/uni00A0implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies.\n\nThis Report references Shell's Sky 1.5 scenarios, specifically within the/uni00A0'Climate change and energy transition' section (pages 242-245).\n\nUnlike Shell's previously published Mountains and Oceans exploratory scenarios, the Sky scenario is based on the assumption that society reaches the Paris Agreement's goal of holding the rise in global average temperatures this century to well below two/uni00A0degrees Celsius (2\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels. Unlike Shell's Mountains and Oceans scenarios which unfolded in an open-ended way based upon plausible assumptions and quantifications, the Sky scenario was specifically designed to reach the Paris Agreement's goal/uni00A0in a technically possible/uni00A0manner./uni00A0\n\nSky 1.5 scenario starts with data from Shell's Sky scenario but is more aggressive and challenging in its assumptions about energy transitions as the pace of change is accelerated. As in Sky, this scenario is normative, meaning we assumed that society achieves the 1.5 degrees Celsius stretch goal of the Paris Agreement, and we worked back in designing how this could occur. Of course, there are many possible paths that society could take to achieve this goal. This will be extremely challenging, but as of today, we believe there is still a technically possible path while maintaining a growing global economy. However,/uni00A0we believe the window for success is quickly closing.\n\nThese scenarios are a part of an ongoing process used in Shell for over 40 years to challenge executives' perspectives on the future business environment. They are designed to stretch management to consider even events that may only be remotely possible. Scenarios, therefore, are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes. Shell's scenarios also are not intended to be projections or forecasts of/uni00A0the future. Shell's scenarios, including the scenarios referenced in this/uni00A0Report, are not Shell's strategy or business plan. When developing Shell's strategy, our scenarios are one of many variables that we consider. Ultimately, whether society meets its goals to decarbonise is not within Shell's control. While we intend to travel this journey in step with society, only governments can create the framework for success.\n\nShell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over/uni00A0the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCF targets over the next 10 years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCF/uni00A0target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In/uni00A0the/uni00A0future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect/uni00A0Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement.\n\nShell's 'Net Carbon Footprint' or 'net carbon intensity' referred to/uni00A0in/uni00A0this Report include Shell's carbon emissions from the production of/uni00A0our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for/uni00A0that production, and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term 'Net Carbon Footprint' or 'net carbon intensity' is for convenience only and not intended to/uni00A0suggest these emissions are those of Shell or its subsidiaries.\n\nExcept where indicated, the figures shown in the tables in this Report are in respect of subsidiaries only, without deduction of any non-controlling interest. However, the term 'Shell share' is used for convenience to refer to the volumes of hydrocarbons that are produced, processed or sold through subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. All of a subsidiary's production, processing or sales volumes (including the share of joint operations) are included in the Shell share, even if Shell owns less than 100% of the subsidiary. In the case of joint ventures and associates, however, Shell-share figures are limited only to Shell's entitlement. In/uni00A0all/uni00A0cases, royalty payments in kind are deducted from the Shell share./uni00A0\n\nExcept where indicated, the figures shown in this Report are stated in/uni00A0US/uni00A0dollars. As used herein all references to 'dollars' or '$' are to/uni00A0the/uni00A0US/uni00A0currency./uni00A0\n\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements/uni00A0concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell.

The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, showed again that the overwhelming majority of countries agree that the world must transition to a low-carbon energy mix. For Shell to play our part will require boldness, ambition and/uni00A0a willingness to transform.\n\nI feel honoured to be the Chair of Shell at such a pivotal stage in its history. Our Powering Progress strategy aims to help us generate shareholder value while achieving our net-zero emissions target, powering people's lives and respecting the natural environment.\n\nWe can take heart from the fact that Shell has always thrived on its people's ingenuity, adaptability and determination. We will need those qualities even more in the coming years.\n\nWith great challenges and changes come great opportunities. The energy transition is both our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity. Our/uni00A0resilience will stand us in good stead. After the COVID-19 pandemic caused one of the world's worst economic downturns, Shell took decisive steps to reshape for the future. We had the capital discipline and underlying strength to keep our strategy on track and to emerge with/uni00A0a/uni00A0foundation for future growth.\n\nWe should be realistic about the scale of the challenges that lie ahead. But we should also be optimistic about our ability to overcome them.\n\n## WORKING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS\n\nThe single most important key to our success in the energy transition will/uni00A0be our ability to work with customers. We have a network of 1 million commercial and industrial customers and around 32 million customers a/uni00A0day visit our 46,000 branded retail service stations.\n\nBy listening to our customers, learning from them and working with them, we can understand what they want and need as the world moves towards a lower-carbon future. We aim to use such insights to profitably provide the low-carbon products and services they will want to buy.\n\nThis approach will be crucial to Shell's target of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Customers' use of/uni00A0products accounts for the vast majority of energy-related carbon emissions. We can seize opportunities that help us and our customers.\n\nFor example, customers in industry and road freight are increasingly working to cut their emissions, to meet society's expectations and comply with tighter environmental regulations. At one of our projects, we can now provide zero-emissions green hydrogen. As part of the Refhyne European consortium, we have installed an electrolyser at Shell's Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland, in Germany. It began operating in July and will/uni00A0use renewable electricity to produce up to 1,300 tonnes of green hydrogen a year.\n\nWe expect to develop new markets by building low-carbon businesses and forming strategic alliances that can help us and entire sectors get to/uni00A0net zero. In November 2021, for example, we signed a strategic co-operation agreement with electric vehicle company NIO aimed at/uni00A0making charging easier for customers around the world.\n\nShell currently operates almost 90,000 electric vehicle charge points globally. We aim to increase this to more than 500,000 by 2025. To/uni00A0achieve this, we must give customers what they want and need: charging services that are convenient, reliable and easy to use.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## SIMPLIFYING FOR THE ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nMany of our customers will also need oil and gas for years to come. If/uni00A0we/uni00A0are to compete in the energy transition and attract investment, we/uni00A0will need to continue to supply their needs too. In August, we took the final investment decision on the Timi gas development project in Malaysia, which will feature the first wellhead platform in the country to be powered by a hybrid solar and wind system.\n\nWe expect this and other Upstream projects to generate strong cash flows. Thanks to our integrated presence across the global energy system, we can use this cash to reward investors with shareholder distributions and/uni00A0to invest, with discipline, in low-carbon businesses that will help us transform. In October we set a new target to halve the absolute emissions from our operations and the energy we buy to run them by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. These are what are known as/uni00A0our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Such shorter-term objectives will/uni00A0push us to make faster progress towards our target of becoming a/uni00A0net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\nWe have simplified our share structure, and believe this will help us accelerate our progress in the energy transition still further. We should find/uni00A0it quicker and easier to manage our portfolio now we have adopted a/uni00A0single line of shares and moved our tax residence to the UK.\n\n## POWERING LIVES\n\nEnergy can help lift people out of poverty. That means something to me. Growing up in Scotland, a short distance from what became the COP26 venue, I sometimes accompanied my father Hugh, a doctor, as he visited patients in deprived areas of Glasgow. Dad saw the patient, while I sat in the car and read comics. I was struck by the importance Dad attached to those home visits. They allowed him to see how his patients' hardships were affecting their health.\n\nNow I am part of an organisation whose business helps customers to heat their homes and travel to a job. In some parts of the world, that access to/uni00A0modern energy can be the difference between struggling and starting on a path towards a better life. Working with our customers to meet their needs, whether industry seeking to cut carbon emissions, the motorist driving an electric car or a family trying to improve their quality of life, makes good business sense for Shell.\n\nToday and for decades to come, we will only succeed by helping the customer succeed.\n\n## SIR ANDREW MACKENZIE\n\nChair\n\n## Shell: providing what is needed for life in the energy transition\n\n(Clockwise from left): energy for cooking; charging for electric vehicles; hydrogen for road freight; and shipments of liquefied natural gas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REVIEW\n\n## TAKING ACTION/uni00A0TODAY, BUILDING FOR TOMORROW\n\nLike many others, I have been appalled by/uni00A0Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an act of/uni00A0aggression that shocked the world. It/uni00A0has/uni00A0inflicted much suffering, and threatened/uni00A0the/uni00A0security of a continent.\n\nOur first priority, as always, was the safety of our people. We employ around 1,500 staff and contractors in Ukraine. We have been doing everything we can to try to ensure their safety and well-being.\n\nWe also took decisive action in support of global economic measures against Russia. We announced our intention to exit joint ventures with Gazprom, a majority Russian-government-owned business, and related entities. This included the Sakhalin-2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility, Salym Petroleum Development and the Gydan energy venture. We also intend to end our involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.\n\nAt the end of 2021, Shell had around $3 billion in non-current assets in/uni00A0these ventures in Russia. We expect our actions will have an impact on/uni00A0the book value of Shell's Russia assets and lead to impairments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also decided to withdraw from involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and LNG, in/uni00A0a/uni00A0phased manner, in line with government guidance. We will shut our/uni00A0service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia.\n\nWe/uni00A0will go ahead with these steps, regardless of their financial implications, while doing everything we can to support our staff in Russia.\n\nDifficult times bring out the best in people. I was moved by how in Shell, Russian and Ukrainian colleagues worked together to respond to events. Shell staff in neighbouring countries stepped up to the task of helping refugees from war.\n\nAs a business, Shell too will seek to help in the relief effort. In discussion with governments around the world, we will also work through the detailed business implications, including the importance of secure energy supplies to/uni00A0Europe and other markets, in compliance with relevant sanctions.\n\n## BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE\n\nWhile so much has happened in recent weeks to increase the challenges our business faces, we must stay on track to ensure continued success. Our Powering Progress strategy and financial framework remain unchanged.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to build for the future. We moved ahead at pace with the transformation of our refining business into energy and chemicals parks that can meet our customers' growing demand for low-carbon energy.\n\nWe made progress in developing our interests in electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and carbon capture and storage (CCS); in hydrogen, wind and solar power.\n\nThese are businesses of the low-carbon energy future. The world will need them if it is to tackle climate change. They are also businesses of enormous potential. I believe that, as they mature, they could be as profitable for Shell as our oil and gas operations are now.\n\n## STRONG RESULTS\n\nIn 2021, we delivered strong financial results. Our income was $20.6/uni00A0billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $21.5/uni00A0billion the previous year. Shell's cash flow from operations went from $34.1 billion in 2020 to/uni00A0$45.1 billion in 2021. Our distributions to/uni00A0shareholders were $9.1 billion in/uni00A02021, the same as in 2020. We/uni00A0expect/uni00A0shareholder distributions to/uni00A0increase significantly in 2022.\n\nShell's net debt reduced from $75.4 billion in 2020 to $52.6 billion at the/uni00A0end of 2021. This brought us below the $65 billion milestone, at which point we increased total shareholder distributions to 20-30% of cash flow from operations.\n\nWe announced a share buyback programme of $8.5 billion for the first half of 2022. This will include $5.5 billion from the sale of our shales business in the US Permian Basin.\n\nWe expect to increase our dividend by around 4% to 25 US cents a/uni00A0share/uni00A0for the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## SAFETY\n\nIn 2021, sadly, six of our contractor colleagues and a police officer were killed in an appalling attack in Nigeria. In Pakistan, a lorry driver died in/uni00A0a/uni00A0refuelling accident at a dealer-operated retail site. A contractor died/uni00A0in/uni00A0an accident at an Indonesian retail site.\n\nI am determined that we learn from these terrible incidents. We must do/uni00A0everything possible to ensure that anyone who works for Shell goes home safe and well.",

Growing tensions as Russia prepared to invade Ukraine added to/uni00A0the rise in prices.\n\nPeople and businesses must have affordable energy bills. Shell can help to/uni00A0bolster supplies by delivering LNG to countries experiencing shortages.\n\nShell must also play its part in helping to tackle the world's biggest challenge: climate change. The COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, made some progress. Agreement on how Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement will work in practice, for example, should stimulate crossborder carbon trading - which could prove important in getting the world/uni00A0to net zero.\n\nWhen we launched our Powering Progress strategy in February 2021, we/uni00A0set short- and medium-term targets to reduce carbon emissions that were ambitious, but realistic. We also reaffirmed our long-term target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress towards meeting the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn May 2021, the District Court in The Hague ruled that by 2030 Shell must reduce its worldwide net-carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. We were disappointed by this ruling, but we/uni00A0decided to rise to the challenge by accelerating our strategy to reduce carbon emissions. We set a new target of cutting the absolute emissions from our operations and the energy we buy to run them by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.\n\nAt the same time, we are appealing against the ruling. It effectively holds Shell, a single company, accountable for a global challenge - reducing consumer demand for carbon-based fuels. What is really needed is action by all: governments, business, customers and wider society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompanies like Shell, with our global scale, financial muscle and technological know-how, are critical to getting things done and helping to/uni00A0make the energy transition a reality. Collaborative action is crucial. For/uni00A0example, in July 2021, we signed an agreement with Deutsche Telekom. Shell will supply renewable energy and Deutsche Telekom engineers will install more than 10,000 electric vehicle chargers in Germany.\n\nThe transformation of our refineries into energy and chemicals parks opens/uni00A0up many possibilities. We are building an 820,000-tonnes-a-year biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. And we have started producing hydrogen from renewables at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland, in Germany.\n\n## SIMPLER, FASTER\n\nOur company-wide reorganisation has made us more streamlined. Adopting a single line of shares and moving our tax residence to the UK/uni00A0will make it quicker and easier to manage our portfolio in the energy transition. We can also buy back shares more quickly, speeding up distributions to investors.\n\nWe will, though, remain a major presence in the Netherlands. We/uni00A0are/uni00A0proud of Shell's Anglo-Dutch heritage. Shell has the agility, and our integrated business model gives us the financial muscle. Cash flows from our Upstream operations enable us to deliver strong shareholder returns and invest in low-carbon opportunities. Upstream also provides oil/uni00A0and gas that the world will need for years to come.\n\nSo while we invest for the future, we must continue to invest to meet today's energy demand. In 2021, we strengthened our Upstream position in core regions. We decided to invest in the Whale development in the US/uni00A0Gulf of Mexico. As part of the Libra consortium, we chose to invest in/uni00A0a/uni00A0fourth floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel in/uni00A0the Mero field, off the Brazilian coast.\n\nIf 2021 was a year of historic change for Shell, it was also a year of great progress. One that has set us up for success as we seize the opportunities of the energy transition.\n\n## BEN VAN BEURDEN\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nt",

It includes natural gas exploration and extraction, and the operation of upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver gas to market.\n\nIn Renewables and Energy Solutions (R&ES), we are exploring emerging opportunities and investing in those where we believe sufficient commercial value is available. R&ES includes Shell's production and marketing of hydrogen, nature and environmental solutions as well as our integrated power activities.\n\n## UPSTREAM\n\nUpstream manages the exploration for and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil/uni00A0and gas, and operates infrastructure necessary to deliver them to/uni00A0market.\n\nWhile the Upstream business delivers the energy of today, it is also funding the energy of tomorrow and will play a fundamental role in/uni00A0supporting Shell's ambitious transformation.\n\n## DOWNSTREAM\n\nDownstream manages different Oil Products and Chemicals activities as part of an integrated value chain that trades and refines crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of products which are/uni00A0moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and transport use.\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nThe products we sell include gasoline, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel, marine fuel, biofuel, lubricants, bitumen and sulphur. We also produce and sell petrochemicals for industrial use worldwide.\n\nOur Downstream organisation also manages Oil Sands activities (the/uni00A0extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its conversion into/uni00A0synthetic crude oil).\n\n## PROJECTS & TECHNOLOGY\n\nOur Projects & Technology organisation manages the delivery of/uni00A0our/uni00A0major projects and drives research and innovation to develop new/uni00A0technology solutions. It provides technical services and technology capability for our Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream activities. It is also responsible for providing functional leadership across Shell in the areas of safety and environment, contracting and procurement, wells activities and greenhouse gas management.\n\nTechnology and innovation are essential to our efforts to meet the world's/uni00A0energy needs in a competitive way. If we do not develop the right technology, do not have access to it or do not deploy it effectively, this could have a material adverse effect on the delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate (see 'Risk factors' on pages 22-33). Our Chief Technology Officer, who is part of the Projects & Technology organisation, oversees the development and deployment of new and differentiating technologies and innovations across Shell. Our main technology centres are in India, the Netherlands and the USA, with other centres in Brazil, China, Germany, Oman and Qatar. A strong patent portfolio underlies the technology that we employ in our various businesses.\n\nOur reporting segments are Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products, Chemicals and Corporate. Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products and Chemicals include their respective elements of our Projects & Technology organisation. The Corporate segment comprises our holdings and treasury organisation, self-insurance activities, and headquarters and central functions. See Note 5 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 245-248. With effect from 2022, our reporting segments will change to Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, Renewables and Energy Solutions and Corporate, reflecting the way Shell reviews and assesses its performance.\n\n## Current reporting segments\n\nFuture reporting segments\n\n<!-- image -->",

The equivalent figure in the January 2021/uni00A0report Decarbonising Road Freight: Getting into Gear was/uni00A0more than 70%.\n\nShell intends to supply our road freight and aviation customers with the low-carbon biofuels they want and need. An important aim of our Powering Progress strategy is to transform refineries into energy and chemicals parks so that we reduce our global production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030.\n\nAt our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, for example, we are building one of Europe's biggest biofuels facilities. It is expected to start production in 2024, making up to/uni00A0820,000 tonnes of biofuels a year, which Shell will sell as sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel.\n\nThe sales will help Shell make purposeful and profitable progress towards our target of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. The facility will help us achieve our ambition of producing around 2 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel a year by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TRANSFORMING OUR REFINERIES INTO ENERGY AND CHEMICALS PARKS\n\nThe multinational chemicals corporation Asahi Kasei, a Shell customer, is aiming to become carbon neutral by 2050 and to use more sustainable feedstocks in its supply chain.\n\nWe believe we can profitably supply Asahi Kasei and other customers with products that they want and need to achieve their carbon neutrality and sustainability aims. This will play an important part in transforming the Bukom manufacturing site into the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore, with an increasing focus on/uni00A0customers' low-carbon energy and sustainability needs. In November, we signed an agreement to supply Asahi Kasei with butadiene, a chemical which it will use to make high-performance tyres that can cut vehicle emissions by improving fuel efficiency.\n\nWe plan to make the butadiene at Bukom, using a new unit that upgrades the quality of pyrolysis oil made from hard-to-recycle plastic waste that would otherwise go into landfill. We expect the/uni00A0pyrolysis oil upgrader to start production in 2023 and be the largest in Asia.\n\nThe pyrolysis oil it produces can be used to make chemicals that go/uni00A0into hundreds of everyday products, so Shell expects many other companies to become customers, especially those with sustainability goals. This will help Shell profitably achieve its aim of processing 1/uni00A0million tonnes a year of plastic waste in our global chemicals plants by 2025. The transformation of Bukom and at least four other refining sites into energy and chemicals parks will help us achieve our ambition of reducing our global production of traditional fuels by 55% by 2030.\n\no\n\nr\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\n\n## OUR STRATEGY\n\n## Powering Progress is our strategy to accelerate the transition of our business to net-zero emissions, in step with society.\n\n## CONTEXT\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges the world faces today,/uni00A0and necessitates a rapid transformation of the energy system to/uni00A0net-zero emissions.\n\nShell supports the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to/uni00A0limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nTo achieve this, there needs to be urgent action to reduce emissions across power, transport, buildings, and industries like steel and chemicals. Shell must play its part, purposefully and profitably, in helping to make these changes happen.\n\nThe energy transition will bring risk and involve confronting complex and/uni00A0difficult obstacles, while at the same time acting on other great challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which is continuing to/uni00A0cause/uni00A0unprecedented levels of disruption.\n\nBut the energy transition will also offer great opportunities.\n\nMore than 120 countries and over 2,000 companies and organisations have made commitments to get to net-zero emissions by 2050. Shell is/uni00A0taking action, sector by sector. We seek to work with our customers to/uni00A0profitably serve their changing needs, and to help decarbonise the energy/uni00A0system and reach net-zero emissions.\n\nOur approach is to start with the customer or sector and ask: what/uni00A0do/uni00A0they/uni00A0want and need - today, and in the future?/uni00A0\n\nBy listening to our customers and learning from them, we work out how to/uni00A0profitably provide the low-carbon products and services that they want and need - today and throughout their progress to net-zero emissions.\n\nThere will be no single solution that fits all customers. Instead, there will/uni00A0be/uni00A0variations in what customers want and need, with differing approaches and rates of progress across countries, sectors and markets. Shell aims to/uni00A0provide customers with what works best for them in their particular circumstances.\n\nCustomers' use of our energy products accounts for the vast majority of/uni00A0energy-related carbon emissions of our products sold. By helping our/uni00A0customers get to net zero, we will also help ourselves get to net zero.\n\n## POWERING PROGRESS\n\nPowering Progress is our strategy to accelerate the transition of our business to net-zero emissions, in step with society's progress towards the/uni00A0goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change./uni00A0\n\nPowering Progress generates value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. It has four main goals which integrate sustainability with our business strategy. These goals support Shell's purpose, to power progress together by providing more and cleaner energy solutions. We expect our employees at all times to maintain our focus on safety and abide by our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people.\n\nGenerating shareholder value: /uni00A0We aim to create the conditions for/uni00A0share price appreciation by preparing our business for the future and/uni00A0seizing the opportunities presented by the energy transition. Shell must take a dynamic approach to its portfolio during the energy transition. This/uni00A0means continuing to provide the energy the world needs today, and increasing our investments in/uni00A0lower-carbon energy products and services. We aim to do this while providing sustainable distributions today through our progressive dividend policy. In 2021, we re-based our dividend to $0.24 per share. We announced a share buyback programme of up to $3.5 billion, including $1.5 billion from the sale of our Permian business. The additional shareholder distributions from the Permian sale will eventually total $7 billion, with $5.5 billion distributed in the form of share/uni00A0buybacks in 2022./uni00A0We aim to/uni00A0maintain a strong balance sheet and/uni00A0a disciplined approach to capital investment, so we remain strong and resilient. In this way, we will achieve our aim of being a compelling investment case for our shareholders.\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the shareholders of the company supported the/uni00A0resolution to amend Shell's articles of association to enable the simplification of the Company. The simplification entailed establishing a/uni00A0single line of shares to eliminate the complexity of Shell's A/B share structure. It also involved aligning Shell's tax residence with its country of/uni00A0incorporation in the UK by relocating the CEO, the CFO and the venue of Board and Executive Committee meetings to the UK. As a consequence, we changed the Company's name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to Shell plc.\n\nThe simplification was designed to strengthen Shell's competitiveness and/uni00A0accelerate shareholder distributions and the delivery of our strategy to become a net-zero emissions energy business.\n\nAchieving net-zero emissions: We have a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. In 2021, we set a/uni00A0new target to halve the absolute emissions from our operations and the energy we buy to run them by 2030 (our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions), compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. We also brought forward our target to eliminate routine gas flaring at our Upstream operated assets from 2030 to 2025.",

In 2021, we announced that we are building an 820,000 tonnes-a-year biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. In Germany, we opened the Refhyne electrolyser at our Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland. This electrolyser is the largest of its kind in Europe, producing 1,300 tonnes of green hydrogen per year from renewable energy.\n\nWe are decarbonising sector by sector, forming alliances and working collaboratively with customers, businesses and governments to make progress in the energy transition and reduce emissions. This includes sectors that are harder to decarbonise, such as aviation, shipping, commercial road freight, power, heating and certain parts of industry. We/uni00A0also support government policies to reduce carbon emissions in the/uni00A0economy, including putting a direct price on carbon emissions.\n\nPowering lives: Shell helps to power lives and livelihoods by providing/uni00A0vital energy for homes, businesses and transport. The supply of/uni00A0affordable, reliable and sustainable energy is crucial for addressing global challenges, including those related to poverty and inequality. Our/uni00A0ambition, by 2030, is to provide reliable electricity to 100 million people in Africa and Asia who do not have it yet. We support livelihoods by providing employment and training in the communities where we operate. We are working to become one of the most diverse and inclusive companies in the world, a place where everyone feels valued and respected. We are focusing on four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) and disability. We seek/uni00A0to/uni00A0respect human rights in all parts of our business.\n\nRespecting nature: We are stepping up our environmental ambitions, and shaping them to reflect the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Our/uni00A0environmental ambitions include protecting and enhancing biodiversity. We are also focusing on using water and other resources more efficiently and reusing as much of them as we can. We are reducing waste from our/uni00A0operations and increasing the recycling of plastics. In 2021, we announced that we will build a new pyrolysis oil upgrader unit at/uni00A0our manufacturing site on Pulau Bukom, Singapore. Scheduled to start production in 2023, the upgrader is designed to improve the quality of pyrolysis oil, a liquid made from hard-to-recycle plastic waste that would otherwise have gone into landfill. We are helping to improve air quality by/uni00A0reducing emissions from our operations and providing cleaner ways to/uni00A0power transport and industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nt",

Shell is adapting its portfolio of assets and products to better meet the cleaner energy needs of its customers. We are delivering our strategy through three business pillars: Growth, Transition, and Upstream.\n\nOur Growth pillar includes Marketing and Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, such as Power and Hydrogen. Our Growth businesses increase our returns while helping customers to decarbonise.\n\nOur Transition pillar includes our Integrated Gas and Chemicals and Products businesses. These businesses enable us to accelerate our progress towards net-zero emissions and deliver sustainable cash flow.\n\nOur Upstream pillar delivers value to shareholders, provides vital oil and/uni00A0gas to society and funds the transformation of our portfolio.\n\nAchieving our strategy depends on how we respond to competitive forces./uni00A0We continually assess the external environment - the markets and/uni00A0the underlying economic, political, social and environmental drivers that shape them - to evaluate changes in competitive forces and business models. We use future scenarios to help inform our strategy. We regularly review the markets where we operate, assessing our competitive position by analysing trends, uncertainties, and the strengths and weaknesses of our traditional and non-traditional competitors.\n\nWe maintain business plans that focus on actions and capabilities to/uni00A0create and sustain competitive advantage. We maintain a risk management framework that regularly assesses our response to, and/uni00A0risk/uni00A0appetite for, identified risks.\n\n- See 'Risk factors' on pages 22-33 and 'Governance' on page 120.\n\nOur Executive Directors' remuneration is linked to the successful delivery of our strategy, based on performance indicators that are aligned with/uni00A0shareholder interests. Long-term incentives form the majority of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Executive Directors' remuneration for above-target performance. In/uni00A02021, the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) included cash generation, capital discipline, value created for shareholders, and an energy transition/uni00A0condition.\n\n- See the 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on page 166.\n- For more details on how the strategic pillars are embedded into our businesses, see 'Shell Powering Progress' on pages 6-11.\n\n## DELIVERING THE STRATEGY: OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF ENERGY\n\n## GROWTH PILLAR:\n\nTHE FUTURE OF ENERGY / Marketing / Renewables and Energy Solutions\n\n## MARKETS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enhanced value delivery through trading and optimisation\n\n## TRANSITION PILLAR:\n\nENABLING OUR STRATEGY / Integrated Gas / Chemicals and Products\n\n## ASSETS\n\n## UPSTREAM PILLAR:\n\nFUNDING OUR STRATEGY\n\n## RESOURCES",

        "page_content": "## OUTLOOK FOR 2022 AND BEYOND\n\nWe believe that our integrated business model is key to driving our strategy. Shell has a competitive portfolio and we are leading our peer group on cash generation. We intend to develop our portfolio of assets and the mix of energy that we sell to meet the cleaner energy needs of/uni00A0our/uni00A0customers, while delivering value for our shareholders.\n\nDelivering our strategy will require clear and deliberate capital allocation choices. We approach capital allocation at three levels: enterprise, portfolio and project. The enterprise level is about how we make choices between increasing distributions to our shareholders, investing in our business and/or strengthening our balance sheet. The portfolio level is/uni00A0about how we allocate capital between our three business pillars -/uni00A0Growth, Transition and Upstream. The project level is about how we/uni00A0evaluate and prioritise investment opportunities.\n\nFor cash capital expenditure, the base capex to sustain our strategy is/uni00A0expected to be $19-22 billion per annum. To accelerate our strategy we/uni00A0expect our cash capital expenditure to grow to $23-27 billion per annum,/uni00A0once we have met our priority to distribute 20-30% of cash flow from operations to shareholders. For 2022 we expect our cash capex to/uni00A0be at the lower end of this range. More than half the additional capex/uni00A0(above the base capex) is expected to be spent on our Growth businesses. We remain committed to our progressive dividend policy and/uni00A0focused on targeting AA-equivalent credit metrics through the cycle.\n\nSubject to Board approval, we aim to increase the dividend per share by/uni00A0around 4% every year. We target the distribution of 20-30% of cash flow from operations to shareholders, and may choose to return cash to/uni00A0shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks.\n\nAfter reaching this level of shareholder distributions, additional surplus cash is expected to be allocated between further disciplined capital investments to accelerate our strategy and further reduce debt to strengthen the balance sheet.\n\nWe support the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to/uni00A0limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We have a long-term target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. To/uni00A0achieve this target, we will have to be net zero on all emissions from the/uni00A0manufacture of all our products and all our customers' emissions from the/uni00A0use of the energy products we sell. This means the target covers our Scope 1 emissions, which come directly from our operations, our Scope 2 emissions, from the energy we buy to run our operations, and our Scope 3 emissions, which include the emissions from our customers' use of the energy products we sell, regardless of whether they are produced by/uni00A0Shell/uni00A0or a third party.\n\nWe also have targets to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, as measured by Shell's Net Carbon Footprint, using 2016 as our baseline year. These include short-term targets of a 3-4% reduction by the end of 2022 and 6-8% by 2023. Our medium- and longer-term targets are to reduce by 20% by 2030, by 45% by 2035 and 100% by 2050, in step with society. We achieved our target of a 2-3% reduction by the end of 2021. In October, we set an absolute emissions reduction target of 50% on all Scope 1 and 2 emissions under Shell's operational control by/uni00A02030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis.\n\nWe believe that our total carbon emissions from energy sold peaked in 2018 and will stay below 1.7 gigatonnes per annum (Gtpa). Further details are in the 'Climate change and energy transition' section on page 75.\n\nThe statements in this 'Strategy and outlook' section, including those related to our growth strategies and our expected or potential future cash flow from/uni00A0operations, organic free cash flow, share buybacks, capital investment, divestments, production and Net Carbon Footprint, are based on management's current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied herein. See 'About this Report' on page iii and 'Risk factors' on pages/uni00A022-33.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, we announced our intention to exit our ventures with Gazprom. On March 8, 2022, we announced our intention to/uni00A0withdraw from our involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons in a/uni00A0phased/uni00A0manner.

This includes considering the interests of other stakeholders which may affect the/uni00A0long-term success of/uni00A0the company. This S172 statement explains how/uni00A0Shell's Directors:\n\n- \u25a0 have considered employee interests, the need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and the effects of/uni00A0those considerations, including on the principal decisions taken during the financial year.\n- \u25a0 have engaged with employees, suppliers, customers and others; and\n\nThe S172 statement focuses on matters of strategic importance to Shell, and the level of information disclosed is consistent with the size and the complexity of Shell's businesses.\n\n## GENERAL CONFIRMATION OF DIRECTORS' DUTIES\n\nShell's Board has a clear framework for determining the matters within its/uni00A0remit and has approved Terms of Reference for the matters delegated to its Committees. Certain financial and strategic thresholds have been set, in order to identify matters requiring Board consideration and approval. The Manual of Authority sets out the delegation and approval/uni00A0process across the broader business. More information on/uni00A0Shell's controls and procedures can be found in 'Other regulatory and/uni00A0statutory information' on page 198.\n\nWhen making decisions, each Director ensures that (s)he acts in the way/uni00A0he or she considers, in good faith, would most likely promote Shell's/uni00A0success for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so/uni00A0has regard (among other matters) to the issues set out below.\n\n## S172(1) (a) 'THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF/uni00A0ANY/uni00A0DECISION IN THE LONG TERM'\n\nThe Directors understand the business and the evolving environment in which we operate, including the challenges of navigating through the energy transition. Based on Shell's purpose to power progress together by/uni00A0providing more and cleaner energy solutions, the strategy set by the Board is intended to accelerate the transition of our business to net-zero emissions, purposefully and profitably, in step with society. We are building a strong, resilient business by putting customers at the centre of/uni00A0our strategy, innovating the products and solutions customers need on their journey to net zero.\n\nAs outlined in 'Our context' in the 'Shell Powering Progress' section on pages 6-11, the rising standard of living of a growing global population is/uni00A0likely to continue to drive demand for energy, including oil and gas, for/uni00A0years to come. At the same time, technological changes, and the need/uni00A0to/uni00A0tackle climate change mean there is a transition under way to a lower-carbon, multi-source energy system with increasing customer choice. Our Powering Progress strategy combines our ambitions under four goals: generating shareholder value, achieving net-zero emissions, powering lives and respecting nature.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continued to cause unprecedented levels of disruption.\n\nIn 2021, the Board announced its move to the next phase of the capital allocation framework, consistent with Shell's Powering Progress strategy. Shell's operational and financial delivery and strengthened balance sheet/uni00A0had given it the confidence to increase shareholder distributions by/uni00A0increasing dividends and commence share buybacks, while Shell/uni00A0continues to invest for the future of energy. The key elements of/uni00A0Shell's strategic direction were highlighted in our 2020 Annual Report/uni00A0and included:\n\n- \u25a0 growing our leading marketing business, further developing the integrated Power business and commercialising hydrogen and biofuels to support customers' efforts to achieve net-zero emissions;\n- \u25a0 setting a target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step with society;\n- \u25a0 transforming our refining portfolio from the current 13 sites into five/uni00A0high-value energy and chemicals parks, integrated with Chemicals. Growth in Chemicals would shift to more performance chemicals and/uni00A0recycled feedstocks;\n- \u25a0 focusing on value over volume by simplifying Upstream to eight significant core positions, which would generate more than 80%/uni00A0of/uni00A0Upstream's cash flow from operations; and\n- \u25a0 extending leadership in liquefied natural gas (LNG) to enable decarbonisation of key markets and sectors;\n- \u25a0 enhancing value delivery through trading and optimisation.\n\nThe Directors recognise that there are differing societal views about our operations and that some Board decisions taken today may not align with/uni00A0all stakeholder interests. Given the complexity of the evolving energy transition, the Directors have taken the good faith decisions they believe best support Shell's strategy.\n\n## S172(1) (b) 'THE INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES'\n\nThe Directors recognise that Shell employees are fundamental and core to/uni00A0our business and the delivery of our strategic ambitions. The success of/uni00A0our business depends on attracting, retaining, and motivating talented employees. The Directors consider and assess the implications of decisions on employees and the wider workforce, where relevant and feasible. The/uni00A0Directors seek to ensure that Shell remains a responsible employer, including with respect to pay and benefits, health and safety issues, and the workplace environment. In early 2021, in recognition and appreciation of employee resilience during 2020 when bonuses were suspended, the Board supported a one-off award of shares worth $1,000/uni00A0to employees below the Executive Committee level.\n\nThe Directors recognise that our pensioners, though no longer employees, also remain important stakeholders.\n\n- More information on this can be found in 'Workforce engagement' on/uni00A0page 145.",

        "page_content": "## S172(1) (c) 'THE NEED TO FOSTER THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS/uni00A0AND OTHERS'\n\nDelivering our strategy requires strong mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers, customers, governments, national oil companies and joint-venture partners. Shell seeks to promote and apply certain general principles in such relationships. The ability to promote these principles effectively is an important factor in the decision to enter into or remain in/uni00A0such relationships. This standard and others are described in the Shell General Business Principles, which are based upon our core values of honesty, integrity, and respect for people. The Board periodically reviews and approves the Shell General Business Principles. The Directors take account of the General Business Principles and core values when exercising their duties and making Board decisions. When feasible, core value moments are built into Board agendas, so the Board can reflect on/uni00A0the importance of the General Business Principles and core values. The/uni00A0Board also reviews and approves Shell's approach to suppliers, which/uni00A0is set out in the Shell Supplier Principles. In 2021, relevant Board committees held briefing sessions with the Contracting and Procurement (C&P) team/uni00A0to more deeply engage on Shell's C&P programme, including its approach, risk management profile and stakeholder engagement. The/uni00A0businesses continually assess the priorities related to customers and/uni00A0those with whom we do business. The Board engages with the businesses on/uni00A0these topics, for example, within the context of business strategy updates and investment proposals.\n\nThe Directors also receive updates on a variety of topics that indicate how/uni00A0these stakeholders have been engaged.\n\nThese updates include information provided by the Projects & Technology function on suppliers and joint-venture partners, with respect to items such/uni00A0as project updates and supplier contract management. Businesses also provide information, as relevant, on customers and joint-venture partners in relation to business strategies, projects, and investment or/uni00A0divestment proposals.\n\nThe CEO provides a comprehensive update to the Board on material business and external developments at each main Board meeting. These/uni00A0include: i) a report on safety performance; ii) significant operational updates relating to each of the business segments, e.g. partnerships, investments, divestments, flagship projects, commercial highlights and achievements; iii) the development of new technologies and innovation via/uni00A0collaborations with partners, suppliers and others; and iv) political or/uni00A0regulatory developments. The CEO also summarises his own external engagements and any changes of senior executive staff.\n\n## S172(1) (d) 'THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ON THE COMMUNITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT'\n\nThis aspect is inherent in our strategic ambitions. The Board receives information on various topics to help it make decisions. The topics can include, for example, the Net Carbon Footprint target, the impact of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic on Shell, country-entry considerations, proposals to invest or divest, and business strategy reviews. The information also goes into Group-level overviews, such as updates on safety and environment performance, reports from the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, and reports from the Chief Internal Auditor. In 2021, certain Board committees and Non-executive Directors conducted site visits of various Shell operations and overseas offices and held external stakeholder engagements, where feasible. As in 2020, not all visits could be face-to-face because of continuing restrictions and precautions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued challenges presented by COVID-19, the Board maintained a strong interface with businesses and staff through virtual engagements, making best use of the technology/uni00A0available.\n\n- More information can be found in 'Understanding and engaging with/uni00A0our stakeholders' on page 141, and in the reports of each Board/uni00A0committee.\n\n## S172(1) (e) 'THE DESIRABILITY OF THE COMPANY MAINTAINING A REPUTATION FOR HIGH STANDARDS OF/uni00A0BUSINESS CONDUCT'\n\nShell aims to meet the world's growing need for more and cleaner energy solutions in economically, environmentally, and socially responsible ways. The Board periodically reviews and approves clear frameworks, such as The Shell General Business Principles, Shell's Code of Conduct, specific Ethics and Compliance manuals, the Ethical Decision-Making Framework, and its Modern Slavery Statements, to ensure that high standards are maintained in Shell businesses and in Shell's business relationships. This, complemented by the ways the Board is informed and monitors compliance with relevant governance standards, helps to ensure that Board decisions and the actions of Shell companies promote high standards of business conduct.\n\n## S172(1) (f) 'THE NEED TO ACT FAIRLY AS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY'\n\nAfter weighing up all relevant factors, the Directors consider which course/uni00A0of action best enables delivery of our strategy through the long/uni00A0term, taking into consideration the effect on stakeholders. In/uni00A0doing/uni00A0so, our Directors act fairly as between the Company's members/uni00A0but are not required to balance the Company's interest with/uni00A0those of other stakeholders. This can sometimes mean that certain/uni00A0stakeholder interests/uni00A0may not be fully aligned.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nThe Board recognises that it plays an important role in assessing and monitoring that our desired culture is embedded in our values, attitudes and behaviours, including in our activities and stakeholder relationships. The Board has established honesty, integrity and respect for people as Shell's core values. The General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, and Code of Ethics help everyone at Shell to act in line with these values and comply with relevant laws and regulations. The Shell Commitment and Policy on Health, Safety, Security, Environment & Social Performance applies across Shell and is designed to help protect people and the environment. In 2021, after our refreshed approach to safety in 2020, we/uni00A0transitioned from our Life-Saving Rules and implemented the Industry Life-Saving Rules. By doing this, we aim to simplify and standardise, to adopt a broader risk scope that focuses on potential for harm to people, and to create a greater sense of individual and team responsibility to avoid fatalities and life-changing injuries. The change builds on existing strong foundations, with an increased and deliberate focus on human performance, the way people, culture, equipment, work systems and processes interact as a system. It remains our ambition to achieve Goal Zero, no harm and no leaks across all our operations.\n\nIn 2021, Shell announced its Powering Progress strategy. This has four goals: generating shareholder value, achieving net-zero emissions, respecting nature and powering lives. At its heart is our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress towards the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change. We/uni00A0also have medium- and long-term targets to reduce our net carbon intensity, compared with 2016 levels, by 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035, and 100% by 2050, in step with society. To achieve our strategic goals, we need to adapt our mindset and behaviours as we navigate the increasing complexity in the world around us. At Shell we seek to have a/uni00A0culture that encourages the attitudes and behaviour that we believe will/uni00A0help us succeed. We seek to encourage:\n\nt",

We build trusting and effective teams where everyone feels ownership and has a voice in how work gets done. We strive to maintain a diverse and inclusive culture.\n\nThe Board considers the Shell People Survey to be an important tool for measuring employee engagement, motivation, affiliation, and commitment to Shell. It provides insights into employee views and has a consistently high response rate. It also helps the Board understand how the survey's outcomes are being used to strengthen Shell culture and values. The Board has noted that although staff surveys offer insight, limitations exist. In 2021, a review was launched to enhance Board oversight of culture. Due to the significant developments and challenges affecting Shell in the/uni00A0second half of 2021, that review was paused. The plan is to resume the/uni00A0review in 2022. It is intended that the review will be informed by the/uni00A0results of the Shell People Survey from 2021 and if available 2022, various staff engagements, relevant context from the 2022 external Board/uni00A0evaluation process, and the Board's 2022 Strategy Days.\n\n## STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT (INCLUDING EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT)\n\nThe Board recognises the important role Shell has in society and/uni00A0is/uni00A0deeply/uni00A0committed to public collaboration and stakeholder engagement. This commitment is at the heart of Shell's strategic ambitions./uni00A0The Board strongly believes that Shell will only succeed by/uni00A0working together with customers, governments, business partners, investors, and other stakeholders.\n\nWorking together is critical, particularly at a time when society, including businesses, governments, and consumers, faces issues as complex and challenging as climate change.\n\nWe continue to build on our long track record of working with others, such/uni00A0as investors, industry and trade groups, universities, governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and, in some appropriate instances, our competitors through our joint-venture operations or industry bodies. We believe that working together and sharing knowledge and/uni00A0experience with others offers us greater insight into our business. We/uni00A0also/uni00A0appreciate our long-term relationships with our investors and acknowledge the positive impact of ongoing engagement and dialogue.\n\nThe guidance on preparing information, proposals or discussion items for the Board asks for these materials to include considerations of the views, interests, and concerns of stakeholders and how management addressed them. This helps to strengthen the Board's knowledge of how the broader business undertakes significant levels of stakeholder engagement. Board minutes have also reflected key points on stakeholder considerations, where appropriate. The Terms of Reference for our Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee also include, within the Committee's remit, the review and consideration of external stakeholder perspectives and how major issues of public concern that could affect Shell's reputation and/uni00A0licence to operate were or are being addressed.\n\nThe Board also engaged with certain stakeholders directly, to understand their views. The Board draws upon Shell's substantial in-house expertise by/uni00A0periodically receiving input from economics and policy experts on key/uni00A0political and economic themes, with some updates being presented to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board each quarter. More on this engagement is provided in 'Understanding and engaging with our stakeholders' on page 141./uni00A0\n\nInformation on how the Directors have engaged with employees can/uni00A0be/uni00A0found on page 145 and in the 'Our people' section on pages/uni00A0114-119. The/uni00A0tables below include examples of how Directors have considered the/uni00A0interests of Shell employees and the resulting outcomes.\n\n## PRINCIPAL DECISIONS\n\nIn the table below, we outline some of the principal decisions made by the Board over the year. We explain how the Directors have engaged with or in relation to key stakeholder groups and how stakeholder interests were considered in decision-making.\n\nTo remain concise, we have categorised our key stakeholders into seven groups. Where appropriate, each group is considered to include both current and potential stakeholders. The groups are:\n\n- employees/workforce/pensioners;\n- investor community;\n- our customers;\n- NGOs/civil society stakeholders/academia/think-tanks;\n- regulators/governments;\n- communities; and\n- suppliers/strategic partners.\n\n## Principal decisions\n\nWe define principal decisions taken by the Board as decisions taken in/uni00A02021 that are of a strategic nature and significant to any of our key stakeholder groups. As outlined in the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Guidance on the Strategic Report, we include decisions related to/uni00A0capital allocation and dividend policy.\n\n## How were stakeholders considered\n\nWe describe how regard was given to the likely long-term consequences of the decision, including how stakeholders were considered during the decision-making process.\n\n## What was the outcome\n\nWe describe which accommodations or mitigations were made, if any, and how Directors have considered different interests, and what factors they took into account.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic updates\n\n## What was the outcome\n\n## Powering Progress Strategy\n\nShell's Powering Progress strategy was announced in February 2021, and highlighted in our 2020 Annual Report. After the announcement and associated stakeholder engagements by management, the feedback received from investors, the media, climate activists and internal staff was presented to and discussed with the Board.\n\nIn 2021, the Board considered strategic opportunities, and the integration of strategy, portfolio, environmental and social ambitions under our Powering Progress goals. Additional targets regarding Scope 1 and 2 emissions were also announced. A report was produced with the aim of helping investors and society obtain a better understanding of how Shell is addressing the risks and opportunities of/uni00A0the/uni00A0energy transition. The Board also considered Shell's capital and portfolio actions and structure. This/uni00A0was to/uni00A0support the delivery of Powering Progress and came after the Reshape reorganisation of Shell. See 'Our People' on pages 114-119 for further information on the Reshape initiative.\n\n## How stakeholders were considered\n\nIn 2021, the Board approved the Shell Energy Transition Strategy publication and its submission to shareholders for an advisory vote at the 2021 AGM. It was essential to ensure that stakeholders and NGOs had a sound understanding of the Energy Transition Strategy. Board members were involved in/uni00A0extensive advance stakeholder engagement. Among these advance engagements was the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo)'s consultation with an investor stakeholder group with/uni00A0a focus on climate-related financial disclosures.\n\n## Energy Transition Strategy publication\n\n## Company simplification\n\nAs the Board considered the simplification, it supported a variety of work to better assess the relevant risks and benefits. Accordingly, a project team was assembled and workstreams set up. One such workstream encompassed stakeholder engagement, focusing on shareholders, staff, government and media. The/uni00A0Board also obtained the views of various external advisers.\n\nDuring the many Board sessions that focused on simplification, discussions considered and assessed a range of factors, including potential costs and benefits and stakeholder feedback. Implementation of the simplification was also subject to an extensive consultation with relevant staff councils. In later meetings, the Board considered the views and responses of stakeholders against current external environmental events and circumstances which could affect stakeholders, but which were beyond the Board's or Shell's control. The Board also participated in engagement sessions, about which more information can be found/uni00A0in 'Understanding and engaging with our stakeholders' on page 141.\n\n## Staff engagements\n\nVirtual staff engagements were held with Directors which enabled them to speak directly with staff on/uni00A0themes including the benefits of working in Upstream. For further information on the engagement with/uni00A0our/uni00A0workforce see 'Board activities and evaluation' and 'workforce engagement' on page 137 and page 145.\n\n## Energy transition strategy\n\nThe Board set out details of how it planned to achieve its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step with society's progress towards achieving net zero.\n\nThe Board announced an additional target to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute emissions, under Shell's operational control, by 50% by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. It was announced that this formed part of the Powering Progress strategy, alongside the/uni00A0goals to generate shareholder value, respect nature and power lives. The Board regarded this as an important step as/uni00A0we rise to meet the challenge of the Dutch court's ruling in/uni00A0the Milieudefensie case against Shell.\n\nFeedback from all of the advance stakeholder engagements was taken into account by the Board, SESCo and the Executive Committee. As appropriate, revisions were made to/uni00A0the Energy Transition Strategy report prior to submission at/uni00A0the 2021 AGM. Shell's Energy Transition Strategy report described our progress towards becoming a net-zero emissions energy business and our emissions targets. Shell was the first energy company to submit an energy transition strategy to shareholders for an advisory vote. Shareholders were informed of the intention to publish an update every three years until 2050. The energy transition strategy received/uni00A088.74% shareholder support at the 2021 AGM.\n\nFollowing the AGM, the Chair, CEO and CFO engaged with stakeholders on a number of matters, which included Shell's energy transition strategy and the Dutch court's ruling in the Milieudefensie case against Shell. The key areas on which we/uni00A0received feedback from our largest shareholders were communicated to the Board. On October 28, 2021, Shell responded to this feedback and the court ruling by announcing a new target to halve Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions under Shell's operational control by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. This is another strategic milestone on our path to becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\n## Company simplification\n\nThe Board reviewed feedback from stakeholders as well as/uni00A0from the Board's independent advisers, concluding that the/uni00A0benefits of the simplification outweighed the downsides. Simplification was assessed as a way to increase the Company's flexibility to implement our Powering Progress strategy at pace, strengthen Shell's competitiveness, and support the acceleration of Shell's transition to a net-zero emissions business and create value for shareholders, customers and wider society. Shareholders were asked to approve a change of Shell's Articles of Association which would facilitate a series of measures leading to simplification. On December 10, 2021, shareholders approved the amendments to the Articles. On December 20, 2021 the Board formally approved the simplification, and on December 31, the Board approved the key steps required to move the Company's tax residence to the UK. The Company's name was changed on January 21, 2022, and the Company's shares were assimilated into a single line of shares on January/uni00A029, 2022. This completed the simplification.\n\nt",

The Board also considered and approved country entries and exits, more details of which are available in 'Board activities and evaluation' on page 137.\n\n## How stakeholders were considered\n\nThe Board considered the impact of decisions related to new business opportunities and divesting from existing opportunities in the context of sustainability, supply, regulations, and carbon intensity. Critically, the Board reviewed the various proposals' alignment with Shell's strategy. Particular focus was given to potential benefits of certain divestments, including their potential to: create returns for shareholders; further strengthen the balance sheet; de-risk future cash flow; and avoid significant additional capital investment. As part of the discussions, the Board considered the strategic drivers for the intended divestments, including the Scope 1 emissions of each asset, anticipated regulatory changes expected to lead to/uni00A0value/uni00A0erosion, and any value opportunities afforded by the macro environment.\n\nAs part of each proposal, the respective business unit will undertake effective due diligence on prospective purchasers from a financial, reputational as well as operating philosophy standpoint to ensure future obligations are met or suitable mitigating measures are in place to protect Shell and its people.\n\nWithin each divestment proposal, the Board considered if the Company was being a responsible seller/uni00A0of/uni00A0its assets and if the purchasers have the capability to manage our assets/people appropriately. Staff matters are explicitly considered during negotiations and the due diligence process/uni00A0for acquisitions and divestments. Comprehensive engagement plans are developed as/uni00A0appropriate in parallel to the negotiations.\n\nPermian - shareholder approval for the divestment of Shell Permian assets.\n\nRa\u00edzen S.A. and Biosev S.A. - shareholder approval for Ra\u00edzen joint venture to acquire Biosev S.A., a/uni00A0Brazilian ethanol producer.\n\nDeer Park Refinery - shareholder approval for the divestment of Deer Park Refining Limited Partnership.\n\nSale of holding in PCK Schwedt Refinery - shareholder approval for the divestment of Shell's interest in PCK Schwedt Refinery.\n\nPurchase of fuel and convenience retail sites in Texas - This acquisition enables Shell to continue its/uni00A0existing, trusted premium product offerings.\n\nPernis Refinery - shareholder approval to take final investment decision to build an 820,000-tonnes-ayear biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam (formerly Pernis Refinery).\n\nNote. References to 'shareholder approval' relate to the Shell intercompany approval process.\n\nPermian - After reviewing multiple strategies and portfolio options for our Permian assets, the Board determined that the/uni00A0transaction with ConocoPhillips presented a compelling value proposition, as well as disciplined capital stewardship. The Board concluded that Shell's Upstream business plays a/uni00A0critical role in the Powering Progress strategy through a/uni00A0more focused, competitive, and resilient portfolio that provides energy which the world needs while funding shareholder distributions and investments in the energy transition. The cash proceeds from the transaction were identified for use in providing additional shareholder distributions of $7 billion through share buybacks.\n\nRa\u00edzen S.A. and Biosev S.A. - While discussing the proposal for the Ra\u00edzen joint venture to acquire Biosev S.A., the Board considered joint-venture partner aspects, and factors regarding assurance of due diligence on environmental aspects and safety performance.\n\n## Deer Park Refinery and PCK Schwedt Refinery\n\n- This/uni00A0was part of Shell's strategy to reduce its global refinery footprint to core sites integrated with the company's trading hubs, chemicals plants and marketing businesses.\n\n## Purchase of fuel and convenience retail sites in Texas\n\n- As one of the largest fuels and convenience retail markets globally, growing in the US gives Shell the opportunity to build on its successful brand presence and benefit from the/uni00A0strength of its ongoing business relationships.\n\nPernis Refinery - In discussing the proposal to build a biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, the Board considered the project's potential to increase the production of low-carbon fuels (including for aviation), Scope 1 emissions and associated adaptations, supply and demand aspects, and enhancing the capability of/uni00A0employees in the talent pipeline.\n\nt",

Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, pandemics such as COVID-19, political instability, conflicts, such as the recent/uni00A0Russian invasion of Ukraine, economic conditions, including inflation, and actions by major oiland/uni00A0gas-producing countries. In a low oil and gas price environment, we would generate less revenue from/uni00A0our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses, and parts of those businesses could become less profitable or incur losses. Low oil and gas prices have also resulted and could continue to result in the debooking of proved oil or gas reserves, if they become uneconomic in this type of price environment. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, or rising costs, have resulted and could continue to result in/uni00A0projects being delayed or cancelled. Assets have been impaired in the past, and there could be impairments in the/uni00A0future. Low oil and gas prices have affected and could continue to affect our ability to/uni00A0maintain our long-term capital investment and shareholder distribution programmes. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could adversely affect the financial, fiscal, legal, political and social stability of countries that rely significantly on oil and gas revenue. In a high oil and gas price environment, we could experience sharp increases in costs, and under some production-sharing contracts, our entitlement to proved reserves would be reduced. Higher prices could also reduce demand for our products, which could result in lower profitability, particularly in our Oil Products and Chemicals business. Higher prices can also lead to more capacity being built, potentially resulting in an oversupplied market which would negatively affect our Upstream, Integrated Gas, Oil Products and Chemicals businesses.\n\nAccordingly, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nOur ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities depends in part on the accuracy of our price assumptions.\n\nFurther information : See 'Market overview' on page 43.\n\n## Risk description\n\nWe use a range of oil and gas price assumptions, which we review on a periodic basis. These ranges help us to evaluate the robustness of our capital allocation for our evaluation of projects and commercial opportunities. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nOur ability to achieve our strategic objectives depends on how we react to competitive forces.\n\nFurther information : See 'Strategy and outlook' on page 14.\n\n## Risk description\n\nWe face competition in all our businesses. We seek to differentiate our services and products, though many of our products are competing in commodity-type markets. Accordingly, failure to manage our costs and our operational performance could result in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. We also compete with state-owned hydrocarbon entities and statebacked utility entities with access to financial resources and local markets. Such entities could be motivated by political or other factors in making their business decisions. Accordingly, when bidding on/uni00A0new leases or projects, we could find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage because these state-owned entities may not require a competitive return. If we are unable to obtain competitive returns/uni00A0when bidding on new leases or projects, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe maintain a diversified portfolio to manage the impact of/uni00A0price volatility. We test the resilience of our projects and/uni00A0other opportunities against a range of prices and costs/uni00A0for crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. We prepare annual strategic and financial plans that test different scenarios and their impact on prices on our businesses and company as a whole. We also aim to maintain a strong balance sheet to provide resilience against weak market prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nThe range of commodity prices used in our project and portfolio evaluations is subject to a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term market drivers. These drivers include the extent and pace of the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe continually assess the external environment - the markets and the underlying economic, political, social and/uni00A0environmental drivers that shape them - to evaluate changes in competitive forces. We define multiple future scenarios and business environments by identifying drivers, uncertainties, enablers and constraints. These scenarios help us to find issues which affect our operating environment and have implications for our strategy.",

        "page_content": "## STRATEGIC RISKS continued\n\nRising concerns about climate change and effects of the energy transition could continue to lead to a fall in demand and potentially lower prices for fossil fuels. Climate change could also have a physical impact on our assets and supply chains. This risk may also lead to additional legal and/or regulatory measures, resulting in project delays or cancellations, potential additional litigation, operational restrictions and additional compliance obligations.\n\n- Further information : For further explanations of/uni00A0our/uni00A0climate change governance, risk management approach, climate ambition and strategy and our/uni00A0portfolio and performance, please refer to the/uni00A0section 'Climate change and energy transition' on pages 76-98.\n\n## Risk description\n\nSocietal demand for urgent action has increased, especially since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report of 2018 on 1.5\u00b0C effectively made the aspirational goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius the default target. This increasing focus on climate change and drive for an energy transition have created a/uni00A0risk environment that is changing rapidly, resulting in a wide range of stakeholder actions at global, local and business levels. The potential impact and likelihood of the associated exposure for Shell could/uni00A0vary across different time horizons, depending on the specific components of the risk.\n\nWe expect that a growing share of our GHG emissions will be subject to regulation, resulting in increased compliance costs and operational restrictions. Regulators may seek to limit certain oil and/uni00A0gas/uni00A0projects or make it more difficult to obtain required permits. Additionally, climate activists are/uni00A0challenging the grant of new and existing regulatory permits. We expect that these challenges are/uni00A0likely to continue and could delay or prohibit operations in certain cases. Achieving our target of becoming net zero on all emissions from our operations could result in additional costs. We also expect that actions by customers to reduce their emissions will continue to lower demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels, as will GHG emissions regulation through taxes, fees and/or other incentives. This/uni00A0could be a factor contributing to additional provisions for our assets and result in lower earnings, cancelled projects and potential impairment of certain assets.\n\nThe physical effects of climate change such as, but not limited to, increases in temperature and sea levels/uni00A0and fluctuations in water levels could also adversely affect our operations and supply chains.\n\nCertain investors have decided to divest their investments in fossil fuel companies. If this were to continue, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access capital markets. Stakeholder groups are also putting pressure on commercial and investment banks to stop financing fossil fuel companies. According to press reports, some financial institutions have started to limit their exposure to fossil fuel projects. Accordingly, our ability to use financing for these types of/uni00A0future projects may be adversely affected. This could also adversely affect our potential partners' ability to finance their portion of costs, either through equity or debt.\n\nIn some countries, governments, regulators, organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to/uni00A0hold fossil fuel companies liable for costs associated with climate change. While we believe these lawsuits to be without merit, losing could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. For example, in May 2021, the District Court in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that, by 2030, Shell must reduce, from its consolidated subsidiaries, its Scope 1 net emissions by 45% from its/uni00A02019 levels and use its best efforts to reduce its Scope 2 and Scope 3 net emissions by 45% from its 2019 levels. In 2019, our Scope 1 emissions from our consolidated subsidiaries were 86 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO/uni2082e), rounded. We expect to see additional regulatory requirements to provide disclosures related to climate risks and their impact on business performance.\n\nIn summary, rising climate change concerns and effects of the energy transition have led and could lead/uni00A0to a decrease in demand and potentially affect prices for fossil fuels. If we are unable to find economically viable, publicly acceptable solutions that reduce our GHG emissions and/or GHG intensity for new and existing projects and for the products we sell, we could experience financial penalties or extra costs, delayed or cancelled projects, potential impairments of our assets, additional provisions and/or reduced production and product sales. This could have a material adverse effect on/uni00A0our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nOur response to the evolving risk outlook requires transparency and clarity around our plans and actions to achieve our climate target. We have a climate change risk management structure which is supported by standards, policies and controls, as part of our health, safety, security and environment and social performance (HSSE & SP) control framework. Climate change and risks resulting from GHG emissions are reviewed and managed in accordance with other significant risks through the Board and Executive Committee. We have established several dedicated climate change and GHG-related forums at different levels of the organisation. These forums seek to address, monitor and review climate change issues. Our strategy to assess and manage risks and opportunities resulting from climate change includes considering different time horizons and their relevance to risk identification and business planning.\n\nOverall, mitigation of the risk is addressed through our strategy to accelerate the transition to net-zero emissions, purposefully and profitably. This approach has three components:\n\n- \u25a0 demonstrating our resilience by aligning our disclosures to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures;/uni00A0and\n- \u25a0 reducing the GHG emissions intensity of our operations. We expect to reduce our carbon intensity primarily through altering our product mix as customer (Scope 3) emissions represent the largest component of our carbon intensity. Our aim is to achieve this by shifting the focus of our portfolio as we build our power, hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions businesses and activities;\n- \u25a0 working towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\nWe are also working with governments on their climate policy to help establish regulatory frameworks that will enable society to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe ruling delivered by the District Court in The Hague in/uni00A0May 2021 has provided an additional challenge in this/uni00A0context. We have appealed the ruling but have stated that we want to rise to the challenge and accelerate our Powering Progress strategy to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society, regardless of/uni00A0whether we win or lose the appeal.\n\nr\n\nt",

If we are slower than/uni00A0society, customers may prefer a different supplier, which would reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our reputation besides materially affecting our earnings and financial results. If/uni00A0we/uni00A0move much faster than society, we risk investing in technologies, markets or low-carbon products that are unsuccessful because there is limited demand for them. This could also have a material adverse effect on/uni00A0our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe seek to execute divestments in pursuing our strategy. We may be unable to/uni00A0divest these assets successfully in line with our strategy.\n\nFurther information : See 'Strategy and outlook' on page 15.\n\n## Risk description\n\nWe may be unable to divest assets at acceptable prices or within the timeline envisaged because of market conditions or credit risk. This would result in increased pressure on our cash position and potential impairments. In some cases, we have also retained certain liabilities following a divestment. Even in cases where we have not expressly retained certain liabilities, we may still be held liable for past acts, failures to act or liabilities that are different from those foreseen. We may also face liabilities if a buyer fails to honour their commitments. Accordingly, if any of the above circumstances arise, this/uni00A0could have a/uni00A0material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe actively monitor societal developments, such as regulation-driven carbon-pricing mechanisms and customer-driven preferences for products. We incorporate these into scenarios which provide insights into how the energy transition may unfold in the medium and long term. These insights and those from various other external scenarios (such as the IPCC Special Report 1.5\u00b0C) guide how we set our strategic direction, capital allocation and carbon emission commitments. We have updated our strategy and organisational structure to increase our focus on the sectors where our customers operate, in order to make us better able to compete in the current evolving energy environment.\n\nThe ruling delivered by the District Court in The Hague in May 2021 has provided an additional challenge. We have appealed against the ruling. But regardless of whether we win or lose the appeal, we want to rise to the challenge, as part of our Powering Progress strategy, of accelerating our transition to a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe continually monitor market developments to assess potential divestments in pursuing our strategy. We carefully tailor our sales processes to buyers' perceived expectations so we can deliver the most competitive outcomes. As a general principle, the sales processes are configured so that buyers will acquire the assets including all related liabilities. For some assets, Shell may agree to retain certain liabilities. We monitor these liabilities closely and make appropriate provisions for them.",

We and our joint arrangements and associates also face/uni00A0the risk/uni00A0of/uni00A0litigation and disputes worldwide.\n\n## Risk description\n\nDevelopments in politics, laws and regulations can and do affect our operations. Potential impacts/uni00A0include: forced divestment of assets; expropriation of property; cancellation or forced renegotiation of/uni00A0contract rights; additional taxes including windfall taxes, restrictions on deductions and/uni00A0retroactive tax claims; antitrust claims; changes to trade compliance regulations; price controls; local content requirements; foreign exchange controls; changes to environmental regulations; changes to regulatory interpretations and enforcement; and changes to disclosure requirements. Tensions between nation states, such as Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine, can also affect our business. Any/uni00A0of/uni00A0these, individually or in aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash/uni00A0flows and financial condition.\n\nSince 2020, many governments have run deficits to deal with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic, there will be uncertain long-term fiscal consequences, with possible subsequent effects on government policies that affect Shell's business interests.\n\nFrom time to time, social and political factors play a role in unprecedented and unanticipated judicial outcomes that could adversely affect Shell. Non-compliance with policies and regulations could result in/uni00A0regulatory investigations, litigation and, ultimately, sanctions. Certain governments and regulatory bodies have, in Shell's opinion, exceeded their constitutional authority by: attempting unilaterally to/uni00A0amend or cancel existing agreements or arrangements; failing to honour existing contractual commitments; and seeking to adjudicate disputes between private litigants. Certain governments have/uni00A0also adopted laws and regulations that could potentially conflict with other countries' laws and/uni00A0regulations, potentially subjecting us to criminal and civil sanctions.

These risks and/uni00A0future events could impact our supply chain, commodity prices, credit, commodity trading, treasury and legal/uni00A0risks. The tensions also create heightened cyber-security threats to our information technology infrastructure.

Our Legal and Tax functions are organised globally and support our business lines in ensuring compliance with local laws and fiscal regulations. Our Corporate Relations department engages with governments in countries where we operate to understand and influence local policies and to advocate Shell's position on topics relevant to our industry.

We may fail to assess or manage these and other risks properly. Such potential obstacles could impair our delivery of these projects, our ability to fulfil the full potential value of the project as assessed when the investment was approved, and our ability to fulfil related contractual commitments. This could lead to impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nFuture oil and gas production will depend on our access to new proved reserves through exploration, negotiations with governments and other owners of proved reserves and acquisitions, and through developing and applying new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields.

These risks include the effects of natural disasters (including weather events), earthquakes, social unrest, pandemic diseases, criminal actions by external parties, and safety lapses. If a major risk materialises, such as an explosion or hydrocarbon leak or/uni00A0spill,/uni00A0this could result in injuries, loss of life, environmental harm, disruption of business activities, loss/uni00A0or/uni00A0suspension of permits, loss of our licence to operate and loss of our ability to bid on mineral rights./uni00A0Accordingly, this could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial/uni00A0condition.\n\nOur operations are subject to extensive HSSE regulatory requirements that often change and are likely/uni00A0to become more stringent over time. Governments could require operators to adjust their future production plans, as has occurred in the Netherlands, affecting production and costs. We could incur significant extra costs in the future because of the need to comply with such requirements.

Our standards and governance structure are defined in our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) Control/uni00A0Framework and supporting guidance documents. These describe how key controls should be operated, for example to ensure safe production and implementation of/uni00A0maintenance activities. Shell Internal Audit provides assurance on the effectiveness of HSSE & SP controls to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board. We routinely practise implementing our emergency response plans to significant risks (such as/uni00A0a/uni00A0spill, toxic substances, fire or explosion).\n\nWe assessed the impact of COVID-19 on our activities and implemented measures to minimise the adverse effect of the/uni00A0pandemic on our operations.

We also seek to minimise the pandemic's impact on our operations through scenario planning, implementing continuity plans and ensuring our sites and offices are COVID safe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information : See 'Upstream' on page 54.\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe test the economic and operational resilience of our/uni00A0Nigerian projects against a wide range of assumptions and scenarios. We seek to proportionally share risks and/uni00A0funding commitments with joint-venture partners. When/uni00A0we/uni00A0participate in joint ventures in Nigeria, we require/uni00A0that they operate in accordance with good industry/uni00A0practice. We monitor the security situation, and/uni00A0liaise with host communities, governmental and non-governmental organisations to help promote peaceful/uni00A0and safe operations.\n\nt",

The Shell General Business Principles (Principles) govern how Shell/uni00A0and its individual companies conduct their affairs, and the Shell Code of Conduct tells employees and contract staff how to behave in line with the Principles. Our challenge is to ensure that all employees and contract staff comply with the Principles and the Code of Conduct. Real or perceived failures of governance or regulatory compliance or a perceived lack of understanding of how our operations affect/uni00A0surrounding communities could harm our reputation.\n\nSocietal expectations of businesses are increasing, with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, safety and minimising damage to the environment. There is increasing focus on the role of oil and gas in the context of climate change and energy transition. This could negatively affect our brand, reputation and licence to operate, which could limit our ability to deliver our strategy, reduce consumer demand for our branded and non-branded products, harm our ability to secure new resources and contracts, and restrict our ability to access capital markets or attract staff. Many other factors, including the materialisation of other risks discussed in this section, could negatively affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems in our operations.\n\nFurther information : See 'Corporate' on page/uni00A074.\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe operation of many of our business processes depends on reliable information technology (IT) systems. Our IT systems are evolving because of changing business models, our increasing focus on customers, ongoing digitalisation of business processes and migration to the cloud. Our IT systems are increasingly dependent on contractors supporting the delivery of IT services. The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions altered the nature of the IT threat, increasing the frequency and ingenuity of/uni00A0malware attacks and increasing the temptation to attack targets for financial gain.\n\nIn 2021, Shell was impacted by data security breaches, including one involving a third-party supplier who gained unauthorised access to various files during a limited window of time, some of which contained personal data. Shell contacted the impacted individuals and stakeholders and worked with/uni00A0them to address possible risks. We also informed relevant regulators and authorities.\n\nThe factors described above continue to contribute to potential breaches and disruptions of critical IT/uni00A0ser vices. If breaches are not detected early and responded to effectively, they could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nOur business exposes us to risks of social instability, criminality, civil unrest, terrorism, piracy, cyber disruption and acts of war that could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n\n## Risk description\n\nAs seen in recent years, these risks can manifest themselves in the countries where we operate and/uni00A0elsewhere. These risks affect people and assets. Potential risks include: acts of terrorism; acts of/uni00A0criminality including maritime piracy; cyber espionage or disruptive cyber attacks; conflicts including war - such as Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine - malicious acts carried out by individuals within Shell, civil unrest and environmental and climate activism (including disruptions by non-governmental and political organisations).\n\nThe above risks can threaten the safe operation of our facilities and the transport of our products. They/uni00A0can harm the well-being of our people, inflict loss of life and injuries, damage the environment and/uni00A0disrupt our operational activities. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe continually assess and monitor the external environment for potential risks to our reputation. We engage in ongoing dialogue with our key stakeholders such as investors, industry and trade groups, universities, governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to gain greater insights into societal expectations of our business. We have mitigation plans for identified brand and reputation risks at the Group, country and line of business level. Our country chairs are responsible for implementing/uni00A0country reputation plans which are updated annually. We continually develop and defend our brand in line with Shell's purpose and promises, and target our investments to drive brand differentiation, relevance and preference.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe continually measure and improve our cyber-security capabilities. To reduce the likelihood of successful cyber attacks, our cyber-security capabilities are embedded into/uni00A0our IT systems. Our IT is protected by detective and protective technologies. Identification and assessment capabilities are built into our IT support processes and adhere to industry best practices. When external companies provide us with IT services, the security of those services is managed through contractual clauses and supplier assurance reports. Shell continually invests in efforts to embed and improve our controls and monitoring. For example, we improved our global web content filtering capability in response to the challenge of increased remote working. If breaches occur, all entities, including those that/uni00A0have yet to be fully integrated into Shell's systems and/uni00A0processes, are required to report the incident and use Shell's information security capabilities. In relation to the 2021 breach, the root cause of the incident was addressed, and the investigation showed no evidence of any impact on Shell's core IT systems. The incident was handled in line with regulations and in co-operation with the authorities./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information : See 'Environment and society' on page 111.\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe seek to obtain the best possible information to enable us to assess threats and risks. We conduct detailed assessments for all our sites and activities, and implement appropriate measures to deter, detect and respond to security risks. Further mitigations include strengthening the/uni00A0security of sites, reducing our exposure as appropriate, journey management, information risk management, crisis/uni00A0management and business continuity measures. We/uni00A0conduct training and awareness campaigns for staff/uni00A0and provide them with travel and health advice and access to 24/7 assistance while travelling. We learn from incidents, in order to continually improve our security risk management in Shell.",

(NAM). An important part of NAM's gas production comes from the onshore Groningen gas field, in which EBN, a Dutch government entity, has a 40% interest and NAM a 60% interest. The gas field is in the process of being closed down owing to earthquakes induced by gas production. Some of these earthquakes have damaged houses and other structures in the region, resulting in complaints and lawsuits from the local community. The government has announced it intends to accelerate the close-down, bringing the end of/uni00A0production forward from 2030 to possibly mid-2022. The exact close-down date depends on security/uni00A0of supply considerations and is still to be decided. While we expect the earlier close-down of/uni00A0the Groningen gas field to further reduce the number and strength of earthquakes in the region, any/uni00A0additional earthquakes could have further adverse effects on our earnings, cash flows and financial/uni00A0condition.\n\nWe are exposed to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and credit risk. We are affected by the global macroeconomic environment and the conditions of financial and commodity markets.\n\nFurther information : See 'Liquidity and capital/uni00A0resources' on page 38 and Note 20 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 270-273.\n\n## Risk description\n\nOur subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are subject to differing economic and financial market conditions around the world. Political or economic instability affects such markets.\n\nWe use debt instruments, such as bonds and commercial paper, to raise significant amounts of capital. Should our access to debt markets become more difficult, the potential impact on our liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our financing costs could also be affected by interest rate fluctuations or any credit rating deterioration.\n\nWe are exposed to changes in currency values and to exchange controls as a result of our substantial international operations. Our reporting currency is the US dollar, although, to a material extent, we also/uni00A0hold assets and are exposed to liabilities in other currencies. While we undertake some foreign exchange hedging, we do not do so for all our activities. Even/uni00A0where hedging is in place, it may not/uni00A0function as expected.\n\nCommodity trading is an important component of our Upstream, Integrated Gas, Oil Products and Chemicals businesses. Processing, managing and monitoring many trading transactions across the world, some of them complex, exposes us to operational and market risks, including commodity price risks. We use derivative instruments such as futures and contracts for difference to hedge market risks. We do not hedge all our activities and even where hedging is in place, it may not function as expected.\n\nWe are exposed to credit risk; our counterparties could fail or be unable to meet their payment and/or performance obligations under contractual arrangements. Although we do not have significant direct exposure to sovereign debt, it is possible that our partners and customers may have exposure which could impair their ability to meet their obligations. Our pension plans invest in government bonds, so/uni00A0they could be affected by a sovereign debt downgrade or other default.\n\nIf any of the above risks materialise, they could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nFurther information : See 'Upstream' on page 52.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nNAM is working with the Dutch government and other stakeholders to fulfil its obligations to residents of the area. These include compensating for damage caused by the earthquakes and paying to strengthen houses where this is required for safety considerations. Negotiations with the state are being conducted to determine how to manage the accelerated close-down. Specific remediations within the agreed scope of responsibilities are planned. NAM's joint-venture partners will review its financial robustness against different scenarios for Groningen's liabilities and costs, with the aim of the venture being able to self-fund any additional expenses and claims.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe use various financial instruments for managing exposure/uni00A0to foreign exchange and interest rate movements. Our/uni00A0treasury operations are highly centralised and seek to/uni00A0manage credit exposures associated with our substantial cash, foreign exchange and interest rate positions. Our/uni00A0portfolio of cash investments is diversified to avoid/uni00A0concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or/uni00A0counterparty. Other than in exceptional cases, the use of/uni00A0external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have the appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.\n\nWe have credit risk policies in place which seek to ensure that products are sold to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. These policies include detailed credit analysis and monitoring of customers against counterparty credit limits./uni00A0Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage credit risk. We maintain committed credit facilities. Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.\n\nIn affecting commodity trades and derivative contracts, we operate within procedures and policies designed to ensure that market risks are managed within authorised limits and trading can only be performed by staff with the appropriate skills and experience. Senior Management regularly reviews mandated trading limits. A department that is independent from our traders monitors our market risk exposures daily, using value-at-risk techniques alongside other risk metrics as/uni00A0appropriate.\n\nt",

If we fail to effectively develop or deploy new technology and products and services, or fail to make full, effective use of our data in a timely and cost-effective manner, there could be a material adverse effect on the delivery of our strategy and our licence to operate. We operate in environments where advanced technologies are used. In developing new technologies and new products, unknown or/uni00A0unforeseeable technological failures or environmental and health effects could harm our reputation and licence to operate or expose us to litigation or sanctions. The associated costs of new technology are sometimes underestimated. Sometimes the development of new technology is subject to delays. If/uni00A0we are unable to develop the right technology and products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or/uni00A0if/uni00A0we develop technologies and products that harm the environment or people's health, there could be a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe have substantial pension commitments, the funding of which is subject to capital market risks and other factors.\n\nFurther information : See 'Liquidity and capital resources' on page 38.\n\n## Risk description\n\nLiabilities associated with defined benefit pension plans are significant, and the cash funding requirement of such plans can also involve significant liabilities. They both depend on various assumptions. Volatility in capital markets or government policies could affect investment performance and interest rates, causing significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. Changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or pensionable remuneration at retirement could also cause significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities. We operate a number of defined benefit pension plans and, in case of a shortfall, we could be required to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations). This could result in a material adverse effect on our/uni00A0earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe mainly self-insure our hazard risk exposures. Consequently, we could incur significant financial losses from different types of risks that are not insured with third-party insurers.\n\n## Risk description\n\nOur Group insurance companies (wholly owned subsidiaries) provide insurance coverage to Shell subsidiaries and entities in which Shell has an interest. These subsidiaries and entities may also insure a/uni00A0portion of their risk exposures with third parties, but such external insurance would not provide any material coverage in the event of a large-scale safety or environmental incident. Accordingly, in the event of a material incident, we would have to meet our obligations without access to material proceeds from third-party insurers. We have incurred adverse impacts from events, such as Hurricane Ida in 2021. We may, in the future, incur significant losses from different types of hazard risks that are not insured with/uni00A0third-party insurers, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/uni00A0financial condition.\n\nMany of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint arrangements or with associates. This could reduce our degree of control and our ability to identify and manage risks.\n\n## Risk description\n\nWhen we are not the operator, we have less influence and control over the behaviour, performance and/uni00A0operating costs of joint arrangements or associates. Despite having less control, we could still be exposed to the risks associated with these operations, including reputational, litigation (where joint and several liability could apply) and government sanction risks. For example, our partners or members of a/uni00A0joint arrangement or an associate, (particularly local partners in developing countries), may be unable/uni00A0to meet their financial or other obligations to projects, threatening the viability of a given project. Where we are the operator of a joint arrangement, the other partner(s) could still be able to veto or block certain decisions, which could be to our overall detriment. Accordingly, where we have limited influence, we are exposed to operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on our earnings,/uni00A0cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nShell's technology organisation and the relevant business lines work together to determine the content, scope and budget for developing new technology that supports our activities. The new technology is developed to ensure portfolio alignment with Shell's strategic ambitions and deployment commitments. A significant proportion of Shell's technology contributes to our Renewables and Energy Solutions portfolio and our emissions reduction targets. We/uni00A0benefit from key relationships with leading academic research institutes and universities, and from working with start-ups. In our Shell GameChanger programme, we help companies to mature early-stage technologies. In our Shell Ventures scheme, we invest in and partner with start-ups and/uni00A0small and medium-sized enterprises that are in the early/uni00A0stages of developing new technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nA pensions forum chaired by the Chief Financial Officer oversees Shell's input to pension strategy, policy and operation. A risk committee supports the forum in reviewing the results of assurance processes with respect to pension risks. Local trustees manage the funded defined benefit pension plans, and the contributions paid are based on/uni00A0independent actuarial valuations that align with local/uni00A0regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information : See 'Corporate' on page 74.\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe continually assess the safety performance of our operations and make risk mitigation recommendations, where relevant, to keep the risk of an accident as low as/uni00A0possible. Our insurance subsidiaries are adequately capitalised and they may transfer risks to third-party insurers/uni00A0where economical, effective and relevant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information : See 'Other Regulatory and Statutory Information' on page 203.\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nFor every major project where we share control, Shell/uni00A0appoints a Joint Venture Asset Manager, whose responsibility is to manage performance and create and protect value for Shell. The Joint Venture Asset Manager seeks to influence operators and other partners to adapt their practices in order to drive value appropriately and to/uni00A0mitigate identified risks. An annual assurance review assesses how the joint venture's standards and processes align with those of Shell. The Joint Venture Asset Manager follows up on any gaps identified.",

Our commodity trading entities are subject to many regulations including requirements for standards of conduct. The risk of ineffective controls, poor oversight of trading activities, and the risk that traders could deliberately operate outside compliance limits and controls, either individually or as a group, has occurred. This has resulted in losses in the past and may result in further losses in the future. This could have material adverse effects on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nViolations of antitrust and competition laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits.\n\nFurther information : See 'Other Regulatory and/uni00A0Statutory Information' on page 202.\n\n## Risk description\n\nAntitrust and competition laws apply to Shell and its joint arrangements and associates in the vast majority of countries where we do business. Shell and its joint arrangements and associates have been fined for violations of antitrust and competition laws in the past. This includes a number of fines by/uni00A0the European Commission Directorate-General for Competition (DG/uni00A0COMP). Because of DG COMP's fining guidelines, any future conviction of Shell or any of its joint arrangements or associates for violation of EU competition law could potentially result in significantly larger fines and have a material adverse effect on us. Violation of antitrust laws is a criminal offence in many countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. In certain circumstances, directors may receive director disqualification orders. It/uni00A0is/uni00A0also now common for persons or corporations allegedly injured by antitrust violations to sue for damages. Any violation of these laws can harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect/uni00A0on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nViolations of anti-bribery, tax-evasion and anti-money laundering laws carry fines and expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions and civil suits.\n\n## Risk description\n\nAnti-bribery, tax-evasion and anti-money laundering laws apply to Shell, its joint arrangements and associates in all countries where we do business. Shell and its joint arrangements and associates have in the past settled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission regarding violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any violation of anti-bribery, tax-evasion or anti-money laundering laws, including potential violations associated with Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited's investment in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block, could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition. Violations of such laws also could expose us and/or our employees to criminal sanctions, civil/uni00A0suits and other consequences, such as debarment and the revocation of licences.\n\nFurther information : See 'Other Regulatory and/uni00A0Statutory Information' on page 202 and/uni00A0Note/uni00A020 to/uni00A0the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages/uni00A0270-273.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe maintain a trading compliance function managed by/uni00A0a/uni00A0regulated Chief Compliance Officer with adequate resources, a comprehensive governance structure, including mitigating controls (both automated and non-automated), and established reporting lines. Staff receive clear guidance through the organisation's Trading Compliance Manual, a/uni00A0specific compliance website, training modules where completion is monitored, and additional quarterly training sessions. Shell leaders frequently reinforce the importance of managing compliance and conduct risk in the trading organisation.

Staff receive clear guidance that/uni00A0includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, an antitrust-specific website, training modules where completion is monitored and regular messages from Shell leaders on the importance of managing antitrust risks. Staff must understand and comply with the Protect Shell Policy, which explains Shell's position on managing antitrust risks in engagements with parties external to Shell. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we issued guidance to/uni00A0address antitrust risks arising from the disruption to supply chains, including procurement guidance which outlines the risks associated with exchanging information and collaborating with Shell's procurement competitors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information : See 'Our people' on page 118, 'Other Regulatory and Statutory Information' on/uni00A0page 202 and Note 26 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 278-279.\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe maintain an anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion and anti-money laundering (ABC/AML) programme with adequate resources, a comprehensive governance structure/uni00A0and established reporting lines.

Since many countries in which we operate have data protection laws/uni00A0and regulations, Shell has adopted Binding Corporate Rules. This means we apply one consistent standard to data protection, across the Group and globally. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) forms the basis of our Binding Corporate Rules. With data privacy legislation now in force in the/uni00A0USA, the risk of class actions is increased. Class actions after large-scale data breaches are increasingly common.\n\nShell companies are increasingly processing large volumes of personal data as we continue to acquire small companies with relatively large amounts of customer data during the energy transition. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the level of processing of sensitive personal data, for example to/uni00A0confirm the health or vaccination status of our employees and visitors. Some governments require immediate disclosure of information, including sensitive personal data. We must be able to update our guidance to employees quickly, so it includes the relevant points of country legislation on COVID-19.\n\nIn some countries that are key to Shell's business operations, such as China, relevant legislation continues to be amended or introduced. Shell must be able to adapt dynamically to such legislative changes and/uni00A0be capable of updating our internal programmes if necessary. Many countries require mandatory notification of data breaches in certain situations. In these circumstances we might be required to report/uni00A0to affected individuals and regulators in the relevant countries.\n\nNon-compliance with data protection laws could harm individuals and expose us to regulatory investigations. This could result in: fines, which could be up to 4% of global annual turnover if under GDPR; orders to stop processing certain data; harm to our reputation; and loss of the trust of existing and potential customers, stakeholders, governments, and employees. With regard to data breaches, we notified a number of data privacy regulators in 2021 of personal data breaches, and some investigations are still ongoing. To date, no material fines have been imposed, but no assurance can be provided that future breaches would have similar outcomes. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. We could also be subject to/uni00A0litigation from persons or entities allegedly affected by data protection violations.\n\nViolation of data protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals can be/uni00A0imprisoned or fined. Any violation of these laws or harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe maintain a Group-wide data privacy programme, a/uni00A0comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. Shell has had Binding Corporate Rules in place for the last 10 years to ensure consistent levels of data/uni00A0protection across the Group. Staff receive clear guidance which includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and/uni00A0Compliance Manual, a website focusing on data privacy, training modules where completion is monitored, and regular messages from Shell leaders on the importance/uni00A0of managing data privacy risks.\n\nWe monitor new and imminent data privacy legislation and ensure we have a robust impact assessment process aligned with the relevant businesses. We design operations and processes with privacy requirements and build controls into/uni00A0our processes and practices which involve the handling of personal data.\n\nRecognising legal developments, not only in data privacy but also in electronic communications and advertising, we/uni00A0have developed pragmatic guidance on direct and indirect marketing.\n\nWe have and continue to update a Group-wide incident management process designed to immediately identify and/uni00A0remediate data breaches. The process also helps us/uni00A0to/uni00A0comply with country-level requirements for reporting breaches. We continue to address challenges with compliance in data-heavy companies controlled by Shell but not yet fully integrated into our systems.\n\nThere is a requirement for newly acquired companies to become compliant with our Binding Corporate Rules within three years of acquisition and there is currently a multi-year programme under way to achieve compliance. IT remediation work remains a priority in such companies, as/uni00A0does the strengthening of programmes to support data/uni00A0privacy compliance.

For example, the EU and the USA continue to impose comprehensive sanctions on countries and territories such as Syria, North Korea and Crimea, and continue to adopt targeted restrictions and prohibitions on certain transactions in countries such as Venezuela and Russia. The USA continues to have comprehensive sanctions against Iran and Cuba. The EU and some nations continue to maintain targeted sanctions against Iran. The EU and the USA introduced sectoral sanctions against Venezuela in 2017, which the USA expanded in 2018 and 2019. The US sanctions primarily target the government of Venezuela and the oil industry.\n\nIn 2014, the EU and the USA imposed additional restrictions and controls directed at defined oil and gas/uni00A0activities in Russia. These remain in force. The USA introduced further restrictions regarding Russia in/uni00A02017, expanding them in 2018. In February 2022, countries around the world began imposing additional sanctions and export controls against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine including, regional trade bans, designations of entities (including Russian banks and state-owned entities) and individuals as/uni00A0Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Parties (SDNs), and restrictions on access by Russia to/uni00A0financial systems. Export controls have also been introduced targeting Russian defence, aerospace, and maritime sectors. More sanctions and export controls are expected. A number of countries have also implemented new sanctions against Belarus for its role in the Russian invasion.\n\nMany other nations are also adopting trade compliance programmes similar to those administered by/uni00A0the EU and the USA. Since January 2021, the UK has maintained a legal framework for trade compliance that is separate and distinct from those of the EU and USA.\n\nAbiding by all the laws and regulations on trade compliance and sanctions can sometimes be complex and challenging because of factors such as: the expansion of sanctions; the frequent addition of prohibited parties; the number of markets in which we operate; the risk of differences in how jurisdictions apply sanctions; and the large number of transactions we process. Shell has voluntarily self-disclosed potential violations of sanctions in the past. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased trade compliance risks, because of factors such as growing state involvement in business dealings, the need to maintain and develop business opportunities and cross-border movement of goods and technologies, and the increasing likelihood that counterparties will change ownership as the economic crisis continues.\n\nAny violation of sanctions could lead to loss of import or export privileges and significant penalties on/uni00A0or/uni00A0prosecution of Shell or its employees. This could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nInvestors should also consider the following, which could limit shareholder remedies.\n\n## OTHER (generally applicable to an investment in securities)\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association determine the jurisdiction for shareholder disputes. This could limit shareholder remedies.\n\n## Risk description\n\nOur Articles of Association generally require that all disputes between our shareholders in such capacity and the Company or our subsidiaries (or our Directors or former Directors), or between the Company and our Directors or former Directors, be exclusively resolved by arbitration in The Hague, the Netherlands, under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. Our Articles of Association also provide that, if this provision is to be determined invalid or unenforceable for any/uni00A0reason, the dispute could only be brought before the courts of England and Wales. Accordingly, the ability of shareholders to obtain monetary or other relief, including in/uni00A0respect of securities law claims, could be determined in accordance with these provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How this risk is managed\n\nWe continue to develop and maintain a trade compliance programme with adequate resources, robust screening protocols, a comprehensive governance structure and established reporting lines. Staff receive clear guidance, which includes requirements in Shell's Ethics and Compliance Manual, a specific website for trade compliance, training modules where completion is monitored and regular messages from Shell leaders on/uni00A0the/uni00A0importance of managing trade compliance risks. The/uni00A0effectiveness of the trade compliance programme is/uni00A0assessed annually (or more frequently if necessary) and/uni00A0we are continually seeking ways to improve.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we promote an increased focus on compliance and assurance. For example, in Trading and Supply we promote a particular focus on compliance with trade controls in high-risk areas such as port agency, inspections and terminal operations.\n\nt",

With non-controlling interest included, income/(loss) for the period in 2021 was $20,630 million, compared with a loss of $21,534 million in 2020. After current cost/uni00A0of supplies adjustment, total segment earnings in 2021 were $17,482/uni00A0million, compared with a loss of $19,701 million in 2020.\n\nEarnings on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings) exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts, after making allowance for the tax effect. The purchase price of volumes sold in the period is based on the current cost of supplies during the same period, rather than on the historic cost calculated on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. When oil prices are decreasing, CCS earnings are likely to be higher than earnings calculated on a FIFO basis and, when prices are increasing, CCS earnings are likely to be lower than earnings calculated on a FIFO basis.\n\nIntegrated Gas earnings in 2021 were $6,340 million, compared with a loss of $6,278 million in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by lower impairment charges, higher realised prices for oil, LNG and gas, higher gains on sale of assets and favourable tax movements. This was partly offset by higher losses due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and higher operating expenditure. See 'Integrated Gas' on/uni00A0pages/uni00A045-49.\n\nUpstream earnings in 2021 were $9,694 million, compared with a loss of/uni00A0$10,785 million in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by higher realised oil and gas prices, lower impairment charges and favourable tax/uni00A0movements. This was partly offset by higher losses related to fair value accounting of commodity derivatives. See/uni00A0'Upstream' on pages 50-56./uni00A0\n\nOil Products earnings in 2021 were $2,664 million, compared with a/uni00A0loss/uni00A0of $494 million in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by lower/uni00A0impairment charges and higher marketing volumes and oil sands/uni00A0margins. This was partly offset by lower contributions from trading/uni00A0and optimisation, higher operating expenditure and unfavourable/uni00A0tax/uni00A0movements. See 'Oil Products' on pages 65-70.\n\nChemicals earnings in 2021 were $1,390 million, compared with $808/uni00A0million in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by higher margins in/uni00A0base chemicals and intermediates as well as favourable tax movements. This was partly offset by higher impairment charges and operating expenditure. See 'Chemicals' on pages 71-73.\n\nCorporate segment earnings in 2021 were an expense of $2,606 million, compared with $2,952 million in 2020. The lower expense was mainly driven by lower net interest expenses and favourable foreign exchange movements. See 'Corporate' on page 74.",

Management's priorities for applying Shell's cash are base capital expenditure to sustain our strategy, progressive dividend growth of around 4% annually, AA credit metrics through the cycle, and/uni00A0additional shareholder distributions (20-30% of cash flow from operations). The fourth priority is disciplined and measured capital expenditure growth and continued balance sheet strengthening.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nShell generated cash flow from operations of $45.1 billion, including a/uni00A0negative impact from working capital of $10.4 billion, and free cash flow of $40.3 billion in 2021, aided by the improving global macro environment and divestments. (For more information on free cash flow see/uni00A0'Non-GAAP measures reconciliations' on pages 326-329.) Net debt decreased to $52.6 billion at December 31, 2021, (December 31, 2020: $75.4 billion). Gearing fell to 23.1% at December 31, 2021, compared with 32.2% at December 31, 2020, as increases in equity and cash flow generation reduced net debt. Note 15 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 257 provides information on our debt arrangements, including net debt and gearing definitions.\n\n## LIQUIDITY\n\n- \u25a0 a $10 billion global commercial paper (CP) programme, with maturities not exceeding 270 days;\n\nWe satisfy our funding and working capital requirements from the cash generated from our operations, the issuance of debt and divestments. In/uni00A02021, access to the international debt capital markets remained strong, with/uni00A0our debt principally financed from these markets through central debt/uni00A0programmes consisting of:\n\n- \u25a0 a $10 billion US CP programme, with maturities not exceeding 397/uni00A0days;\n- \u25a0 an unlimited US universal shelf (US shelf) registration.\n- \u25a0 an unlimited Euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme (also referred/uni00A0to as the Multi-Currency Debt Securities Programme); and\n\nAll these CP, EMTN and US shelf issuances are issued by Shell International Finance B.V., the issuance company for Shell, with its/uni00A0debt/uni00A0being guaranteed by Shell plc (the Company).\n\nWe also maintain committed credit facilities. The core facilities were extended in December 2021. Of the $10 billion total facility, $0.08 billion matured in 2021, $1.92 billion matures in 2022, $0.32 billion in 2025 and $7.68 billion in 2026. This remained fully undrawn at December 31, 2021. These core facilities and internally available liquidity provide back-up coverage for our CP programmes. In April 2020, to increase liquidity amid/uni00A0COVID-19-related uncertainties, Shell entered into a dual-currency $7.2 billion and \u20ac4.4 billion one-year revolving credit facility, with two six-month extension options at our discretion. This facility remained undrawn and expired at the end of the first year in April 2021. Other/uni00A0than/uni00A0certain borrowing by local subsidiaries, we do not have/uni00A0any/uni00A0other/uni00A0committed credit facilities.\n\nOur total debt decreased by $18.9 billion to $89.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The total debt excluding leases matures as follows: 7% in 2022; 6%/uni00A0in 2023; 7% in 2024; 10% in 2025; and 69% in 2026 and beyond. The portion of debt maturing in 2022 is expected to be repaid from a/uni00A0combination of cash balances, cash generated from operations, divestments and the issuance of new debt.\n\nIn 2021, we issued $1.5 billion of bonds under our US shelf registration. All/uni00A0CP outstanding was repaid within the year with no additional issuance. Additionally in 2021, we redeemed $4.5 billion of USD bonds, bringing forward maturities of certain bonds maturing before the end of 2025. We/uni00A0believe our working capital is sufficient for current requirements.\n\nWhile our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions, such as foreign withholding taxes on the transfer of funds in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances, such restrictions are not expected to have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations.\n\n## MARKET RISK AND CREDIT RISK\n\nWe are affected by the global macroeconomic environment as well as financial and commodity market conditions. This exposes us to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk, market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk) and credit risk. See 'Risk/uni00A0factors' on pages 29 and Note 20 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 268-273. The size and scope of our businesses require a/uni00A0robust financial control framework and effective management of/uni00A0our/uni00A0various risk exposures.\n\nWe use various financial instruments for managing exposure to commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate movements. Our/uni00A0treasury and trading operations are highly centralised and seek to/uni00A0manage credit exposures associated with our substantial cash, commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate positions. Our portfolio of/uni00A0cash investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one/uni00A0instrument, country or counterparty. The use of external derivative instruments is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control/uni00A0and reporting systems. Credit risk policies are in place to ensure/uni00A0that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness, and include credit analysis and monitoring of customers/uni00A0against counterparty credit limits. Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage credit risk. Management believes it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.\n\n## PENSION COMMITMENTS\n\nWe have substantial pension commitments, the funding of which is subject to capital market risks (see 'Risk factors' on page 30). We address key pension risks in a number of ways. Principal among these is the Pensions Forum, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, which oversees Shell's input to pension strategy, policy and operation. A risk committee supports the/uni00A0forum in reviewing the results of assurance processes in respect of pensions risks. In general, local trustees manage the funded defined benefit pension plans, with contributions paid based on independent actuarial valuations in accordance with local regulations. Our total employer contributions were $0.9 billion in 2021 and are estimated to be/uni00A0$0.9 billion in 2022.

        "page_content": "## STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\n\nCash flow from operating activities in 2021 was an inflow of $45.1 billion, compared with $34.1 billion in 2020, mainly due to higher earnings, partly offset by unfavourable working capital movements of $10.4 billion (compared with favourable working capital movements of $4.6 billion in/uni00A02020). The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2020, compared with $42.2 billion in 2019, was mainly due to lower earnings.\n\nCash flow from investing activities in 2021 was an outflow of $4.8 billion, compared with an outflow of $13.3 billion in 2020. The decreased cash/uni00A0outflow was mainly due to higher proceeds from sale of property, plant/uni00A0and equipment in 2021, including the divestment of our Permian business in the USA. The decreased cash outflow in 2020 compared with $15.8/uni00A0billion in 2019 was mainly due to lower capital expenditure in 2020.\n\nCash flow from financing activities in 2021 was an outflow of $34.6 billion, compared with outflows of $7.2 billion in 2020 and $35.2/uni00A0billion in/uni00A02019, due to net repayment of debt of $19.7/uni00A0billion (2020: $5.6 billion net issuance; 2019: $3.4/uni00A0billion net repayment), and higher repurchases of/uni00A0shares of $2.9 billion (2020: $1.7 billion; 2019: $10.2 billion).\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $37.0 billion at December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: $31.8 billion; December 31, 2019: $18.1 billion).\n\n## CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe most significant factors affecting our cash flow from operating activities are earnings, which are mainly impacted by: realised prices for/uni00A0crude oil, natural gas and LNG, production levels of crude oil, natural gas and LNG, chemicals, refining and marketing margins; and movements in working capital.\n\nThe impact on earnings from changes in market prices depends on: the extent to which contractual arrangements are tied to market prices; the dynamics of production-sharing contracts; the existence of agreements with governments or state-owned oil and gas companies that have limited sensitivity to crude oil and natural gas prices; tax impacts; and the extent to which changes in commodity prices flow through into operating expenses. Changes in benchmark prices of crude oil and natural gas in any particular period provide only a broad indicator of changes in our Integrated Gas and Upstream earnings in that period. Changes in any one of a range of factors, derived from either within the industry or the broader economic environment, can influence refining and marketing margins. The precise impact of any such changes depends on how the oil markets respond to them. The market response is affected by factors such as: whether the change affects all crude oil types or only a specific grade; regional and global crude oil and refined products inventories; and the collective speed of response of refiners and product marketers in adjusting their operations. As a result, margins fluctuate from region to region and from period to period.\n\n## Cash flow information [A]\n\n|                                                                         | 2021     | 2020     | $ billion 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------------|\n| Cash flow from operating activities excluding working capital movements |          |          |                  |\n| Integrated Gas                                                          | 18.3     | 10.8     | 14.8             |\n| Upstream                                                                | 22.6     | 9.8      | 19.9             |\n| Oil Products                                                            | 12.0     | 7. 0     | 10.7             |\n| Chemicals                                                               | 3.3      | 1.8      | 1.7              |\n| Corporate                                                               | (0.7)    | 0.1      | (0.3)            |\n| Total                                                                   | 55.5     | 29.5     | 47. 0            |\n| (Increase)/decrease in inventories                                      | ( 7. 3 ) | 4.5      | (2.6)            |\n| (Increase)/decrease in current receivables                              | (20.6)   | 9.6      | (0.9)            |\n| Increase/(decrease) in current payables                                 | 1 7. 5   | (9. 5)   | (1.2)            |\n| (Increase)/decrease in working capital                                  | (10.4)   | 4.6      | (4.8)            |\n| Cash flow from operating activities                                     | 45.1     | 34.1     | 42.2             |\n| Cash flow from investing activities                                     | (4.8)    | (13.3)   | (15.8)           |\n| Cash flow from financing activities                                     | (34.7)   | ( 7. 2 ) | (35.2)           |\n| Currency translation differences relating to cash and cash equivalents  | (0.5)    | 0.2      | 0.1              |\n| Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents                        | 5.1      | 13.8     | (8.7)            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the year                  | 31.8     | 18.1     | 26.7             |\n| Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year                        | 37. 0    | 31.8     | 18.1             |\n\n- [A] See the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 232.\n\nt",

In total, Shell targets the distribution of 20-30% of/uni00A0its cash flow from operations to shareholders. Shell may choose to return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share/uni00A0buybacks.\n\nWhen setting the level of shareholder remuneration, the Board looks at a range of factors, including the macro environment, the underlying business earnings and cash flows of Shell Group, the current balance sheet, future investment and divestment plans and existing commitments. We returned $6.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends in 2021.\n\nThe fourth quarter 2021 interim dividend of $0.24 per share will be payable to shareholders on the register at February 18, 2022. See Note 24 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 277. The Board expects that the first quarter 2022 interim dividend will increase by around 4% compared with the fourth quarter 2021 interim dividend, to/uni00A0$0.25 per share.\n\n## PURCHASES OF SECURITIES\n\nOn July 29, 2021, the Company announced the start of a share buyback programme of $2 billion, which was completed in November 2021. Subsequently, on December 1, 2021, the Company announced the first $1.5 billion tranche of a buyback programme to return $7 billion of proceeds from the divestment of its Permian assets. This tranche was completed in January 2022. In February 2022, share buybacks of $8.5/uni00A0billion for the first half of 2022 were announced. These included the/uni00A0remaining $5.5 billion of the Permian divestment proceeds that had/uni00A0been allocated for share buybacks.",

As at December 31, 2021, 653 million ordinary shares could still be repurchased under the current AGM authority. The purpose of the share repurchases in 2021 was to reduce the/uni00A0issued share capital of the Company.\n\nA new resolution will be proposed at the 2022 AGM to renew the authority for the Company to purchase its own share capital, up to/uni00A0specified limits, for a further year.

Certain condensed financial information in respect of the Trust is given below. See 'Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust Financial Statements' on pages 316-319.\n\nThe Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited and BG Group Limited have each issued a dividend access share to Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited (the Trustee). For the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Trust/uni00A0recorded income before tax of \u00a32,201 million, \u00a32,777 million and \u00a35,484 million respectively. In each period, this reflected the amount of/uni00A0dividends payable on the dividend access shares. Dividends are/uni00A0also/uni00A0classified as unclaimed where amounts have not cleared recipient bank accounts.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Trust had total equity of \u00a3nil (December 31, 2020: \u00a3nil; December 31, 2019: \u00a3nil), reflecting assets of \u00a37 million (December 31, 2020: \u00a37 million; December 31, 2019: \u00a33 million) and\n\nunclaimed dividends of \u00a37 million (December 31, 2020: \u00a37 million; December 31, 2019: \u00a33 million). The Trust only records a liability for an/uni00A0unclaimed dividend, to the extent that dividend cheque payments have/uni00A0not been presented within 12 months, have expired or have been returned/uni00A0unpresented.\n\nOn January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through assimilation of each A share and each B share into one ordinary share of/uni00A0the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or/uni00A0dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on/uni00A0dividends on/uni00A0A/uni00A0shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the/uni00A0ordinary shares following the assimilation.\n\nIn relation to the assimilation of the Company's Class A and B shares, the/uni00A0Trust will continue in existence for the foreseeable future to facilitate the payment of unclaimed dividend liabilities for B shareholders, until these are either claimed or forfeited in line with the terms outlined.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## MARKET OVERVIEW\n\nWe maintain a large business portfolio across an integrated value chain and are exposed to crude oil, natural gas, hydrocarbon product and chemical prices (see 'Risk factors' on page 22). This diversified portfolio helps us mitigate the impact of price volatility. Our annual planning cycle and periodic portfolio reviews aim to ensure that our levels of capital investment and operating expenses are appropriate in the context of a volatile price environment. We test the resilience of our projects and other opportunities against a range of crude oil, natural gas, oil product and chemical prices and costs. We also aim to maintain a strong balance sheet to provide resilience against weak market prices.\n\n## GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nAfter a sharp economic deceleration related to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the global economy has experienced a strong but uneven recovery in 2021. In its World Economic Outlook of January 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that global growth for 2021 has reached 5.9% - its strongest post-recession pace in 80 years. This recovery is uneven and largely reflects sharp rebounds in some major economies, most notably the USA and China, owing to substantial government policy support. In many emerging market and developing economies, inequalities in access to vaccines led to higher infection rates. This combined with a partial withdrawal of policy support have offset some of the benefits of strengthening external demand and rising commodity prices. Early policy support and vaccinations proved effective/uni00A0at mitigating some of the adverse economic and health impacts of COVID-19 during 2021. However, rising energy prices and supply disruptions have also resulted in broad-based inflation in the second half/uni00A0of 2021, notably in the USA and many emerging market and developing economies.\n\nThe global economic prospects remain highly uncertain. The world remains vulnerable to COVID-19 and the pandemic is continuing, owing to/uni00A0unequal access to vaccines, the reluctance of some to get vaccinated and the emergence of more infectious new variants such as Omicron. Socioeconomic challenges abound, including rising inflation, subdued employment growth, supply chain problems, setbacks to educational attainment, and climate change.\n\nConfronted with such complex challenges, policy choice is difficult because a sharp increase in global debt levels during the pandemic has/uni00A0left limited room for manoeuvre. There is also an upside, because the pandemic has induced greater automation and workplace transformation, which could accelerate productivity growth. Structural investment plans implemented in Europe and the USA could also lift the growth outlook.\n\n## GLOBAL PRICES, DEMAND AND SUPPLY\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the main crude oil and natural gas price markers to which we are exposed:\n\n## Oil and gas average industry prices [A]\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n| Brent ($/b)                                   |   71 |   42 |   64 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| West Texas Intermediate ($/b)                 |   68 |   39 | 57   |\n| Henry Hub ($/MMBtu)                           |    4 |    2 |  2.5 |\n| EU TTF ($/MMBtu)                              |   16 |    3 |  5   |\n| Japan Customs-cleared Crude ($/b) -  3 months |   60 |   51 | 70   |\n\n## CRUDE OIL\n\nBrent crude oil, an international benchmark, rebounded in 2021, supported by stronger demand and moderate supply growth. Brent traded between $50 per barrel (/b) and $86/b in 2021, ending the year/uni00A0at around $77/b and averaging $71/b for the whole year. This/uni00A0was/uni00A0about 70% higher than in 2020.\n\nGlobal oil product demand rose by 5.6 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2021 to 97.4 million b/d, after a sharp drop of around 8.5 million b/d in 2020, according to the IEA. The rebound was supported by successful vaccine roll-outs, especially in developed economies such as the USA, UK/uni00A0and EU. Road mobility has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, with COVID-19 travel restrictions being lifted and more people switching from public transport to cars. Air travel has begun to recover, but is still around 20-30% below pre-pandemic levels. This is probably attributable to remaining cross-border travel restrictions and public hesitancy about air travel during a global pandemic. Mirroring the broad economic recovery, demand for naphtha, LPG and ethane also picked up.\n\nGlobal oil production has started to rise gradually as demand recovers. Annual growth in 2021 was about 1.5 million b/d, with OPEC+ making up/uni00A0most of the growth. From the second quarter of 2021, OPEC+ has been gradually unwinding the production cuts it implemented in 2020, with full unwinding expected by the second half of 2022. Outside OPEC+, US light tight oil (LTO) has dominated the growth, supported by the rebounding oil price. The number of US rotary oil rigs increased by more than 160% by December 2021, from the record low seen in August 2020. This, though, remained only around 60% of the 2019 average.\n\nThe OPEC+ production cuts have enabled a quick rundown of a record global oil inventory. The industry stock of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies, which had reached more than 3,200 million barrels by the middle of 2020, fell to around 2,760 million barrels by the end of 2021, a seven-year low.\n\nThe oil price largely followed an upward trend for most of the year. The/uni00A0Brent daily price passed the $70/b mark in June and $80/b in October. The strong price move reflected a tight market balance, resulting from modest supply growth and robust demand recovery. It also reflected the broad inflationary pricing environment for energy commodities such as/uni00A0coal and natural gas, in a period of economic recovery and supply chain challenges.\n\nThe price rally was at times interrupted by restrictions introduced in response to new waves of COVID-19, especially those caused by the Delta/uni00A0variant in the summer and Omicron towards the end of the year. In/uni00A0the final few weeks of 2021, the Omicron variant triggered the sharpest sell-off since April 2020, with Brent retreating almost $10/b in a single day at the height of the sell-off. Brent started regaining its strength towards the end of December, as a severe Omicron-induced demand disruption failed to materialise and supply concerns once again prevailed.",

        "page_content": "Looking forward, demand uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain a key uncertainty affecting the recovery of the global crude market. This is particularly so for aviation fuel which has been the most impacted by travel restrictions. But the extent of new COVID-related demand disruption could be moderated by booster programmes and the/uni00A0greater availability of more effective treatments for the virus.\n\nAt the same time, there has been increasing evidence of supply side risks./uni00A0Upstream investment worldwide has slowed considerably during the/uni00A0pandemic. As a result, OPEC's excess capacity will be declining. Meanwhile, US light tight oil is expected to be facing continued capital discipline pressures, restraining its growth. These factors will constrain the/uni00A0global fast response supply capacity to manage demand and supply/uni00A0disruptions, which may lead to price upside and volatilities.\n\n## NATURAL GAS\n\nGlobal demand for natural gas rose by an estimated 4.6% in 2021, after/uni00A0the COVID-19 pandemic caused consumption to decline by around 1.2% in 2020, according to the IEA. The 2021 rate represents a return to/uni00A0around the historical norms of growth for gas, and is roughly the same/uni00A0as the pre-pandemic growth rate of 2019. The revival of economic growth/uni00A0underpinned the industrial uptake of gas, especially in China. Underperformance of hydroelectric output in China and South America as/uni00A0well as weak renewables generation in Europe drove incremental power demand for gas./uni00A0Colder-than-normal winters and hotter-than-usual summers also produced higher-than-expected demand for gas from commercial and residential users. Reduced supply from a number of sources led/uni00A0to/uni00A0shortages and record high prices for gas and LNG globally.\n\nLNG imports were up 6.0% in 2021 after only a minor increase in 2020./uni00A0The global LNG supply complex experienced upstream production deficits in 2021. Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, Peru and Norway were down a combined 12 million tonnes, or 32%, from 2020. The addition of/uni00A0new liquefaction capacity was also limited in 2021, although utilisation of/uni00A0projects that started in 2020 improved, which provided some support for supply growth.\n\nEuropean gas prices rose to unprecedented levels by the middle of 2021, with the average Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price more than five times that of 2020. The TTF price reached a peak of almost $60 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). TTF and European spot gas hub prices broke above oil parity by the third quarter and continued well above that level for the rest of the year. Prices were supported by an/uni00A0extended heating season that left gas storage at a deficit coming out/uni00A0of/uni00A0winter and prompted fears of scarcity as indigenous production slumped and pipeline and LNG imports were restrained. Record coal and/uni00A0carbon prices also contributed to the price surge.\n\nAsian spot LNG prices, as reflected by the Japan Korea Marker (JKM), responded to the tight European market conditions with bids at a premium to TTF for most of the year. This was in order to secure LNG supplies for China and South Korea, where demand was higher than expected. Average JKM prices ended the year up more than 300% from 2020 and/uni00A0up more than 200% from 2019. Long-term contracts indexed to oil/uni00A0prices tracked the wider crude complex upward during the year but/uni00A0did/uni00A0not increase at the same rate as spot gas and LNG prices.\n\nStrong Asian and European prices incentivised full US LNG export production. This helped strengthen Henry Hub cash prices to an average of $3.81 per MMBtu for 2021, up more than 90% year-on-year. After trading in a narrow range of around $3 per MMBtu for the first half of 2021, Henry Hub prices rose above $5 per MMBtu by the end of the third/uni00A0quarter. The upstream investment cuts of 2020 continued into 2021. Production did not keep pace with rebounding demand, heightened by/uni00A0a/uni00A0combined 34% increase in LNG and Mexico pipeline exports from/uni00A0a/uni00A0year ago.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect that the high gas prices in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific will go down to more normal levels. This is because we anticipate that global gas inventories will eventually replenish as production recovers in response to the current elevated price levels. Price developments, though, are highly uncertain.\n\nWe believe gas and LNG prices in Europe and Asia will be increasingly influenced by European gas storage levels and by competition with Asia for LNG imports, particularly flexible supply from the USA. Overall LNG supply is expected to recover and increase as new liquefaction capacity is/uni00A0added in the USA in 2022. But the global LNG market will remain structurally tight as a relatively small amount of incremental supply will come to market over the coming years.\n\nIn the USA, Henry Hub prices are expected to moderate from 2021 as/uni00A0production increases in response to higher gas prices as well as oil prices (which support associated gas production in the Permian basin). But/uni00A0upward pressures on gas prices are also expected as LNG exports, Mexico pipeline exports and economic growth stimulate demand.\n\n## CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE ASSUMPTIONS\n\nOur ability to deliver competitive returns and pursue commercial opportunities ultimately depends on the accuracy of our price assumptions (see 'Risk factors' on page 22). We use a rigorous assessment of short-, medium- and long-term market uncertainties to determine what ranges of/uni00A0future crude oil and natural gas prices to use in project and portfolio evaluations. Market uncertainties include, for example, future economic conditions, geopolitics, actions by major resource holders, production costs, technological progress and the balance of supply and demand.

        "page_content": "## MARKET OVERVIEW continued\n\nGross refining margins improved during 2021, especially during the second and third quarters. This is because demand for oil products recovered significantly as economies rebounded and transport use increased with the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions. Demand for kerosene for aviation remained below pre-pandemic levels because varying levels of international travel restrictions remained in place in 2021. Despite the Omicron variant of COVID-19, demand recovery continued during the fourth quarter.\n\nIndustry utilisation showed some recovery, but in 2021 there were further/uni00A0announcements that refineries would fully or partially close on/uni00A0a/uni00A0permanent basis. Construction of new capacity continued during the/uni00A0year, especially in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nRefining margins for the next few years are expected to be supported by demand returning to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. The continued addition of new refinery capacity, often integrated with chemicals production, will put downward pressure on margins during the next few years.\n\n## PETROCHEMICAL MARGINS\n\nCracker industry margins [A]\n\n|                                    |   2021 |   2020 |   $/tonne 2019 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| North East/South East Asia naphtha |    229 |    362 |            302 |\n| Western Europe naphtha             |    597 |    513 |            528 |\n| US ethane                          |    692 |    433 |            440 |\n\nCracker margins were volatile in 2021. This was because of supply interruptions and demand increases as COVID-19 lockdown restrictions eased. Overall margins were higher than in 2020, except in Asia. Chinese demand recovered quickly from the pandemic, but petrochemical supply was constrained by power restrictions that affected manufacturing centres, logistics issues within China because of COVID-19, and global logistics issues. Asia cracker margins were down slightly from 2020 because of the balance of supply and demand, and rising prices for energy, crude oil and naphtha feedstock. US ethane cracker margins were/uni00A0supported by disruption due to winter storm Uri in February and March and to a lesser extent by interruptions caused by Hurricane Ida in August and September. West European cracker margins were supported by the US weather events and strong domestic demand, which offset rising crude and natural gas prices for the majority of 2021.\n\nThe outlook for petrochemical margins in 2022 and beyond depends on/uni00A0feedstock costs and the balance of supply and demand. Demand for/uni00A0petrochemicals will be affected by the spread of COVID-19 as new variants emerge, and the extent of recovery from the pandemic. Supply of/uni00A0petrochemicals will depend on the net capacity effect of new builds and plant closures (taking into account any delays or cancellations in building new plants or closing old ones). Product prices reflect the prices of/uni00A0raw materials, which are closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. The balance of all these factors will drive margins.\n\nThe statements in this 'Market overview' section, including those related/uni00A0to our price forecasts, are forward-looking statements based on/uni00A0management's current expectations and certain material assumptions and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or/uni00A0implied herein.

It markets and trades natural gas, LNG, power and carbon-emission rights, and LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels./uni00A0\n\n## BUSINESS CONDITIONS\n\nGlobal demand for natural gas rose by an estimated 4.6% in 2021, after/uni00A0the COVID-19 pandemic caused consumption to decline by around 1.2% in 2020, according to the IEA. The 2021 rate represents a return to/uni00A0around the historical norms of growth for gas, and is roughly the same/uni00A0as the pre-pandemic growth rate of 2019. The revival of economic growth underpinned the industrial uptake of gas, especially in China. Underperformance of hydroelectric output in China and South America as/uni00A0well as weak renewables generation in Europe drove incremental power demand for gas. Colder-than-normal winters and hotter-thanusual/uni00A0summers also produced higher-than-expected demand for gas from/uni00A0commercial and residential users. Reduced supply from a number of sources led/uni00A0to/uni00A0shortages and record high prices for gas and LNG globally.\n\nLNG imports were up 6.0% in 2021 after only a minor increase in 2020./uni00A0The global LNG supply complex experienced upstream production deficits in 2021. Nigeria, Trinidad and Tobago, Peru and Norway were down a combined 12 million tonnes, or 32%, from 2020. The addition of/uni00A0new liquefaction capacity was also limited in 2021, although utilisation of/uni00A0projects that started in 2020 improved, which provided some support for supply growth.\n\nEuropean gas prices rose to unprecedented levels by the middle of 2021, with the average Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price more than five times that of 2020.

Record coal and carbon prices also contributed to the price surge.\n\nAsian spot LNG prices, as reflected by the Japan Korea Marker (JKM), responded to the tight European market conditions with bids at a premium to TTF for most of the year. This was in order to secure LNG supplies for/uni00A0China and South Korea, where demand was higher than expected. Average JKM prices ended the year up more than 300% from 2020 and up more than 200% from 2019. Long-term contracts indexed to oil prices tracked the wider crude complex upward during the year but did not increase at the same rate as spot gas and LNG prices.\n\nIn the USA, Henry Hub prices are expected to moderate from 2021 as/uni00A0production increases in response to higher gas prices as well as oil prices (which support associated gas production in the Permian basin). But/uni00A0upward pressures on gas prices are also expected as LNG exports, Mexico pipeline exports and economic growth stimulate demand.\n\n- See 'Market overview' on pages 42-44.\n\n## PRODUCTION AVAILABLE FOR SALE\n\nIn 2021, our production was 344 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or/uni00A0942 thousand boe per day (boe/d), compared with 333 million boe, or/uni00A0911 thousand boe/d in 2020. Natural gas production was 83% of total production in 2021 and 2020. In 2021, natural gas production increased by 3% compared with 2020. This was mainly because of the restart of production at the Prelude floating LNG facility in Australia, and the effects of production-sharing contracts, partly offset by field decline. Liquids production increased by 6% driven mainly by the restart of production at/uni00A0the Prelude facility.\n\nt",

This decrease was mainly due to lower LNG/uni00A0liquefaction volumes and lower purchases from third parties.\n\nThrough our Shell Energy organisation, we market a portion of our share of equity production of LNG and sell and market LNG volumes around\n\n## INTEGRATED GAS DATA TABLE\n\nLNG liquefaction volumes\n\nMillion tonnes\n\n|                     | 2021   |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Australia           | 13.1   |   11.8 |   12.5 |\n| Brunei              | 1.4    |    1.6 |    1.6 |\n| Egypt               | 0.3    |    0.2 |    0.4 |\n| Nigeria             | 4.3    |    5.3 |    5.3 |\n| Oman                | 2.5    |    2.5 |    2.6 |\n| Peru                | 0.6    |    0.9 |    0.9 |\n| Qatar               | 2.4    |    2.4 |    2.5 |\n| Russia              | 2.8    |    3.1 |    3   |\n| Trinidad and Tobago | 3.6    |    5.4 |    6.7 |\n| Other               | -      |    0.2 |    0.2 |\n| Total               | 31.0   |   33.2 |   35.6 |\n\n## EARNINGS 2021-2020\n\nSegment earnings in 2021 were $6,340 million, which included a net/uni00A0charge of $2,417 million. The net charge comprised losses of $2,641/uni00A0million due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives, impairment charges of $594 million and provisions for onerous contracts of $217 million, partly offset by gains on sale of assets of $1,086 million.\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 were a loss of $6,278 million, which included a/uni00A0net charge of $10,661 million. The net charge reflected impairment charges of $9,282 million mainly reflecting revisions to mid- and long-term price outlook assumptions and primarily related to the Queensland Curtis LNG and Prelude floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) operations in Australia. It also comprised a net charge of $969 million due to the fair value accounting of commodity derivatives and a charge of $607 million related to onerous contract provisions.\n\nExcluding the net charges described above, segment earnings were $8,757 million in 2021 compared with $4,383 million in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by higher realised prices for oil, LNG and gas,/uni00A0favourable tax movements and higher volumes. This was partly offset/uni00A0by higher operating expenditure.\n\n## PRIOR YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY\n\nOur earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2019, can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 47) and Form 20-F (page 31) for/uni00A0the year ended December 31, 2020 as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US Securities and Exchange/uni00A0Commission, respectively.\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCash capital expenditure in 2021 was $5,767 million, compared with/uni00A0$4,301 million in 2020. The increase was mainly due to growth\n\nin/uni00A0our/uni00A0Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. Our cash capital expenditure is expected to be around $8 billion in 2022.\n\n## PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 In March 2021, we completed the sale of a 26.25% interest in the Queensland Curtis LNG Common Facilities to Global Infrastructure Partners Australia for $2.5 billion.\n\nKey portfolio events included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 In June 2021, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, our 50:50 joint venture with EDF Renewables North America, was awarded rights to provide 1.5 GW of renewable offshore wind power to New Jersey, USA.\n- \u25a0 In July 2021, we started production in Block 5C in the East Coast Marine Area off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago.\n- \u25a0 In July 2021, we signed a memorandum of understanding with Deutsche Telekom to advance digital innovation as both companies accelerate their transitions to net-zero emissions.\n- \u25a0 In December 2021, we completed the acquisition of Savion LLC, a/uni00A0large/uni00A0utility-scale solar and energy storage developer in the USA.\n- \u25a0 In January 2022, we announced that Shell and ScottishPower had won/uni00A0bids to develop 5 GW of floating wind power in the UK.\n- \u25a0 In December 2021, we signed a gas concession agreement for Block 10 in Oman.\n- \u25a0 In January 2022, we started operations at the power-to-hydrogen electrolyser in China.\n- \u25a0 In February 2022, Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind, our 50:50 joint venture with EDF Renewables North America, became the provisional winner of acreage in the New York Bight offshore wind auction, USA.\n- \u25a0 In February 2022, we completed the acquisition of online energy retailer Powershop Australia which was announced in November 2021.\n- \u25a0 In February 2022, we announced our intention to exit our joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities, including our 27.5% interest in Sakhalin-2 and involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. For/uni00A0more information, see Note 32 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 283.\n\nthe/uni00A0world through our hubs in the UK, UAE and Singapore. Shell has term sales contracts for the majority of our LNG liquefaction and term purchase contracts. We are able to maximise the income we generate from our LNG cargoes through our shipping network, regasification terminals and/uni00A0ability to purchase and deliver LNG spot cargoes from third parties. For/uni00A0example, if one customer does not need a scheduled cargo, we can/uni00A0deliver it to another customer who is in need. Similarly, if a customer needs an additional cargo not available from our production facilities, we/uni00A0can contract with third parties to deliver the additional cargo. We also conduct paper trades, primarily to manage commodity price risk related to sales and purchase contracts. We also sell LNG for trucks in China, Singapore and Europe.",

Brent traded between $50 per barrel (/b) and $86/b in 2021, ending the/uni00A0year/uni00A0at around $77/b and averaging $71/b for the whole year. This/uni00A0was/uni00A0about 70% higher than in 2020.\n\nGlobal oil product demand rose by 5.6 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2021 to 97.4 million b/d, after a sharp drop of around 8.5 million b/d in 2020, according to the IEA. The rebound was supported by successful vaccine roll-outs, especially in developed economies such as the USA, UK/uni00A0and EU. Road mobility has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, with COVID-19 travel restrictions being lifted and more people switching from public transport to cars. Air travel has begun to recover, but is still around 20-30% below pre-pandemic levels. This is probably attributable to remaining cross-border travel restrictions and public hesitancy about air/uni00A0travel during a global pandemic. Mirroring the broad economic recovery, demand for naphtha, LPG and ethane also picked up.\n\nGlobal demand for natural gas rose by an estimated 4.6% in 2021, after/uni00A0the COVID-19 pandemic caused consumption to decline by around 1.2% in 2020, according to the IEA. The 2021 rate represents a return to/uni00A0around the historical norms of growth for gas, and is roughly the same/uni00A0as the pre-pandemic growth rate of 2019. The revival of economic growth underpinned the industrial uptake of gas, especially in China. Underperformance of hydroelectric output in China and South America as/uni00A0well as weak renewables generation in Europe drove incremental power demand for gas. Colder-than-normal winters and hotter-thanusual/uni00A0summers also produced higher-than-expected demand for gas from/uni00A0commercial and residential users. Reduced supply from a number of sources led/uni00A0to/uni00A0shortages and record high prices for gas and LNG globally.\n\nEuropean gas prices rose to unprecedented levels by the middle of 2021, with the average Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price more than five times that of 2020. The TTF price reached a peak of almost $60 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). TTF and European spot gas hub prices broke above oil parity by the third quarter and continued well above that level for the rest of the year. Prices were supported by an extended heating season that left gas storage at a deficit coming out/uni00A0of/uni00A0winter and prompted fears of scarcity as indigenous production slumped and pipeline and LNG imports were restrained. Record coal/uni00A0and/uni00A0carbon prices also contributed to the price surge.\n\nIn the USA, Henry Hub prices are expected to moderate from 2021 as/uni00A0production increases in response to higher gas prices as well as oil prices (which support associated gas production in the Permian basin). But/uni00A0upward pressures on gas prices are also expected as LNG exports, Mexico pipeline exports and economic growth stimulate demand.\n\n- See 'Market overview' on pages 42-44.\n\n## PRODUCTION AVAILABLE FOR SALE\n\nIn 2021, production was 818 million boe, or 2,240 thousand boe/d, compared with 887 million boe, or 2,424 thousand boe/d in 2020. Liquids production decreased by 5% and natural gas production decreased by 13% compared with 2020.\n\nThe decrease in production was mainly caused by divestments in Canada, Egypt and the USA, higher maintenance most significantly in Nigeria and the UK, and the effects of production-sharing contracts (PSCs) which were especially notable in Malaysia and Kazakhstan.\n\nOil production declined by around 8% from 2019 to 2021. Excluding the/uni00A0impact from the Permian divestment, oil production is expected to/uni00A0decrease on average by 1-2% a year until 2030.",

        "page_content": "## EARNINGS 2021-2020\n\nSegment earnings in 2021 were $9,694 million, which included a net gain/uni00A0of $3,268 million on sale of assets mainly related to the sale of the/uni00A0Permian business in the USA, partly offset by post-tax impairment charges of $479 million, a net charge of $393 million due to the fair value/uni00A0accounting of commodity derivatives and fourth quarter 2021 legal/uni00A0provisions of $287 million.\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 were a loss of $10,785 million, which included a net charge of $6,447 million related to impairments, primarily in the US Gulf of Mexico, unconventional assets in North America, offshore assets in Brazil and Europe, and a project in Nigeria (OPL245), mainly triggered by revision of Shell's mid- and long-term commodity price and updated Appomattox subsurface understanding. Also included was a net charge of $782 million related to the impact of the weakening Brazilian real on a/uni00A0deferred tax position.\n\nExcluding the net gains described above, segment earnings in 2021 were a profit of $7,950 million, compared with a loss of $2,852 million in 2020. Earnings excluding the net gains were helped by higher oil and gas prices mainly driven by the improved macroeconomic conditions as described in/uni00A0the business condition section and the one-off release of a tax provision in Nigeria of $628 million.\n\n## PRIOR YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY\n\nOur earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2019, can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 54) and Form 20-F (page 37) for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCash capital expenditure in 2021 was $6.3 billion, compared with $7.3/uni00A0billion in 2020.\n\nLower cash capital expenditure in 2021 was mainly driven by deferral and/uni00A0slippage of activities across the portfolio and divestments.\n\n## PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\n\n- \u25a0 In Brazil, in August 2021, we announced the final investment decision (FID) taken by the Libra consortium, operated by Petrobras, to contract the Mero-4 floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to be deployed at the offshore Mero field in the Santos Basin.\n\nWe took the following key portfolio decisions during 2021:\n\n- \u25a0 In Malaysia, in August 2021, we announced the FID on the Timi gas/uni00A0development project.\n- \u25a0 We continue to review positions that are outside our risk appetite, such/uni00A0as Nigeria onshore. In the last decade we have reduced the total/uni00A0number of licences by half and we continue to review the portfolio/uni00A0options for Nigeria onshore oil and gas.\n- \u25a0 In the US Gulf of Mexico, in July 2021, we took the FID for Whale, a/uni00A0deep-water development in the US Gulf of Mexico that features a/uni00A099% replicated hull and an 80% replication of the topsides of our/uni00A0Vito project.\n\nWe continued to divest assets during 2021, including:\n\n- \u25a0 in Egypt, in September 2021, we completed the sale of our upstream assets in Egypt's Western Desert;\n- \u25a0 in Canada, in April 2021, we completed the sale of our Duvernay light/uni00A0oil position in Alberta. The transaction had an effective date of/uni00A0January 1, 2021;\n- \u25a0 in Nigeria, in January 2021, we completed the sale of our 30% interest/uni00A0in oil mining lease (OML) 17 in the Eastern Niger Delta, and/uni00A0associated infrastructure;\n- \u25a0 in the USA, in December 2021, we completed the sale of our Permian/uni00A0business.\n- \u25a0 in the Philippines, in May 2021, we agreed to sell our 100% shareholding in Shell Philippines Exploration B.V. (SPEX). We/uni00A0aim/uni00A0to/uni00A0complete the sale in 2022; and\n\nAs announced on February 28, 2022, Shell intends to exit its joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities, including our 50% interest in Salym Petroleum Development and our 50% interest in Gydan energy venture. For more information see Note 32 on page 283.\n\n## BUSINESS AND PROPERTY\n\nOur subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are involved in all aspects of upstream activities, including land tenure, entitlement to produced hydrocarbons, production rates, royalties, pricing, environmental protection, social impact, exports, taxes and foreign exchange.\n\nThe conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which oil and/uni00A0gas interests are held vary from country to country. In almost all cases/uni00A0outside North America, legal agreements are generally granted by, or entered into with, a government, state-owned company, governmentrun oil and gas company or agency. The exploration risk usually rests with/uni00A0the independent oil and gas company. In North America, these agreements may also be with private parties that own mineral rights. Of/uni00A0these agreements, the following are most relevant to our interests:\n\n- \u25a0 Lease agreements, which are typically used in North America and are/uni00A0usually governed by terms similar to licences. Participants may include governments or private entities. Royalties are either paid in cash or in/uni00A0kind.\n- \u25a0 Licences (or concessions), which entitle the holder to explore for hydrocarbons and exploit any commercial discoveries. Under a licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and production activities, and is responsible for financing these activities. In/uni00A0principle, the licence holder is entitled to the totality of production less any royalties in kind. The government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company may sometimes enter into a joint arrangement as a participant, sharing the rights and obligations of the licence but usually without sharing the exploration risk. In a few cases, the state-owned company, government-run oil and gas company or/uni00A0agency has an option to purchase a certain share of production.\n- \u25a0 Production-sharing contracts (PSCs) entered into with a government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company. PSCs/uni00A0generally oblige the independent oil and gas company, as contractor, to provide all the financing and bear the risk of exploration, development and production activities in exchange for a share of the/uni00A0production. Usually, this share consists of a fixed or variable part that is/uni00A0reserved for the recovery of the contractor's cost (cost oil). The/uni00A0remaining production is split with the government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company on a fixed or volume/revenue-dependent basis. In some cases, the government, state-owned company or government-run oil and gas company will participate in the rights and obligations of the contractor and will share in the costs of development and production. Such participation can be/uni00A0across the venture or on a field-by-field basis. Additionally, as the price of oil or gas increases above certain predetermined levels, the independent oil and gas company's entitlement share of production normally decreases, and vice versa. Accordingly, its interest in a project/uni00A0may not be the same as its entitlement.\n\nt",

(NAM). A significant part of NAM's gas production comes from the onshore Groningen gas field, in which NAM holds a 60% interest. The remaining 40% interest is held by EBN, a Dutch government entity. NAM also has a 60% interest in the Schoonebeek oil field and operates 25 other hydrocarbon production licences.\n\nProduction from the Groningen field induces earthquakes that have damaged houses and other buildings and structures in the region. This/uni00A0has/uni00A0led to complaints and claims for compensation for damage from/uni00A0the local community.\n\nSince 2013, the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy has set an annual production level for the Groningen field, taking into account all interests, including residents' safety, security of supply in the domestic gas market and supply commitments in EU member states. The production level in the gas year 2021-2022 (ending October 1, 2022) was set as 3.9/uni00A0billion cubic metres, subject to revision by the Minister.\n\nIn June 2018, NAM's shareholders and the Dutch government signed a heads of agreement (HoA) to reduce production from Groningen and to ensure the financial robustness of NAM to fulfil its obligations. In the HoA, NAM's shareholders agreed not to declare dividends for 2018 and 2019. Dividend payments for 2020 and beyond will be made only if a solvency ratio of 25% is reached and maintained, which was not the case for 2021. In September 2018, detailed agreements were signed to further implement the HoA. As part of these agreements, Shell guarantees NAM's payment obligations vis-\u00e0-vis the Dutch government in relation to earthquakerelated damages and costs of strengthening houses, up to a maximum of/uni00A030%. This maximum equates to Shell's indirect interest in the Groningen/uni00A0production system.\n\nIn conjunction with the HoA, it was agreed that NAM would cease all/uni00A0involvement in handling damage claims or strengthening buildings to/uni00A0make them safe. The Dutch government has stepped into these two/uni00A0roles and has developed legislation and policies to deal with earthquake-related matters. The Dutch government passes on to NAM the cost of/uni00A0the/uni00A0elements for which NAM is liable. NAM has started arbitration with/uni00A0the Dutch government to have its financial liability determined for/uni00A0certain earthquake costs which the Dutch government compensates to/uni00A0claimants and subsequently recovers from NAM.\n\nIn September 2019, the Dutch government issued an update announcing that it was able to reduce Groningen production faster, stopping production in 2022, eight years earlier than initially planned. Discussions have not been concluded between the Dutch government and NAM shareholders regarding the compensation payable by the Dutch government to NAM in order to restore the balance of the package of/uni00A0arrangements laid down in the HoA.\n\nA parliamentary inquiry into production from the Groningen gas field officially started in the spring of 2021. Public hearings are scheduled for/uni00A0the summer of 2022.\n\nOn October 26, 2021, NAM announced that it will split up its assets into/uni00A0four new legal entities, with the intent to sell those new entities. This/uni00A0excludes the wider Groningen business, which will remain in the existing NAM legal entity.\n\n## Norway\n\nWe are a partner in 21 production licences on the Norwegian continental shelf. We are the operator in nine of these, of which two are producing: the Knarr field (Shell interest 45%) and the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). In 2021, we took the final investment decision on the Phase 3 project for Ormen Lange, adding subsea compression to the field. We/uni00A0hold a non-operated interest in the producing field Troll (operated by/uni00A0Equinor, Shell interest 8.1%) where the Phase 3 gas project came on/uni00A0stream in 2021 adding new production. Decommissioning is planned for/uni00A0Gaupe (cessation of production was in 2018) and Knarr (cessation of/uni00A0production is expected in May 2022).\n\nWe have a 33.3% interest in the Northern Lights joint venture, where the other partners are Equinor and TotalEnergies (equal partners). The joint venture is developing a carbon dioxide transportation and storage project.\n\n## UK\n\nFor more than 50 years we have operated a significant number of our/uni00A0interests on the UK continental shelf under a 50:50 joint-venture agreement with ExxonMobil. In the fourth quarter of 2021, ExxonMobil completed the sale of its share of some of these and other UK continental shelf assets to Neo Energy. In addition to our oil and gas production from North Sea fields, we have various interests in the Atlantic Margin area where we are not the operator. These are mainly in the West of Shetland area (Clair, Shell interest 27.97%, and Schiehallion, Shell interest 44.89%)./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, new production came on stream in Arran (Shell interest 44.57%),/uni00A0which is a tie-back to the Shearwater facility. New production also came on stream at new wells in the existing and producing Clair Ridge (Shell interest 27.97%, non-operated). In the fourth quarter of 2021,/uni00A0Shell completed a deal to increase its equity in the Shearwater field/uni00A0(from 28%/uni00A0to 55.5%) by purchasing BP's entire interest in the field. Shell will continue to be the operator of the Shearwater field.\n\nIn October 2021, the UK's Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) advised that it was unable to approve the environmental statement consent for the Jackdaw Project. Engagement with OPRED has continued, during which there have been discussions of/uni00A0alternative proposals to address the regulator's concerns.\n\nIn 2021, Shell increased its stake in the early-stage Acorn carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and blue hydrogen (BH2) project from 25% to 30%. Shell was appointed technical development lead for certain parts of/uni00A0the CCS project and will take up the role at the end of the first quarter of/uni00A02022. The UK government selected the Scottish Cluster (of which Acorn is/uni00A0part) as a reserve cluster for track 1 in its CCUS cluster sequencing process. This means that if another cluster selected as track 1 is discontinued the Scottish Cluster may take its place. The UK government has stated that it/uni00A0will/uni00A0prioritise track 1 cluster for accelerated negotiation of terms.",

Shell continues to work with its co-venturer and the UK government to map out the next steps on Cambo.\n\nDecommissioning of the Heather, Goldeneye and Curlew FPSO assets continued. In September 2021, Heerema's Thialf vessel safely lifted Goldeneye's 3,000-tonne jacket and 1,300-tonne topsides, before transporting them to Norway to be dismantled at the AF Offshore Decom/uni00A0yard in Vats./uni00A0\n\nIn Brent, production ceased after 45 years when on March 31, 2021, we shut down Brent Charlie. This is due to become the fourth and final platform to be decommissioned and removed from the Brent oil and gas field. Brent Charlie's topsides are expected to be lifted and removed in 2023, after necessary offshore preparatory works have been completed. The UK regulator OPRED is expected to announce a final decision in the first half of/uni00A02022 on the proposed derogations to leave in place the gravity-based concrete structures of Brent Bravo, Brent Charlie and Brent Delta.\n\n## Rest of Europe\n\nWe also have interests in Albania, Bulgaria and Germany.\n\n## Asia (including the Middle East and Russia) Brunei\n\nShell and the Brunei government are 50:50 shareholders in Brunei Shell/uni00A0Petroleum Company Sendirian Berhad (BSP). BSP has long-term onshore and offshore oil and gas concession rights, and sells most of its gas/uni00A0production to Brunei LNG Sendirian Berhad (see 'Integrated Gas' on/uni00A0pages/uni00A045-49), with the remainder (24% in 2021) sold in the domestic/uni00A0market.\n\nIn addition to our interest in BSP, we have a non-operating interest in/uni00A0the/uni00A0offshore Block B concession (Shell interest 35%), where gas and/uni00A0condensate are produced from the Maharaja Lela field.\n\nWe have a non-operating interest in a gas holding area for deep-water Block CA2 (Shell interest 12.5%), under a production-sharing contract (PSC).\n\nWe also operate in the deep-water Block CA1 (Shell interest 86.95%), under a PSC.\n\n## Iraq\n\nWe have a 44% interest in the Basrah Gas Company, which gathers, treats and processes associated gas that was previously being flared from/uni00A0the Rumaila, West Qurna 1 and Zubair fields. The processed gas and/uni00A0associated products, such as condensate and LPG, are sold to the/uni00A0domestic market. Any surplus condensate and LPG is exported.\n\n## Kazakhstan\n\nWe are the joint operator of the onshore Karachaganak oil and condensate field (Shell interest 29.3%). The Karachaganak field is/uni00A0in/uni00A0north-west Kazakhstan and covers an area of more than 280 square kilometres.\n\nWe have an interest in the North Caspian Sea production-sharing agreement (Shell interest 16.8%) which includes the Kashagan field in the/uni00A0Kazakh sector of the Caspian Sea. The North Caspian Operating Company is the operator. This shallow-water field covers an area of around 3,400/uni00A0square kilometres. Phase 1 development of the field led to/uni00A0plateau oil production capacity of around 66 thousand boe/d (Shell/uni00A0interest) in 2021, with the possibility of increases after later phases/uni00A0of development.\n\nWe have a 7.4% interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which owns and operates an oil pipeline running from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, across parts of Kazakhstan and Russia.\n\n## Malaysia\n\nWe explore for and produce oil and gas offshore Sabah and Sarawak under 16 PSCs, in which our interests range from 20% to 85%.\n\n## Offshore Sabah:\n\n- \u25a0 We have a 21% interest in the Siakap North-Petai deep-water field and/uni00A0a 30% interest in the Kebabangan field, both operated by third parties. We also have exploration interests.\n- \u25a0 We operate two producing oil fields, the Gumusut-Kakap field (Shell interest 30%) and the Malikai deep-water field (Shell interest 35%).\n\n## Offshore Sarawak:\n\n- - gas fields F6, F23, E8, F13 East and F13 West under the MLNG PSC/uni00A0(Shell interest 40%);\n- \u25a0 We are the operator of eight producing gas fields and one producing oil and gas field. Nearly all the gas produced offshore Sarawak is supplied to Malaysia LNG (MLNG) and to our gas-to-liquids plant in/uni00A0Bintulu. See 'Integrated Gas' on pages 45-49. The eight producing gas fields and the one producing oil and gas field are:\n- - gas fields F14 and F28 under the SK308 PSC (Shell interest 50%);\n- - producing oil and gas field E6 under the SK-308 PSC (Shell\n- - gas field Gorek under the SK408 PSC (Shell Interest 30%); and\n- interest/uni00A050%).\n- \u25a0 We are the operator for Block SK-318 PSC (Shell interest 75%). This/uni00A0block contains the discovered Rosmari, Marjoram and Timi fields. In/uni00A0August 2021, we took the final investment decision on the Timi gas development project. Situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Sarawak, Timi is a sweet gas field discovered in 2018. The Timi project comprises a wellhead platform powered by a solar and wind hybrid renewable power system, two wells and a pipeline tie-in to the F23 production hub, supporting future growth in the Sarawak Central Luconia area. The proposed Rosmari-Marjoram development is the first/uni00A0phase of the Sarawak Integrated Sour Gas Evacuation System (SISGES) development and comprises an offshore platform and onshore gas treatment plant in Bintulu, Sarawak.\n- \u25a0 We achieved first oil and gas for Phase 2 of the E6 project in March 2021.\n- \u25a0 In July 2021, we signed a new exploration PSC for Block SK-437 (Shell/uni00A0interest 85%).\n- \u25a0 We took the final investment decision in March 2021 on Jerun, which is/uni00A0part of the Block SK-408 PSC (Shell interest 30%). Jerun is a gas development with an integrated central processing platform. Block SK-408 also contains the producing non-Shell-operated Larak and Bakong fields.\n- \u25a0 In our non-operated portfolio:\n- \u25a0 We also have a 40% interest in the amended 2011 Baram Delta enhanced oil recovery PSC, and a 50% interest in the SK-307 PSC.

We will monitor the situation closely and evaluate implications for/uni00A0the integrity of our infrastructure and the sustainability of our current/uni00A0operations./uni00A0\n\nWe announced our intention to reduce our involvement in onshore oil and/uni00A0gas production in Nigeria, in line with our risk appetite. We are in/uni00A0discussion with the Nigerian government and other stakeholders on/uni00A0how/uni00A0this can be best achieved.\n\nIn August 2021, Nigeria adopted the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) that/uni00A0creates a new regulatory framework for the industry. The PIA introduces significant changes, some of which require clarification during/uni00A0the 18-month implementation phase. We are actively engaged to/uni00A0ensure that/uni00A0our operations will comply with any new requirements.\n\n## Onshore\n\nThe Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) is/uni00A0the operator of a joint venture (JV) (Shell interest 30%) that, after the completion of the sale of its interest in OML 17 on January 15, 2021, has/uni00A016/uni00A0Niger Delta onshore oil mining leases (OML).\n\nIn 2019, OML 11 expired when the Federal Government (FGN) denied an/uni00A0application of SPDC JV for renewal. While SPDC JV is challenging this/uni00A0decision in court, the FGN and SPDC JV are exploring an out-of-court solution. SPDC continues to operate OML 11 pending these discussions.\n\n## Offshore\n\nOur main offshore deep-water activities are carried out by Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCO), (Shell interest 100%). SNEPCO has interests in three deep-water blocks that are under PSC terms: the producing assets Bonga (OML 118) and Erha (OML 133) and the non-producing asset Bolia Chota (OML 135). SNEPCO operates OMLs 118 (including the Bonga field floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, Shell interest 55%) and 135 (Bolia and Doro, Shell interest 55%) and has a 43.8% non-operating interest in OML 133 (including the Erha FPSO). In May 2021 OML 118 was renewed for 20 years. In 2021, the licence for the offshore oil block OPL 245 expired.\n\nAuthorities are investigating our involvement in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block. See Note 26 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages/uni00A0277-279.\n\nSPDC also has three shallow-water licences (OMLs 74, 77 and 79) and/uni00A0a/uni00A040% interest in the non-Shell-operated Sunlink joint venture that/uni00A0has/uni00A0one/uni00A0shallow-water licence (OML 144)./uni00A0\n\nIn our Nigerian operations, we face various risks and adverse conditions/uni00A0which could have a significant adverse effect on our operational performance, earnings, cash flows and financial condition (see 'Risk/uni00A0factors' on pages/uni00A027). There are limitations to the extent to/uni00A0which we can mitigate these risks. We carry out regular portfolio assessments so/uni00A0we/uni00A0can maintain our long-term competitiveness in Nigeria. We support the Nigerian government's efforts to improve the efficiency, functionality and domestic benefits of Nigeria's oil and gas industry. We/uni00A0monitor legislative developments and the security situation. We liaise with host communities, governmental and non-governmental organisations (NGOs)/uni00A0to help promote peaceful and safe operations. We continue to/uni00A0be transparent about how we manage and report spills, and how we/uni00A0deploy oil-spill response capability and technology. We implement a/uni00A0maintenance strategy to support sustainable equipment reliability and/uni00A0have begun a/uni00A0multi-year programme to reduce routine flaring of/uni00A0associated gas.

Shell Egypt N.V. subsequently filed a notice of final relinquishment of the North East Obaiyed block, which is the only remaining onshore block still held by Shell Egypt N.V.\n\nIn 2021, Shell announced plans to hand back to the Government of Tunisia Upstream assets associated with the Miskar and Hasdrubal concessions. Discussions are in progress regarding the terms of the hand-back.\n\n## North America Canada\n\nIn Canada, we produce and market natural gas, natural gas liquids and/uni00A0condensate.\n\nWe hold mineral acres, primarily in the Montney play in British Columbia and Alberta. We currently operate four natural gas processing area facilities in our Groundbirch asset in British Columbia. In April 2021, we/uni00A0sold our Duvernay shale light oil position in Alberta.\n\n## USA\n\nWe produce oil and gas in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. We produce heavy oil in California through a 51.8% interest in Aera Energy LLC which operates wells in the San Joaquin Valley. The majority of our oil and gas interests are acquired under leases granted by the owner of the minerals underlying the relevant area, including many leases for federal offshore tracts. Such leases usually run on an initial fixed term that is automatically extended by the establishment of continued production, subject to/uni00A0compliance with the terms of the lease (including, in the case of/uni00A0federal/uni00A0leases, extensive regulations imposed by federal law).\n\nWe have sold or relinquished all frontier licences in Alaska and have no plans for frontier exploration off Alaska's coast. We retain two exploration acreage positions in the long-established North Slope area of Alaska. One is a non-operating interest of 50% in 13 federal leases held since 2007 and operated by Eni. The other position consists of 18 state leases in/uni00A0nearby West Harrison Bay that have been held since 2012, which we/uni00A0plan to turn over to an alternative operator.\n\n## Gulf of Mexico\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is our major production area in the USA. We have an/uni00A0interest in 311 active federal offshore leases.\n\nWe are the operator of eight production hubs - Mars, Olympus, Auger, Perdido, Ursa, Enchilada/Salsa, Appomattox and Stones - and the West Delta 143 processing facilities (Shell interests ranging from 33% to 100%). We continue to produce from Coulomb (Shell interest 100%) which ties into the Na Kika platform, where Shell has a 50% non-operating interest.\n\nWe continued exploration, development and abandonment activities in/uni00A0the Gulf of Mexico in 2021.\n\nWe made discoveries at the Leopard and Blacktip North prospects in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Perdido Corridor. The Leopard well encountered more than 600/uni00A0feet (183 meters) net oil pay at multiple levels and the Blacktip North well/uni00A0encountered approximately 300 feet net oil pay at multiple levels. Evaluation is ongoing to further define development options. The Leopard and Blacktip North discoveries are opportunities to increase production in/uni00A0the Perdido Corridor, where Shell's Great White, Silvertip and Tobago fields are already producing./uni00A0\n\nWe also took the final investment decision (FID) for Whale, a deep-water development in the Perdido Corridor that features a 99% replicated hull and an 80% replication of the topsides of our Vito project. The Whale development (Shell interest 60%) is currently scheduled to begin production in 2024.\n\nWe made progress on the development of Powernap and Vito, which are both in the execution phase. Powernap (Shell interest 100%) is a subsea tie-back to the Olympus production hub, while Vito (Shell interest 63%) is/uni00A0a stand-alone host. Both are expected to achieve first oil in 2022.\n\nThe 2021 Atlantic hurricane season adversely impacted production at our US Gulf of Mexico assets. We experienced extended shutdowns at our Mars, Olympus, and Ursa production hubs because of structural damage to our West Delta-143 (WD-143) processing facilities after Hurricane Ida. We safely reinstated production at Olympus on October 1, (33 days after Hurricane Ida), and at Mars and Ursa on November 4, (67 days after Hurricane Ida). This was ahead of estimated timelines./uni00A0\n\n## Shales\n\nOur activity in 2021 was focused in the Permian Basin. On December 1, 2021, we completed the sale of Shell's interest in the Permian to ConocoPhillips for a base consideration of $9.5 billion. As a result of this divestment, Shell no longer has active shales development in the USA.\n\n## Rest of North America\n\nWe also have deep-water licences and one shallow-water licence in Mexico.\n\n## South America Brazil\n\n- \u25a0 the Bijupir\u00e1 and Salema fields (Shell interest 80%), which ceased production in December 2021 to begin abandonment operations;\n\nOur operated portfolio consists of offshore assets in:\n\n- \u25a0 the BC-10 field (Shell interest 50%) in the Campos Basin;\n- \u25a0 a total of 22 exploration blocks in the following areas:\n- \u25a0 the Gato do Mato area in the Santos Basin and the adjacent Sul de/uni00A0Gato do Mato area (Shell interest 50%), subject to unitisation, with/uni00A0development options under evaluation; and\n- \u25a0 Barreirinhas Basin (10 blocks with Shell interests ranging from 50%/uni00A0to/uni00A0100%);\n- \u25a0 Potiguar Basin (Shell interest 100%); and\n- \u25a0 Santos Basin (two blocks with Shell interests 45% and 55%);\n- \u25a0 Campos Basin (three blocks with Shell interest 40% and one block with/uni00A0Shell interest 100%). An additional five blocks were awarded to/uni00A0Shell in the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) permanent offer round in October 2021. Contracts were expected to be signed in/uni00A0the/uni00A0first quarter of 2022.\n\nt",

This consisted of an increase of 1,322 million boe from Shell subsidiaries and an increase of 148 million boe from the Shell share of joint ventures and associates.\n\nAfter taking production into account, our proved reserves increased by/uni00A0241 million boe in 2021 to 9,365 million boe at December 31, 2021.\n\n## SHELL SUBSIDIARIES\n\nBefore taking production into account, Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves increased by 1,322 million boe in 2021. This consisted of an increase of/uni00A0637 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids, an increase of/uni00A0775 million boe (4,494 thousand million scf) of natural gas and a decrease of 90 million barrels of synthetic crude oil. The 1,322 million boe/uni00A0increase was the result of a net increase of 1,091 million boe from revisions and reclassifications, an increase of 430 million boe from extensions and discoveries, an increase of 31 million boe from improved/uni00A0recovery, and a net decrease of 230 million boe related/uni00A0to/uni00A0purchases and sales of minerals in place.\n\nAfter taking into account production of 1,088 million boe (of which 41 million boe were consumed in operations), Shell subsidiaries' proved reserves increased by 234 million boe in 2021 to 8,456 million boe. In/uni00A02021, Shell subsidiaries' proved developed reserves (PD) decreased by/uni00A0238 million boe to 6,740 million boe, and proved undeveloped reserves (PUD) increased by 472 million boe to 1,716 million boe.\n\n## SHELL SHARE OF JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES\n\nBefore taking production into account, the Shell share of joint ventures and/uni00A0associates' proved reserves increased by 148 million boe in 2021. This/uni00A0consisted of an increase of 48 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and an increase of 100 million boe (580 thousand million scf) of natural gas. The 148 million boe increase comprised a net increase of 146 million boe from revisions and reclassifications and an increase of 2/uni00A0million boe from extensions and discoveries.\n\nAfter taking into account production of 141 million boe (of which 7 million boe were consumed in operations), the Shell share of joint ventures and associates' proved reserves increased by 7 million boe to 909 million boe at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Shell share of joint ventures and associates' PD increased by 8/uni00A0million/uni00A0boe to 801 million boe, and PUD decreased by 3 million boe to 108 million boe.\n\nFor further information, see 'Supplementary Information - oil and gas (unaudited)' on pages 284-301.\n\n## PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES\n\nIn 2021, Shell subsidiaries and the Shell share of joint ventures and associates' PUD increased by 469 million boe to 1,824 million boe. There/uni00A0were decreases of 467 million boe because of maturation to PD, mainly 129 million boe in Troll (Norway), 69 million boe in Tupi (Brazil), and 269/uni00A0million boe spread across other fields, and a net decrease of 26/uni00A0million boe due to purchases and sales. These were offset by: increases\n\nof 498 million boe due to revisions, an increase of 31 million boe due to/uni00A0improved recovery, and a net increase of 432 million boe due to extensions and discoveries. The extensions and discoveries consisted of/uni00A0107 million boe in/uni00A0Mero, 81 million boe in Whale, and 244 million boe/uni00A0spread across other fields.\n\nIn addition to the maturation of 467 million boe from PUD to PD, 51 million boe was matured to PD from contingent resources through PUD as a result of project execution during the year.\n\nPUD held for five years or more (PUD5+) at December 31, 2021, amounted to 238 million boe, an increase of 54 million boe compared with the end of 2020, which was driven mainly by changes in Kolo Creek (Nigeria), Tupi (Brazil) and Groundbirch (Canada).\n\nThe fields with the largest PUD5+ on December 31, 2021 were Lunskoye (Russia), Gorgon (Australia), Kolo Creek (Nigeria) and Tupi (Brazil).\n\nThese PUD5+ remain undeveloped because development either requires the installation of compression equipment (Russia) and the drilling of additional wells (Brazil) or will take longer than five years because of/uni00A0the/uni00A0complexity and scale of the project (Australia).\n\nDuring 2021, we spent $5.3 billion on development activities related to/uni00A0PUD maturation.\n\n## DELIVERY COMMITMENTS\n\nWe sell crude oil and natural gas from our producing operations under a/uni00A0variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit us to/uni00A0sell quantities based on production from specified properties, although some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below.\n\nIn the past three years, we met our contractual delivery commitments, with/uni00A0the notable exceptions of Egypt, Trinidad and Tobago, and Malaysia. In the period 2022-2024, we are contractually committed to deliver to third parties, joint ventures and associates a total of 6,976 billion scf of natural gas from our subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. The sales contracts contain a mixture of fixed and variable pricing formulae that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery.\n\nIn the period 2022-2024, we expect to meet our delivery commitments for/uni00A0almost all the areas in which they are carried, with an estimated 73.2% coming from PD, 5.0% through the delivery of gas that becomes available to us from paying royalties in cash, and 21.8% from the development of PUD as well as other new projects and purchases. The key exceptions are:\n\n- \u25a0 in Trinidad and Tobago (East Coast Marine Area and North Coast Marine Area), we expect to cover 91% of our delivery commitments from existing developed resource volumes and new projects, resulting in an expected true shortfall of some 62 billion scf; and\n- \u25a0 Egypt: The government decision to divert gas from the offshore West Delta Deep Marine fields to domestic use has caused a tangible shortfall of 502 billion scf (84% of the promised gas delivery), expected to continue in the near future leaving LNG gas commitment mostly under force majeure;\n- \u25a0 in Malaysia, one of the third-party gas supply lines which was under maintenance has not been repaired during 2021. Force majeure has been declared, and no penalties have been incurred, resulting in an expected true shortfall of some 54 billion scf (48% of the promised gas/uni00A0delivery).",

The products we sell include low-carbon fuels, lubricants, bitumen, sulphur, gasoline, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel and marine fuel. We provide access to electric vehicle charge points at home, at work and on-the-go, including at/uni00A0our fuel and convenience retail site forecourts and at a range of public locations. We also trade crude oil, oil products and petrochemicals.\n\nOur Oil Products activities comprise Marketing and Refining & Trading. These are sub-segments of Oil Products that are made up of various classes of business. Marketing includes Retail, Lubricants, Business-toBusiness (B2B), Low-Carbon Fuels (biofuels and renewable natural gas/uni00A0(RNG)), our interests in the Raizen JV, and Pipelines. In Trading and/uni00A0Supply, we trade crude oil, low-carbon fuels, oil products and petrochemicals to optimise feedstocks for Refining, to supply our Marketing businesses and third parties, and for our own profit. The Oil Products business also manage Oil Sands activities - the extraction of bitumen from mined oil sands and its conversion into synthetic crude oil./uni00A0\n\n## BUSINESS CONDITIONS/uni00A0\n\nGlobal oil product demand rose by 5.6 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2021 to 97.4 million b/d, after a sharp drop of around 8.5 million b/d in 2020, according to the IEA. The rebound was supported by successful vaccine roll-outs, especially in developed economies such as the USA, UK/uni00A0and EU. Road mobility has largely returned to pre-pandemic levels, with COVID-19 travel restrictions being lifted and more people switching from public transport to cars. Air travel has begun to recover, but is still around 20-30% below pre-pandemic levels. This is probably attributable to remaining cross-border travel restrictions and public hesitancy about air travel during a global pandemic. Mirroring the broad economic recovery, demand for naphtha, LPG and ethane also picked up.\n\nGross refining margins improved during 2021, especially during the second and third quarters. This is because demand for oil products recovered significantly as economies rebounded and transport use increased with the easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions. Demand for/uni00A0kerosene for aviation remained below pre-pandemic levels because varying levels of international travel restrictions remained in place in/uni00A02021./uni00A0Despite the Omicron variant of COVID-19, demand recovery continued during the fourth quarter.\n\nIndustry utilisation showed some recovery, but in 2021 there were further/uni00A0announcements that refineries would fully or partially close on/uni00A0a/uni00A0permanent basis. Construction of new capacity continued during the/uni00A0year, especially in the Middle East and Asia.\n\n## See 'Market overview' on pages 42-44.\n\n## REFINERY UTILISATION\n\nUtilisation is defined as the actual usage of the plants as a percentage of/uni00A0the rated capacity.\n\nUtilisation remained at 72%, unchanged from 2020.\n\n## OIL PRODUCTS SALES\n\nOil Products sales volumes decreased by 5% in 2021 compared with 2020. The decrease was largely driven by lower Trading volumes, partly offset by higher Marketing volumes.\n\n## EARNINGS 2021-2020\n\nSegment earnings in 2021 were $2,664 million, 639% higher than in/uni00A02020. Earnings in 2021 included a net charge of $1,280 million, compared with a net charge of $6,489 million in 2020 which is described/uni00A0at the end of this section.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## OIL PRODUCTS continued\n\nExcluding the impact of the net charges (described below), earnings in/uni00A02021 were $3,944 million, compared with $5,995 million in 2020. Marketing accounted for 106% of these 2021 earnings, Refining for (36)%/uni00A0and Trading and Supply for 30%.\n\nOil Products earnings, excluding the net charge, decreased by $2,051/uni00A0million, or 34% compared with 2020. This was driven by lower contributions from trading and optimisation (around $1,100 million), higher operating expenses (around $1,000 million) and other items, mainly unfavourable deferred tax movements (around $1,100 million), partly offset by higher Marketing volumes (around $700 million) and higher Oil/uni00A0Sands margins (around $500 million).\n\nThe decrease in earnings of $2,051 million, analysed by sub-segment, was/uni00A0as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Refining and trading earnings were $1,671 million lower than in 2020, mainly because of lower contributions from trading and optimisation, higher operating expenses and unfavourable deferred tax movements. These were partly offset by higher refining margins, higher Oil Sands margins due to increased average realised prices and lower depreciation.\n- \u25a0 Marketing earnings were $379 million lower than in 2020, mainly driven by higher operating expenses. These were partially offset by higher sales volumes.\n\nSegment earnings in 2021 included a net charge of $1,280 million.\n\n## This included:\n\n- \u25a0 redundancy and restructuring costs of $62 million (mainly the cost of/uni00A0Reshape 2020-2021, partly offset by Bukom transformation provision release); and\n- \u25a0 impairment charges of $1,619 million mainly related to the divestment of Puget Sound and Deer Park refineries in the USA;\n- \u25a0 other net charges of $32 million;\n\nThese charges were partly offset by:\n\n- \u25a0 a net gain of $142 million due to the fair value accounting of/uni00A0commodity derivatives.\n- \u25a0 net gains from disposal of assets of $291 million mainly related to/uni00A0the/uni00A0dilution of interest in the Ra\u00edzen joint venture; and\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 included a net charge of $6,489 million.\n\n## This included:\n\n- \u25a0 restructuring costs of $365 million (mainly shutdown of Convent, Pulau Bukom transformation and various initiatives across Oil Products);\n- \u25a0 impairment charges of $5,530 million across sites, reflecting revisions to medium- and long-term price outlook assumptions in light of: changes in supply and demand fundamentals in the energy market; macroeconomic conditions; the COVID-19 pandemic; impairment and transformation charges at Pulau Bukom; and the shutdown of Convent;\n- \u25a0 other net charges of $552 million (mainly onerous contract provisions due to shutdown of Convent); and\n- \u25a0 a net charge of $101 million due to the fair value accounting of/uni00A0commodity derivatives.\n\nThese charges were partly offset by net gains from disposal of assets of/uni00A0$59 million.\n\n## PRIOR YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY\n\nOur earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2019, can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 71) and Form 20-F (page 52) for/uni00A0the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US Securities and Exchange/uni00A0Commission, respectively.\n\n## CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\nCash capital expenditure (cash capex) was $3.9 billion in 2021, compared with $3.3 billion in 2020.\n\nCash capital expenditure in Marketing increased by $0.3 billion mainly because of higher spend in growth projects relating to biofuels and retail. In Refining and trading, cash capital expenditure increased by $0.2 billion due to turnarounds. Our cash capital expenditure is expected to be around $7 billion to $8 billion in 2022.\n\n## PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- \u25a0 In July 2021, we announced the start-up of Europe's largest polymer electrolyte membrane hydrogen electrolyser at the Shell Energy and/uni00A0Chemicals Park Rheinland, Germany, producing green hydrogen (hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources).\n\nSignificant portfolio and business developments in 2021 included:\n\n- \u25a0 In July 2021, our subsidiary Shell Deutschland reached an agreement for the sale of its non-operated 37.5% shareholding in the PCK Schwedt Refinery, 120 km north-east of Berlin, Germany.\n- \u25a0 In September 2021, we announced a final investment decision to build/uni00A0an 820,000-tonnes-a-year biofuels facility at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the Netherlands, which was formerly known as the Pernis refinery.\n- \u25a0 In August 2021, trading in shares of Ra\u00edzen S.A., our joint venture (Shell/uni00A0interest 44%), began on the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange (B3) in/uni00A0Brazil, after a successful initial public offering.\n- \u25a0 In October 2021, we signed an agreement to acquire the retail gas station network (including gas stations, convenience retail and dealer supply agreements) from the Landmark group of companies, a Texas-based fuel retail and convenience retailing business. Subject to/uni00A0the satisfaction of closing conditions, the deal expected to be completed in the first half of 2022.\n- \u25a0 In February 2022, we have made a non-binding offer to purchase all/uni00A0remaining common units held by the public representing limited partner interests in Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. for $12.89 per common unit in cash. The proposed transaction is subject to a number of contingencies, including the approval of the board of directors of/uni00A0Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. and the satisfaction of any conditions to the consummation of a transaction set forth in any definitive agreement concerning the transaction.\n- \u25a0 In January 2022, our subsidiary Shell Oil Company completed the sale of its interest in Deer Park Refining Limited Partnership, in Texas, USA. This was a 50:50 joint venture between Shell Oil Company and P.M.I. Norteamerica, S.A. De C.V. (a subsidiary of Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, or Pemex). The transaction transferred Shell's interest in the partnership, and with it full ownership of the refinery, to Pemex. The agreement for sale of its interest was reached in May 2021. Shell Chemical L.P. continues to operate its 100% owned Deer Park Chemicals facility located adjacent to the site.",

        "page_content": "## BUSINESS AND PROPERTY Marketing\n\nShell is the world's largest mobility retailer, by number of sites, with more than 46,000 service stations operating in more than 70 countries at the end of 2021. We operate different models across these markets, from full/uni00A0ownership of retail sites through to brand licensing agreements.\n\n## Mobility\n\nEvery day, around 32 million customers visit these sites to buy fuel, convenience items including beverages and fresh food, and services such as lubricant changes and car washes. We offer our business customers Shell Fleet Solutions, through which they can obtain items including fuel cards, road services and carbon-offset offers. At the end of 2021, Shell operated 12,400 convenience stores worldwide and we expect to grow this number to 15,000 by 2025.\n\nWe have more than 100 years' experience in fuel development. Aided/uni00A0by/uni00A0our partnership with Scuderia Ferrari, we have concentrated on developing fuels with special formulations designed to clean engines and improve performance. We sold such fuels under the Shell V-Power brand in 66 countries in 2021./uni00A0\n\nIn a growing number of markets, we are offering customers lower-emission products and services, including biofuels, electric vehicle fast charging, hydrogen and various gaseous fuels such as LNG. In eight markets, including the UK and the Netherlands, Shell Mobility provides customers/uni00A0with the opportunity to offset their carbon emissions.\n\nShell Mobility offers electric vehicle (EV) customers nearly 8,000 public charge points at Shell stations, on-street and at destinations like supermarkets. In addition, Shell Renewables and Energy Solutions operates around 80,000 private charge points and offers customers access to more than 300,000 charge points through its growing roaming/uni00A0networks in Europe, North America and South East Asia.\n\nIn 2021, Shell, Waitrose and Partners in the UK, and REWE and Penny supermarkets in Germany, announced the intention to install hundreds of/uni00A0charge points over the coming years. In January 2022, Shell opened its/uni00A0first EV charging hub in the UK in Fulham, London, where petrol and diesel pumps at an existing fuel station have been replaced with charge points. Shell Fulham features nine high-powered, ultra-rapid 175 kW charge points.\n\nIn 2021, Shell Mobility introduced a new premium fresh coffee and food offer, called Shell Caf\u00e9. The launch of Shell Caf\u00e9 provides a consistent brand for drivers visiting Shell stations and addresses the evolving needs of customers with enhanced customer facilities and new on-site service offerings. By the end of 2021, there were 800 conversions across 14/uni00A0markets in Europe with plans to expand to other regions in 2022.\n\nWe have around 50 hydrogen retail sites in Europe and North America, where drivers can fill up their vehicles with hydrogen fuel.\n\n## Lubricants\n\nShell Lubricants has been the number one global finished lubricants supplier in terms of market share for 15 consecutive years, according to/uni00A0Kline & Company data for 2021. Across more than 160 markets, we produce, market and sell technically advanced lubricants for passenger cars, motorcycles, trucks, coaches, and machinery used in manufacturing, mining, power generation, agriculture and construction.\n\nWe also make premium lubricants for conventional vehicles and Shell E-fluids for electric vehicles using gas-to-liquids (GTL) base oils that are made from natural gas at our Pearl GTL plant in Qatar (see 'Integrated Gas' on pages 45-49).\n\nWe have a global lubricants supply chain with a network of four base oil manufacturing plants, 33 lubricant blending plants, eight grease plants and six GTL base oil storage hubs.\n\nThrough our marine activities, we primarily provide the shipping and maritime sectors with lubricants. We also provide fuels, chemical products and related technical and digital services. We supply more than 200/uni00A0grades of lubricants and seven types of fuel to vessels worldwide, ranging/uni00A0from large ocean-going tankers to small fishing boats.\n\n## Business-to-business\n\nOur Business-to-business (B2B) activities encompass the sale of fuels, speciality products and services to a broad range of commercial customers.\n\nShell Aviation provides aviation fuel, lubricants and low-carbon solutions globally. In 2021, we took a final investment decision to build a new biofuels facility at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. This will be among the largest in Europe producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We announced plans to produce SAF at our energy and chemicals parks in Germany and Singapore. We also invested in LanzaJet, a leading sustainable fuels technology company.\n\nShell Bitumen supplies customers across 60 markets and provides enough bitumen to resurface 500 kilometres of road lanes every day. It also invests in research and development to create innovative products.\n\nShell Sulphur Solutions is a business that manages the complete value chain of sulphur, from refining to marketing. The business provides sulphur for use in applications such as fertiliser, mining and chemicals. The business also licenses Shell Thiogro technologies to create innovative and custom sulphur-enhanced fertilisers.\n\n## Low-carbon fuels Biofuels\n\nIn 2021, around 9.1 billion litres of biofuels went into Shell's fuels worldwide, which includes sales made by Ra\u00edzen, our joint venture in/uni00A0Brazil (Shell interest 44%, not operated by Shell).\n\nRa\u00edzen produced around 2.5 billion litres of ethanol and around four million tonnes of sugar from sugar cane in 2021. The cellulosic ethanol plant at Ra\u00edzen's Costa Pinto mill in Brazil produced 19 million litres of ethanol in 2021.\n\nIn February 2021, Ra\u00edzen announced the acquisition of Biosev, adding a/uni00A0further 50% of production capacity in low-carbon fuels. We believe this/uni00A0will allow Ra\u00edzen to increase its bioethanol production capacity to/uni00A03.75 billion litres a year. The transaction contributes to Shell's target to/uni00A0be/uni00A0a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\nt",

The plant uses locally sourced cow manure and agricultural residues to produce low-carbon fuel for heavy-duty road transport. We opened our first renewable compressed natural gas (R-CNG) fuelling site in the USA at our products distribution complex in Carson, California. The R-CNG is sourced from Shell's portfolio of anaerobic digestion projects.\n\nIn Europe, we are offering liquefied renewable natural gas (bio-LNG) to/uni00A0customers with trucks powered by natural gas. In 2021, in collaboration with Nordsol, we opened our first European bio-LNG plant, in Amsterdam Westpoort, in the Netherlands. This will make us the first fuel provider to/uni00A0offer a blend of bio-LNG throughout the entire LNG network in the Netherlands.\n\n## Midstream\n\nShell Pipeline Company LP (Shell interest 100%) operates eight tank farms/uni00A0across the USA. It owns all the interest in one tank farm, and has majority-ownership interests in the other seven through its subsidiaries. It/uni00A0transports around 2 billion barrels of crude oil and refined products a year through around 6,000 kilometres of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and five US states. Our various non-Shell-operated ownership interests provide a further 13,000 kilometres of pipeline.\n\nWe carry more than 40 types of crude oil and more than 20 grades of/uni00A0fuel and chemicals, including gasoline, diesel, aviation fuel, chemicals and ethylene.\n\nShell Midstream Partners, L.P., a master limited partnership that is headquartered in Houston, Texas; owns, operates, develops and acquires pipelines and other midstream and logistics assets. The Partnership's assets include interests in entities that own (a) crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals that serve as key infrastructure to transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and deliver refined products from those markets to major demand centers and (b) storage tanks and financing receivables that are secured by pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and other infrastructure used to stage and transport intermediate and finished products. The Partnership's assets also include interests in entities that own/uni00A0natural gas and refinery gas pipelines that transport offshore natural gas to market hubs and deliver refinery gas from refineries and plants to chemical sites along the Gulf Coast. Shell controls the General Partner of/uni00A0Shell Midstream Partners.\n\n- See 'Governance - Related Party Transactions' on page 201 for information on transactions between Shell and Shell Midstream Partners, L.P.\n\n## Refining and trading Refining\n\nWe have interests in 10 refineries worldwide, with a capacity to process a/uni00A0total of 1.6 million barrels of crude oil per day. The distribution of our refining capacity is 52% in Europe and Africa, 34% in the Americas and/uni00A014% in Asia.\n\nShell's Refining business is transforming. We are concentrating our refineries portfolio to meet our strategic aims and to capitalise on the strong integration between our customers, trading operations, chemical\n\nplants and, increasingly, our low-carbon fuels output. We are transforming our refining sites into five energy and chemicals parks. These are expected to be Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Rheinland in Germany, Pulau Bukom in Singapore, Norco in Louisiana, USA, and Scotford in Alberta, Canada.\n\nTransforming our refinery business will mean developing new facilities and/uni00A0converting or dismantling existing units. We plan to process less crude oil and use more renewable and recycled feedstocks such as hydrogen, biofuels and plastic waste.\n\nIn 2021, we completed the sale of the Puget Sound refinery near Anacortes, Washington, USA, to a subsidiary of HollyFrontier Corporation. We also completed the sale of Fredericia refinery, Denmark.\n\n## Trading and Supply\n\nThrough our main trading offices in London, Houston, Singapore and/uni00A0Rotterdam, we trade crude oil, low-carbon fuels, refined products,/uni00A0chemical feedstocks and environmental products. Trading and/uni00A0Supply trades in physical and financial contracts, lease storage and/uni00A0transportation capacities, and manages shipping and wholesale/uni00A0commercial fuel activities globally.\n\nOperating in around 25 countries, with about 130 Shell and joint-venture terminals, we believe our supply and distribution infrastructure is well positioned to make deliveries around the world.\n\nShipping and Maritime/uni00A0enables the safe delivery of the Shell Trading and/uni00A0Supply contracts. This includes supplying feedstocks for our refineries and chemical plants, and finished products such as gasoline, diesel and/uni00A0aviation fuel to our Marketing businesses and customers.\n\nShell Wholesale Commercial Fuels provides fuels for transport, industry and heating ranging from reliable main-grade fuels to premium products.\n\n## Oil Sands\n\nSynthetic crude oil is produced by mining bitumen-saturated sands, extracting the bitumen, and transporting it to a processing facility where hydrogen is added to make a wide range of feedstocks for refineries. The/uni00A0Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) in Alberta, Canada, includes the Albian Sands mining and extraction operations, the Scotford upgrader/uni00A0and the Quest carbon capture and storage (CCS) project.\n\nWe have a 50% interest in 1745844 Alberta Ltd. (formerly known as/uni00A0Marathon Oil Canada Corporation), which holds a 20% interest in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Athabasca Oil Sands Project.\n\n## BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WITH SYRIA AND CUBA Syria\n\nWe ceased all operational activities in Syria in 2011.\n\n## Cuba\n\nWe do not have any operational activities in Cuba.\n\n## OIL PRODUCTS DATA TABLES\n\nThe tables below reflect Shell subsidiaries and instances where Shell owns/uni00A0the crude oil or feedstocks processed by a refinery. The tables include Fredericia refinery until the date of divestment in June 2021 and Puget Sound refinery until the date of divestment in October 2021. Other joint ventures and associates are only included where explicitly stated.",

Segment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis.\n- [B]  See 'Non-GAAP measures reconciliations' on pages 326-329./uni00A0\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nOur Chemicals business supplies customers with a range of base and intermediate chemicals to make products that people use every day. We/uni00A0also have major manufacturing plants that are located close to refineries, and our own marketing network.\n\n## BUSINESS CONDITIONS\n\nCracker margins were volatile in 2021. This was because of supply interruptions and demand increases as COVID-19 lockdown restrictions eased. Overall margins were higher than in 2020, except in Asia. Chinese demand recovered quickly from the pandemic, but petrochemical supply was constrained by power restrictions that affected manufacturing centres, logistics issues within China because of COVID-19, and global logistics issues. Asia cracker margins were down slightly from 2020 because of the balance of supply and demand, and rising prices for energy, crude oil and naphtha feedstock. US ethane cracker margins were/uni00A0supported by disruption due to winter storm Uri in February and March and to a lesser extent by interruptions caused by Hurricane Ida/uni00A0in/uni00A0August and September. West European cracker margins were supported by the US weather events and strong domestic demand, which/uni00A0offset rising crude and natural gas prices for the majority of 2021.\n\nThe outlook for petrochemical margins in 2022 and beyond depends on/uni00A0feedstock costs and the balance of supply and demand. Demand for/uni00A0petrochemicals will be affected by the spread of COVID-19 as new variants emerge, and the extent of recovery from the pandemic. Supply of/uni00A0petrochemicals will depend on the net capacity effect of new builds and plant closures (taking into account any delays or cancellations in building new plants or closing old ones). Product prices reflect the prices of/uni00A0raw materials, which are closely linked to crude oil and natural gas prices. The balance of all these factors will drive margins.\n\n- See 'Market overview' on pages 42-44.\n\n## CHEMICAL PLANT UTILISATION/uni00A0\n\nUtilisation is defined as the actual usage of the plants as a percentage of/uni00A0the rated capacity.\n\nChemicals manufacturing plant utilisation was 78% in 2021 compared with 80% in 2020. The change was mainly because of the impact of Hurricane Ida in the USA in 2021 and an extended turnaround./uni00A0\n\n## CHEMICALS SALES\n\nIn 2021, Chemicals sales volumes were 14,216 thousand tonnes, which was 5% lower than 2020 sales volumes of 15,036 thousand tonnes, as/uni00A0a/uni00A0result of the impact of Hurricane Ida in the USA.\n\n## EARNINGS 2021-2020\n\nSegment earnings in 2021 of $1,390 million were 72% higher than in 2020. Earnings in 2021 included a net charge of $364 million, compared with a net/uni00A0charge in 2020 of $154 million, which is described below.\n\nExcluding the impact of these charges, earnings in 2021 were $1,753/uni00A0million, compared with $962 million in 2020.\n\nChemicals earnings, excluding the net charges (described below), increased by $792 million, or 82%, compared with 2020. This was driven by higher margins in base chemicals and intermediates (around $800 million) from a stronger price environment, and favourable deferred tax movements (around $200 million), partly offset by higher operating expenses (around $200 million) driven by the impact of Hurricane Ida.\n\nSegment earnings in 2021 included a net charge of $364 million.\n\n## This included:\n\n- \u25a0 redundancy and restructuring costs of $21 million;\n- \u25a0 impairment charges of $301 million (mainly due to divestment of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Mobile and Deer Park refineries in the USA and the closure of/uni00A0a/uni00A0production unit on Jurong Island, Singapore);\n- \u25a0 other net charges of $38 million (mainly legal provision); and\n- \u25a0 net loss from disposal of assets of $12 million.\n\nThese charges were partly offset by a net gain from fair value accounting of commodity derivatives of $8 million.\n\nSegment earnings in 2020 included a net charge of $154 million.\n\nt",

Our/uni00A0cash capital expenditure is expected to be around $2 billion to/uni00A0$3/uni00A0billion in 2022.\n\n## BUSINESS AND PROPERTY Manufacturing\n\nOur plants produce a range of base chemicals, including ethylene, propylene and aromatics, and intermediate chemicals such as styrene monomer, propylene oxide, solvents, detergent alcohols, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol. We have the capacity to produce around 6.5/uni00A0million tonnes of ethylene a year. We are expanding our product portfolio to include sustainable chemicals, more intermediates and performance chemicals such as polyethylene and polycarbonate. We operate chemical plants worldwide and have a global balance of locations, feedstocks and/uni00A0products that allows us to seize commercial opportunities and get/uni00A0through cycles of lower margins.\n\nShell's Chemicals business is transforming and has integrated further with/uni00A0our Refining business. In addition to our standalone, chemicals-only production sites, we are transforming our refineries into five energy and chemicals parks. We expect this to happen at the following sites: Norco in/uni00A0the USA, Scotford in Canada, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Rheinland in Germany and Pulau Bukom in Singapore. The energy and chemicals parks are expected to focus more on meeting customers' low-carbon and/uni00A0sustainability needs.\n\n## Marketing\n\nIn 2021, we supplied more than 14/uni00A0million tonnes of petrochemicals to/uni00A0more than 1,000 industrial customers worldwide.

It/uni00A0comprises Shell's holdings and treasury organisation, selfinsurance activities and headquarters and central functions. All finance expense and income and related taxes are included in Corporate segment earnings rather than in the earnings of business segments.\n\nThe holdings and treasury organisation manages many of the Corporate entities. It is the point of contact between Shell and external capital markets, conducting a wide range of transactions, such as raising debt/uni00A0instruments and transacting foreign exchange. Treasury centres in/uni00A0London and Singapore support these activities.\n\nHeadquarters and central functions provide business support in communications, finance, health, human resources, information technology (IT), legal services, real estate and security. They also provide/uni00A0support for shareholder-related activities. The central functions are supported by business service centres, which process transactions, manage data and produce statutory returns, among other services. Most headquarters and central-function costs are recovered from the business segments. Costs that are not recovered are retained in Corporate.\n\n## EARNINGS 2021-2020\n\nSegment earnings in 2021 were an expense of/uni00A0$2,606 million, compared with/uni00A0$2,952 million/uni00A0in 2020./uni00A0\n\nNet interest decreased by $289 million in 2021 compared with 2020. This/uni00A0was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense following debt repayments and a reduction in interest expense on lease liabilities, partly offset by a reduction in interest income generated on cash balances.\n\nTaxation and other earnings increased by $58 million in 2021, compared with 2020. This largely reflected a foreign exchange gain arising from favourable exchange rate movements and lower financing expenses from joint ventures and associates, partly offset by unfavourable deferred tax impacts due to the weakening Brazilian real on financing positions.\n\n## PRIOR YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY\n\nOur earnings summary for the financial year ended December 31, 2020, compared with the financial year ended December 31, 2019, can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts (page 80) and Form 20-F (page 60) for the year ended December 31, 2020, as filed with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, respectively.\n\n## SELF-INSURANCE\n\nWe mainly self-insure our hazard risk exposures. Our Group insurance companies are adequately capitalised to meet self-insurance obligations and respective regulations, though they may transfer risks to third-party\n\ninsurers where economical, effective and relevant (see 'Risk factors' on/uni00A0page 30). We continually assess the safety performance of our operations and make risk mitigation recommendations, where relevant, to/uni00A0minimise the risk of an accident./uni00A0\n\n## INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CYBER SECURITY\n\nGiven our digitalisation efforts and increasing reliance on information technology (IT) systems for our operations, we continually monitor external developments and actively share information on threats and security incidents. Shell employees and contract staff are subject to mandatory courses and regular awareness campaigns aimed at protecting us against cyber threats. We periodically test and adapt cyber-security response processes and seek to enhance our security monitoring capability.\n\nGiven our dependence on IT systems for our operations and the increasing role of digital technologies across our organisation, we are aware that cyber-security attacks could cause significant harm to Shell in the form of/uni00A0loss of productivity, loss of intellectual property, regulatory fines and reputational damage. As a result, we continuously measure and, where required, further improve our cyber-security capabilities to reduce the likelihood of successful cyber attacks. Our cyber-security capabilities are/uni00A0embedded into our IT systems, which are protected by various detective and protective technologies. The identification and assessment capabilities are built into our support processes and adhere to industry best practices. The security of IT services, operated by external IT companies, is managed through contractual clauses and additionally through formal supplier assurance reports for critical IT services.\n\nShell is frequently subjected to cyber attacks and since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have noticed an increase in such activity. COVID-19 necessitated a switch from office to remote working, which changed and increased the IT systems' exposure to cyber threats. Shell's CyberDefence team responded by enhancing cyber-security controls for remote connectivity, strengthening its monitoring and detection, and taking additional measures to improve cyber awareness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See 'Risk factors' on page 28.\n\n## BRAND VALUE\n\nIn January 2022, Shell's brand value was estimated at $49.9 billion in Brand Finance Global 500 2022, the annual report by leading brand valuation consultancy Brand Finance. This was up 18% compared with 2021, and up 36% compared with 2017. According to the valuation, the Shell brand remains the most valued in the oil and gas industry. The gap to/uni00A0second place widened from $4.7 billion in 2021 to $6.3 billion in 2022. The report also showed that Shell's brand rating is AAA- in 2022, which is/uni00A0reduced from AAA in 2021.",

Our/uni00A0governance is designed to effectively manage our transition to a/uni00A0net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nOur governance begins with the Board's approval of our energy transition strategy and oversight of its implementation and delivery. In 2021, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year when reviewing and/uni00A0guiding our energy transition strategy, assessing the risk management policies in place, and challenging and endorsing the business plans and budgets, including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and/uni00A0divestments. In 2021, the Board convened 12 times and continued to regularly oversee the Powering Progress Strategy and net-zero initiatives, including at the Board Strategy Day in June 2021.\n\nThree Board committees provide primary oversight of the delivery of our energy transition strategy: the Safety, Environmental and Sustainability Committee (SESCo), the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee. See 'Climate change governance organogram' below.\n\nSESCo provides oversight of our technical delivery in driving reduction of our carbon emissions, and the potential impacts and adaptation measures related to the physical risks of climate change. This includes reviewing our Carbon Management Framework and monitoring progress in reducing emissions to meet targets. SESCo met 13 times in 2021 and discussed climate-related matters at nine meetings. After each meeting the SESCo Chair provided updates to the Board directly. For more information on/uni00A0SESCo's activities in 2021, see page 152.\n\nOur Audit Committee provides oversight of the effectiveness of our internal controls and risk management framework to ensure that our\n\nfinancial statements reflect the risks and opportunities associated with/uni00A0our/uni00A0energy transition strategy and climate change. During 2021, the/uni00A0Audit Committee convened 11 times in total and discussed climaterelated matters on at least six occasions.\n\n- More information on our Audit Committee's activities in 2021 can/uni00A0be/uni00A0found in the Audit Committee Report on page 156.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sets our remuneration policy and targets designed to challenge and support management to reduce our carbon emissions while maintaining shareholder value. The Remuneration Committee met five times during 2021, with climate-related matters discussed at each meeting.\n\n- Find more information on our Remuneration Committee's activities in 2021 in the 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on page 167 and the 'Annual Report on Remuneration' on page 171.\n\n## Climate performance and remuneration\n\nClimate-related key performance indicators were considered as part of the 2021 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting) for almost all of Shell's employees, as well as the 2021 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards (10% weighting) and the 2021 Long-term Incentive Plan (20% weighting, vesting in 2023) for senior executives.\n\n- See 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on pages 166-170 for further information.\n\nThe importance of our energy transition strategy means that all of these committees are informed about climate-related matters on a frequent basis throughout the year.\n\n- Find additional information on the Board's oversight in 'Governance framework' on page 135.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S ROLE IN ASSESSING AND MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has the delegated authority from the Board to manage Shell's actions in relation to the Company's strategy, which includes climate change. The CEO is assisted by a number of senior/uni00A0management positions on climate-related matters to implement Shell's/uni00A0energy transition strategy and ensure that such matters are appropriately monitored:\n\n- \u25a0 The Downstream Director identifies climate-related opportunities while/uni00A0managing and mitigating the climate risks of our existing Downstream businesses. The Sectors and Decarbonisation organisation supports the Downstream Director in implementing the/uni00A0sectoral decarbonisation approach.\n- \u25a0 The Director of Strategy, Sustainability and Corporate Relations supports the CEO in developing Shell's energy transition strategy, including climate scenarios development, and augmenting the Company's Carbon Management Framework. This framework includes/uni00A0the setting of carbon budgets for our businesses, and the/uni00A0implementation of carbon-related activities.\n- \u25a0 The Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions Director is responsible for finding and developing low-carbon solutions and opportunities, including those across our solar, hydrogen and wind businesses, as well as managing and mitigating carbon emissions from/uni00A0our business.\n- \u25a0 The Projects & Technology (P&T) Director is responsible for setting emissions, climate, and reporting standards that are applicable to all our businesses. The P&T Director is also responsible for developing new technologies that will help our businesses to deliver net-zero emissions targets through both energy efficiency measures and research and development activities geared towards decarbonisation.\n- \u25a0 The Upstream Director is responsible for identifying low-carbon and emission reduction opportunities in our Upstream oil and gas business through managing and mitigating our carbon emissions, for example, by eliminating routine flaring and in some cases by using renewable energy to power our oil and gas extraction activities.\n- \u25a0 The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is responsible for monitoring the effective application of the Shell Control Framework, which provides the basis for managing our material risks including climate-related risks and opportunities, and the assurance over our financial information, carbon emissions and climate-related disclosures.\n\n## Delivering through three strategic pillars\n\n- \u25a0 The Capital Investment Committee (CIC) facilitates the portfolio management discussions to ensure that the climate risks and opportunities are embedded in investment decision-making. This/uni00A0committee is made up of senior executives, including the CEO,/uni00A0CFO, and individual business directors.\n\nThere are two key supporting management committees, with/uni00A0representatives from across the organisation:\n\n- \u25a0 The Carbon Reporting Committee (CRC), which was formed in 2021,/uni00A0is/uni00A0sponsored by the CFO, and includes senior management representatives from business units, Projects & Technology climaterelated disciplines and various functions such as Strategy, Finance and/uni00A0Legal. This committee is tasked with ensuring that greenhouse gas/uni00A0(GHG) emissions measures, both absolute emissions and carbon intensity, and associated metrics, comply with all regulatory and legal/uni00A0requirements. The CRC is responsible at Group level for effectively embedding Group-wide training plans, measurement and/uni00A0reporting of/uni00A0GHG emissions metrics, and review and approval of/uni00A0external disclosures.\n\nOur network of country chairs supports the overall governance and development of climate-related opportunities. They set each country's energy transition strategy within our Powering Progress strategy.\n\n## Processes by which management is informed about climate-related issues\n\nSeveral processes are employed across the organisation to ensure that/uni00A0management teams can effectively monitor and manage climaterelated matters. The management teams are helped by a combination of/uni00A0carbon-management-related standards and frameworks, forums at/uni00A0various levels of the organisation, and capability development programmes. These include our Carbon Management Framework, carbon/uni00A0pricing, and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and Energy Management Manual.\n\n## Carbon Management Framework\n\nIn 2021, we worked on augmenting our comprehensive Carbon Management Framework (CMF). The CMF seeks to implement an approach to managing and reducing our emissions that is similar to/uni00A0how we use our financial framework.\n\nThis helps to ensure that management considers carbon emissions when making decisions.\n\nThe CMF helps set carbon budgets in our operating plan. For the 2021 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity (NCI) targets were translated into Scope 1, 2 and 3 (see definition below) carbon budgets for each business. These were used as boundaries for optimising each business' operating plan. As a result, the CMF makes it easier to assess the trade-offs between emitting carbon and generating value. This helps to inform portfolio decisions.\n\nSome examples of how our decarbonisation targets are taken into/uni00A0account in fundamental decisions across the organisation are/uni00A0as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Certain assets are required to identify GHG abatement opportunities and reflect them in their annual business plans.\n- \u25a0 Our businesses further embedded carbon emissions objectives in/uni00A0their individual business units' Capital, Portfolio and Carbon forums. The forums consist of the most senior business management representatives who are responsible for active portfolio management through evaluation, and delivery of growth and divestment decisions.\n\n## Definition - Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\n\n- \u25a0 Scope 1: direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or/uni00A0controlled by Shell.\n\nWe follow the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which defines three scopes of GHG emissions:\n\n- \u25a0 Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions from generation of purchased energy consumed by Shell.\n- \u25a0 Scope 3: other indirect GHG emissions, including emissions associated with the use of energy products sold by Shell.\n\nt",

We have developed country-specific short-medium and long-term estimates of/uni00A0future costs of carbon which are reviewed and updated annually. In 2021, we increased the expected cost of carbon, so by 2050, in real terms our cost of carbon estimates for all countries increased to between $125 and $200 per tonne of GHG emissions. The process for developing our cost of carbon estimates uses short-term policy outlooks and long-term scenario forecasts. We believe our estimates appropriately reflect society's current implementation of the Paris Agreement. Unfortunately, however, society is not yet on track to/uni00A0meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Shell will continue to update the cost of carbon estimates to take account of changes in/uni00A0the economic environment and pace of energy transition.\n\n## Greenhouse gas and energy management\n\nEach Shell entity and Shell-operated venture is responsible for the/uni00A0development of their GHG and energy management plans.\n\nIn 2021, we updated our Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management standard. It is part of both our health, safety, security,/uni00A0environment, and social performance (HSSE & SP) Control/uni00A0Framework, and Asset Management System. This update streamlines accountabilities for GHG and energy management within businesses, assets and projects, tightening the process for analysing our emissions, benchmarking performance, identifying improvement opportunities, and forecasting future performance.\n\nShell's GHG and energy management process is integrated into our/uni00A0annual business planning cycles to provide leadership with the robust information required to make decisions on GHG reduction opportunities and portfolio choices required to achieve our decarbonisation targets.\n\nWe also created the position of a Global Process Owner for GHG/uni00A0and energy management within our Safety, Environment and/uni00A0Carbon, and Asset Management (SEAM) organisation. The/uni00A0Global Process Owner is responsible for working across Shell/uni00A0businesses to ensure the GHG and energy management requirements are adopted and embedded in business operations, planning, and performance management processes. The Global Process Owner also facilitates the ongoing improvement of processes, tools, communications, and capabilities needed within/uni00A0the businesses to achieve our decarbonisation aspirations.\n\nShell will continue to update its cost of carbon estimates to take account of changes in the pace of energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur GHG & Energy Management process is integrated into our annual business planning cycle.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## ENERGY TRANSITION STRATEGY\n\nIn 2021, we announced Powering Progress, our strategy to accelerate our/uni00A0transition to a net-zero emissions energy business, purposefully and profitably. Powering Progress aims to deliver value for our shareholders, for our customers and for wider society.\n\n- See the 'Strategy and outlook' for more information on page 12.\n\n## Our strategy aims to support the ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement\n\nTackling climate change is an urgent challenge. It requires a/uni00A0fundamental transformation of the global economy and the energy system so that society stops adding to the total amount of/uni00A0greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, achieving what is known/uni00A0as net-zero emissions. That is why Shell has set a target to/uni00A0become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step/uni00A0with society's progress in/uni00A0achieving the goal of the Paris/uni00A0Agreement on climate change.\n\nThere is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature limit goal of the Paris Agreement. In the absence of a broadly accepted standard, we developed our own approach to demonstrate Paris alignment by setting carbon intensity targets using a pathway derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios aligned with the Paris Agreement's goal. We believe our NCI and/uni00A0absolute emissions targets support the more ambitious goal of/uni00A0the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the average global temperature to/uni00A01.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It/uni00A0is/uni00A0aligned with the/uni00A0findings of the IPCC which concluded that the/uni00A0world must reach net-zero carbon emissions by around 2050 to/uni00A0limit global warming to/uni00A01.5 degrees Celsius and avoid the worst/uni00A0effects of climate change.\n\nWe determined our targets using scenarios taken from a database developed for the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C. We filtered out certain outlying IPCC scenarios to ensure that Shell's targets are aligned with earlier action, and lowovershoot scenarios. Overshoot refers to the extent to which a/uni00A0scenario exceeds an emissions budget and subsequently relies/uni00A0on/uni00A0sinks to compensate for the excess emissions.\n\nBecoming a net-zero emissions energy business means that we are/uni00A0reducing emissions from our operations, and from the fuels and/uni00A0other energy products such as electricity that we sell to our customers. It also means capturing and storing any remaining emissions using technology, protecting natural carbon sinks, and providing high quality nature-based solutions to our customers to/uni00A0offset unavoidable emissions.\n\nIncreasing numbers of countries and companies have announced targets to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century, and we are starting to see some changes in the demand and supply/uni00A0of energy. Achieving the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal will be/uni00A0challenging and require unprecedented global collaboration. The pace of change will also vary around the world.\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED BY SHELL OVER THE SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG TERM\n\nOur target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in/uni00A0step with society's progress, requires us to continue enhancing our/uni00A0strategic risk management approach to addressing climate risk. Our/uni00A0energy transition strategy is designed to help us identify and shape/uni00A0how we can assist with decarbonising our customer sectors. This/uni00A0means that our strategy is shaped in response to risks and opportunities identified across the sectors and regions we work in.\n\nThere are many teams across Shell involved in this process, to ensure that/uni00A0we make sound strategic decisions.\n\nThe process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities is set out under 'Climate Risk Management' below. Through this process, Shell continues to identify climate change and the associated energy transition as a material risk based on the rapidly evolving societal concerns and developments related to climate change and managing GHG emissions. These developments expose Shell to a variety of factors, which could have an impact on demand for our products, our operational costs, supply chains, markets, regulatory environment, licences to operate and litigation. This risk is composed of a combination of complex elements that affect Shell's overall business value chain. The risks are interrelated, and generally describe a rapidly evolving risk landscape for our asset, product and business portfolio. To achieve our climate ambition, active holistic management of all climate-related risk components is important. The composite risk is broken down into the following sub-components:\n\n- \u25a0 regulatory risk;\n- \u25a0 commercial risk;\n- \u25a0 societal risk (including litigation risk); and\n- \u25a0 physical risk.\n\nIn addition to risk, we also continue to identify opportunities for Shell in/uni00A0the/uni00A0energy transition, from our existing position as a leading global energy provider. These risks and opportunities are described below and are also/uni00A0summarised in the strategic risks report section on page 23.\n\n## Time horizons: short, medium and long\n\n- \u25a0 Short term (up to three years): we develop detailed financial projections and use them to manage performance and expectations on/uni00A0a three-year cycle. These projections incorporate decarbonisation measures required to meet our short-term targets.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty, and the pervasive nature of the risks across our strategy and business model, the climate-related risks and opportunities are monitored across multiple time horizons.\n\n- \u25a0 Medium term (generally three to 10 years): embedded within our operating plan, with our continued focus on the customer, the investments and portfolio shifts required in the medium term that will fundamentally reshape Shell's portfolio. At the same time, our existing asset base is expected to provide the cash flow to finance this transition of our revenue in this period.\n- \u25a0 Long term (generally beyond 10 years): it is expected that our portfolio and product mix will look very different, addressing the shift from an asset-based approach to a customer-based business model.\n\nt",

An excess of/uni00A0supply over demand could reduce fossil fuel prices./uni00A0This could be a factor contributing to additional provisions for our assets and result in/uni00A0lower/uni00A0earnings, cancelled projects and potential/uni00A0impairment of certain assets\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED REGULATORY RISK\n\n## Changing preferences of investors and financial institutions\n\nFinancial institutions are increasingly aligning their portfolios to a low-carbon and net-zero world, driven/uni00A0by both regulatory and broader stakeholder pressures. A failure to decarbonise the business portfolios in line with investor and lender expectations could have a material adverse effect on/uni00A0our ability to use financing for these types of future/uni00A0projects. This could also adversely affect our/uni00A0potential partners' ability to finance their portion/uni00A0of costs, either through equity or debt.\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy will increase the cost of compliance for our assets and/or products, and may include restrictions on the use of hydrocarbons. The lack of net-zero-aligned global and national policies and frameworks increases the uncertainty around this risk.\n\n## Potential material impacts on the organisation\n\n## Increased compliance costs\n\nSome governments have introduced carbon pricing mechanisms, which we believe can be an effective way to reduce GHG emissions across the economy at the lowest overall cost to society.\n\nShell's cost of compliance with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and related schemes was around $331 million in 2021, as recognised in Shell's Consolidated Statement of Income for 2021 (see Note 31 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements').\n\nShell's annual carbon cost exposure is expected to/uni00A0increase over the next decade because of evolving carbon regulations. The forecasted annual cost exposure in 2030 is estimated to be within the range/uni00A0of $1.0-2.5 billion. This estimate is based on/uni00A0a/uni00A0forecast of Shell's equity share of emissions from operated and non-operated assets (including joint ventures and associates), and real-terms carbon cost estimates which range from around $25 to around $200 per tonne of GHG emissions in 2030. This exposure also takes into account the estimated impact of free allowances as relevant to assets based/uni00A0on their location.\n\n## Restrictions on use of hydrocarbons\n\nWith around 90% of the global economy now signed/uni00A0up to net-zero commitments as of January 2022, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit of the UK, there is an ever-increasing threat that governments set future regulatory frameworks that restrict further exploration and production of hydrocarbons, and bring in controls to/uni00A0limit the use of/uni00A0such products. Failure to replace proved reserves could result in an accelerated decrease of future/uni00A0production, which could have a/uni00A0material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows/uni00A0and/uni00A0financial condition.\n\n## Relevant time horizon:\n\nMedium\n\nLong\n\n## Remaining in step with the pace and extent of/uni00A0the energy transition\n\nThe energy transition provides us with significant opportunities, as described in the 'Transition opportunities' below. If we fail to stay in step with the/uni00A0pace and extent of change or customer and other/uni00A0stakeholders' demand for low-carbon products, this could adversely affect our reputation and future earnings. If we move much faster than society, we risk/uni00A0investing in technologies, markets or low-carbon products that are unsuccessful, therefore we cannot transition too quickly or we will be trying to sell products that customers do not want. This could also have a material adverse effect on financial results.\n\nOur short-term remuneration targets are not conditioned by society's progress towards net zero. However, our 2050 net zero target is conditioned by society's progress as there is significant risk that Shell will not be able to meet its net-zero target if society is not net zero.\n\n## Relevant time horizon:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lack of net-zero-aligned global and national policies and frameworks\n\nThe lack of net-zero-aligned global and national policies and frameworks increases the uncertainty around how carbon pricing and other regulatory mechanisms will be implemented in the future. This/uni00A0makes it harder to determine the appropriate assumptions to be taken into account in our financial planning and investment decision processes.",

This is likely to include class action lawsuits or/uni00A0similar/uni00A0litigation.\n\n## Potential material impacts on the organisation\n\n## Decline in reputation and brand\n\nSocietal expectations of businesses are increasing, with a focus on business ethics, quality of products, contribution to society, safety and minimising damage to the environment. There is an increasing focus on the role of the oil and gas sector in the context of climate change and the energy transition. This could negatively affect our brand, reputation and licence to operate, which could limit our ability to deliver our strategy, reduce consumer demand for our branded and non-branded products, harm our ability to secure new resources and contracts, and/uni00A0restrict our ability to access capital markets or/uni00A0attract staff.\n\n## Physical risks\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED PHYSICAL RISK\n\nThe potential physical effects of climate change may impact Shell's assets, operations, supply chains, employees and markets.\n\n## Potential material impacts on the organisation\n\nMitigation of physical risks, whether or not related to/uni00A0climate change, are considered and embedded in/uni00A0the design and construction of assets. The potential impact of physical changes come from both acute and chronic physical risks.\n\nAcute risks, such as flooding and droughts, wildfires and more severe tropical storms, could potentially impact our operations and supply chains. The frequency of these hazards and impacts is expected to increase in certain high-risk locations. Extreme weather events, whether or not related to climate change, could have a negative impact on earnings. Recent examples in 2021 include the Texas winter storm and Hurricane Ida. These had an impact on our/uni00A0operations and an adverse impact on 2021 earnings of around $200 million and around $400/uni00A0million respectively.\n\n## Deteriorating relationships with key stakeholders\n\nFailure to decarbonise Shell's value chain in line with societal, governmental and investor expectations is a/uni00A0material risk to Shell's reputation as a responsible and market-leading energy company. The impact of this risk includes shareholder divestment, greater regulatory scrutiny and potential asset closure resulting from public interest groups' protests.\n\nChronic risks, such as rising temperatures and rising sea levels, could potentially impact the efficiency of/uni00A0our plants, increase equipment corrosion, decrease gas pipeline capacity, and impact our coastal facilities. The assets at highest risk from these impacts are those in coastal locations across refining, We have performed analyses addressing a range of typical climate change features for a select group of assets. We concluded that currently any adaptation costs for those selected assets are not expected to/uni00A0be/uni00A0significant. We recognise that we need to deepen and widen these analyses for a more comprehensive climate resilience assessment. We/uni00A0continue to monitor this and plan to conduct further analysis on other assets as well as assess long-term physical impacts.\n\n## Relevant time horizon:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Class action lawsuits and litigation\n\nThere is an increasing risk for oil and gas companies from public, private and governmental lawsuits taken to inhibit the exploration, excavation and processing of hydrocarbons as a matter of environmental and societal welfare. Such action may force entities to hand over strategic autonomy in part to regulators, divest from hydrocarbon technologies and pay large compensation packages to the plaintiff.\n\nIn some countries, governments, regulators, organisations and individuals have filed lawsuits seeking to hold oil and gas companies liable for costs associated with climate change. While we believe these lawsuits to be without merit, losing could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nFor example, in May 2021, the District Court in The Hague, Netherlands, ruled that, by 2030, Shell must reduce, from its consolidated subsidiaries, its net Scope 1 emissions by 45% and use it best efforts to reduce its net Scope 2 and net Scope 3 emissions by 45%, compared with 2019 levels. In 2019, our Scope 1 emissions from our consolidated subsidiaries were 86 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO/uni2082e) (rounded) (financial control basis).\n\n## Relevant time horizon:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditionally, the impact of physical climate change on our operations is unlikely to be limited to the boundaries of our assets. The overall impact including how supply chains, resource availability and markets may be affected also needs to be considered, for a holistic assessment of this risk. The risk assessment and mitigation actions are based on our current understanding and we continue to track ongoing research on the subject to update our assessment and actions.\n\nt",

Our research and development (R&D) activities are key to achieving our/uni00A0net-zero emissions target.\n\nAs we shift from an asset-based to a customerfocused business model our current key focus areas/uni00A0for seizing this opportunity are:\n\n## 1. Renewables and Energy Solutions\n\nThis encompasses our wind, solar, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage businesses. Electricity generated by wind and solar power plays a direct role in reducing emissions in passenger transport and parts of industry. It can also be used to create hydrogen. We expect hydrogen to present a business opportunity for heavy-duty road freight over a shorter time horizon and within shipping, industry and, possibly, aviation, over a longer time horizon. Hydrogen also has the potential to become a material part of Shell's business-to-business (B2B) operations, as heavy industry begins to transition away from energy sourced from hydrocarbons.\n\nShell and our joint venture Ra\u00edzen (Shell interest 44%,/uni00A0not operated by Shell) are together one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels. Shell plans to continue to invest in and increase the/uni00A0production of these low-carbon fuels.  Our low-carbon fuels projects and operations around the world form part of a wider commitment to provide a range of energy choices for customers. For example, we believe that sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) provide the most effective way of removing emissions within the aviation sector, with wider adoption of SAF enabling us to provide more low-carbon fuels to our customers. Biofuels may also present opportunities in/uni00A0the shipping, road freight and other sectors.\n\n## IMPACT OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES/uni00A0ON SHELL'S BUSINESSES, STRATEGY/uni00A0AND/uni00A0FINANCIAL PLANNING\n\nThe transformation of the energy system to net-zero emissions will require simultaneous action in three areas - an unprecedented improvement in the efficiency with which energy is used, a sharp reduction in the carbon intensity of the energy mix and the mitigation of residual emissions using technology and natural sinks. While it is difficult to predict the exact combination of actions that will deliver the net-zero goal, scenarios help/uni00A0us/uni00A0to understand the direction and pace of the transition needed.\n\nWe have been developing scenarios within Shell for almost 50 years, helping Shell leaders to explore ways forward and make better decisions./uni00A0Shell scenarios are designed to stretch management's thinking in considering events that may be only remotely possible. They help them/uni00A0make crucial choices in times of uncertainty and transition as/uni00A0we/uni00A0grapple with tough energy and environmental issues.\n\nShell scenarios are aligned to different energy transition pathways and/uni00A0help guide risk and opportunity identification and decision-making. Our/uni00A0energy transformation scenarios - Waves, Islands and Sky 1.5 are/uni00A0all possible pathways towards the future that have both attractive and/uni00A0challenging features. Out of the three scenarios, Sky 1.5 has a pace and timing for energy decarbonisation that is fast enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of/uni00A0this century. The full report can be found at www.shell.com/ transformationscenarios.\n\n## Relevant time horizon:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Natural gas\n\nShifting from coal and oil to natural gas is one way for countries to take action as the world moves to a net-zero emissions future. It is a key component of the energy transition. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) is expected to grow and we are a leading LNG supplier, with around 40 million tonnes of equity/uni00A0capacity.\n\n## 4. Transforming refineries into energy and chemicals parks\n\nAn important aim of our Powering Progress strategy is/uni00A0to transform refineries into energy and chemicals parks so that we can sell more low-carbon and sustainable products.\n\nDifferent socio-economic and technological parameters are used to/uni00A0construct these scenarios, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 future trajectory of oil consumption, demand for natural gas;\n- \u25a0 sectoral and regional energy demand;\n- \u25a0 renewable electricity demand and the pace of the electrification of/uni00A0the/uni00A0global energy system;\n- \u25a0 pace of uptake of electric vehicles;\n- \u25a0 supply of solar and wind energy;\n- \u25a0 demand for biofuels;\n- \u25a0 level of carbon capture and storage;\n- \u25a0 growth of the hydrogen economy;\n- \u25a0 deployment of lower-carbon energy technologies; and\n- \u25a0 global trade of oil and gas.\n\nManagement consideration of different climate change outcomes informs a range of areas including, but not limited to, the setting of the long-term strategy, business planning, and investment and divestment decisions.

At/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group level, the potential impacts of the energy transition on/uni00A0our/uni00A0business model are discussed and assessed at the Board and/uni00A0the/uni00A0Executive Committee level as part of the annual strategic and/uni00A0business planning cycle. This assessment allows us to challenge accepted ways of/uni00A0thinking, identify material risks and opportunities, and/uni00A0formulate key/uni00A0tensions and trade-offs.\n\n## Key financial and non-financial components of business planning\n\nThe output of our annual business planning process is presented and approved by the Board. The plan contains operational and financial metrics, and its objective is to drive delivery of our Powering Progress strategy.\n\nDecarbonisation targets are key inputs of our business planning process. Each business owner offers viable Scope 1, 2 and 3 reduction opportunities as part of this process, in line with the Carbon Management Framework (CMF) (see page 77).\n\nThe business plan is underpinned by assumptions about internal and external parameters. These assumptions are developed with input from our scenarios and internal estimates and outlooks. Some/uni00A0of the key assumptions relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 refining margins;\n- \u25a0 commodity prices;\n- \u25a0 production levels and product demand;\n- \u25a0 future carbon costs;\n- \u25a0 exchange rates;\n- \u25a0 the schedules of capital investment programmes; and\n- \u25a0 risks and opportunities that may have material impacts on/uni00A0free/uni00A0cash flow.\n\nThe level of uncertainty around these assumptions increases over/uni00A0longer time horizons.\n\n## Impact on business and financial planning\n\nThere is no one single scenario that underpins Shell's business and financial planning. Generally, our scenarios are designed to stretch management's thinking including considering events that may be only remotely possible. Scenarios are not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes and, therefore, are not the basis for Shell's operating plans and financial statements. Our scenarios help in developing our future oil and gas pricing outlooks. The oil and gas pricing outlooks take account of various factors relating to the energy transition such as potential changes in supply and demand (see details of scenario parameters above). The low, medium and high pricing outlooks are prepared by a team of experts, reviewed by the Shell Executive Committee and approved by the CEO and CFO. The medium pricing outlook represents management's reasonable best estimate and is/uni00A0the/uni00A0basis for Shell's financial statements, operating plans and impairment/uni00A0testing.\n\nShell's targets to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis, and 20% reduction of net carbon intensity of Scope 3 emissions by 2030 have been included in Shell's operating plan. Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement requires the global economy to transform in a number of complex and connected ways. Shell will continue to revise its operating plan, price outlooks and/uni00A0assumptions as it moves towards net-zero emissions by 2050, in/uni00A0step/uni00A0with society.\n\nMeeting the goals of the Paris Agreement requires the global economy to/uni00A0transform in a number of complex and connected ways. We continue to/uni00A0update our analysis and the corresponding price outlooks and business plans, in line with our strategy and in step with society.\n\nAs described in 'Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by/uni00A0Shell/uni00A0over the short, medium and long term', the low pricing outlooks could result in increased commercial, regulatory and societal risks, as well/uni00A0as transition opportunities. How these risks are prioritised is described in 'Shell's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks'. Given our ambition to become a net-zero emissions energy business by/uni00A02050, in step with society, the use of low-pricing outlooks is a part of/uni00A0our resilience testing and resulting actions. Physical risk is expected to/uni00A0be more material in higher temperature scenarios.\n\n## RESILIENCE OF SHELL'S STRATEGY, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION DIFFERENT CLIMATE-RELATED SCENARIOS, INCLUDING A TWO DEGREES CELSIUS OR/uni00A0LOWER SCENARIO\n\nShell's financial strength and access to capital give us the ability to reshape our portfolio as the energy system transforms and demand changes. They also allow us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets.\n\nWe are shifting capital from our Upstream business to our Transition and/uni00A0Growth businesses as the energy transition accelerates and we sell/uni00A0more low-carbon energy products. We aim to find the right balance between managing our Upstream assets - which will produce the returns needed to/uni00A0help us fund the transition - and investing in our Transition and/uni00A0Growth businesses. These businesses are essential to identify, build and scale up profitable projects that offer low-carbon energy solutions for/uni00A0our customers.\n\nt",

This provides an overarching/uni00A0summary of the key areas where climate change and/uni00A0the/uni00A0energy transition impact Shell's financial statements.\n\nShell's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future. As/uni00A0referred to above, the medium pricing outlook informed by Shell's scenario planning represents management's best estimate.\n\nSensitivity analysis using external climate scenarios has been performed for the period covering asset life cycles. If these different price outlooks from external and often normative climate change scenarios were used, this would impact the recoverability of certain assets recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2021.\n\nPrice outlooks have been used as the basis for sensitivity analysis because oil and gas prices are one of the key assumptions that underpin Shell's financial statements. Price outlooks reflect a broad range of factors, including but not limited to future supply and demand and the pace of growth of low-carbon solutions. Sensitivity of asset-carrying amounts to prices are under the assumption that all other factors in the models used to/uni00A0calculate impacts remain unchanged. Changes to prices are applied due to the significant impact on Shell's business.\n\nSensitivity analysis has been performed using price outlooks from:\n\n- 1.  Average prices from four 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate change/uni00A0scenarios. In view of the broad range of price outlooks across the various scenarios, the average of four external price outlooks was/uni00A0taken from IHS Markit/ACCS 2021; Woodmac WM AET 2 degree; IEA NZE50; and IEA SDS.\n\nApplying these prices to Integrated Gas assets of $65 billion and/uni00A0Upstream assets of $89 billion as at December 31, 2021, shows recoverable amounts that are $13-16 billion and $14-17 billion lower, respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2021.\n\n- 2.  Hybrid Shell Plan and IEA NZE50: for this Shell's mid-price outlook is/uni00A0applied for the next 10 years. Because of the greater uncertainty, the/uni00A0International Energy Agency (IEA) normative Net Zero Emissions scenario is applied for the period after 10 years. This weights less price-risk uncertainty to the first 10 years reflected in the operating plan period and applies more risk to the more uncertain subsequent periods.\n\nApplying this priceline to Integrated Gas assets of $65 billion and/uni00A0Upstream assets of $89 billion as at December 31, 2021, shows recoverable amounts that are 10-12 billion and $5-6 billion lower, respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2021.\n\nIn addition, further sensitivities are provided of -10% or +10% to Shell's medium pricing outlook, as an average percentage over the full period.\n\nApplying -10% to Shell's medium pricing outlook to Integrated Gas assets of $65 billion and Upstream assets of $89 billion as at December 31, 2021, shows recoverable amounts that are $8-10 billion and $4-5 billion lower, respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2021.\n\nApplying +10% to Shell's medium pricing outlook to Integrated Gas assets of $65 billion and Upstream assets of $89 billion as at December 31, 2021, shows recoverable amounts that are $3-5 billion and $3-4 billion higher, respectively, than the carrying amounts as at December 31, 2021.\n\nNote 4 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' describes how Shell has considered climate-related impacts in key areas of the financial statements and how this translates into the valuation of assets and measurement of liabilities as Shell makes progress in the energy transition.\n\nItems in Note 4 include: sensitivity analysis on asset-carrying values using/uni00A0price outlooks from external and often normative climate change scenarios; shifting trends in our portfolio, particularly exploration and evaluation, Upstream production and refineries; risks related to stranded assets; resilience of investments for transformation of the refining portfolio into five energy and chemical parks; forecasted taxable profits sufficient to/uni00A0recover deferred tax assets; dividend resilience; and limited risk on/uni00A0timing of decommissioning and restoration activities for Integrated Gas/uni00A0and Upstream.\n\nTo ensure the resilience of our Powering Progress strategy, our responses to the risks and opportunities identified are:\n\n- \u25a0 our sectoral decarbonisation approach - recognising that we need to/uni00A0work with our customers to identify low-carbon energy solutions for/uni00A0their energy demand; and\n- \u25a0 delivering through three strategic pillars - Upstream, Transition and/uni00A0Growth;\n- \u25a0 decarbonising our energy value chains and operations.",

Shell's financial strength and access to capital give us the ability to reshape our portfolio as the energy system transforms and demand changes. It also allows us to withstand volatility in oil and gas markets. Our financial framework is based on sector-leading cash flow, continued capital discipline, capital flexibility and a strong balance sheet.\n\n- \u25a0 Our Transition pillar comprises Integrated Gas, and our Chemicals and/uni00A0Oil Products businesses and it makes the products needed to enable the energy transition. It produces sustainable cash flow and gives us the asset infrastructure to support our investments in our Growth business.\n- \u25a0 Our Growth pillar includes our service stations, sales of gasoline and/uni00A0diesel, fuels for business customers, power, hydrogen, biofuels, charging for electric vehicles, nature-based solutions, and carbon capture and storage. It focuses on working with our customers to/uni00A0accelerate the transition to net zero and is the foundation for/uni00A0the/uni00A0future/uni00A0businesses in Shell.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See 'Strategy and outlook' for more information on page 14.\n\n## Our sectoral decarbonisation approach\n\nChanges to the supply of energy products and decarbonising the energy system require structural changes in the end-use of energy. This requires energy users to improve, update or replace equipment so that they can use carbon-based energy more efficiently, or switch to low- and zerocarbon energy.\n\nFor example, in the transport sector, decarbonisation includes replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electric and hydrogen vehicles. In/uni00A0the industrial sector, replacing oil- and coal-fired furnaces with electrical furnaces would be one solution, carbon capture and storage is another. And in the buildings sector, replacing gas heating systems with electric heating systems would also contribute to decarbonisation.\n\nSuch structural changes will help to trigger transitions along the supply chain of individual sectors and across sectors, including the production of/uni00A0energy and emissions over time. The International Energy Agency (IEA)/uni00A0estimates that these changes in the end-use of energy will require substantial investment. Under the IEA's Paris-aligned Sustainable Development Scenario, of the more than $1.5 trillion extra annual spending required on energy-sector investment, 55% will need to be spent on end-use or what is more commonly known as demand-side investment.\n\nTransforming energy demand is the focus of our decarbonisation strategy. To transform demand, we are working with customers sector-by-sector across the energy system. We will change the mix of energy products we/uni00A0sell to our customers as their needs for energy change.\n\nBecause emissions resulting from customer use of our energy products make up the greatest percentage of Shell's carbon emissions, this is where/uni00A0we can make the greatest contribution to the energy transition, by/uni00A0increasing sales of low-carbon energy products and services. Today, we/uni00A0sell around 4.6% of final energy consumed in the world and produce around 1.4% of total primary energy. Our share of energy production may/uni00A0decline over the coming decades, but we intend to increase our share/uni00A0of low-carbon energy sales.\n\nWe have restructured our company so that we can better identify opportunities and the role that we can play in each sector to help transform demand. We are moving from an approach focused on/uni00A0types/uni00A0of/uni00A0products to one where our customer and account management/uni00A0is/uni00A0focused on sectors.\n\nWe have introduced a sector-based approach, so our businesses can help/uni00A0drive the decarbonisation of the sectors they cover such as aviation, commercial road transport, passenger transport, shipping, technology and industry. We will build on our existing relationships across each sector, with consumers, infrastructure owners, other suppliers and policymakers to help to accelerate change.\n\nA key theme running through the whole of our strategic approach to/uni00A0climate change is to work collaboratively. We aim to make strategic alliances with customers, other companies and entire sectors so we and/uni00A0they can make profitable progress towards net zero.\n\nFor example, we are working with Swiss food and drinks group Nestl\u00e9/uni00A0to/uni00A0reduce emissions across the full cycle of their products, from/uni00A0increasing agricultural yields with high performance fertilisers, to/uni00A0providing renewable energy for the manufacturing process and providing low-carbon fuels for transport.\n\nWe continue to engage with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and we are a member of its Technical Working Group that is currently working to define its methodology to set science-based targets for the oil,/uni00A0gas and integrated energy sector.\n\nAs a founding member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI)/uni00A0we/uni00A0are part of a group of 12 national and international energy/uni00A0companies. OGCI supports the climate goals of the UN Paris/uni00A0Agreement/uni00A0and recognises that collective actions, such as the reduction/uni00A0in/uni00A0methane emissions and accelerating the deployment of/uni00A0carbon capture/uni00A0and storage, will help drive the energy transition.\n\n## Decarbonising our energy value chains and operations\n\n- \u25a0 developing our low-carbon Power business through wind and solar;\n\nWe plan to keep customers at the centre of our strategy as we decarbonise our energy value chains and operations. We will seek to/uni00A0base our actions on a deep understanding of the decarbonisation strategies and plans of the users of our energy products. In accordance with our energy transition strategy, the 10 ways below support our net-zero emissions ambition, including changing our product mix to lower-carbon intensity energy products:\n\n- \u25a0 transforming refineries into energy and chemicals parks;\n- \u25a0 producing and selling hydrogen;\n- \u25a0 providing low-carbon fuels;\n- \u25a0 providing electric vehicle charging;\n- \u25a0 using nature-based solutions;\n- \u25a0 shifting to natural gas;\n- \u25a0 developing carbon capture and storage (CCS);\n- \u25a0 pursuing operational efficiency in our assets.\n- \u25a0 research and development contributing to decarbonisation; and\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION\n\n## CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## SHELL'S PROCESSES FOR IDENTIFYING AND ASSESSING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identifying climate-related risks\n\n- \u25a0 commercial risks;\n\nAs discussed in 'Energy transition strategy', Shell considers climate change and GHG emissions, referred to as 'Rising concerns about climate/uni00A0change and effects of energy transition', as a material risk factor. We monitor the risk related to climate change and GHG emissions across four/uni00A0components:\n\n- \u25a0 regulatory risks;\n- \u25a0 physical risks.\n- \u25a0 societal risks (including litigation risk); and\n\nThese components are monitored and assessed on an integrated basis, necessitated by the interdependence of the risks and the related actions. The different components pose different kinds of exposures spanning different time horizons. Similarly, the risk responses for the different components of the risk are also planned by taking a holistic view.\n\nFor example, the increasing cost of complying with emission limits in some/uni00A0regions is a regulatory risk that may require operational responses in the near term. The reduction in demand for legacy hydrocarbons is a/uni00A0commercial risk that is likely to have a medium- to long-term impact, demanding changes to our strategic portfolio and business models. The risk of physical impacts of climate change is likely to occur in the medium and long term and would require actions to mitigate adverse impacts to/uni00A0our assets and supply chain. As an example, the transformation of our/uni00A0refineries into energy and chemicals parks mitigates our operational emissions exposure risk, medium- to long-term commercial risks and allows/uni00A0us to plan for other future adaptation measures. This highlights our/uni00A0integrated approach to risk management.\n\nThese integrated assessments and the resulting changes in our strategy ensure we manage our aggregate climate change risk within our overall risk appetite over different time horizons.\n\nShell's processes for identifying and assessing risks are part of our Shell Control Framework.\n\nOur risk management procedures that help us identify climate-related risks/uni00A0and opportunities include:\n\n- \u25a0 evaluating the status of risk indicators, which illustrate how well we are/uni00A0managing each component of the risk related to climate change and GHG emissions; and\n- \u25a0 monitoring external developments, such as the announcements made/uni00A0at COP26 in November 2021;\n- \u25a0 learning from incidents and assurance review findings.\n\nWe use these procedures to identify risks relating to climate change and GHG emissions, which in turn enables us to determine their significance, both individually and relative to other risks.\n\n## Assessing climate-related risks\n\nProcesses within the Shell Control Framework that help us assess each identified risk include the evaluation of its impact, likelihood and the level of risk we are willing to accept.\n\nWhen assessing the likelihood of a risk occurring, we consider factors such/uni00A0as our ability to prevent the risk happening, and whether the risk has/uni00A0materialised in the past.\n\nWhen assessing the potential impact of a risk, we consider the financial consequences and how it might affect more qualitative aspects, such as/uni00A0our reputation, our ability to comply with regulations, and possible damage to health, safety, our assets and the environment. The impact and/uni00A0hence, materiality of a risk is based on how critical it could be to/uni00A0our/uni00A0business model.\n\nAs Shell has operations both onshore and offshore, the potential physical/uni00A0impacts of climate change are also important for us to manage. In this respect, we consider the physical risks to our assets and facilities to/uni00A0ensure they can operate and be accessed safely under extreme weather conditions The physical risks are assessed at an asset level. Metocean (meteorology and oceanography) engineering experts assess/uni00A0and monitor the physical risks and logistical activities for certain of/uni00A0our assets. These studies aim to ensure our operations are safe and that/uni00A0our facilities can be accessed safely under extreme conditions\n\nAs we operate in multiple countries globally, societal risks are material as/uni00A0they are directly linked to our licence to operate in these countries.\n\nThe impact and likelihood assessment helps us to prioritise risks and determine their relative materiality, based on a comprehensive picture of all significant risks in the context of the objectives of the relevant business.\n\nTo support our risk assessments, we also seek to establish our risk appetite, which is the level of risk that we are willing to accept in pursuit of Shell's strategy and objectives. We consider the amount of resources - such as/uni00A0financial resources, people, processes, systems and controls - that we/uni00A0are/uni00A0willing and able to allocate to manage each risk in pursuit of our/uni00A0objectives. We also consider the impact to Shell's overall risk profile, such as the change in our overall risks and returns as we develop our Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses and pivot away from our/uni00A0Upstream business.\n\nThe impact and likelihood assessment, combined with risk appetite, determines the type of risk responses, such as controls and assurance activities, that may be required to manage each risk.\n\nPossible responses include:\n\n- \u25a0 mitigating or reducing the risk with appropriate controls, supported by/uni00A0assurance activities;\n- \u25a0 accepting the risk without any further action;\n- \u25a0 transferring the risk, for example to insurance providers where appropriate; and\n- \u25a0 altogether stopping or forgoing the activity that gives rise to the risk.\n\nIn determining our risk responses, we always seek to comply with our Code of Conduct and other boundaries, such as our financial framework, which set the aggregate level of risk appetite that could be sustained. The/uni00A0financial framework considers boundaries such as net debt levels and/uni00A0our credit rating.\n\nWe note that the majority of our emissions are our Scope 3 customer emissions which are outside of our direct control. In recognition of this, we/uni00A0have put customers at the centre of our Powering Progress strategy, partnering with others to reduce carbon emissions, sector-by-sector.",

        "page_content": "## Classifications of risks\n\nWe identify and assess risks across the Group in terms of three distinct categories:\n\n- \u25a0 operational risks: we consider material operational exposures across Shell's entire value chain which provides a more granular assessment of key risks that the organisation is facing.\n- \u25a0 strategic risks: we consider current and future portfolio issues, examining parameters such as country concentration or exposure/uni00A0to higher-risk countries. We also consider long-range developments in order to test key assumptions or beliefs in relation to energy markets.\n- \u25a0 conduct and culture risks: we consider alignment of our policies, practices and behaviours against our purpose and core values.\n\nThe four sub-components of risk related to climate change and GHG emissions - commercial, regulatory, societal including litigation, and physical risk - are assessed using the above categories to ensure that we maintain strategic resilience, have robust day-to-day operational risk responses and that responses align with Shell's purpose and core values.\n\n## SHELL'S PROCESSES FOR MANAGING CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS\n\nOur climate-related risk management process is carried out at Group level, at business, function and asset level which includes projects.\n\nWe apply the Shell Control Framework to ensure that we effectively manage our climate-related risks at all these levels. The framework includes:\n\n- \u25a0 project-level risk management processes;\n- \u25a0 mandatory risk standards and manuals;\n- \u25a0 management and Board review;\n- \u25a0 annual attestation processes.\n- \u25a0 internal audits and investigations; and\n\n## Mandatory risk standards and manuals\n\n- \u25a0 ensure consistent management and assessment of climate risk across/uni00A0Shell;\n\nWe have mandatory standards and manuals which establish the requirements on how to effectively manage material risks including the/uni00A0operation of appropriate controls. Our standards and manuals also/uni00A0provide guidance on how to monitor, communicate and report changes in/uni00A0the risk environment. These documents aim to:\n\n- \u25a0 clarify expectations for risk management and reporting, including roles/uni00A0and responsibilities of the risk owners;\n- \u25a0 strengthen decision-making by ensuring that businesses have better awareness and understanding of climate risks (including their likelihood and potential impact) and mitigation plans; and\n- \u25a0 clarify types of assurance activities that may be applicable;\n- \u25a0 enable integration of Shell's reporting.\n\nWe periodically review and, if necessary, update our standards and manuals in light of developments in risks associated with climate change. Our approach continues to evolve as we increase our understanding of/uni00A0changing policies and the differing pace of energy transition in different/uni00A0regions.\n\n## Project-level risk management processes\n\nAt a project level, assessing climate-related risks is an important part of/uni00A0making initial investment decisions. To support project-level risk management, projects of a certain size or which carry unusual risks are/uni00A0required to follow Shell's Opportunity Realisation Standard, which sets out/uni00A0the rules for managing and delivering opportunities in the organisation. Each project is assisted by experts from our global subject matter groups during their development, implementation and operation.\n\nProjects under development that are expected to have a material greenhouse gas impact must meet our internal carbon performance standards or industry benchmarks. This indicates that they will be able to/uni00A0compete and prosper in a future where society aims to limit overall carbon emissions.\n\nOur performance standards are used for measuring a project's average/uni00A0lifetime GHG-intensity or energy efficiency per asset type. Applying these/uni00A0criteria ensures that our projects can compete and prosper/uni00A0in the/uni00A0energy transition. An exception process is in place to/uni00A0manage specific/uni00A0incidental cases. The reporting year 2021 was the/uni00A0first/uni00A0full/uni00A0year/uni00A0of/uni00A0implementation of performance standards across our/uni00A0Upstream/uni00A0and/uni00A0Transition pillars. The performance standards for/uni00A0the/uni00A0Growth businesses are under development.\n\nThe performance standards are approved by the Executive Vice President accountable for implementation in the relevant businesses, and by the Executive Vice President Safety, Environment and Asset Management.\n\nProjects with a material greenhouse gas footprint that meet the performance standards or industry benchmarks will often set more ambitious emissions targets for themselves that then are approved by the/uni00A0Executive Vice President Safety, Environment and Asset Management at/uni00A0certain defined stages. The respective project's GHG abatement plan helps to determine the nature of these targets, and we assess the effects of/uni00A0a project's emissions alongside economic and technical design factors.\n\nWe estimate the future GHG emissions of projects in two ways. We apply the performance standards, and we consider the GHG emissions from the use of the products that are to be manufactured. These assessments can lead to projects being stopped or designs being changed.\n\nWe expect the performance standards to evolve as our portfolio changes in the energy transition.\n\n## Management and Board reviews\n\nManagement and the Board perform regular reviews of the risk of climate/uni00A0change and GHG emissions to ensure awareness of emerging issues that impact our strategy and to ensure the effectiveness of our responses in managing this risk at a more granular, operational level. For/uni00A0example, as part of the annual strategic planning cycle, the Executive Committee and the Board assess how climate and GHG emissions may affect the pace of the energy transition and the long-term implications for/uni00A0Shell's current portfolio.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nIn addition, at an operational level, each business and function regularly reviews its risk profile, risk responses and assurance activities throughout the year to ensure climate-related risks are managed effectively. These insights are used to provide the Executive Committee and Board with an update twice a year on the operational management of climate change and GHG emissions risks. During these updates, the Executive Committee and Board consider the significance of the climate change and GHG emissions risks relative to other risks on the Group risk profile and review whether our risk responses are effective in addressing the four subcomponents of the climate change and GHG emissions risk. Where necessary, Board reviews are further supplemented by additional in-depth/uni00A0reviews with the relevant management teams.\n\nOur management reviews help us to update Shell's forward-looking plans and guide our day-to-day operational decisions such as maintenance schedules and our risk response plans.\n\n## Internal audits and investigations processes\n\nShell's Internal Audit and Investigations (SIAI) team provides independent and objective assurance and advises management and the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management and internal controls.\n\nFor example, in relation to our climate ambitions, SIAI conducted four GHG audits during 2021 to test whether controls are adequately designed and operating effectively to mitigate the identified risks. The/uni00A0controls tested covered GHG emissions measurement and reporting, abatement projects and GHG forecasts. In addition, a SIAI-led Shell Energy audit focused on the reported gas and electricity volumes used/uni00A0for/uni00A0net carbon intensity calculations and reporting.\n\n## Annual attestation processes\n\nOn an annual basis, each business director is required to provide an annual attestation of their business' compliance with our Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) Control Framework and/uni00A0to report this to Shell's CEO. This includes the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls in managing climate-related risks.\n\n## Project-level risk management in action\n\nDuring project development stages, we consider ways to reduce GHG emissions and whether to include them in the design. Measures considered and adopted in 2021 included:\n\n- - Gbaran asset, Nigeria: improvement project including flare/uni00A0reduction and improved efficiency of power system;\n- \u25a0 flaring reduction:\n- \u25a0 CCS capabilities;\n- \u25a0 using renewable energy; and\n- \u25a0 exclusion of high-intensity process equipment;\n- \u25a0 electrification:\n- - Linnorm, Norway: plan evolves full electrification of a gas/uni00A0production platform; currently past conceptual design/uni00A0phase and expected to take FID in 2022; and\n- - Timi, Malaysia: financial investment decision (FID) taken on/uni00A0fully electrified wellhead platform for gas production;\n- - F6 Vlap, Malaysia: conceptual planning completed, aimed at/uni00A0implementing an extension of existing platform with improved power production to reduce GHG intensity. The/uni00A0FID is expected in 2022.\n\nWe also include considerations of potential physical climate change risks in the internal Design and Engineering Practice (DEP) requirements for new projects.\n\n## Physical risk management in action\n\nIn addition to the steps we are taking to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, we are also adapting to the changing physical risk environment. An example is:\n\nPort Fourchon Junction, USA, (comprising two Shell-operated ventures, with Shell interest of 75% in the Amberjack Pipeline Company and 71% in Mars Oil Pipeline/uni00A0Company). The Port Fourchon Junction facilities are located in the Mississippi Delta, one of the world's most vulnerable low-elevation coastal zones. These facilities are highly exposed to storm surge and wave-induced inundation under hurricanes which regularly visit the/uni00A0Gulf of Mexico. Another important factor is that the area experiences one of the largest rates of subsidence in the world, which, combined with sea level rise, could increase the site vulnerability in the coming decades. In 2021, Shell assessed the present and future scenarios of subsidence and sea level rise under extreme metocean conditions induced by hurricanes and their impact on Port Fourchon Junction. This led to a new project involving infrastructure changes. In 2021, it was developed past the conceptual design phase and is expected to take FID in 2022. The/uni00A0scope should allow for continued safe operations and accessibility to/uni00A0the location under different extreme circumstances which involves relocation of assets and raising all equipment as per/uni00A0metocean experts' recommendations.\n\n## INTEGRATION OF THE CLIMATE-RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS INTO SHELL'S OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nAs described above, our climate-related risk management process follows the approach set out by the Shell Control Framework, ensuring that it is integrated in the overall risk management processes of the Group.\n\nClimate-related risks are considered from a strategic and operational perspective to ensure we maintain a comprehensive view of the different types of climate risks we face and the different time horizons in which they may affect us.\n\nThe monitoring and review of risks is a key risk management process in Shell. The Executive Committee and the Board regularly review climaterelated risks against the Group's operational and strategic risk profile. This allows management to take a holistic view and to optimise risk mitigation responses, to ensure that climate-related risk responses are properly integrated into the relevant businesses' and functions' activities.",

Key metrics we use to track progress against our energy transition strategy are the/uni00A0net/uni00A0carbon intensity of our portfolio and our absolute emissions.\n\nThe other material climate-related risk relates to Shell's physical risk/uni00A0exposure. Currently, this response is managed at an asset level. We/uni00A0are continuing to establish a structured process for managing the/uni00A0physical risk of climate change across the Group. The process may/uni00A0include consideration of additional metrics and targets to monitor/uni00A0physical risk exposure.\n\nOur overall climate target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. It includes net-zero emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions), as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell (scope 3 emissions). We have set short, medium and long-term targets to track our performance against our overall climate target over time.\n\nWe believe our total absolute emissions peaked in 2018 at 1.73/uni00A0gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO/uni2082e) and our/uni00A0overall/uni00A0climate target means we will have to bring that down to/uni00A0absolute/uni00A0net-zero emissions by 2050, in step with society.\n\nIn October 2021, in support of our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we set/uni00A0a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 absolute emissions from assets and activities under our operational control (including divestments) by 50% by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. We monitor our progress against these targets using the key metrics described below.\n\n## Climate-related targets summary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- [A]  Our total emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3 equity boundary) peaked in 2018 at around 1.73 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO/uni2082e) per annum.\n- [C]  Overall methane emissions intensity for facilities with marketing gas.\n- [B]  Operational control boundary.\n- [D]  Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) based on the energy product sales included in Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) using equity boundary.\n- [E]  We aim to achieve these targets in step with society.\n\nt",

To a lesser extent, there is also a contrast between hydrocarbon fuels and biofuels, which can vary significantly in intensity depending on the feedstock and production process used.\n- \u25a0 For hydrocarbon fuels, emissions from end-use by customers are by far/uni00A0the biggest contributors to the carbon intensity of the product.

Our total Scope 3 emissions from energy products are/uni00A0largely unchanged from last year. The decrease in 2020 from 2019 mainly relates to a decrease in demand for oil products given market conditions in 2020, and a decrease related to volumes associated with/uni00A0additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes with effect from January 2020.\n\nOur strategy is based on working with our customers, sector-by-sector, to/uni00A0address the emissions from the use of our products and to help them find ways to reduce their emissions and overall carbon footprint to net zero by 2050.\n\n## TARGETS USED BY SHELL TO MANAGE CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGETS\n\nShell's material climate-related risks and opportunities are set out in the 'Climate-related risks and opportunities identified by Shell over the short, medium and long term' section. Our response to the transition risk focuses on decarbonising our value chain. Our climate targets are focused on reducing our net carbon intensity as well as our absolute emissions.\n\n## NCI target-setting\n\nTackling climate change is an urgent challenge. But only a transformation of the global economy and the energy system that supports it will stop the world adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, achieving what is known as net-zero emissions. That is why, for our part, Shell has set a target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society's progress in achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nWe believe our targets support the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement: to limit the increase in the global average temperature to\n\n## Working to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions\n\nScope 1-2 emissions in million tonnes per annum [A],[B]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- [A]  This chart assumes no adjustments to the base year\n- [B]  Operational control boundary\n\ntransformation\n\n1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Our net-zero target is aligned with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which concluded that the world must reach net-zero carbon emissions by around 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and avoid the worst effects of climate change.\n\nAs there is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets with the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, we have developed our own approach to demonstrate that our carbon intensity targets are aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C goal. We set our targets using scenarios taken from a database developed for the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C. We started with the complete range of IPCC 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, then chose scenarios that focused on earlier action and placed less reliance on the use of carbon sinks. We then calculated the carbon intensity of each of the selected scenarios and, after removing outlying values, used the resulting range of intensities to produce the final 1.5\u00b0C pathways used to set our targets.\n\nTo become a net-zero emissions energy business, we must reduce emissions from our operations, and from the fuels and other energy products such as electricity that we sell to our customers. We must also capture and store remaining emissions using either technology or natural carbon sinks.\n\nShell will work with our customers to help them accelerate their transition by providing low- and zero-carbon energy products and services. If they are not able to accelerate their transition, we will help our customers in other ways by providing high-quality, nature-based solutions to offset any unavoidable emissions. We know that even though we offer this service, our customers may choose to source offsets from other companies.\n\nToday, it is not possible for energy companies and their customers to jointly account for actions to reduce emissions. We will work with partners towards changing accounting and reporting protocols and developing new systems for suppliers and users of energy to exchange information about steps they are taking to reduce their emissions. These changes will/uni00A0take time to put into practice, and we reflect this in our targets which before 2035 include only mitigation actions directly involving Shell.\n\nt",

The/uni00A0intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the/uni00A0overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell, as described in Shell's climate target. The NCI is calculated on a life-cycle basis and as/uni00A0such includes GHG emissions - on an equity basis from/uni00A0several sources, including:\n\n- \u25a0 indirect GHG emissions from generation of energy consumed by/uni00A0Shell;/uni00A0and\n- \u25a0 indirect GHG emissions from the use of the products we sell.\n\nEmissions from other parts of the product life cycle are also included, such as those from the extraction, transport and processing of crude oil, gas or/uni00A0other feedstocks and the distribution of products to our customers.\n\nAlso included are emissions from parts of this life cycle not owned by Shell, such as the extraction of oil and gas processed by Shell but not produced by Shell; or from the production of oil products and electricity marketed by/uni00A0Shell that have not been processed or generated at a Shell facility.\n\nEmissions offset through various measures, such as by working with nature to create carbon sinks - including forests and wetlands - or mitigated by/uni00A0using CCS technology are also taken into account.\n\n- Refer to scope of NCI on page 90 for details of the supply chains and/uni00A0steps in the product life cycles that are included in the Net Carbon/uni00A0Footprint methodology.\n\nThe following GHG emissions are not included in the net carbon intensity/uni00A0(NCI):\n\n- \u25a0 emissions from third-party processing of sold intermediate products, such as the manufacture of plastics from feedstocks sold by Shell;\n- \u25a0 emissions from production, processing, use and end-of-life treatment of/uni00A0non-energy products, such as chemicals and lubricants;\n- \u25a0 emissions associated with the construction and decommissioning of/uni00A0production and manufacturing facilities;\n- \u25a0 other indirect emissions from waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, transmission and distribution losses associated with imported electricity, franchises and investments;\n- \u25a0 emissions associated with the production of fuels purchased to/uni00A0generate energy on site at a Shell facility;\n- \u25a0 emissions from capital goods, defined by the GHG Protocol as including fixed assets or property, plant and equipment (PP&E), and other goods and services not related to purchased energy feedstocks sourced from third parties or energy products manufactured by third parties and sold by Shell.\n\nThe NCI calculation uses Shell's energy product sales volume data, as disclosed in the Annual Report and Sustainability Report. This excludes certain sales volumes such as:\n\n- \u25a0 retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under trademark licensing agreements.\n- \u25a0 certain contracts held for trading purposes reported net rather than gross. Business-specific methodologies to net volumes have been applied in oil products and pipeline gas and power. Paper trades that/uni00A0do not result in physical product delivery are excluded; and\n\n## Important notes on the Net Carbon Footprint methodology\n\n- 1.  The Net Carbon Footprint is not a mathematical derivation of total emissions divided by total energy, nor is it an inventory of absolute emissions.\n- 2.  It is a weighted average of the life-cycle CO/uni2082 intensities of different energy products, normalising them to the same point relative to their final end-use. The use of a consistent functional unit, grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule (gCO/uni2082e/MJ), allows like-for-like comparisons and the aggregation of individual life-cycle intensities for/uni00A0a range of energy products including renewables.\n- For further information see our detailed NCF methodology documentation.\n\n## Basis of preparation - absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions\n\n- \u25a0 Scope 1: direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by Shell.\n\nWe follow the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, which defines three scopes of GHG emissions:\n\n- \u25a0 Scope 2: indirect GHG emissions from generation of purchased energy/uni00A0consumed by Shell.\n- \u25a0 Scope 3: other indirect GHG emissions, including emissions associated/uni00A0with the use of energy products sold by Shell.\n\nGHG emissions comprise carbon dioxide (CO/uni2082), methane (CH/uni2084), nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride, with carbon dioxide and methane being the most significant contributors. Our GHG inventory was prepared in line with the requirement outlined in the ISO 14064-1:2018 Specification with Guidance at the Organisational Level for Quantification and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals and the GHG Protocol's Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n\nIn line with external standards, Shell aggregates its emissions of greenhouse gases into tonnes of CO/uni2082 equivalent by applying global warming potential (GWP) factors to each greenhouse gas. The GWP factors used for converting the mass of individual gases to their CO/uni2082 equivalents are shown in the consolidated statement of GHG emissions. These factors are taken from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) over a 100-year time horizon, in line with the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for/uni00A0Company Reporting.\n\nt",

All operated assets were included in the GHG inventory in the reporting period.\n\n## Basis of preparation - Scope 1 emissions\n\n- \u25a0 combustion of carbon-containing fuels in stationary equipment (e.g.,/uni00A0boilers, gas turbines) for energy generation;\n\nSources included in Scope 1 emissions comprised:\n\n- \u25a0 combustion of carbon-containing fuels in mobile equipment (e.g.,/uni00A0trucks, vessels, mobile rigs);\n- \u25a0 venting and emissions from industrial processes (e.g., hydrogen plants,/uni00A0catalytic cracking units); and\n- \u25a0 flares;\n- \u25a0 fugitive emissions, including piping and equipment leaks and non-routine events.\n\n## Scope 1 emissions - exclusions\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions from biogenic sources (for example, biofuels, biomass) were excluded from our Scope 1 emissions; instead, they were captured separately. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from biogenic sources were included in our Scope 1 emissions.\n\nCaptured carbon dioxide that was subsequently sold or otherwise transferred to third parties was excluded from our Scope 1 emissions.\n\nCarbon dioxide captured and sequestered using CCS technologies was/uni00A0excluded from our Scope 1 emissions. But the emissions from operating CCS were included in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\nCarbon offset credits were excluded from our Scope 1 GHG emissions.\n\nNo material sources were excluded from the Scope 1 inventory.\n\n## Basis of preparation - Scope 2 emissions\n\nSources included in Scope 2 emissions comprised indirect emissions from/uni00A0purchased and consumed electricity, steam and heat. We did not/uni00A0identify any assets with imported cooling or compressed air used for/uni00A0energy purposes.\n\nScope 2 emissions were calculated using the market- and location-based methods separately as defined by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.\n\nNo material sources were excluded from our inventory.\n\n## Basis of preparation - Scope 3 emissions\n\nThis report provides Scope 3 emissions included in our net carbon intensity (NCI). They were consolidated using the equity boundary approach. Under this approach, we reported Shell share of emissions from/uni00A0energy products sold by Shell, including those sourced from third parties. Scope 3 categories included in the total number in this Report include following:\n\n## Scope 3, category 1: purchased goods and services\n\nThis category includes well-to-tank emissions from purchased third-party unfinished and finished energy products excluding electricity (which was reported separately under Category 3: Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2)).\n\nEmissions in this category were estimated using well-to-tank emission factors for crude oil, natural gas, refined oil products (such as gasoline, and diesel), LNG and biofuels. Because the emission factors includes transport, we did not estimate emissions from transport of purchased third-party products separately.\n\nEmissions from purchased non-energy products were not included in this/uni00A0Report.\n\n## Scope 3, category 3: fuel and energy-related activities (not/uni00A0included in Scope 1 and 2)\n\nThis category includes well-to-wire emissions from purchased third-party electricity sold by Shell, calculated using the market-based method. Emissions were not adjusted for any potential double-counting of sold natural gas that may have been used for generating this electricity.\n\nThis category does not include:\n\n- \u25a0 well-to-tank emissions from purchased electricity, steam and heat consumed by our assets (i.e. Scope 3 emissions from extraction, refining and transport of primary fuels before their use in the generation of electricity or steam).\n- \u25a0 indirect emissions from generation of imported energy (steam, heat or/uni00A0electricity consumed by our assets). These emissions were reported separately as Scope 2 emissions; and\n\n## Scope 3, category 9: downstream transport and distribution\n\nThis category includes estimated emissions from transport and distribution of energy products produced or refined by Shell. It does not include the emissions associated with transporting third-party products, which are included in Scope 3, Category 1. In order to avoid double counting the emissions from transport, Scope 1 and 2 emissions from transport included in our equity emissions were subtracted from the total in this category.\n\n## Scope 3, category 11: use of sold products\n\nThis category includes estimated emissions from the use-phase of sold energy products, such as LNG, GTL, pipeline gas, refined oil products and biofuels. The emissions consist of two separate sub-categories: products manufactured and sold by Shell and third-party products sold by Shell.\n\nThis category does not include non-energy products that may have been/uni00A0combusted during the use-phase (for example, lubricants).\n\n## Biogenic CO/uni2082 emissions from combustion of sold biofuels\n\nBiogenic CO/uni2082 from combustion of sold biofuels were estimated and reported separately outside of scopes. Methane and nitrous oxide have been included in Scope 3, Category 11 in line with the ISO 14064-1:2018 and GHG Protocol requirements.\n\nWe did not estimate CO/uni2082 from combustion of biogenic emissions in other Scope 3 categories. It is assumed that the presence of biogenic emissions in other categories is negligible at present.\n\n## Other Scope 3 categories\n\nAs noted above, this Report only covers Scope 3 GHG emissions included in our net carbon intensity metric. Other Scope 3 GHG emissions can be/uni00A0found on our website: www.shell.com/ghg.",

They are indispensable elements of our organisation. The Shell HSSE & SP Control Framework (CF) consists of mandatory standards and manuals, which align with the Shell Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP. Guidance documents, assurance protocols, and training materials support implementation of the standards and manuals.\n\nThe HSSE & SP CF applies to every Shell entity and Shell-operated venture, including all employees and contract staff. The HSSE & SP CF defines requirements and accountabilities at each organisational level and sets out processes and procedures. We aim to ensure that all significant HSSE & SP risks associated with our business activities are assessed and managed to minimise them as far as reasonably practicable. Our HSSE &/uni00A0SP functions provide expert advice and support businesses to improve HSSE & SP performance.\n\nWe aim to minimise the environmental impact of new projects and existing operations. Shell conducts an environmental, social and health impact assessment for every major project.

The full Shell portfolio comprises about 200 organisational groups covered by this programme. Audits are performed with a frequency of between three and five years, depending on the overall risk and complexity of a particular facility or organisational group. The Board approves an annual audit plan. On average, the assurance team conducts about 50 audits on a variety of subject areas per year. The scope of the/uni00A0audits is designed to test risk areas as defined in the HSSE & SP CF. This includes the overall HSSE & SP management system and specific requirements for areas such as personal safety, environment and contractor management. Based on audit outcomes, the audit frequency for an entity may be increased. The relevant business documents the audit/uni00A0findings, records any action items and tracks them to completion.\n\nWe expect joint ventures not operated by Shell to apply standards and principles substantially equivalent to our own. We support these joint ventures in implementing such standards and principles. We also offer to/uni00A0help them review the effectiveness of their implementation. Even if\n\nsuch/uni00A0a review is not conducted, we periodically evaluate HSSE & SP risks/uni00A0faced by the ventures that we do not operate. If a joint venture does/uni00A0not meet our HSSE & SP expectations, we seek to improve performance by working with our partners to develop and implement/uni00A0remedial action plans.\n\nFrom August 2021, we integrated the Process Safety and HSSE & SP Assurance team and the related HSSE & SP assurance programme into/uni00A0the Shell Internal Audit & Investigations (SIAI) team to form a single/uni00A0independent assurance organisation within Shell. Within SIAI, the/uni00A0HSSE &/uni00A0SP and Asset Management Assurance team continues to provide assurance to the Board on the effectiveness of the HSSE & SP CF/uni00A0as/uni00A0outlined above.\n\nShell aims to work with suppliers that behave in a safe, economically, environmentally and socially responsible manner. Our approach to suppliers is set out in our Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles. These cover expectations in areas such as business integrity, health and safety, environment, and human rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY continued\n\n## Divestments\n\nResponsible divestments are a key part of transitioning our portfolio to deliver our Powering Progress strategy.\n\nWhen considering divestments, we collaborate with in-house and external experts, where appropriate, to conduct checks and examine key attributes of potential buyers. These attributes may include their financial strength; operating culture; health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) policies; and approach to ethics and compliance. We also consider risk- and people-management processes and standards; community liaison practices; and social performance programmes.\n\nApplicable attributes are assessed against Shell's policies and the requirements of relevant local regulations. Divestments are often subject to/uni00A0the approval of regulatory authorities, which may in part depend on/uni00A0potential buyers' HSSE capacity, compliance record, and assetstewardship capabilities.\n\n## SAFETY\n\nShell's Powering Progress strategy is underpinned by our focus on safety. We aim to do no harm to people and to have no leaks across our operations. We call this our Goal Zero ambition.\n\nWe seek to improve safety by focusing on the three areas where the safety risks associated with our activities are highest: personal, process and transport. We strive to reduce risks and to minimise the potential impact of any incident, with a particular emphasis on the risks with the/uni00A0most serious consequences if something goes wrong. In 2021, we/uni00A0introduced a new measure to report on our personal safety performance, known as Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F)./uni00A0\n\nThis new measure is one example of how we have updated our thinking about safety, how we learn from incidents with potential to cause life-altering injuries, and how leaders should respond. In 2020, we started a multi-year process of refreshing our approach to safety for all employees and contractors. Our updated approach to safety is rooted in a consistent focus on human performance, by which we mean the way people, culture, equipment, work systems and processes all interact. The majority of our fatalities over the last five years were down to the interaction between these elements.\n\nWe aim to better understand the gap between how we anticipate work will be done safely and how the work is actually carried out. We continue to work to prevent incidents by maintaining safety barriers and providing training. We acknowledge that people make mistakes and not all incidents may be preventable. We continue to focus more on installing adequate controls to create capacity to fail safely. With that, we believe/uni00A0that we will enhance our safeguards and reduce the likelihood of/uni00A0serious injuries.\n\nWe recognise that people are key to executing complex tasks and to finding solutions to problems. We aim to apply a learner mindset, by which we mean the belief that we can always improve, enhance individual capabilities, learn from mistakes and successes, and speak up without being punished. We seek to create conditions that encourage employees and contractors to share ideas and concerns without fear of rejection or/uni00A0punishment.\n\nWe work with the large number of our contractors and suppliers so they understand our safety requirements. Together we seek to improve safety performance by building skills and expertise, and by creating an inclusive and safe work environment. We strive to help improve safety throughout the energy industry by sharing our safety standards and experience with other operators, contractors and professional organisations, such as the Energy Institute, the London-based global professional body for the energy sector; IPIECA, the global oil and gas association for advancing environmental and social performance across the energy transition; and IOGP, the international association of the upstream oil and gas industry.\n\nShell also continues to use technology and digital solutions to help keep people and our operations safe. Drones, remote sensing technologies, robots and other technologies, such as augmented reality, help us keep people out of harm's way. For example, we use drones and robots to conduct inspections, reducing the need for human inspectors to enter hazardous environments. We also use various technologies and devices/uni00A0to/uni00A0help frontline employees stay safe and react quickly should/uni00A0an/uni00A0incident occur.\n\n## Personal safety\n\nWe continue to strengthen the safety culture and leadership among our/uni00A0employees and contractor staff. This aligns with our focus on caring for/uni00A0people.\n\nWe expect everyone to consider two aspects of their tasks: the hazards that could potentially cause serious harm, and the effectiveness of the barriers in place to avoid serious harm if something does happen. We have ongoing safety awareness programmes, and hold an annual global Safety Day to give employees and contractors time to reflect on how to prevent incidents and how we can work together to improve performance.\n\nIn September, during Safety Day 2021, we began the transition to a new set of nine industry Life-Saving Rules which came into effect from January 2022. All our staff and contractors were given time to reflect on how these rules apply to everyday activities, and how to put them into practice applying the human performance and learner mindset guidelines. Introducing the industry Life-Saving Rules has been an opportunity to strengthen the way we learn from adverse incidents and to simplify and standardise processes and procedures. Safety Day marked the start of a series of engagements. We encouraged team leaders to hold additional conversations with their team to help further understanding of the nine industry Life-Saving Rules and together create the conditions to enable these rules to be followed. This is particularly important with the new line of fire rule. This states that people must ensure that they and others are out/uni00A0of the way of potential pressure releases, vehicles that might move, or/uni00A0objects that could fall, drop or move. Analysis of safety incidents at Shell-operated ventures showed that many of our most serious events related to the line of fire rule. By the end of 2021, more than 90,000 of/uni00A0our/uni00A0employees and contractors had already completed the mandatory/uni00A0updated training for the Life-Saving Rules.\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information on Life-Saving Rules guidance for contractors.",

It starts at the design and construction stage of/uni00A0projects and continues throughout the life cycle of facilities to ensure they are safely operated, well maintained and regularly inspected.\n\nFor example, we embedded safety in the design and construction of the Falcon Ethane Pipeline System in the USA, which was commissioned in 2021. We used pipe with thicker walls and buried it deeper than required by regulations. We used ultrasound and X-ray equipment to test welds before use. The pipeline is designed to withstand almost twice the normal/uni00A0operating pressure.\n\nOur global standards and operating procedures define our expectations for the controls and physical barriers required to reduce the risks of incidents. For example, offshore wells must be designed with at least two independent barriers in the direction of flow, in order to reduce the risk of an uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons. We regularly inspect, test and maintain these barriers to ensure they meet our standards. For example, at/uni00A0the West Delta Deep Marine joint venture assets (Shell interest 50%, not/uni00A0operated by Shell), off the coast of Egypt, more than 750 kilometres of/uni00A0hydrocarbon-carrying pipelines were inspected for their integrity using a/uni00A0technique based on screening pipelines by electro-magnetic waves. Since 2017, until end of 2021, 540 kilometres were confirmed safe. We/uni00A0expect to check the remaining 210 kilometres of concrete-coated pipe/uni00A0in 2022 using a method that helps to inspect pipelines by analysing their magnetic field.\n\nWe strive to learn not only from leaks that happened, but also from potential events that were prevented by our barriers. Spending time monitoring and learning from high-potential events - avoided leaks which would have caused significant harm to assets and people - is necessary as our industry moves towards risk-based classification of leaks. In the event of a loss of containment such as a spill or a leak, our standards require the use of independent recovery measures to stop the release from/uni00A0becoming catastrophic. We have embedded a set of process safety fundamentals in order to strengthen barriers relating to critical safety tasks/uni00A0performed by frontline staff. These fundamentals provide guidelines for good operating practices to prevent unplanned releases.\n\nWe routinely prepare and practise our emergency response to potential incidents such as a spill or a fire. This involves working closely with local services and regulatory agencies to jointly test our plans and procedures. These tests continually improve our readiness to respond. If an incident does occur, we have procedures to reduce the impact on people and the/uni00A0environment.\n\nIn August and September 2021, Hurricane Ida posed a potential safety risk to millions of people across the Gulf Coast region. Thousands of Shell employees, contractors, and their families were affected. Hurricane Ida also threatened Shell's onshore and offshore assets in the region. Years of/uni00A0planning and learning through exercises enabled Shell's emergency response teams to efficiently take care of employees and minimise the disruption of our business. We conducted extensive training at our sites between May and July 2021, so that our teams were ready to react when/uni00A0the hurricane hit.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY continued\n\nShell helped with disaster response and recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, playing our part in assisting employees and neighbours in the communities where we work. We supported employees and communities in the Gulf Coast region and also in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. For example, we distributed assistance packages to more than 400 employees in need. We also established base camps in/uni00A0the Gulf Coast region at Shell's Norco and Convent sites in Louisiana. These hosted more than 700 displaced individuals, employees required to/uni00A0remain on site, and electrical linemen working to restore power to communities. Shell had around 3,000 employees in the Gulf Coast region, and about 2,200 of them found themselves in an area that qualified as a/uni00A0natural disaster zone.\n\n## Transport safety\n\nTransporting large numbers of people, products and equipment by road,/uni00A0rail, sea and air poses safety risks. We seek to reduce these risks by/uni00A0developing best-practice standards within Shell. We also work with specialist contractors, industry bodies, NGOs and governments to find/uni00A0ways of reducing transport safety risks.\n\nIn 2021, Shell employees and contractors drove around 470 million kilometres on business in more than 50 countries. There were no fatalities related to road transport in activities under the operational control of a/uni00A0Shell company in 2021. By the end of December, we recorded more than 1.2 billion kilometres with no fatalities in almost two-and-a-half years.\n\nWe continually take steps to improve our road safety performance. For example, we implement best practice, encourage safe behaviour, and call/uni00A0for safe vehicle design. We run road safety programmes including our/uni00A0online defensive driving course that teaches safe techniques and behaviours and is mandatory for all who drive on public roads/uni00A0while on Shell business. In 2021, around 11,000 Shell employees and contractors completed some form of in-vehicle or virtual defensive driving training.\n\nFalling asleep behind the wheel or being distracted while driving can lead/uni00A0to serious road accidents around the world. Our road transport fleets/uni00A0have begun deploying devices that detect signs of microsleeps, fatigue and distraction, and respond by warning drivers so they can take/uni00A0action to stay alert.\n\nThis deployment started in 2020, at the Shell-operated QGC facility in Queensland, Australia, where we worked with four universities and eight contracting companies to evaluate fatigue detection devices and to find the one that performed best in testing. The basis for this project was a scientific study commissioned by Shell, BP, TotalEnergies, and Chevron to/uni00A0review more than 100 commercially available technological systems that purported to detect fatigue or distraction in drivers.\n\nWe are adopting a phased approach to deploying the devices and ensuring drivers know how to use them. We will start in countries identified as high-risk locations: Australia, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey and the Philippines.\n\nIn 2021, the UN General Assembly's status report on road safety globally recognised Shell as being among the very few private-sector companies that have funded road safety projects and activities. We believe that collaboration is key to achieving the UN's target to halve global traffic deaths by 2030, based on their estimations for incidents between 2021 and 2020. This is considered part of Sustainable Development Goal 3: ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. We remain determined to play our part in helping to achieve this, including through organisations such as the Global Road Safety Partnership. Shell has been a founding member of this partnership between businesses, development agencies, governments and civil-society organisations which took on the role to create and support multi-sector road safety partnerships that are engaged with frontline good practice road safety interventions in countries and communities throughout the world.\n\nIn 2021, Shell employees and contractors drove around 470 million kilometres on business in more than 50 countries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are determined to learn from these incidents and spread the lessons from them throughout our organisation so we can/uni00A0do everything possible to prevent anything similar recurring.\n\nThe fatal incidents were as follows:\n\nIn Nigeria, six people working for an engineering contractor and a police/uni00A0officer lost their lives when gunmen attacked a convoy of buses transporting people to the Assa North Gas development project site. The/uni00A0Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) worked with the contractor and supported the police during the investigation of/uni00A0the incident.\n\nIn Pakistan, a contractor colleague died after a fire at a dealer-operated retail site. Another contractor lost his life when a wall fell over during demolition work at a retail site in Indonesia.\n\nSeveral industry safety leadership groups confirm that serious and high-potential incidents often have different root causes than most lower-consequence events. To improve insights from incident investigations and data analysis, we are changing how we report incidents. From 2021 onwards, we measure the number of serious injuries and fatalities per 100 million working hours, instead of the Total Recordable Case Frequency, which measured injuries per million working hours. The new measure, known as Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F), allows us to focus our investigations on the most serious incidents. The aim is to collect and analyse relevant, high-quality data that/uni00A0can help us improve our efforts to/uni00A0prevent serious injuries and fatalities.\n\nIn 2021, the SIF-F was 6.9 injuries and illnesses per 100 million working hours, compared with 6.0 in 2020.\n\nThere were 102 operational Tier 1 and 2 process safety events in 2021, compared with 103 in 2020.\n\nFor reporting on process safety, in this Report, we combine Tier 1 and 2 events. A Tier 1 event is an unplanned or uncontrolled release of any material from a process, including non-toxic and non-flammable materials, with the greatest actual consequence resulting in harm to employees, contract staff or a neighbouring community, damage to equipment, or exceeding a defined threshold quantity. A Tier 2 process safety event is/uni00A0a/uni00A0release of lesser consequence.\n\nAs part of Shell's learner mindset approach, we investigate all serious incidents so we can understand the underlying causes, including technical, behavioural, organisational and human factors. We share what we learn widely, including with contractors. We implement mitigations at the site and in the country and business where the incident occurred. We seek to turn incident findings into improved standards or better ways of working that can be applied widely across similar facilities.\n\n- Additional information on our 2021 safety performance is expected to/uni00A0be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2022.\n\n## ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn 2021, as part of our Powering Progress strategy, we launched our Respecting Nature goal, which sets out our environmental ambitions around biodiversity, water, circular economy and waste, and air quality. Our Respecting Nature commitments step up our approach to managing\n\nthe impacts of our operations on the environment. They also aim to extend our approach with our supply chain, for example, with commitments around plastics and circular economy.\n\nWe adopted short-term goals and also set environmental ambitions for/uni00A02030 and later. We have been working to embed these new requirements into our systems and processes. Accountability for delivery of the Respecting Nature goal lies with our Executive Committee. We/uni00A0have restructured and resourced our organisation to add specialists on biodiversity and circularity and are building capability with the help of/uni00A0external partners.\n\nWe have included our new commitments in our performance management and reporting systems and are defining the baselines for each of the commitments and setting 2022 targets across our businesses. We are working with external environmental partners to develop new approaches that aim to show the extent of the progress we are making towards our environmental goals.\n\nWe will continue to seek opportunities to go further. Our environmental ambitions will be underpinned by collaboration with our supply chains and transparent reporting./uni00A0\n\n## Environmental standards\n\nShell's global environmental standards as set in our HSSE & SP Control Framework cover our environmental performance. They include details of how to manage emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), consume energy more efficiently, reduce gas flaring and control air quality, prevent spills and leaks of hazardous materials, use less fresh water and conserve biodiversity. We seek to apply our global environmental standards wherever we operate. When planning new major projects, we conduct detailed environmental, social and health impact assessments. We help inform our approach by drawing on external standards and guidelines, such as those developed by the World Bank and the International Finance/uni00A0Corporation.\n\nThe Shell HSSE & SP Standards require that we certify our major installations against an internationally recognised independent environmental management system standard if they have significant environmental risks. Major installations are crude oil and natural gas terminals, gas plants, manned offshore and onshore production platforms or flow stations, floating production and storage vessels, refineries, chemicals manufacturing facilities, mines or upgraders. For the purpose of/uni00A0this Report, we did not count each major installation in Upstream and Integrated Gas separately. They were aggregated into their respective operating unit or operating company, such as Shell Upstream UK or Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), in line with the scope of/uni00A0their certifications. At the end of 2021, 98% of major installations within/uni00A0that scope and operated by Shell were certified against the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System or were in compliance with equivalent environmental frameworks required by local regulations. At the end of 2021, there was one operating unit without active certification because of late changes with key auditing contractors and/uni00A0the impact of COVID-19. Actions have been taken to have their certification renewed in 2022. In addition, many installations that are not/uni00A0classified major, such as lubricant plants or Supply terminals, are also/uni00A0certified against ISO 14001 but are not included in the data above. The total also excludes major installations for which divestments were completed in 2021 or are expected to be completed in 2022.\n\n- See also 'Control Framework' on page 202 and 'Climate change and/uni00A0energy transition' on page 77 for more information on how we/uni00A0manage our GHG emissions.",

        "page_content": "## Biodiversity\n\n- \u25a0 From 2021, our new projects in areas rich in biodiversity - critical habitats - will have a net-positive impact on biodiversity.\n\nWe have adopted an ambition to have a positive impact on biodiversity. This involves three new commitments:\n\n- \u25a0 From 2021, our nature-based solutions projects, which protect, transform or restore land, will have a net-positive impact on biodiversity.\n- \u25a0 From 2022, we will replant forests, achieving net-zero deforestation from new activities, while maintaining biodiversity and conservation value.\n\nWe aim to minimise the impact of our projects on biodiversity and ecosystems by applying the mitigation hierarchy. This is a decision-making framework that involves a sequence of four key actions: avoid, minimise, restore and offset. We assess the potential impact of projects on biodiversity as part of our Impact Assessment process. In 2003, we/uni00A0committed not to explore for, or develop, oil and gas resources in/uni00A0natural and mixed World Heritage Sites.\n\nIf we decide to go ahead with a project that is in a critical habitat, we develop a biodiversity action plan. This sets out what we should do to follow the mitigation hierarchy. If there is an impact on biodiversity, the plan outlines the action required to achieve a net-positive outcome for biodiversity. For example, in Australia, the Shell-operated QGC natural gas project manages the 10,000-hectare Valkyrie property as part of its/uni00A0strategy to offset impacts on biodiversity. In 2021, QGC completed the/uni00A0final steps to secure further hectares of habitat for three threatened species: koala, south-eastern long-eared bat and greater glider.\n\n## Circular economy and waste\n\nWe are working to reduce waste, improve our waste management processes and apply the principles of a circular economy, where materials/uni00A0are recycled and reused, across our businesses and supply chains. Our ambition is to use resources and materials efficiently and/uni00A0to/uni00A0increase reuse and recycling.\n\nWe are aiming for zero waste by reducing waste generated and increasing reuse and recycling in our businesses and supply chains. In/uni00A02021, we conducted pilot assessments to develop and test a methodology that we could use across a number of businesses in/uni00A02022/uni00A0to/uni00A0gather options to set goals for 2023+ relating to circular economy and/uni00A0waste management.\n\nSome of our sites and businesses are already starting to take a more circular approach. For example, our Mobility business has made the commitment that all Shell-owned service stations will reduce, reuse and repurpose waste by 2025. By 2025, we also aim to remove unnecessary single-use plastic, such as bags, straws and cutlery from our service/uni00A0station shops. We will make it easier for customers to recycle and are looking for ways to repurpose plastic waste.\n\nWe have also set commitments to work with our suppliers and contractors to help end plastic waste in the environment:\n\n- \u25a0 We will increase the amount of recycled materials used to make our products, starting with plastics. Our ambition is to use 1 million tonnes of plastic waste a year in our global chemical plants by 2025.\n- \u25a0 By 2030, we will increase the amount of recycled plastic in our packaging to 30% and ensure that the packaging we use for our products is reusable or recyclable.\n\n## Water\n\nManaging our impacts on water and ensuring the availability of fresh water for our operations is a growing challenge in some parts of the world. Increasing demand for water resources, growing stakeholder expectations and concerns, and water-related legislation may reduce our/uni00A0access to water.\n\nWe manage water use carefully, and tailor our use of fresh water to local conditions and requirements. We sometimes use alternatives to fresh water in our operations. These include water that has been recycled from our operations, processed sewage water and desalinated water. We require that all Shell facilities and projects are assessed to see what risks they might pose to water availability. In places where water is scarce, we/uni00A0develop water-management action plans for using less fresh water, increasing water recycling and closely monitoring water use.\n\nIn 2021, we set a measurable target for fresh-water use: we will reduce the/uni00A0amount of fresh water consumed in our facilities. This will start with reducing our consumption of fresh water by 15% by 2025 compared with 2018 levels in water-stressed areas, which are places where there is high pressure on fresh-water resources.\n\nAt the end of 2021, four of our major facilities were in areas where there is/uni00A0a high level of water stress, based on analysis using references such as the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas and information specific to the local environment. These four facilities are the Pearl GTL (gas-to-liquids) plant in Qatar, the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park in Singapore, the Shell Jurong Island chemical plant, also in Singapore, and/uni00A0the Tabangao Import Terminal in the Philippines. In 2021, these four facilities consumed 22 million cubic metres of fresh water, compared with/uni00A0their baseline of 25 million cubic metres in 2018.\n\nWe have also stated that, by the end of 2022, we will have assessed options for further goals related to reducing our use of fresh water.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a pilot assessment of circular approaches towards/uni00A0fresh-water consumption. This helped us to develop a methodology that will be used to assess businesses' performance in/uni00A02022./uni00A0We believe that/uni00A0this will help deepen our understanding of how/uni00A0to/uni00A0improve water efficiency and help us set further goals by the end/uni00A0of/uni00A02022. The assessments involve desktop analysis and detailed site/uni00A0evaluations conducted with external organisations.\n\nIn 2021, our overall intake of fresh water decreased to 166 million cubic metres, compared with 171 million cubic metres in 2020 mainly driven by/uni00A0the shutdown of the Shell Convent Refinery (USA) in December 2020.\n\nAround 90% of our intake of fresh water was used for manufacturing oil products and chemicals, with the rest mainly used for oil and gas production. Around 35% of our fresh-water intake was from public utilities, such as municipal water supplies. The rest was taken from surface water such as rivers and lakes (around 55%) and groundwater (around 10%).\n\nAdditional information on our 2021 environmental performance is expected to be published in the Shell Sustainability Report in April 2022.\n\nt",

They can also affect our licence to operate and/uni00A0harm our reputation.\n\nWe have requirements and procedures designed to prevent spills. We/uni00A0design, operate and maintain our facilities with the intention of avoiding spills. To further reduce the risk of spills, Shell has routine programmes to/uni00A0reduce failures and maintain the reliability of facilities and/uni00A0pipelines. Our/uni00A0business units are responsible for organising and executing spill responses in line with Shell guidelines and relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Our offshore installations have spill response plans for when/uni00A0an incident occurs. These plans set out response strategies and techniques, available equipment, and trained personnel and contracts. We can engage specialist contracted services for oil spill response, including vessels, aircraft or other equipment and resources, if/uni00A0required, for large spills. We conduct regular exercises that seek to ensure these plans remain effective and fit for purpose.\n\nWe have further developed our ability to respond to spills to water. We/uni00A0have a worldwide network of trained staff to help with this. We/uni00A0also/uni00A0have a global oil spill expertise centre, which tests local capability and maintains our ability to respond to a significant spill into/uni00A0a/uni00A0marine environment.\n\nWe are involved in several industry consortia formed to improve well-containment capabilities. Shell Offshore Response Company LLC is a founding member of the Marine Well Containment Company, a non-profit industry consortium providing a well-containment response system for the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Response Limited was a founding member of the Subsea Well Response Project, an industry co-operative effort to enhance global well-containment capabilities, which has since become Oil Spill Response Limited, an industry consortium./uni00A0\n\nWe maintain site-specific emergency response plans in case there is an onshore spill. Like the offshore response plans, these are designed to meet Shell guidelines and relevant local legal and regulatory requirements. The onshore response plans also provide for the initial assessment of incidents and the mobilisation of resources to manage them. In the event of spills on/uni00A0land, businesses are supported by our global Soil & Groundwater team which reviews and implements appropriate remedies./uni00A0The Soil & Groundwater team is engaged throughout the life cycle of our assets./uni00A0For example, during acquisition and divestment of assets, the team conducts due diligence to identify land contamination liabilities./uni00A0Through research and development initiatives, the team collaborates with regulators in developing, modifying, and applying sustainable remediation techniques.\n\nSpills still occur for reasons such as operational failure, accidents or unusual corrosion. In 2021, there were 42 operational spills of more than 100 kilograms compared with 70 in 2020. The weight of operational spills of oil and oil products in 2021 was 0.05 thousand tonnes, compared with/uni00A00.4 thousand tonnes in 2020.\n\n## Spills in Nigeria\n\nIn the Niger Delta, over the last 11 years, the total number of operational hydrocarbon spills and the volume of oil spilled from them into the environment have been significantly reduced.\n\nMost oil spills in the Niger Delta region continue to be caused by crude oil/uni00A0theft, the sabotage of oil and gas production facilities, and illegal oil/uni00A0refining, including the distribution of illegally refined products.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) reported 10 operational spill incidents of more than 100 kilograms of crude oil, fewer than the 12 reported in 2020. The volume of around 0.03 thousand tonnes remained on the same level.\n\nSPDC has an ongoing work programme to appraise, maintain and replace key sections of pipelines and flow lines, in order to reduce the/uni00A0number of/uni00A0operational spills. Over the last 11 years, around 1,410/uni00A0kilometres of/uni00A0pipelines and flow lines have been replaced. This/uni00A0work/uni00A0is organised through a pipeline and flow line integrity management system that proactively addresses pipeline integrity. It/uni00A0installs barriers where necessary, and recommends when and where/uni00A0pipeline sections should be/uni00A0replaced to prevent failures. In/uni00A02018,/uni00A0this/uni00A0integrity management system/uni00A0was enhanced to manage threats/uni00A0arising from frequent pipeline/uni00A0sabotage or vandalism.\n\n## Spills caused by sabotage in 2021\n\nIn 2021, more than 90% of the oil spills of more than 100 kilograms from the SPDC joint venture's facilities were caused by the illegal activities of/uni00A0third parties. In 2021, the volume of crude oil spills of more than 100/uni00A0kilograms caused by sabotage was around 3.3 thousand tonnes (107/uni00A0incidents), compared with around 1.5 thousand tonnes (122 incidents) in 2020. We believe that the number of incidents in 2021 continued to decrease because of improved security and surveillance. The doubling of/uni00A0the volume was mainly because of one incident which alone accounted for around 2.3 thousand tonnes of crude oil which was contained and could be recovered.\n\nSPDC continues to undertake initiatives to prevent and reduce spills caused by theft from or sabotage of its facilities in the Niger Delta. In/uni00A02021, SPDC continued on-ground surveillance of its areas of operation, including its pipeline network, to mitigate third-party interference and ensure that spills are detected and responded to as quickly as possible.\n\nThere are daily overflights of the most vulnerable segments of the pipeline network to identify any new spills or illegal activity. SPDC has introduced anti-theft protection mechanisms for key infrastructure such as wellheads and manifolds. The programme to protect wellheads with steel cages continues to help deter theft.\n\nBy the end of 2021, a total of 283 cages had been installed, including 62/uni00A0that had been upgraded with CCTV. This compared with a total of/uni00A0364 installed cages at the end of 2020. This year-on-year reduction was because of the 2021 divestment of the OML-17 licence. In 2021, 29/uni00A0breaches were successful out of 1,700 registered attempts.\n\n## Faster response and remediation\n\nIrrespective of the cause, SPDC works to clean up and remediate areas affected by spills originating from its facilities. In 2021, the time that SPDC needed to complete the recovery of free-phase oil - oil that forms a separate layer and is not mixed with water or soil - remained at around one week compared to 2020. This is the average time it takes to safely access a damaged site to start joint investigation visits with regulators, affected communities, and in some cases with NGOs, to clean up oil not/uni00A0mixed with water or soil.\n\nClean-up activities include bio-remediation which stimulates microorganisms that naturally break down and use carbon-rich oil as a source/uni00A0of food and energy, effectively removing it. Once clean-up and/uni00A0remediation operations are completed, the work is inspected and,/uni00A0if/uni00A0satisfactory, approved and certified by the Nigerian regulators. With/uni00A0operational spills, SPDC also pays compensation to affected people/uni00A0and/uni00A0communities.\n\nSPDC has been working with the International Union for Conservation of/uni00A0Nature (IUCN) since 2012 to enhance remediation techniques and protect biodiversity at sites affected by oil spills in SPDC's areas of operation in the Niger Delta. Based on this collaboration, SPDC has launched further initiatives to help strengthen its remediation and restoration efforts. In 2021, SPDC, IUCN, the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, and Wetlands International worked together on the Niger Delta Biodiversity Technical Advisory Group, which continues to monitor biodiversity recovery at remediated sites.\n\nSPDC also works with a range of stakeholders in the Niger Delta to build greater trust in spill response and clean-up processes. Local communities participate in remediation work for operational spills. The restrictions of COVID-19 meant there were fewer opportunities to collaborate, but the engagement and partnership with communities continued. Various NGOs have sometimes gone on joint investigation visits with SPDC, government regulators, and members of affected communities to establish the cause and volume of oil spills.\n\nSPDC has implemented programmes to raise awareness of and counter the negative effects of crude oil theft and illegal oil refining. Examples include community-based pipeline surveillance, and promoting alternative livelihoods through Shell's flagship youth entrepreneurship programme, Shell LiveWIRE.\n\n## Bodo clean-up process\n\nIn 2015, SPDC, on behalf of the SPDC joint venture and the Bodo community, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) granting SPDC access to begin cleaning up areas affected by two operational spills that occurred in 2008. The MOU also provided for the selection of/uni00A0two international contractors to conduct the clean-up under the oversight of an independent project director. The clean-up project was delayed in 2016 and for most of 2017 because of access challenges from/uni00A0the community. Engagement with the Bodo community and other stakeholders began in September 2015 and was managed by the Bodo/uni00A0Mediation Initiative.\n\nAfter two years of engagement, in September 2017, it was possible to start the first phase of clean-up and remediation activities. The clean-up consists of three phases:\n\n- 2) remediation of soil and sediments; and\n- 1) removal of oil from shoreline surfaces and mud flat beds;\n- 3) planting mangroves and monitoring.\n\nThe first phase was completed in August 2018. The contract procurement process for phase two was completed in 2019. Remediation activities in the field started in November 2019. During 2020, work had to be put on hold because of COVID-19 restrictions. By November 2020, controls were in place to mitigate impacts from COVID-19 for the workers on site and the remediation work resumed.\n\nIn 2021, the remediation of the soil and sediments at the Bodo project site/uni00A0continued. By the end of 2021, remediation work was completed on/uni00A0more than 60% of around 1,000 hectares that have been designated for clean-up. Almost 2,000 community workers have been trained and engaged in the clean-up. Remediation is expected to be completed by/uni00A0the/uni00A0end of the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe planting of mangrove seedlings (phase 3) started in 2021. Around two/uni00A0million mangrove seedlings need to be planted and survive to 2025 to fulfil the project's goal. By the end of 2021, about 300,000 seedlings had been planted.\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY continued\n\n## Ogoniland: commitment to the United Nations Environment Programme\n\nSPDC remains committed to the implementation of the 2011 United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Report on Ogoniland which/uni00A0assessed contamination from oil operations in the region and recommended actions to clean it up. Over the last 10 years, SPDC has acted on all and completed most of the UNEP recommendations that were specifically addressed to it as the operator of the joint venture.\n\nThe clean-up efforts are led by the Hydrocarbon Pollution and Remediation Project (HYPREP), an agency established by the federal government. In 2018, HYPREP awarded contracts for the first set of remediation projects. In 2019, 21 contractors started operations on 21 lots which add up to 12 of the 67 polluted sites recorded in the UNEP report. Of those 67 sites, two are waste sites without hydrocarbon pollution. In January 2020, HYPREP awarded a further 29 contracts for remediation on 29 lots covering eight polluted sites. The contractors began remediation activities in the fourth quarter of 2020. In 2021, remediation work was completed on nine sites which have been certified by the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), the Nigerian government agency responsible for monitoring of and responding to oil spills. Remediation continues on 11 sites. Although remediation works continue to make progress, challenges remain. These/uni00A0include re-pollution, lack of contractor funding, land disputes, environmental issues such as flooding caused by excessive rainfall, and/uni00A0security issues in Ogoniland.\n\nThe UNEP report recommended creating an Ogoni Trust Fund (OTF) with/uni00A0$1 billion capital, to be co-funded by the Nigerian government, the/uni00A0SPDC joint venture and other operators in the area. The SPDC joint venture remains fully committed to contributing $900 million to the fund as/uni00A0its share over five years. SPDC joint-venture partners contributed the first instalment of $180 million for the clean-up by July 2018, and released the second instalment of $180 million in 2019. HYPREP did not request the release of any funds in 2020. In 2021, HYPREP requested the release of funds for 2020 and 2021. The SPDC joint venture partners agreed to only pay the 2021 instalment of $180 million because of a delayed use of funds by HYPREP, which only spent around $70 million of the fund. The request for the 2021 payment is being processed. Once the payment is made the total contribution by the SPDC joint venture will be $540 million.\n\nThe UNEP continues to monitor the progress of the clean-up through its/uni00A0observer status at HYPREP's Governing Council and the Ogoni Trust/uni00A0Fund. UN agencies such as the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research provide services to HYPREP in the areas of livelihood programmes, training/uni00A0and project services.\n\n## HYDRAULIC FRACTURING Onshore Operating Principles\n\nWe use five aspirational operating principles which focus on safety, environmental safeguards, and engagement with nearby communities to/uni00A0address concerns and help develop local economies. We are working towards making all of our Shell-operated onshore projects where hydraulic fracturing is used to produce gas and oil from tight sandstone or/uni00A0shale, consistent with these principles.\n\nWe consider each project - from the geology to the surrounding environment and communities - and design our activities using technology and innovative approaches best suited to local conditions. We also support government regulations consistent with these principles that are designed to reduce risks to the environment and keep those living near operations safe.\n\nWe review the Onshore Operating Principles annually and update them as new technologies, challenges and regulatory requirements emerge.\n\n## Water\n\nThe availability and quality of water, local environmental conditions and/uni00A0regulatory requirements vary from basin to basin.\n\nWe aim to minimise water usage in our shale assets by developing a water/uni00A0management strategy specific to the area. Depending on local hydro-geological conditions, our shale assets typically use a combination of fresh water, brackish groundwater, produced water and waste water. We/uni00A0work to limit, and ideally eliminate, our use of fresh water in drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations by increasing recycling capacity and/uni00A0using municipal water.\n\nChemical additives are needed in hydraulic fracturing fluid to carry sand, reduce friction and prevent the growth of bacteria. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping fluid that is typically 99.9% water and sand and around 0.1% chemical additives into tight sand or shale rock at high pressure. This creates threadlike fissures - typically the diameter of a human hair - in the rock, making space through which the hydrocarbons can flow more easily.\n\n## Greenhouse gas\n\nShell's shale assets implement greenhouse gas management plans including robust leak detection and repair programmes using the latest technologies, such as infrared cameras and drones. We also seek to minimise routine gas flaring at shale assets.\n\nShell sold its stake in the Permian Basin, USA, with effect from December 1, 2021. Between the beginning of 2017 and the end of 2021, we reduced our greenhouse gas and methane intensity of the Permian assets by around 80%. We also reduced flaring by more than 80%. At the same time, production increased at the Shell-operated assets by nearly 120%.\n\n## Operational footprint\n\nOur Shales assets use technology, local knowledge and management strategies to minimise/uni00A0potential impacts such as high traffic volumes, noise, and effects on supplies of drinking water.\n\n## Communities\n\nWe build relationships and engage with a broad range of stakeholders across the entire project life cycle. Our stakeholders include residents, local communities - including indigenous populations - government officials, NGOs, civil-society groups, academia and industry. We focus our engagement on understanding local social and economic conditions and proactively identifying and responding to those concerns.\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information on our Onshore Operating Principles.\n\n## SEISMICITY\n\nOverall, we believe it is relatively unlikely that hydraulic fracturing or well operations for disposing of produced water will induce seismicity that is felt on the surface. We would also expect any such impact to be limited to/uni00A0a relatively small area. The geology of some places, though, does increase the risk of inducing seismicity that can be felt on the surface. Shell/uni00A0assesses the risk profile of each basin before entering and manages operations accordingly, often beyond regulatory requirements. We assess the subsurface formation and surface environment around our operations and have developed appropriate mitigation plans to follow if needed.\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information about our induced seismicity management practices, such as the 'Onshore Operating Principles in Action: Induced Seismicity Fact Sheet'.\n- For information on the Groningen onshore gas field in the Netherlands, see 'Upstream' on page 52.",

        "page_content": "## ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS\n\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental laws, regulations and reporting requirements in the countries where we operate. Infringing any/uni00A0of these laws, regulations and requirements could harm our reputation/uni00A0and ability to do business, and result in significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines, sanctions and third-party claims.\n\nOngoing operating expenses include the costs of preventing unauthorised discharges into the air and water, and the safe disposal and handling of/uni00A0waste.\n\nWe place a premium on developing effective technologies that are also/uni00A0safe for the environment. But when operating at the forefront of technology, there is always the possibility that a new technology has environmental impacts that were not assessed, foreseen or determined to/uni00A0be harmful when originally implemented. While we believe we take reasonable precautions to limit these risks, we could be subject to additional remedial, environmental and litigation costs as a result of unknown and unforeseen impacts of operations on the environment. Although these costs have so far not been material to us, no assurance can be given that this will always be the case.\n\n## SECURITY\n\nOur operations expose us to criminality, civil unrest, activism, terrorism, cyber-disruption and acts of war that could have a material adverse effect on our business (see 'Risk factors' on page 28). We seek to obtain the best possible information to enable us to assess threats and risks. To help us understand the threats, we build strong and open relationships with government, law enforcement, armed forces, industry peers and specialist security information providers. On the basis of these threat assessments, we identify security risks to staff, assets including information technology equipment, and operations. We then seek to manage the risks so they are as low as reasonably practicable./uni00A0Risk mitigation includes strengthening the security of sites, reducing our exposure to threats as appropriate, journey management, information risk management and cyber-defence operations, crisis management and business continuity measures. We conduct training and awareness campaigns for staff, and provide them with travel advice and access to 24/7 assistance while travelling. We consistently verify the identity of our employees and contract staff, we control physical access to our sites and activities, and we document access with digital tools.\n\nWe take steps to have clear and planned responses to security incidents, so that we are able to react quickly and effectively if they occur.\n\nShell is a member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights initiative. This is a multi-stakeholder initiative of governments, extractive sector industries and NGOs that gives guidance on how to/uni00A0respect human rights while providing security for business operations. Shell implements this guidance across its companies, concentrating on/uni00A0countries where the risks of working with state and private security forces are greatest.\n\nThe Board's Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) has oversight of Shell's security risk management activities. In the Executive Committee, accountability for security matters sits with the/uni00A0Chief/uni00A0Human Resources and Corporate Officer.\n\n## CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY\n\nShell's businesses are part of society and contribute to it by buying and selling goods and services in many countries. Our employees, suppliers and contractors are part of the local communities where Shell operates.\n\nIn 2021, Shell paid $58.7 billion to governments (2020: $47.3 billion). We/uni00A0paid $6.0 billion in corporate income taxes and $6.6 billion in government royalties, and collected $46.1 billion in excise duties, sales taxes and similar levies on our fuel and other products on behalf of governments. In 2021, Shell spent $37.5 billion (2020: $39.3 billion) on/uni00A0goods and services from more than 24,000 suppliers globally.\n\n- For more information about our approach to tax and transparency, see/uni00A0Shell's Tax Contribution Report, available via our website shell.com.\n\n## Social and economic impacts\n\nWe are assessing our social and economic impacts in a number of countries and regions. To do this, we have enlisted the help of the company Oxford Economics using its Global Sustainability Model to/uni00A0assess social, environmental and economic impacts.\n\nIn 2021, Shell published its first report based on 2019 social and economic performance data. It details the impacts of our activities in five countries: the Netherlands, UK, USA, Nigeria and India. These countries were chosen because we have significant and wide-ranging operations in them.\n\nThe report provides performance data on Shell's contribution to in-country gross domestic product, job numbers, tax payments to governments, and our spending on social and educational programmes. The report also provides details of our operations in each country and our procurement of/uni00A0goods and services./uni00A0We intend to expand this work to include more/uni00A0European countries.\n\n## Supply chain engagement\n\nOur suppliers are critical to our ability to run our businesses. They are involved in almost every step of our operations. They often play an important part in Shell having a positive impact on local communities and/uni00A0achieving business success. Shell aims to work with suppliers, including contractors, that behave in an economically, environmentally and socially responsible manner, as set out in our Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles.\n\nThe way we engage with our contractors and suppliers is based on our Shell Supplier Principles, which are embedded in contracts. They require contractors and suppliers:\n\n- \u25a0 to use energy and natural resources efficiently; and\n- \u25a0 to commit to protect the environment in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations;\n- \u25a0 to continually look for ways to minimise waste, emissions and discharge from their operations, products and services.\n\nWe also work with our partners and industry peers to include worker welfare in industry standards, guidance, and best practice. This helps raise expectations and levels of consistency across the industry. We achieve results in this area partly by participating in organisations such as:\n\n- \u25a0 the Joint Qualification System, an initiative of BP, Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, aimed at creating a collaborative approach to human rights supplier assessments;\n- \u25a0 the Building Responsibly group of engineering and construction companies working together to raise the bar in promoting the rights and welfare of workers across the industry;\n- \u25a0 the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP); and\n- \u25a0 the IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for advancing environmental and social performance across the energy transition.\n\nWe also work closely with our key contractors. As a result, 23 of our biggest contractors have signed up to the Building Responsibly principles, which cover more than 1 million workers.\n\nr\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY continued\n\n## Helping our suppliers decarbonise\n\nWe continually work with our suppliers to find ways to reduce greenhouse/uni00A0gas emissions across our supply chains.\n\nIn 2020, Shell and 50 of our major suppliers piloted a new digital platform, the Shell Supplier Energy Transition Hub. This platform enables suppliers to set emission targets and track performance, share best practice and exchange emissions data with their own supply chains. In/uni00A02021, we rolled out the platform free of charge to the rest of our supply/uni00A0chain and any other interested companies.\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information about how we engage/uni00A0with contractors and suppliers.\n\n## NEIGHBOURING COMMUNITIES\n\nEngaging with communities is part of our approach to managing human rights and providing access to remedy. Shell's HSSE & SP Control Framework helps to ensure that we operate responsibly and avoid or minimise the negative social impacts of our operations. The requirements set out in the framework also help us to maximise benefits arising from our presence, such as local employment and contractual opportunities. When we divest assets or exit areas, we use well-established processes, applied in a systematic way, to guide our assessment of risks in divestments.\n\nOur requirements set rules, supplemented by guidance, for how we engage with communities that may be affected by our operations. Major/uni00A0projects and facilities that Shell operates have a social performance plan setting out how to manage potential negative impacts and maximise benefits. These plans typically begin with defining the social environment, with a particular focus on people who may be especially vulnerable to the potential impacts of our operations. Another important component is an effective community feedback mechanism for listening and responding to questions and resolving complaints in a timely manner. We have specific requirements to avoid, minimise or mitigate potential impacts on the traditional lifestyles and cultural heritage of indigenous peoples. We also have specific requirements to avoid, minimise or mitigate their involuntary resettlement.\n\nWe use our online community feedback tool, launched in 2020, to track and respond to all questions, complaints and feedback that we receive. It/uni00A0allows our network of about 100 community liaison officers (CLOs) to/uni00A0document feedback and outcomes.\n\nThe CLOs act as a bridge between local communities and our businesses. In 2021, travel restrictions and lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to limit our face-to-face engagement with members of communities. In response, our CLOs moved engagements online to/uni00A0maintain relationships virtually.\n\nAs part of our ongoing effort to improve community engagement, we developed an assessment tool in 2019, to measure the effectiveness of our/uni00A0community feedback mechanisms at 32 priority sites. The assessment is based on criteria set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It has helped 18 priority sites to improve their community feedback mechanisms in the following areas:\n\n- \u25a0 improving written procedures so they are better aligned with global good practice and more reflective of local circumstances;\n- \u25a0 promoting public access to and transparency of the sites' community feedback mechanisms;\n- \u25a0 providing clear steps for recognising alternative options for communities to seek remedy; and\n- \u25a0 respecting people's anonymity and data privacy.\n\nBy the end of 2021, 10 sites updated their community feedback mechanisms so procedures are better aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Five sites have improved access/uni00A0and transparency by publishing the procedures for their community/uni00A0feedback mechanisms. We are working to improve community/uni00A0feedback mechanisms at 20 sites.\n\nIn 2020, we developed a guide to help sites improve the effectiveness of/uni00A0their community feedback mechanisms. In 2021, we simplified this guide/uni00A0so it could be applied to a wider range of operations. In 2022, we/uni00A0plan to/uni00A0improve the methods for tracking how feedback is resolved.\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information about our work with communities.",

        "page_content": "## HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nHuman rights are fundamental to Shell's core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Respect for human rights is embedded in the Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nWe work closely with other companies and organisations to improve how we apply these UN guiding principles. We focus on four priority areas where respect for human rights is critical to how we operate: communities, security, labour rights, and supply chain. For each of these areas, we have systems to identify potential impacts and to avoid and mitigate them. For/uni00A0example, Shell's HSSE & SP Control Framework contains mandatory standards and manuals that set out how we identify, assess, and manage our impacts on communities where we operate, including any impact on human rights. Our joint-venture partners are expected to implement our control framework or an equivalent.\n\nThe Shell Supplier Principles outline how we expect our contractors and suppliers to respect the human rights of their workforce, and to manage the social impacts of their activities on Shell's neighbouring communities.\n\nIn 2021, we published Shell's Approach to Human Rights, which increases/uni00A0transparency by providing our staff and external stakeholders with important information about our approach and commitment to human rights. The publication includes Shell's position on respecting and/uni00A0promoting worker welfare. It also contains information on how we/uni00A0provide access to remedy.\n\nIn 2021, we launched an updated human rights training course which/uni00A0is/uni00A0mandatory for staff working in areas with the greatest risk of/uni00A0infringement, such as social performance, human resources, and contracting. We encourage all staff to do the course, regardless of their/uni00A0role, to build greater understanding of human rights across Shell.\n\nAn internal Human Rights Working Group consisting of experts from different functions guides Shell businesses on the best ways to implement and review our approach to human rights. The group includes an external adviser to provide an outside view and help us to improve our approach. A steering committee composed of senior executives supports the work of/uni00A0the Human Rights Working Group.\n\nOur approach to due diligence is informed by the/uni00A0UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and is supported by experts working in/uni00A0our/uni00A0focus areas procurement, social performance, human resources, and/uni00A0security./uni00A0Due diligence helps us to act on our commitment to respect human rights. For example, in our supply chains, where contractors and suppliers are considered to be at risk of having issues with labour rights, we engage with them to assess their management systems, before deciding whether to award a contract. Results of these supplier assessments are evaluated, and where gaps are found, we may work with/uni00A0suppliers and contractors to help them implement corrective actions. We may also conduct on-site audits or consider terminating contracts if serious or persistent shortcomings are found.\n\nThe most common shortcomings found during our supplier assessments typically relate to policy gaps rather than performance in the following/uni00A0areas:\n\n- \u25a0 avoiding child labour;\n- \u25a0 freely chosen employment;\n- \u25a0 working hours, wages and benefits;\n- \u25a0 equal opportunities and freedom of association; and\n- \u25a0 dormitory, housing and working conditions;\n- \u25a0 supply chain and performance management.\n\nThe Shell Supplier Principles include specific labour and human rights expectations for contractors and suppliers. Shell companies use a joint industry supplier capability assessment that is delivered in collaboration with other operators. This sharing mechanism is intended to support the improvement of working conditions in the participating companies' supply/uni00A0chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- See our website shell.com for more information about our approach to/uni00A0human rights.\n\nt",

There were a total of 87,000 employees at/uni00A0December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.\n\nIn August, we launched our new organisational structure as part of the Reshape initiative. This new structure was created with the aim of reducing costs and making us a more competitive organisation that is agile and better able to respond to customers.\n\nThe Reshape initiative in 2021 involved job reductions in line with our expectation that around 8,000 jobs will be reduced by the end of 2022. As a result of different notice periods in various markets, people are continuing to leave until the end of 2022. In certain markets, we provided the opportunity for selected voluntary severance (SVS), in order to reduce the number of enforced redundancies. We have around 3,000 people that are leaving on SVS.\n\nWe have sought at all times to conduct the job reductions process in accordance with our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. We have constantly sought to show care for anyone losing their/uni00A0role.\n\nThroughout the Reshape process, we have aimed to support those facing job reductions by helping them to find and engage with internal and external opportunities to reskill and upskill. We introduced a global minimum standard for outplacement./uni00A0This ensured that all employees who/uni00A0were leaving Shell had access to an independent professional career/uni00A0coach who could offer individualised support.\n\nThe proportion of voluntary resignations in Shell was 4.4% in 2021 compared with 2.6% in 2020. The rate is low across a range of industries.\n\nThe table below shows actual employee numbers by geographical area. Note 27 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 280 provides the average number of employees by business segment.\n\n## Actual number of employees by/uni00A0geographical/uni00A0area\n\n|               |   2021 |   2020 |   Thousand 2019 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|-----------------|\n| Europe        |     26 |     27 |              27 |\n| Asia          |     30 |     31 |              31 |\n| Oceania       |      2 |      3 |               2 |\n| Africa        |      4 |      4 |               4 |\n| North America |     18 |     20 |              21 |\n| South America |      1 |      2 |               2 |\n| Total         |     82 |     87 |              87 |\n\nt",

        "page_content": "## OUR PEOPLE continued\n\nIn 2021, a total of 271,000 formal training days were provided for employees and joint-venture partners, compared with 234,000 in 2020/uni00A0and 373,000 in 2019. The increase was caused by the rise in the availability of virtual courses as we rapidly digitalised, enabling people to/uni00A0attend virtually. This allowed us to continue to invest in people and capabilities, while maintaining our focus on safety.\n\nWe have migrated to virtual courses and their uptake has increased from/uni00A02020, when people were still new to the virtual ecosystem. In 2021, learners embraced the virtual courses. This shows in the increase in the number of completions and the corresponding rise in training person days/uni00A0(TPD) of 37,000 compared with 2020.\n\n## EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION AND INVOLVEMENT\n\nManagement regularly engages with our employees, including internally elected employee representatives, through a range of formal and informal channels. These include webcasts and all-staff messages from our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ben van Beurden, senior leader webcasts, town halls, team meetings, virtual coffee/chai connects, interviews with Senior Management, and online publications via our intranet. In 2021 Board members had virtual staff engagements and visited some sites such as Qatar, Shell Pernis, and Pennsylvanian Chemicals park to have direct engagement with staff.\n\n## For further information on stakeholder engagement, see/uni00A0'Governance'/uni00A0on pages 141-144.\n\nThe Shell People Survey is one of the principal tools used to measure employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to Shell. It/uni00A0provides insights into employees' views and has had a consistently high/uni00A0response rate. In 2021, the response rate was 83%, a decrease of 3.1/uni00A0percentage points compared with 2020. This decrease was probably because of the timing of the survey, as many employees who were invited to take part were on a notice period before exiting Shell because of the Reshape reorganisation. Employees who are about to leave typically have a lower response rate than those who plan to stay with a company. The average employee engagement score was 75 points out of 100. This is/uni00A0a/uni00A0decrease of three points compared with 2020 but still reflects the resilience of our people in a year of change. This result gives Shell one of/uni00A0the leading employee engagement scores across a range of industries. The employee engagement score is based on a well-researched and validated model that combines satisfaction, motivation, affiliation, loyalty/uni00A0and dedication.\n\nWe provide our people with what they need to work in our offices and other locations, with flexibility for staff based on their reasonable business and personal needs. We also seek to provide what they need if they are/uni00A0working remotely. We enable, develop and improve their leadership qualities through global learning programmes, short- and long-term international assignments, and offering the possibility of moving between roles in different parts of the organisation. We help to increase the appeal of working for Shell through flexible working options, supportive policies such as a global minimum maternity leave of 16 weeks, regular engagements between management and employees, and career development tools such as individual development plans, coaching and/uni00A0formal training.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to support our people and assist in the fight against COVID-19. We continued our home-working ergonomics programme, providing funding for proper office equipment for home use for 5,000 employees in addition to the 50,000 we assisted in 2020. This included offering funding to new joiners for home-use office equipment. We also provided tips on setting up and maintaining good ergonomics, working with others virtually and maintaining productivity. Our Real Estate teams developed guidance on returning to site safely for all of our locations.\n\nDuring and before the pandemic, we invested in the mental well-being of our employees through programmes such as World Mental Health Day, I'm Not Okay and the One Thing Wall. We also provided resources for our employees under the Care-for-Self programme.\n\nShell is one of more than 800 companies to have signed the Neptune Declaration, an international agreement sponsored by the Global Maritime Forum, promising to support seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The support has included providing access to vaccines.\n\n## DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION\n\nOur ambition is to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world, a place where everyone - including employees, customers, partners and suppliers - feels valued and respected and has a strong sense of belonging. We believe that by achieving this ambition, we will contribute to a better and more equal world. We will also become a stronger organisation, with a richness of/uni00A0experience and views to guide us.\n\n## Living by our values\n\nOur approach starts with living up to our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. These standards are set out in the Shell General Business Principles and our Code of Conduct. We want everyone to have a strong sense of belonging, irrespective of our differences. We launched two mandatory training courses for all staff in 2021: Respect in the Workplace and Conscious Inclusion. These will help us to continue to/uni00A0embed inclusive behaviours in our culture.\n\n## Powering lives DE&I commitments\n\nWe are focusing on removing barriers and creating equality of opportunity in four strategic priority areas: gender; race and ethnicity; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+); and enablement and disabilities inclusion, as set out in our powering lives commitments to diversity and inclusion.\n\nShell/uni00A0is working towards achieving 35% representation of women in/uni00A0our/uni00A0senior leadership positions by 2025 and 40% by 2030.\n\nWe aim to increase racial and ethnic representation across our workforce so that we better reflect the communities in which we work and live.\n\nAt Shell, we seek to provide a safe, caring and inclusive environment for/uni00A0LGBT+ and PWD (people with disabilities) staff so that they can be/uni00A0themselves and reach their full potential.\n\n## Gender\n\nOur CEO Ben van Beurden is a Catalyst CEO Champion for Change. Like more than 70 other CEOs he has made an organisational and personal commitment to accelerate the advancement of women, including women of colour, into senior leadership and board positions. Shell also endorsed the World Economic Forum Call to Action on closing the gender gap in the/uni00A0oil and gas sector.\n\nWe aim to meet or exceed the target set by the external, UK-based Hampton-Alexander Review of having 33% female Board membership, progressing towards 50% or more representation. We/uni00A0have/uni00A0achieved this target. Currently six out of 12 of our Board members are women.\n\nIn an industry where women have been traditionally underrepresented, three of our five largest energy-trading divisions are led by women.",

As of December 31, 2021, the proportion of women in senior leadership positions was 29.5% (this value includes leavers still in the HR System). This was just short of our ambition to have 30% representation of/uni00A0women in our senior leadership positions by 2021, but it was also an/uni00A0increase of 1.7 percentage points compared with the end of 2020. 'Senior leadership positions' comprises our top 1,250 leaders and is a/uni00A0Shell measure based on salary group levels and is distinct from the term/uni00A0'senior manager' in the statutory disclosures in the table below.\n\n## Gender diversity data (at December 31, 2021)\n\n| Gender diversity data    |   Men | Men   |   Women | Women   |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|\n| Directors of the Company |     6 | 50%   |       6 | 50%     |\n| Senior managers [A]      |   619 | 71%   |     254 | 29%     |\n| Employees (thousand)     |    55 | 67%   |      27 | 33%     |\n\n## Race and ethnicity\n\nWe are working to address racial inequity. We seek to ensure everyone at/uni00A0Shell has equal opportunities and feels included. In 2020, we created the Shell Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Council for Race, supported by a/uni00A020 -member Employee Advisory Board composed of members from a/uni00A0diverse mix of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Sponsored by our CEO Ben van Beurden, Integrated Gas, Renewables and Energy Solutions Director Wael Sawan and Legal Director Donny Ching, the council aims to/uni00A0advance diversity in our workforce so that it better reflects communities where we work and from which we draw talent. Externally, in the USA, we/uni00A0work closely with the civil rights organisation National Urban League. In the UK, Shell was one of the first signatories to the Race at Work Charter of the Business in The Community organisation. We are part of/uni00A0Black Representation in Marketing (BRiM), a UK initiative to improve the representation of black people in marketing.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, 8% of our Board members were from an ethnic/uni00A0minority.\n\n## In the USA:\n\n- \u25a0 We are launching mandatory anti-racism training for all US staff.\n- \u25a0 In 2021, 65% of our US employees were white; 33.2% were people of/uni00A0colour, with 13% Asian, 11.8% Hispanic/Latino, 8.4% black, and 1.8%/uni00A0in the Other category.\n\n## In the UK:\n\n- \u25a0 We have set a recruitment ambition to have 8% black representation in/uni00A0our graduate and experienced hires by 2025, to increase representation in line with UK society through actions such as mentoring and outreach.\n- \u25a0 In 2021, 78.5% of our UK employees identified as white and 21.5% were from an ethnic minority background. Our ethnic minority employees identified as Asian (13.1%), black (3.4%), mixed (2.4%) or another ethnic background (2.6%). As ethnicity declaration is voluntary, our ethnicity declaration rate is not 100% and all calculations are based on a declaration rate of 81%. The 19% of our workforce who have not provided data or have chosen not to declare their ethnicity were not included in our calculations.\n- \u25a0 We co-sponsored the UK 2021 Race at Work survey conducted by/uni00A0the/uni00A0membership organisation Business in the Community.\n- \u25a0 Shell in the UK was one of the first FTSE 100 companies to voluntarily/uni00A0publish ethnicity pay gap data in November 2020.\n\nIn the Netherlands, we began implementing our first Ethnic Inclusion action plan and established an employee sounding board to support this/uni00A0process.\n\nWe are focusing on the USA, UK and Netherlands because these are the/uni00A0Shell hubs where we see the most significant opportunities for representation and inclusion of minority staff.\n\n## LGBT+\n\nWe are working to advance LGBT+ inclusion within Shell. We promote equal opportunity and create an environment where people feel included, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. Our approach reinforces respect for people and provides psychological safety for our LGBT+ employees in line with our core values. Most of our work around LGBT+ inclusion happens at a country level in line with local policies, laws and regulations. Shell is active in external organisations and activities that/uni00A0advance LGBT+ inclusion.\n\nWe benchmark ourselves externally, with consistent top-tier results. In 2021, in the USA we earned a perfect score of 100 points in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index, a recognition we have earned annually since 2016. Shell was rated as a top employer in/uni00A0the Workplace Pride Global Benchmark 2021 survey, with a score of 92.4%. We have also pledged support for the UN Standards of Conduct for Business that aim to eliminate discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people.\n\nShell has a global LGBT+ forum consisting of LGBT+ colleagues and allies./uni00A0The forum now has 14 chapters globally. The LGBT+ focus area is/uni00A0sponsored by Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl. Jessica Uhl was included in the OUTstanding 2021 Ally Executives Role Model List, which recognises business leaders who help create more inclusive workplaces. Two of our LGBT+ colleagues were featured in the OUTstanding 2021 LGBT+ Future Leaders List.\n\n## Enablement and disability inclusion\n\nWe are creating an environment where people with disabilities can excel. We provide support and make adjustments for people with disabilities during the recruitment process and throughout their careers with Shell. This/uni00A0includes equal access to valuable educational resources, training programmes, and emphasis on personal and professional development. In/uni00A0the UK, we partnered with PurpleSpace to launch a personal development programme called 'Empowered and enABLED' to support employees with disabilities to build inner confidence, develop a sense of community and advocate for any adjustments or accommodations they require. In December 2021, we also launched a LinkedIn learning path called 'Spotlight - Disability Inclusion: A Guide for Line Managers.' This/uni00A0collection of learning resources helps Shell line managers to become/uni00A0more confident about issues relating to disability inclusion.\n\nOur workplace accessibility (WPA) service currently serves 86 locations globally. Supported by functions such as Shell Health, HR, Real Estate and/uni00A0IT, WPA is designed to ensure that all employees have access to reasonable physical workplace or other adjustments so that they can work/uni00A0effectively and productively. We combined the home-working ergonomics programme with WPA to help all employees including those/uni00A0with disabilities to work from home effectively during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nt",

First launched in/uni00A0the/uni00A0UK in 2005, we now have 14 enABLE networks globally. In 2021, we/uni00A0formed the Global enABLEMENT Coalition, an internal forum bringing together enABLE networks and functions to create an inclusive, accessible and psychologically safe workplace for people with disabilities. The Enablement and disability inclusion focus area is sponsored by Harry Brekelmans, Projects & Technology Director and Huibert Vigeveno, Downstream Director.\n\nShell is a member of The Valuable 500, a global business group which/uni00A0seeks to eliminate the exclusion of disabled people and ensure that/uni00A0disability remains a priority for company leaders. Shell belongs to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Business Disability Forum. This is a membership organisation that/uni00A0brings business leaders, disabled people, and government together to understand how to improve the life opportunities and experiences of/uni00A0disabled people in employment, the economy and wider society. We/uni00A0belong to PurpleSpace, a networking and professional development hub for disabled employees, employee network leads and allies from all/uni00A0sectors and trades.\n\n## Other diversity and inclusion targets: local/uni00A0national/uni00A0coverage\n\nWe track local national coverage.

The programme is underpinned by our commitment to prohibit bribery, money laundering and tax evasion, and/uni00A0to/uni00A0conduct business in line with our Shell General Business Principles/uni00A0and Code of Conduct.\n\nWe do not tolerate the direct or indirect offer, payment, solicitation or/uni00A0acceptance of bribes in any form. Facilitation payments are also prohibited. The Shell Code of Conduct includes specific guidance for/uni00A0Shell/uni00A0staff, (which comprises employees and contract staff), on requirements to avoid or declare actual, potential or perceived conflicts/uni00A0of/uni00A0interest, and on offering or accepting gifts and hospitality.\n\nRegular communications from our leaders emphasise the importance of/uni00A0these commitments and compliance with requirements. These are reinforced with both global and targeted messages to ensure that Shell staff are kept reminded of their obligations. To support the Code of Conduct, we have mandatory risk-based procedures and controls that\n\naddress a range of compliance risks and ensure that we focus resources, reporting and attention appropriately. By making a commitment to our core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people, and by following the Code of Conduct, we protect Shell's reputation.\n\nIn 2021, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic brought additional focus on/uni00A0conduct risk, which arises from human behaviour, influenced by factors in/uni00A0the external environment. Our core values are undermined if decisions are taken which fall short of the expected standards of ethical behaviour and compliance. Our response to the pandemic remains to reiterate and emphasise that adherence to Shell's compliance rules (including the Code of Conduct) remains essential to protecting our business and helping us/uni00A0to/uni00A0make the right decisions for the future. While maintaining this basic position, pragmatic, risk-based mitigations have been implemented where/uni00A0appropriate to increase response speed and efficiency without undermining the intended purpose of our controls.\n\nOur ethics and compliance requirements are articulated through our/uni00A0policies, standards and procedures and supported by the Ethical Decision-Making Framework, a tool to help staff think through and discuss, in a structured way, the legal, ethical and external consequences of decisions. They are communicated to Shell employees and contract staff and, where necessary and appropriate, to agents and business partners. We monitor and report internally on adherence to select ethics and compliance requirements, such as mandatory training completion and/uni00A0due/uni00A0diligence screening. We pay particular attention to our due diligence procedures when dealing with third parties. We also make our requirements clear to third parties through a variety of measures such as standard contract clauses. We offer a good practice anti-bribery and corruption e-learning course to third parties that may not have a training programme in place. We publish our Ethics and Compliance Manual on/uni00A0shell.com to demonstrate our commitment in this area.\n\nThe Shell Ethics and Compliance Office helps the businesses and functions to implement the ABC/AML and other programmes, assess risks and monitors and reports on progress. Legal counsel provides legal advice globally and supports the implementation of programmes. The Shell Ethics and Compliance Office regularly reviews and revises all ethics and compliance programmes to ensure they remain up to date with applicable laws, regulations and best practices. This includes incorporating results from relevant internal audits, reviews and investigations, and periodically commissioning external reviews and benchmarking.\n\nWe investigate all good-faith allegations of breaches of the Code of/uni00A0Conduct, however they are raised. We are committed to ensuring all/uni00A0such incidents are investigated by specialists in accordance with our Investigation Principles. Allegations may be raised confidentially and anonymously through several channels, including a Shell Global Helpline operated by an independent provider.\n\nAllegations of breaches of the Code of Conduct may be raised confidentially and anonymously through several channels, including the/uni00A0Shell Global Helpline, which is operated by an independent provider./uni00A0In 2021, there were 1,479 entries to the Shell Global Helpline: 1,177/uni00A0allegations and 302 inquiries.    The Business Integrity Department is/uni00A0a/uni00A0specialist investigative unit within Shell Internal Audit that is responsible for managing the Shell Global Helpline and the Group level incident management procedures. The Board has delegated the oversight of the functioning of the Shell Global Helpline to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is also authorised to establish and monitor the implementation of procedures for the receipt, retention, proportionate and independent investigation and follow-up action of reported matters.",

In some cases, we may report a violation to the relevant authorities, which could/uni00A0lead to legal action, fines or imprisonment.\n\nInternal investigations confirmed 181 substantiated breaches of the Code of Conduct in 2021. As a result, we dismissed or terminated the contracts of a total of 67 employees and contract staff./uni00A0\n\n## EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS\n\nWe have a number of share plans designed to align employees' interests with our performance through share ownership. For information on the share-based compensation plans for Executive Directors, see the 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on pages 166-170.\n\n## PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN, LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN AND/uni00A0EXCHANGED AWARDS UNDER THE BG LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN\n\nUnder the Performance Share Plan (PSP), 50% of the award is linked to certain indicators described in 'Performance indicators' on pages 36-37, averaged over the performance period. For 2018 to 2019, 12.5% of the award was linked to free cash flow (FCF) and the remaining 37.5% was/uni00A0linked to a comparative performance condition which involves a comparison with four of our main competitors over the performance period, based on three performance measures. For 2020, 11.25% of the award was linked to the FCF measure and 5% was linked to an energy transition measure. The remaining 33.75% was linked to the comparative performance condition. From 2021, 10% of the award is linked to the FCF measure and 10% is linked to an energy transition measure. The remaining 30% is linked to the comparative performance condition.\n\nUnder the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards made in 2018, 25% of the award is linked to the FCF measure and the remaining 75% is linked to the comparative performance conditions mentioned above. For 2019 and 2020, 22.5% of the award is linked to the FCF measure and 10% is linked to an energy transition measure. The remaining 67.5% is linked to the comparative performance condition mentioned above. From 2021, 20% of the award is linked to the FCF measure and 20% is linked to an energy transition measure. The remaining 60% is linked to the comparative performance condition.\n\nSeparately, following the BG acquisition, certain employee share awards made in 2015 under BG's Long-term Incentive Plan were automatically exchanged for equivalent awards over shares in the Company. The/uni00A0outstanding awards take the form of nil-cost options.\n\nUnder all plans, all shares that vest are increased by an amount equal to the notional dividends accrued on those shares during the period from the award date to the vesting date. In certain circumstances, awards may be adjusted before delivery or subject to clawback after delivery. None of the awards result in beneficial ownership until the shares vest.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee Note 22 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 274.\n\n## RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN\n\nUnder the Restricted Share Plan, awards are made on a highly selective basis to senior staff. Shares are awarded subject to a three-year retention period. All shares that vest are increased by an amount equal to the notional dividends accrued on those shares during the period from the award date to the vesting date. In certain circumstances, awards may be/uni00A0adjusted before delivery or subject to clawback after delivery.\n\n## GLOBAL EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN\n\nEligible employees in participating countries may participate in the Global/uni00A0Employee Share Purchase Plan. This plan enables them to make contributions from net pay towards the purchase of the Company's shares at a 15% discount to the market price, either at the start or at the end of an/uni00A0annual cycle, whichever date offers the lower market price.\n\n## UK SHELL ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN\n\nEligible employees of participating Shell companies in the UK may participate in the Shell All Employee Share Ownership Plan, under which monthly contributions from gross pay are made towards the purchase of the Company's shares. For every six shares purchased by the employee, one matching share is provided at no cost to the employee.\n\n## UK SHARESAVE SCHEME\n\nEligible employees of participating Shell companies in the UK have been/uni00A0able to participate in the UK Sharesave Scheme. Options have/uni00A0been granted over the Company's shares at market value on the invitation date. These options are normally exercisable after completion of a three-year or/uni00A0five-year contractual savings period. From 2017 no further grants were/uni00A0made under this plan.\n\nSeparately, following the acquisition of BG, certain participants in the BG/uni00A0Sharesave Scheme chose to roll over their outstanding BG share options into options over the Company's shares. The BG option price (at/uni00A0a/uni00A0discount of 20% to market value) was converted into an equivalent Company option price at a ratio agreed with HM Revenue and Customs. These options are normally exercisable after completion of a three-year contractual savings period. As of December 31, 2021, there are no outstanding UK Sharesave or BG Sharesave options.\n\n## POWERING PROGRESS SHARE AWARD\n\nThis was a one-off share award granted to all eligible employees of Shell on June 18, 2021. This award supports employee engagement in the Powering Progress strategy. These awards vest at the end of a one-year period. All shares that vest are increased by an amount equal to the notional dividends accrued on those shares during the period from the/uni00A0award date to the vesting date.\n\nStrategic Report signed on behalf of the Board\n\n/s/ Linda M.

        "page_content": "## INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIR\n\nI feel very honoured to have been appointed Chair at our 2021 AGM, particularly at such a pivotal time for Shell, the industry and wider society. It is also a great honour to succeed Chad Holliday, whose chairmanship I have much admired and who I know is warmly remembered not only for the Shell achievements he oversaw but also for his integrity and leadership.\n\nBefore being appointed Chair, I was delighted to participate as a Non-executive Director in the shaping of the compelling Powering Progress strategy that Shell unveiled in February 2021. I believe Shell has an exceptional portfolio of future-facing assets and, working with Ben van Beurden and the Board, we will profitably accelerate Shell's transition to a net-zero emissions energy business that continues to generate substantial value for shareholders, customers and communities alike.\n\nThe recent simplification of Shell supports this value generation. The Board/uni00A0thanks our shareholders for the overwhelming support shown at/uni00A0the/uni00A0General Meeting in December 2021. This ultimately allowed us to/uni00A0establish a single line of shares to eliminate the complexity of Shell's A/B share structure and to align Shell's tax residence with its country of/uni00A0incorporation in the UK. On December 20, 2021, the Board formally approved the simplification, and on December 31, the Board approved the key steps required to move the Company's tax residence to the UK. The Company's name was changed on January 21, 2022, and the Company's shares were assimilated into a single line of shares on January/uni00A029, 2022, completing the simplification.\n\nShell is proud of its Anglo-Dutch heritage and will continue to be a significant employer with a major presence in the Netherlands. The Group's Projects & Technology division, its global Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses and its renewable energies hub remain in The/uni00A0Hague. Shell's growing presence in offshore wind and the recent decision to build a world-scale low-carbon biofuels plant at the Energy\n\nSir Andrew Mackenzie Chair\n\nand Chemicals Park Rotterdam underline the importance of the Netherlands to Shell's energy transition activities. So too does the fact that we are working towards final investment decisions on plans to build Europe's biggest electrolyser in Rotterdam and to participate in the Porthos carbon capture and storage project.\n\nThe last two years have been transformative - not just in the macroeconomic uncertainty around prices and demand for oil and gas products, but also in the ongoing impact on our ways of working, our people, our customers and their families. Throughout 2021, society continued to cope and live with COVID-19, with governments loosening and tightening restrictions based on local conditions. As vaccinations increased, workers in some regions started returning to offices. Various travel restrictions were lifted. But many of Shell's office-based employees continued to work from home in 2021 and into 2022. Although our offices in some regions are returning to a new normal, many of our office-based staff have not worked together physically for almost two years. Health measures implemented at our sites have led to changes such as differing shift patterns and self-isolation. This can impact the time people are away from their families. Yet in this challenging environment, our people drove proposals to final investment decision across the business and safely delivered significant projects, such as the sale of our Permian assets, the/uni00A0divestment of the Deer Park refinery in Texas, USA, and Company simplification to name but a few.\n\nAs Chad said last year, the list of what our people do, and continue to do, for Shell and for each other is extensive and in many instances humbling. The Board and I thank them for their continued commitment, perseverance and personal sacrifices.\n\nWe are equally aware of the scale of the complex climate challenges confronting Shell and society. The answer, though, is not as simple as stopping the extraction of oil and gas and wholly shifting capital investment into other areas. The cash generated by Shell's oil and gas operations provides returns to our investors, who can be global pension funds, governments, insurance companies and investment products through which the general public invest. Crucially, the cash flows from oil/uni00A0and gas also help fund Shell's investments in lower-carbon energy businesses. These help Shell, our customers and entire sectors to cut emissions and accelerate the energy transition. The goal is a low-carbon world, not a single lower-carbon company. Achieving a low-carbon world/uni00A0requires governments, companies and society to work together to deliver change - to help people make the right choices, in a way that is affordable and inclusive. We believe that our Powering Progress strategy enables this. We think it allows Shell to successfully navigate the energy transition in step with society. We believe that the commitments Shell has/uni00A0made within its shareholder-approved energy transition strategy to/uni00A0drive this collective goal are market leading amongst the companies in/uni00A0our sector.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## INTRODUCTION FROM THE CHAIR\n\n## ENERGY TRANSITION STRATEGY\n\nIn February 2021, Shell announced its intention to put its energy transition strategy to shareholders for an advisory vote every three years, with the first vote being at the 2021 AGM. This was an important step for Shell and/uni00A0the first time that an energy company asked shareholders to vote on/uni00A0its energy transition strategy.\n\nShareholders endorsed the energy transition strategy, with 88.74% voting in favour of this resolution. The Board thanks our shareholders for their support. At the 2022 AGM, scheduled for May 24, 2022, shareholders will be asked to vote on our progress in respect of our energy transition. Shareholder support is important as our business changes and we work towards our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\n## BOARD LEADERSHIP AND SHELL'S PURPOSE\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') provides that the Board should promote the long-term sustainable success of Shell, generating value for shareholders and contributing to wider society. The/uni00A0Board believes that Shell's efforts give it an effective framework to play its part in the energy transition as a growing, successful, commercial organisation. In the Board's view, this framework will allow Shell to provide the energy solutions that consumers will want and buy in this period of uncertain change. The Board also thinks that Shell will be able to/uni00A0deliver against its recently published targets and reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products it sells.\n\nThe purpose of Shell is set out in the early pages of this Annual Report. We/uni00A0will continue with the theme of communicating purpose throughout this Governance report. We will focus on how Shell's governance operates in practice, and why we believe this is the best approach for us.\n\nThe Governance report is structured around the key themes of the Code. Our narrative seeks to explain how governance supports and protects Shell and our stakeholders.\n\nAlthough Shell applies the principles and the spirit of the Code, there are/uni00A0instances where we adopt an approach slightly different from that suggested by some of the Code's provisions. We explain these on page 134. In these instances, our governance processes are considered appropriate, given the specific circumstances and range of factors particular to Shell, such as its global nature, size, complexity and history./uni00A0More detail on Shell's compliance with the Code can be found/uni00A0on/uni00A0page 134.\n\nLast year, Chad highlighted the importance of our stakeholders and the greater level of external focus on these groups. We also expressed our enthusiasm for building on our engagement with our stakeholder groups in/uni00A02021. The use of technology to facilitate virtual engagements proved valuable, and continues to improve. But sadly the continued restrictions on/uni00A0social interaction and travel, combined with other notable projects needing the Board's attention, meant that we did not make as much progress on this ambition as we had hoped. As a result, this is a focus area/uni00A0for 2022, as outlined in the outcomes of the Board evaluation on page 139. Information on how the Board discharges its duty in relation to/uni00A0key stakeholder interests, including those of our workforce, and an explanation of how it considered these when making principal decisions are set out on page 16. On page 137 we provide information about our Board activities and highlight which stakeholders we considered.\n\nOur workforce engagement methods remain unchanged from those previously disclosed. As we continue to implement the proposals from our Reshape reorganisation, we anticipate an enhanced level of workforce engagement, within the parameters of COVID-19 restrictions. We continue to believe that constructive relationships built on mutual respect and transparency help Shell attract and retain employees while supporting greater productivity and operational safety and efficiency. Ensuring that the employee voice is heard on relevant matters in the boardroom in practical ways is key to understanding the broader impact of business decisions, including with respect to organisational culture.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of culture and its link to delivering Shell's purpose and strategy. Given our culture's importance, it requires long-term commitment. The Board believes that our people and safety culture is strong, and takes pride in having such a culture.\n\nShell's culture reflects the values of the organisation - honesty, integrity and respect for people. These underpin all the work we do and are embedded in our strategy and purpose. The Board continues to increase its focus on Shell's culture and in 2021 the Nomination and Succession Committee initiated an in-depth examination of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (see page 147).\n\n## DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nMore information on how the Board and its Committees support business operations is provided on page 135. Further detail is contained within the Terms of Reference for each Committee, which are provided on our website. Each year the Board committees' Terms of Reference are reviewed and updated, as required.\n\nMaintaining independent judgement on the Board is a fundamental governance principle and one the Board supports. The Code provides circumstances that it considers are likely to impair, or could appear to impair, a Non-executive Director's independence. One of these is tenure. On page 134 we note that for part of 2021 our previous Chair, Chad Holliday, exceeded the recommended term outlined in the Code. When this new provision was introduced, we provided a clear explanation to shareholders that we believed it was right for the Company to exceed this/uni00A0term in order to ensure smooth Board succession. The Board also disclosed when it expected Chad's tenure to end. Director and Chair succession has been facilitated in line with the timeline that was communicated to shareholders.\n\n## COMPOSITION, SUCCESSION AND EVALUATION\n\n- For biographies of current Board members see pages 121-128.\n- For how the Board, Committees and Directors appraised their performance see pages 137-140.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, shareholders appointed Jane Holl Lute as a Nonexecutive Director to the Board. After joining the Board, Jane was appointed to the Audit Committee. An overview of Jane's induction programme can be found on page 149. Committee membership has been/uni00A0further reviewed during the year. The 2021 AGM was also Chad Holliday's last day with Shell, after six years' service as Chair and since joining the Board in September 2010. He left a distinguished legacy of strong, inclusive leadership, and the Board is deeply grateful for his tireless and dedicated commitment to Shell and its people over the years.\n\n- An overview of the Chair succession process was provided in the 2020 Annual Report and a summary is included on page 150.",

Sinead Gorman is/uni00A0to be appointed Chief Financial Officer of Shell plc, effective April 1, 2022. The Board is immensely grateful to Jessica for her tremendous contribution to the company over many years, but particularly as CFO and especially during the past two years as we successfully tackled the many challenges presented by the pandemic. She has been instrumental in strengthening Shell's financial position, putting in place measures to secure the company's long-term health while delivering industry leading cash flows year on year. Jessica has been an exemplary ambassador for/uni00A0Shell and the company's strength today is testament to her professionalism, resolve and values-driven leadership.\n\n## AUDIT, RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control and oversight over Shell's financial reporting. A variety of standing matters and more specific topics are discussed by the Audit Committee throughout the year. As part of the year-end reporting process, the Audit Committee advises the Board on/uni00A0the/uni00A0adequacy of the system of risk management and internal control, the/uni00A0appropriateness of the viability statement and going concern basis of/uni00A0accounting. The Audit Committee also advises on whether this Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the/uni00A0information necessary for stakeholders to assess Shell's position and performance, business model and strategy. More information on the Audit Committee's activities, highlights and priorities can be found in its report on page 153.\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nAs we shared last year, Shell is at a point where it must transform itself. The/uni00A0steps of this transformation, will be intensely scrutinised by society and/uni00A0the environment in which we operate will continue to change rapidly. Not all of our stakeholders will be fully supportive of the decisions that we/uni00A0take, yet we must frame and implement our strategy with courage and/uni00A0commitment and a focus on the long-term success of the Company. This we will do with the humility to listen, learn and adapt. Shell's Board and leadership must be steadfast, agile and sensitive to the opportunities, risks and rewards confronting the business. I, my fellow Directors on the Board, and our colleagues across the business, remain confident that Shell/uni00A0is up to the task.\n\n## SIR ANDREW MACKENZIE\n\nMarch 9, 2022\n\nChair\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE\n\nThe Board confirms that, throughout the year, the Company has applied the principles, both in spirit and in form, and complied with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in July 2018 (the 'Code'), with the exception of/uni00A0provisions 5 and 19 noted below. A copy of the Code can be found on/uni00A0the FRC's website: www.frc.org.uk.\n\nShell's governance arrangements have been considered alongside the/uni00A0Code. The information set out in the Directors' report, including the Board committee reports on (pages 147 to 170) is intended to provide an/uni00A0explanation of how the Code's principles were applied practically throughout the year. We also provided clear and meaningful explanation below where we believe stakeholders may benefit from more specific information on a particular Code provision 4.\n\n## CHAIR TENURE (PROVISION 19)\n\nCharles O. Holliday (Chad) was appointed as Chair in 2015, after four/uni00A0and a half years as a Non-executive Director. In September 2019 he/uni00A0reached a tenure of nine years. Chad stood down from the Board at/uni00A0the 2021 AGM.\n\nThe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code introduced a new requirement that the Chair not remain in post beyond nine years of the date of their first appointment. As a result, for part of the year in review (from January 1 to May 18, 2021), Shell did not comply with this provision. But the Code also notes that to facilitate effective succession planning and development of a/uni00A0diverse Board this period can be extended, particularly where the Chair was an existing non-executive Director on appointment. Within the 2019 Annual Report we provided a thorough explanation of why Chad was to remain on the Board for longer than nine years as we transitioned to the (then) new Code requirement. We also said when his tenure would end. An explanation also featured on page 126 of the 2020 Annual Report. Following the 2021 AGM, Chad was succeeded by Sir Andrew Mackenzie, in line with the timeline Shell disclosed in 2020 (within the/uni00A02019 Annual report).\n\n## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT (PROVISION 5)\n\nThe size and diversity of our employee base and wider workforce have complicated the feasibility of implementing any of the three specific workforce engagement methods recommended in the Code. The Board believes that its current approach to workforce engagement continues to/uni00A0be pragmatic and effective, particularly when considered against the/uni00A0required coverage needed for a global organisation such as Shell.\n\nElsewhere in this Annual Report, we explain how our people are essential/uni00A0to the successful delivery of the Shell strategy, and how the Board recognises the importance of understanding their views through engagement. In previous Annual Reports, we communicated the Board's desire and intention to increase its direct engagements, when the Board, committees and individual Directors visit our sites across the world. The ongoing travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic again limited our ability to do this in 2021. While some engagements could not be held physically, many were held virtually, and there were opportunities for the Board to speak with our stakeholders and obtain feedback. The/uni00A0Board also intends to keep the effectiveness of the engagements under review. Stakeholder engagement also continues to be enhanced in/uni00A0management reporting. More information on the current approach and/uni00A0a/uni00A0description of the channels used by the Board, its committees, and/uni00A0the Executive Committee are outlined in 'Workforce engagement' on pages 145 to 146.\n\n## AGM VOTING (PROVISION 4)\n\nAt the 2021 AGM more than 20% of shareholders supported a resolution which the Board had recommended voting against. Provision 4 of the UK Governance Code requires certain actions to be undertaken if more than 20% of shareholders vote in a way which is different to what the Board recommended. There are three stages to these actions. First, explain when announcing the voting results what actions the company intends to take to/uni00A0consult shareholders to understand the reasons behind the voting result. Shell included this explanation with its voting results, published on May 18, 2021. Second, an update on the engagement with shareholders should be published no later than six months after the shareholder meeting. This statement was added to the Shell website in November 2021. Third, a/uni00A0final summary of the engagement and the actions taken should be/uni00A0included within the Annual Report. This information is provided on/uni00A0page 141.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS OUTSIDE THE/uni00A0UK\n\nIn addition to complying with applicable corporate governance requirements in the UK, the Company complies with the rules of Euronext Amsterdam as well as Dutch securities laws because of its listing on that exchange. The Company likewise adheres to US securities laws and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and regulations because its securities are registered in the USA and listed on the NYSE.",

The/uni00A0names of the Directors that held office during the year can be found on pages 121-128. Information on the Directors who are seeking appointment or reappointment is included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\nThere is no fixed amount of times that the Board may meet in one year.

Forthcoming Board agenda items are categorised as: Strategy & Portfolio, Delivery & Performance, External Environment, Corporate & Miscellaneous or Standard items. Of the standard items, Board agendas regularly include reports from the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and each Board committee. Core values moments and Shell Hero stories featured in early 2021 while updates continued throughout the year from various businesses and key functions, including Investor Relations; Health and Safety, Security and Environment; Information Technology; Human Resources; and Legal, as well as the Company Secretary. The Board also considers and approves the quarterly, half-year and full-year financial results, shareholder distributions and the associated announcements, and,/uni00A0at most meetings, considers investment, divestment and/or financing proposals. To enable purposeful debates and focus on particular aspects of/uni00A0agenda topics, including the impact on key stakeholders, Directors have/uni00A0an opportunity to specify information they require to be provided in advance of Board meetings. Finally, given the number of new Non-executive Directors over 2020 and 2021 in a continued virtual environment, virtual break-out sessions were built in to try to nurture relationship-building while promoting focused discussions on discrete topics.\n\nDuring the year, where possible, certain Non-executive Directors conducted site visits. These visits were predominantly virtual, as a result/uni00A0of/uni00A0continued COVID-19 restrictions. The visits were designed to provide Directors with a deeper insight into certain business operations. Directors/uni00A0also held various virtual workforce engagements, as well as/uni00A0virtual external stakeholder engagements. More detail on these can/uni00A0be/uni00A0found in the table below and on pages 138-139.\n\nSome of the activities and areas of Board focus over the year are summarised in the table below. The information below is not exhaustive. Information on other topics discussed by the Board and details of the resulting decisions are covered elsewhere, primarily in the Section 172 Statement contained in the Strategic Report on page 16.

Effort was again invested into making the virtual sessions as engaging and interactive as possible, including break-out sessions and staff engagements. Directors shared the feedback obtained during the staff engagements on topics such as staff views on Shell strategy (including acceleration of Shell's energy transition strategy), Project Reshape, pride in the Shell brand, diversity, and pride and concerns regarding Shell's future.\n\nStrategy Day 2021 marked the start of the roll-out of Shell's Powering Progress strategy. The agenda focused on implementing this strategy and/uni00A0the critical enablers. Delivering the Powering Progress strategy requires us to transform Shell. The challenge is to navigate how we move/uni00A0from the certainty of familiar and proven business models to the uncertainty of a new energy environment, which is still evolving at variable pace in different sectors and regions. The Board Strategy Day agenda was built on the theme of Powering Progress in an Accelerating World, explored the topics which pose strategic risk or opportunity for Shell. The/uni00A0Board also reviewed areas where the strategy is already in action as/uni00A0implementation is under way and new businesses are developing. The/uni00A0Board Strategy Days included discussions on various topics including:\n\n- \u25a0 simplification of Shell's equity capital and corporate structure;\n- \u25a0 energy transition and commitment to net zero emissions;\n- \u25a0 review of Upstream strategy;\n- \u25a0 update on Financial Framework and financing the energy transition;/uni00A0and\n\nStakeholders\n\n- \u25a0 review of Power strategy;\n- \u25a0 deep dive on electric vehicle charging.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reports in relation to the Audit Committee, Nomination and Succession Committee, Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee and Remuneration Committee were sent to the respective committee chairs.\n\nThe feedback from the Board Directors was positive throughout their responses to the evaluation. Views were provided on what additional expertise or experience might benefit Board composition through the energy transition. These views were actively considered, along with other/uni00A0factors, in Nomination and Succession Committee discussions.\n\nBoard dynamics - The Non-executive Directors' engagement, support/uni00A0and challenge of management was rated very highly, with the quality of the interaction and the openness of the Executive team being commended. The Boardroom atmosphere was also highly rated.\n\nBoard oversight - The Board's oversight of the Powering Progress strategy was rated highly overall, as was the understanding of the capacity of the Company to deliver the strategy. Some recommendations for further enhancement were received in this area. Board oversight of monitoring various external forces was also highly rated, although the Board noted an appetite for improved oversight of new technologies and digitalisation. The Board viewed its oversight of various specific aspects of/uni00A0risk positively and suggested further enhancements to improve risk discussions between the Board and management. The Board's oversight of the Company's processes for managing and developing senior executive talent was rated very highly, with a focus on the work in progress on further improving the ethnic diversity of senior talent.\n\nManagement and focus of meetings - Themes included: Board papers (a common topic for many corporates), which would still benefit from further simplification; and a desire to return to physical meetings when circumstances permit. The support available to the Board in terms of/uni00A0the induction/onboarding, Company Secretarial support and access to/uni00A0external advice was rated highly.\n\nStakeholder oversight - The mechanisms by which the Board obtains insight into the views and needs of major investors and employees were highly rated. At the same time, it was again noted that mechanisms for obtaining views of customers, private/retail investors, communities and suppliers should be explored to see whether feasible and relevant enhancements could be made. The Board's effectiveness in monitoring and assessing culture throughout the organisation was rated positively overall, although the Board indicated interest in further enhancing its oversight in this area, particularly as the Company transforms through the/uni00A0energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## BOARD ACTIVITIES AND EVALUATION continued\n\n## Delivery against the 2021 ambitions\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact both the near- and long-term business outlook. Although government restrictions in many countries loosened as vaccinations increased, resulting in some regions starting to return to offices, international travel continued to present challenges well into the fourth quarter of 2021 and into 2022. Through the/uni00A0use of additional meetings, the Board balanced its focus on short-term operational matters and long-term strategy. However, delivery of some of/uni00A0the Board's ambitions were affected by the need to focus attention and/uni00A0resources on other key events, such as the completion of Reshape, Shell's company-wide reorganisation, and the simplification announced towards the end of 2021.\n\nThe Board progressed and supported significant projects throughout the/uni00A0year. Some of these are discussed in more detail in the Section 172 statement on page 16. These efforts were made throughout 2021 alongside numerous sessions to monitor and support management in/uni00A0implementing strategy. Management sought the Board's input and support on the proposed announcements for Strategy Day 2021, the presentations on stakeholder feedback from Strategy Day 2021, and the/uni00A0Board's review, and approval of Shell's energy transition strategy.\n\nThe Board continued to monitor the Reshape reorganisation and had regular engagements on culture and workforce engagement through various sources. Because information on culture is dispersed across various reports and activities, and because of timeliness after launching Powering Progress and finalising Reshape, a discussion was originally planned for/uni00A0the latter part of 2021 to determine how best to address this topic in/uni00A0a/uni00A0unified and pragmatic way. Subsequently this was deferred to early 2022 because of the other pressing Board agenda topics that arose in/uni00A0the/uni00A0second half of 2021.\n\nOther 2021 ambitions were: Chair succession, which has received positive reviews from the Chair evaluation; and enhancements for the greater oversight of litigation, which were also implemented. Further optimisation of the Non-executive Director onboarding programme was largely completed (except for items still impacted by travel restrictions, such as sharing Board travel). The plan to enhance ongoing training and explore pragmatic ways to further improve Board materials was impacted by the/uni00A0prioritisation of resources towards other significant projects.\n\n## Planned enhancements for 2022\n\n- \u25a0 building on the 'monitoring execution and strategic implementation' focus area from the 2020 evaluation, (including ensuring continued alignment on the Financial Framework). Directors' suggestions were relayed to appropriate individuals for incorporation into the Strategy Agenda for 2022;\n\nThe 2021 Board evaluation findings provided areas of focus or priorities for 2022. There was strong agreement between the Board and Executive Committee around:/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 clarifying the need for, and how best to obtain, wider external stakeholder views in feasible and relevant ways; and\n- \u25a0 enhancing the risk management dialogue between management and/uni00A0the Board./uni00A0\n\n## Powering Progress strategy/strategic direction/energy transition/uni00A0\n\nThis is very important for the years ahead. The Board and Executive Committee will continue to oversee the strategic execution as a priority (particularly Powering Progress, and the net zero/Carbon Management Framework).\n\n## External engagement\n\nEnhancing interactions and/or obtaining the views of relevant external stakeholders, including external experts, customers, partners and society, was highlighted within the evaluation. The Board began discussions on this objective at its February 2022 meeting, considering how it could best be accomplished, and the informational scope that would be most relevant from various stakeholder groups. The Board plans to explore this topic further in 2022.\n\n## Financial framework\n\nCapital investment allocation and operating expense are key to achieving the Company's 2030 net-zero goals and intermediate actions. Alignment on the distribution policy/strategy and on the long-term financial framework will also be areas of focus.\n\n## Chair evaluation\n\nThe Chair was very highly rated as having made a strong start under difficult circumstances, with the COVID-19 pandemic limiting opportunities for face-to-face interaction. It was noted that his relationship with the CEO is balanced and positive. Transparency and good alignment between the Chair and the Non-executive Directors was highlighted. Directors praised his clear communication skills, noting only minor areas for improvement. The Chair's management of the individual input of Directors both inside and outside Board meetings was highly rated, and his availability to individual Directors was valued and appreciated. The Board also praised his ability to keep agendas focused with sufficient time for full discussion.\n\nThe Deputy Chair communicated the feedback to the Chair, along with requests to:\n\n- \u25a0 continue to apply his industry experience and expertise as relevant in/uni00A0Board discussions, which adds strong contextual perspectives.\n- \u25a0 consider feasible and reasonable improvements in reducing Board materials and meetings; and\n\nThe Chair fully accepted the feedback, agreed to reflect and act upon it, and offered additional development points not identified that he was working on.",

        "page_content": "## UNDERSTANDING AND ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\nThe Board continues to value and recognise the importance of engagement and co-operation with our stakeholders. Time is dedicated to listening to different stakeholder views and our commitment to stakeholder engagement is built upon the understanding that knowledge-sharing, widening of experiences and adopting a learner mindset will help us achieve our commercial, environmental and social objectives.\n\nThe Board's and Shell's commitment to public collaboration and stakeholder engagement has in the past been easier to demonstrate by/uni00A0looking at the number of physical events and engagements held in a/uni00A0particular year. In recent years, as we continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to be more creative and maximise virtual opportunities in order to obtain feedback on stakeholder issues and/uni00A0priorities.\n\nWe continue to put the safety and health of our people, customers and other stakeholders first, along with the safe operations of our businesses. With that as our priority, we have endeavoured to engage in ways that are as effective and as safe as possible.\n\nThe continued impact of COVID-19 has inevitably limited the engagements we planned for 2021. Many of our events have again been/uni00A0held virtually, with the Board prioritising the health and safety of/uni00A0our/uni00A0shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. Most recently, our General Meeting was held physically in the Netherlands but shareholders were urged to consider whether physically attending was in their and the public's interest, with the meeting webcast being recommended as an alternative way to follow the proceedings. Any engagements, virtual or physical, always involved considering stakeholder interests, public health and safety, and the advice and law of local governments. The Board was disappointed that there have been relatively few possibilities to engage in person in 2021, having hoped for a significant improvement on the limited opportunities of 2020. We remain grateful for the opportunities that we have had and are thankful for the continued support of our stakeholders. We also look forward to future engagements in the year ahead, when it/uni00A0is/uni00A0safe and appropriate to hold them.\n\nThe Directors have continued to consider stakeholders' views in Board discussions and decision-making, as described on page 16.\n\nEngagement with our stakeholders goes beyond the Board and is continuous. Our broader businesses regularly engage with stakeholders throughout the year, and in the build-up to or during many Shell projects or activities. This engagement is often governed by formulated policies, control frameworks, regulation and legislation. It may differ by region.\n\n## Site visits\n\n- \u25a0 first-hand insights into portfolio positions; and\n\nThe Chair, certain Board committees and Non-executive Directors traditionally visit a number of Shell operations and overseas offices. The/uni00A0visits are designed to provide Directors with:\n\n- \u25a0 opportunities to engage directly with stakeholders including employees, partners, communities and NGOs.\n\nIn previous years, and as part of the Board evaluation process, the Directors have reflected on the use of site visits for improving the Board's oversight of risk and concluded that the best way to determine if risks are being properly managed is to visit sites and talk to local management. Similarly, some Directors have used site visits as a way to monitor and assess culture first-hand. They have commented on the difficulty of doing that this year. It was also noted that visits to key sites played an important part of the induction process for new Board members and provided good opportunities for Board members to get to know each other better.\n\nAlternative arrangements were made where feasible, and details of these are described below.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nThe Chair, the Deputy Chair and Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Vice President Investor Relations each meet regularly with major shareholders and report the views of such shareholders to the Board. Committee chairs also seek engagement with shareholders on significant matters related to their areas of responsibility. Over the year and following his appointment as Chair, Sir Andrew Mackenzie met with 93 major shareholders, including at roadshows. Prior to his retirement from the Board and position as Chair, Chad Holliday met with 34 major shareholders, including at roadshows. The Remuneration Committee Chair met with 31 shareholders over the course of the year. A variety of topics were discussed.\n\nShareholders can contact Shell directly via the 'Contact us' section of the/uni00A0Shell website. This allows investors' questions to be directed to the appropriate Shell team that can assist. Shareholders are also able to make use of our automated question response tool. Investors can also access information via the frequently asked questions section of the Shell/uni00A0website.\n\nThe Shell website also provides contact details for our registrar, Equiniti, shareholder queries, our media team, requests for copies of the Annual Report, and general customer enquiries.\n\nThe Company's registrar operates an internet access facility for registered shareholders, providing details of their shareholdings. Facilities are also provided for shareholders to lodge proxy appointments electronically. The/uni00A0Corporate Nominee service, facilitated by Equiniti, provides a facility for investors to hold their shares in the Company in paperless form.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement on AGM resolution\n\nIn September 2021, after the second quarter results and the summer holiday period, the Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer hosted meetings with some of our large shareholders. These meetings covered many topics. Shareholders were asked for specific feedback on Shell's energy transition strategy and the resolution submitted by the Follow This group. Shareholders who had voted for the/uni00A0Follow This resolution were asked about the rationale of supporting it/uni00A0while also voting in favour of Shell's energy transition strategy. These shareholders were also asked what they would like to change in Shell's energy transition strategy. In some instances, these discussions also included talk about the outcome of the Dutch court case.\n\nMany investors were complimentary about Shell's energy transition strategy and the comprehensive targets we had set. Some shareholders said they were merely supporting a 'climate-related' resolution, and so/uni00A0they could or probably had supported both Shell's energy transition strategy and the Follow This resolution. Some investors mentioned that they would like to see targets for cutting absolute emissions rather than just reducing net carbon intensity. But many were understanding of why these had not been set. Some said Shell's net-zero target needed to be clearer and not so dependent on customers reducing their emissions.\n\nAll of the stakeholder feedback was added to the ongoing internal considerations of the Company's climate targets, along with the outcome of/uni00A0the Dutch court case, the Powering Progress strategy and the commitments that Shell had made within its energy transition strategy. On/uni00A0October 28, 2021, Shell announced a new target to halve Scope 1 and/uni00A02 emissions under Shell's operational control by 2030, compared with/uni00A02016 levels on a net basis. This is another strategic milestone on our/uni00A0path/uni00A0to becoming a net-zero/uni00A0emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.",

        "page_content": "## UNDERSTANDING AND ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS continued\n\n## Board governance event\n\nWe previously reported our proposal for the next Board Engagement Day to be held in October 2021, circumstances permitting. Unfortunately, after the publication of the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, and 20-F, the COVID-19 pandemic continued and was still causing concern in the autumn of 2021. The Board had to balance health and safety concerns with the value to Shell of stakeholder engagements, such as Board Engagement Day. As a result, there was no Board Engagement Day in 2021. The Board has sought to obtain feedback and be involved in discussions in other ways, in the absence of/uni00A0this particular event. These ways are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\n## Engagements in 2021\n\nInformation on engagements the Board has held during the year are summarised below.

        "page_content": "## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nThe Board recognises merit in the Code's three mechanisms for engaging with the workforce. As with all the Code's provisions, boards must consider the size and structure of their business, including its international scope, and select an approach that most practically delivers the underlying spirit and ambition of the Code, even if the chosen approach differs from what the Code outlines. The Code does note that alternative methods for workforce engagement are supported where an explanation is provided.\n\nThe Code states that its use of the term 'workforce' is not meant to align/uni00A0with legal definitions of workforce, employee, worker or similar terms. But for a global organisation bound by the laws of more than 70/uni00A0countries, blurring the clearly prescribed legal definitions that affect complex issues/uni00A0(such as local health, safety, security and environment (HSSE) requirements, work contract terms, legal accountability, employment rights) or merging two definitions of the same term could have a notable impact on the business, its operations and its stakeholder relationships (including with suppliers). As a result, Shell considers its workforce to be/uni00A0employees of companies in the Shell Group. The Board also engages with others outside this group (for example, on site visits), and some of this/uni00A0engagement is shared on page 141.\n\nAlthough our reporting and formal engagement focuses predominantly on/uni00A0our employees, all individuals working on Shell sites (including Shell offices) are required to undertake certain Shell training (for example, on/uni00A0matters relating to HSSE and the Code of Conduct). Adhering to the Life-Saving Rules and the Code of Conduct compliance obligations is included within our contracts with suppliers. The Shell Global Helpline is/uni00A0available for all workers to report matters of concern.\n\nFor many years, Shell has recognised the importance of engaging with its/uni00A0workforce. Engagement is especially important in maintaining strong business delivery in volatile times of change. We strive to maintain a dialogue between management and our workforce - both directly and/uni00A0where appropriate, through employee representative bodies. Management regularly engages with the workforce through a range of/uni00A0formal and informal channels, including via webcasts and emails from/uni00A0the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other senior executives, webcasts, town halls, team meetings, face-to-face gatherings (pre-COVID-19), interviews with Senior Management and online publications via our intranet.\n\nThe Board considers effective engagement a key element of its understanding of the Company's ability to create value, because it recognises that our people are our greatest asset. Workforce views can/uni00A0help inform the Board on matters such as operational effectiveness, Shell culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, identifying risk and developing/uni00A0and delivering strategy.\n\nThroughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted how the Board engaged with the workforce. In most countries, employees were largely working from home in accordance with government rules and guidance, except for those operating vital assets. Face-to-face engagements could not be pursued because of travel bans. Board members did undertake virtual engagements, often around the time of scheduled Board discussions. Feedback from these video calls was shared with and discussed by the wider Board. Management also engaged extensively throughout the year, implementing a number of focused events to better understand how people were coping with the working environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, their mental well-being and what the/uni00A0business could do to better support them. In February 2021, the first\n\nstrategy day for staff was held to engage on the new Powering Progress strategy. Engagement sessions were held on the strategic scenarios, the carbon reduction elements, and the Growth, Transition and Upstream pillars of our strategy. Management held several engagements on Reshape, the restructuring of our organisation. Reshape is focused on how we are organised (organisational structure), how we work (mindset and behaviours) and who we are (identity), underpinned by our values. At the end of 2021, several webcasts and walk-in sessions were held to engage with the workforce on the simplification for the future, including Shell's move of official headquarters and tax residence, and its name change from Royal Dutch Shell plc to Shell plc. Information from these discussions was regularly provided to the Board.\n\nThe Board considers the current workforce engagement approach effective. The information provided in the following table gives examples of various methods of Board engagement.\n\n## Board's direct engagements with the workforce\n\n(Because of COVID-19 restrictions in various countries, the engagement/uni00A0activities have mostly been held virtually.)\n\n## Virtual informal engagement - Board\n\nNomination and Succession Committee members meet with various senior leaders and high-potential individuals throughout the year. The Nomination and Succession Committee also received a detailed briefing alongside that given to the full Board on the results of the annual Shell People Survey, which was completed by around 83% of employees.\n\n## Off-site visits\n\nBecause of COVID-19 restrictions, site visits were limited in 2021. Although in some instances we were able to organise virtual visits and meetings, priority was given to running the business operations.\n\nPeople engagements during Board and/or meetings off-sites.\n\nMeeting talent/leadership teams.\n\nCompany Chair engaging with various individuals.\n\nThrough these more formal engagements, the Chair and other Non-executive Directors (either individually or with their committees) have deepened their understanding of how the Company's purpose, strategy and values are embedded in particular businesses, sites and countries. This gives insight into progress made, risks and opportunities. The benefits are mutual. The Board obtains direct insight into/uni00A0local business operations and projects, and local strengths and challenges. Our/uni00A0people have a chance to better understand the Board and to provide direct/uni00A0feedback on topics of importance to them, their business or function and/uni00A0their/uni00A0location.\n\n## Employee network and related sessions\n\nConducted by Directors with, for example, Directors engaging with Shell's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT+) networks. In 2021, engagement took place with the Board and representatives from the LGBT+ network. There were discussions about the challenges facing the LGBT+ community and what type of support they could receive so everyone in Shell could perform at their best. Various members of/uni00A0the Board joined these discussions.\n\nDirectors involved in these engagements noted the opportunity to enrich their understanding of the LGBT+ perspective within Shell, so they had better insights into/uni00A0the challenges and the employee experience in this area.",

        "page_content": "## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT continued\n\n## Formal reports and information updates to the Board\n\n## Shell People Survey (anonymous survey facilitated externally)\n\nThe Board was provided with an update on the outcomes and employee engagement levels and the quality and resilience of leadership across Shell's workforce. As well as a broad range of subjects, the Board was informed of principal metrics, with particular focus on rewards, working conditions/workload and reputation. A more in-depth review and discussion is scheduled for early 2022.\n\nThe Board considers the Shell People Survey to be one of its principal tools for measuring employee engagement, motivation, affiliation and commitment to Shell. It/uni00A0provides insights into employee views and has a consistently high response rate. In/uni00A02021 the response rate was 83%, which remains high. The average employee engagement score was 75 points out of 100. This is a decrease of three points compared with 2020 but still reflects resilience of our people in a year of change. The Board also considers this engagement to understand, for example, how Shell is/uni00A0using the survey outcomes in: i) data analytics, for example, to identify potential correlative relationships between employee engagement and safety or ethics and/uni00A0compliance incidents; and ii) strengthening Company culture and values.\n\n## Senior Succession and Resourcing Review\n\nThe annual Senior Succession and Resourcing Review focused on the strength of senior leadership and plans for its development and succession, while highlighting the breadth, depth and diversity of its pipeline, the developing profile of the leadership cadre, and recruitment and attrition levels.\n\nThe Nomination and Succession Committee noted the effectiveness of succession planning, the impact of its associated execution, and the professional, data-driven, integrated approach to leadership and leadership development. It welcomed the continued focus on performance management, proactive management of Shell's talent pipeline, and the focus on advancing Shell's diversity agenda with increased attention on gender, race, LGBT+ and disabilities. This year's insights provided a deeper understanding of the interplay between culture, identity, leadership talent and employee engagement across Shell.\n\n## Assessment of key trends and material incidents\n\nPresented by Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. This is based on the established channels for staff and others to file complaints or report on suspected breaches in relation to the Shell General Business Principles (SGBP), the Code of Conduct or any breaches of law or regulations, including accounting control and auditing concerns.\n\nThe update covers Shell employees and our wider stakeholder base. The Board (also via the Audit Committee and SESCo) obtains insight into incidents and reporting levels and remediation. These provide indicators of conduct risks and, together with the related Board reports noted below, suggest the strength of embedding and awareness of the Code of Conduct and SGBP obligations and/uni00A0employees' comfort levels in raising incidents.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe Board reviews reports on strategic risks annually, and considers reports on operational risks twice a year. These reports assess current business activities against risk appetite.\n\n## Organisational culture\n\nAs part of the Reshape restructuring, the Board has been discussing the Powering Progress strategy, including powering lives. The Board also focused on diversity, equity and inclusion commitments and the launch of new organisation after Reshape. There was also engagement on the safety refresh, with the launch of the alignment with the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) life-saving rules. There were also discussions on psychological safety, to further improve the learner mindset and our organisational culture.\n\nThe Audit Committee also reviewed the Conduct and Culture Risk Report, which included a refreshed dashboard of risk appetite measures aligned with Shell's core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. Elements measured by the dashboard include: the number of terminations as a result of formally investigated Code of Conduct violations; the number of overdues on mandatory Ethics and Compliance training; anonymous reporting rates on our Global Helpline; and a/uni00A0selection of Shell People Survey scores. Qualitative assessments of insider threats/uni00A0and our approach to caring for our people were also covered.\n\n## Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer Report\n\nData and insights include information from the Global Helpline, the Shell Ethics and Compliance organisation and the Shell People Survey. SESCo continues to strongly support the work of the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, including the efforts to ensure a safe working environment where staff feel confident to raise any concerns in good faith.\n\nThe Audit Committee is kept updated when matters highlighted through the Global/uni00A0Helpline are investigated. The Audit Committee is also informed about the/uni00A0associated remediation. For more information see page 162 of the Audit Committee Report.\n\n## Assurance activities\n\nAssurance activities, including items raised by businesses and functions (through the Group Assurance Letters process) and assurance (from Internal Audit, HSSE, Ethics and Compliance, Reserves Assurance and Reporting), provide additional evidence to the Board of the commitment to high standards of risk management and internal control. The assurance activities ensure that work can be done safely, within regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe information provided within these reports further supports the Board's annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and internal control and feeds into the Group scorecard, against which staff bonuses are calculated.\n\n## The Shell Control Framework\n\nSignificant HSSE, Ethics and Compliance, and more broadly, business control incidents are brought to the attention of Senior Management and the Board through/uni00A0regular reporting.\n\nThe Board discussed how the organisation could learn more from incidents and how/uni00A0the business could drive safety performance. The Board shared and discussed examples based on personal experience of how to promote a strong safety culture.",

It/uni00A0plays a key role in senior succession and resourcing. Retaining in-depth knowledge of the individuals within the talent pipeline is a Committee priority. The Committee makes time to personally meet and engage with numerous individuals within the pipeline. The Committee's oversight and input extend from recruitment to leadership identification and from leadership development to leadership appointment, all of which are underpinned by clearly articulated talent priorities and a commitment to/uni00A0advancing diversity, equity and inclusion across Shell.\n\nThe Committee manages Board and Senior Management succession under a structured, proactive methodology. The processes have clear and agreed selection principles for short-, medium- and long-term succession and are aligned with Shell's strategic priorities.\n\n## SIR ANDREW MACKENZIE\n\nChair of the Nomination and Succession Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## NOMINATION AND SUCCESSION COMMITTEE continued\n\nFor Non-executive Director succession, the Committee continues to follow its Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board, adding factors as they evolve. These principles function much like a policy and include both quantitative and qualitative principles, considering:\n\n- \u25a0 the values, attitudes, and behaviours expected of Directors.\n- \u25a0 the overall aspired Board composition and diversity of gender, race and ethnicity, nationality, background, experience and desired skill sets/uni00A0that align with the Company's strategy and purpose; and\n\nFor Senior Management succession, the selection principles include process-specific elements, such as a clear and proactive approach to identifying and developing succession candidates. The principles also outline the long-term structured nature of the succession planning process. There is also great focus on ensuring that the principles reflect the leadership qualities required for future business success and that they advance the progress of diversity in all its forms.\n\nSenior Management principles feature in the Committee's review of the succession plans which occurs in every Committee meeting. Using the principles, the Committee implements any changes through a well-defined and diligent process with overall Board engagement. The Committee agrees candidate profiles and meets prospective candidates well ahead of any selection decision being necessary. It also engages the Board early in the process to ensure all Directors have an opportunity to meet and assess prospective candidates. Consequently, some of the leaders whom the Committee and Board have engaged with extensively in the past are now members of the Board or the Executive Committee.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee undertook its annual in-depth look at the succession plans for Senior Management across Shell and reviewed the talent pipeline in line with the business outlook. The engagement focused on the organisational health of our workforce following Project Reshape; the introduction of a single integrated and global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion plan aligned to our strategy and purpose, the depth and breadth of the senior executive leadership pipeline including good progress in enhancing diversity, the skills, behaviours and development support required for future success, and an evolving outlook on senior executive roles. Following the Committee's review, the findings were reported to the/uni00A0Board.\n\n## DIVERSITY OF LEADERSHIP\n\nThe Committee recognises that continuing to improve all types of diversity at each level of the Shell Group is crucial. Shell aims to be an inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and respected and has a strong sense of belonging. The Committee's review of diversity objectives and strategies for the Shell Group as a whole also monitors the impact of diversity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nIn February 2021, Shell published its aspirations for diversity, equity and inclusion as part of its strategic update. The focus will continue to be on gender and nationality diversity, and is broadening and deepening to the areas of race and ethnicity, enablement and LGBT+. When looking at our progress against our ambitions, female representation has steadily improved in recent years. Among experienced recruitment in 2021, Shell companies recruited 34% females, and among graduates 47%. Female representation in the top 1,250 roles ('Senior Leadership' positions) has strengthened by 1.7 percentage points during 2021 to 29.5%, and we continue to progress towards our aim of achieving 35% female senior\n\nleadership representation by 2025. Nationality diversity, such as Asian and American talent, continues to be managed in accordance with the business outlook and we have a strong focus on progressing race and ethnic minority representation, beginning in the UK and the USA and followed by the Netherlands. The representation of people of colour among Shell's senior leaders in the USA has been actively tracked for many years. It stood at 26.1% at the end of 2021, compared with 17.3% in/uni00A02016. In the UK, race and ethnicity representation among senior leaders was 16.5% [A].\n\n[A] As ethnicity declaration is voluntary, our ethnicity declaration rate is not 100% and all calculations are based on a declaration rate of 81%. The 19% of our workforce who have not provided data or chosen not to declare their ethnicity were not included in our calculations.\n\nSenior Leadership is a Shell-specific measure and different from that which/uni00A0we are required to report under the Code, being female representation in Senior Management and their direct reports, where/uni00A0the/uni00A0percentage is 28.4%.\n\nAlthough the Committee monitors Shell's organisational diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and initiatives, it also holds itself accountable for the Board's own diversity and inclusion. By the end of 2020, the Board's diverse composition met the Hampton Alexander and Parker Reviews' objectives by reflecting 38.46% female representation with one person meeting BAME criteria. Gender representation was down slightly from May 2020 (when the Board's composition included 42% female representation) as a result of the departure of three Non-executive Directors (one female, two males) and the appointment later in the year/uni00A0of/uni00A0four new Non-executive Directors (one female, three males). However, following the 2021 AGM, for the first time in Shell's history, the/uni00A0Board reached gender parity with 50% female representation.\n\n- More information on diversity, equity and inclusion in Shell is provided in the Our people section on page 114.\n\n## The People Strategy and culture and identity\n\nDuring the year, the Committee initiated an in-depth examination into/uni00A0our/uni00A0approach on diversity, equity and inclusion. This will follow the/uni00A0format/uni00A0of the examination of the Shell People Strategy that the Committee undertook in 2020, which placed particular emphasis on our/uni00A0aspired culture and identity. Powering Lives is a foundational element of our Powering Progress strategy. The Committee will be conducting further engagements in 2022 to maintain proactive oversight over Shells ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in/uni00A0the world, where everyone feels valued, respected, with a focus on four/uni00A0areas of gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability.\n\n## Committee activity\n\nIn addition to its considerations regarding succession, the Committee made recommendations on corporate governance guidelines, monitored/uni00A0compliance with corporate governance requirements and/uni00A0made recommendations on corporate governance-related disclosures. The Committee continues to monitor and review this area, considering whether and how current Company governance matters should be strengthened. Further insight on some of the Committee's areas/uni00A0of consideration in 2021 is provided below.",

This normally includes site visits and meetings with Senior Management to enable them to build up a detailed understanding of Shell's business and strategy, and the key risks and issues that Shell faces. Existing Directors are also able to join these visits to keep abreast of business developments and progress. With the abnormal COVID-19 circumstances in 2020 and 2021, the induction programme was quickly adapted to a completely virtual induction.\n\nOnboarding is phased and prioritised based on forthcoming Board agenda items to help ensure the new Non-executive Directors hit the ground running. In 2020 and 2021, digital onboarding books were provided for each new Non-executive Director. These onboarding books complemented the existing digital Directors' Handbook and featured:\n\n- \u25a0 hyperlinks to key Shell publications (external and internal);\n- \u25a0 overviews of scheduled briefing meetings customised to the Non-executive Directors' needs and linked to upcoming Board agenda/uni00A0items;\n- \u25a0 lists of common Shell acronyms;\n- - Shell's safety and core values;\n- \u25a0 key current materials on:\n- - Board governance;\n- - key businesses and functions; and\n- - Group strategy and portfolio;\n- - climate change and energy transition;\n- \u25a0 Other elements of the onboarding programme for Non-executive Directors included:\n- \u25a0 biographies of key executives.\n- - arranging briefing meetings with key executives (both business and/uni00A0functional) customised to Non-executive Directors' needs and/uni00A0phased based on forthcoming Board agenda items;\n- - where possible, arranging virtual site visits (either specifically for/uni00A0onboarding or by inviting the new Directors to committees' virtual site visits).\n- - where feasible, pairing up new Non-executive Directors in onboarding briefings to optimise learning while also providing opportunities for collegial relationship-building and increasing efficiencies for the executives; and\n\nSupported by the benefits of the global vaccination programme, we are/uni00A0now seeing COVID-19-related restrictions starting to ease in many countries. As a result, we envisage Directors being able to increase their face-to-face engagement with our teams at our sites in 2022 and to enhance ongoing Director training.",

        "page_content": "## NOMINATION AND SUCCESSION COMMITTEE continued\n\n## CHAIR SUCCESSION Message from Euleen Goh\n\nIn early 2018, the process of selecting the next Chair of the Board of Shell plc (at the time known as Royal Dutch Shell plc) began in response to/uni00A0the proposed limit on Chair tenure, outlined in the then draft version of the Code. The Nomination and Succession Committee (NOMCo) created a subcommittee, drew up a potential succession timeline, and initiated an internal and external search process. Hans Wijers, the Senior/uni00A0Independent Director at the time, led the subcommittee and the search process. Chad Holliday, the current Chair, was not a member of the subcommittee.\n\nMy predecessor Gerard Kleisterlee took over from Hans in May 2018 and refined the selection criteria and succession timeline. The subcommittee agreed what qualities the successful candidate should have, and determined the functional focus elements of the new Chair's role. Accordingly, the subcommittee considered and interviewed multiple candidates.\n\nAfter Gerard retired from the Board at the 2020 AGM, I assumed leadership of the subcommittee and we further reviewed the required qualities and functional focus elements of the role in the context of the current environment. The subcommittee also examined the main trends and factors affecting the long-term success and future viability of Shell, and the organisation's strategic priorities, consulting on these with the wider Board. One-on-one discussions were held with each Board member. The review and the discussions helped us to refine our search process with a clear and updated understanding of the qualities, skills and attributes that the future Chair should possess.\n\nWe engaged with some of our larger investors, as appropriate, seeking input on the skills, attributes and sector knowledge that they considered important for the Chair candidate profile. These discussions were very valuable. They helped inform our search and selection of the most appropriate individual for the role.\n\nAfter this thorough and robust search process, the Board agreed unanimously at its March 2021 meeting that Sir Andrew Mackenzie should be/uni00A0appointed Chair of the Board with effect from the conclusion of Shell's 2021 Annual General Meeting, which was held on May 18, 2021.\n\nWhen reviewing candidates, our preferred qualities and functional focus elements included a strong requirement for a candidate who has experience in leading large, complex, international organisations. The candidate would have had significant experience in capital discipline. He/she should have an ability to balance the transformational changes that Shell needs to make against the timing of these changes as it navigates the energy transition. The successful candidate should have demonstrated sustainable actions with respect to the climate change agenda. An understanding of the energy market was essential, without it being necessary for the candidate to have spent their entire career working in the oil and gas sector.\n\nIn Andrew we believe that we have found the required qualities and more. Andrew is a lifelong learner with a collaborative, agile mindset and he/uni00A0is a champion of good governance. His strategic vision has helped operations and companies under his leadership to transform. His leadership performance in the areas of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and climate action are outstanding. He was recently knighted by the Queen of the United Kingdom for his services to business, science and technology. Andrew firmly believes that business can be a force for good, for shareholders and society alike.\n\nSince joining the Board in October 2020, Andrew has dedicated significant time to familiarising himself with the business, the people, and/uni00A0the/uni00A0Powering Progress strategy which he and the Board fully support and are committed to delivering together with management.\n\nHis broad experience, strategic vision, scientific curiosity and commercial acumen made him the ideal candidate to lead the Board of Shell plc.",

        "page_content": "## SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE continued\n\nThe Committee reviews and considers external stakeholder perspectives in/uni00A0relation to Shell's business, and how Shell addresses issues of public concern that could affect its reputation and licence to operate.\n\nIn line with the strategic importance of the Committee's agenda, the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of Shell plc regularly attend Committee meetings for discussions on specific topics.\n\nShell's Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee hold overall/uni00A0accountability for sustainability within Shell. In February 2022, Shell announced a newly created role of Strategy, Sustainability and Corporate Relations Director. The new director is a member of Shell's Executive Committee.\n\n## ACTIVITIES\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee focused on the areas of greatest operational and strategic importance to Shell, in line with its Terms of Reference. This/uni00A0allowed the Committee to oversee effectively and thoroughly the practices and performance of the Company with respect to safety, environment including climate change, and broader sustainability.\n\nThe topics discussed in particular depth by the Committee included personal and process safety, a range of environmental topics, Shell's energy transition targets, and remuneration metrics. The Committee also reviewed in detail Shell companies' operations and the challenges faced in Nigeria.\n\nThe Committee supported and contributed to the announcement of Shell's Powering Progress strategy in 2021. This included a series of targets and commitments under the goals of achieving net-zero emissions, respecting nature, and powering lives. The Committee believes the Powering Progress strategy further demonstrates Shell's determination to play its full role in the energy transition. The Committee has conducted in-depth discussions with senior management about how Shell's energy transition targets for the near-term, medium-term and longer-term will be met through a combination of developing low-carbon energy businesses, transforming existing assets to energy and chemicals parks, carbon abatement programmes, portfolio actions, the use of nature-based solutions, and the/uni00A0development of carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS).\n\n## Activities performed\n\nFrequency\n\nFollowing the Committee's review of remuneration with management, the safety and energy transition metrics have been further enhanced for the 2022 Executive Committee annual scorecard and the 2022-24 Long-Term Incentive Plan in order to drive further performance improvements.\n\nTogether with the Audit Committee, the Committee reviewed the controls and procedures for managing contracting and procurement activities. The/uni00A0Committee Chair held several meetings with senior leaders to discuss/uni00A0specific topics, including reducing carbon emissions and enhanced/uni00A0assurance protocols. Committee members also held a series/uni00A0of/uni00A0individual engagements with business directors to discuss their/uni00A0reflections on emerging risks.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed wider matters of public concern during 2021 such as plastic waste, methane emissions, human rights, diversity and inclusion, and access to energy in low- and middle-income countries. The Committee engaged with external stakeholders on the topic of plastic waste and undertook a feedback session on how Shell's energy transition strategy and targets are perceived.\n\nThe Committee continued to closely monitor and strongly support Shell's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 in terms of care for staff and/uni00A0the safe management of operations.\n\n## For further details on SESCo and how Shell manages sustainability see www.shell.com\n\n## SITE VISITS\n\nThe Committee postponed its planned site visits for 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee instead conducted a virtual site visit to the Qatar Gas-to-Liquids facility via videoconference. The visit focused on safety and environmental performance and broader sustainability issues. The Committee Chair also held a follow-up engagement with the/uni00A0Rheinland Refinery in Germany to review safety performance and progress with the planned transformation of the site into an energy and/uni00A0chemicals park.\n\n| Review Shell's practices and performance relating to safety, including the safe condition and responsible operation of Shell's assets (Shell-operated  ventures and non-Shell-operated ventures), with a focus on both employees and contractors   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Review Shell's practices and performance relating to environment, including in particular environmental protection and greenhouse gas emissions                                                                                                    |\n| Review any major incidents that impact, or had the potential to impact, Shell's safety and environmental performance                                                                                                                               |\n| Review progress towards meeting Shell's Powering Progress ambitions, including its near-term and longer term energy transition targets for net carbon  intensity and becoming a net-zero emissions energy business, in step with society           |\n| Endorse Shell's annual assurance plan for Health, Security, Safety, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) and Asset Management                                                                                                            |\n| Review execution of Shell's HSSE & SP assurance plan and audit outcomes, and review relevant findings from Shell's broader internal audit programme                                                                                                |\n| Assess Shell's overall sustainability performance and provide input to Shell's annual reporting and disclosures regarding sustainability                                                                                                           |\n| Review how Shell addresses other major issues of public concern that could affect Shell's reputation and licence to operate                                                                                                                        |\n| Review and consider external stakeholder perspectives in relation to Shell's business                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Advise the Remuneration Committee on metrics relating to safety and energy transition                                                                                                                                                              |\n\nCommittee Activity Key:\n\nAnnually\n\nPeriodically\n\nMost meetings\n\nEvery meeting\n\nAs necessary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Jane joined the AC in July 2021 and her insights are a valuable addition to the AC.\n\nThe primary role of the AC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in areas such as the integrity of financial reporting, the effectiveness of the risk management framework and system of internal controls as well as consideration of ethics and compliance matters. We/uni00A0are responsible for assessing the quality of the audit performed by,/uni00A0and the independence and objectivity of, the external auditor. The/uni00A0AC/uni00A0also makes a recommendation to the Board on the appointment/uni00A0or reappointment of the external auditor. In addition, we/uni00A0oversee the work and quality of the internal audit function.\n\nThe AC's work programme over the course of a year focuses on a variety of matters that involve either a high degree of judgement and/or are significant to Shell's consolidated financial statements. Topics addressed during 2021 included the potential impact of climate change on Shell's consolidated financial statements, redundancy and restructuring charges related to Reshape, deferred taxes and tax exposures, significant portfolio acquisitions and divestments, third-party credit exposure, litigation, including the Dutch climate court case ruling, discount rates used for impairment testing, decommissioning and other provisions, impairment trigger assessments, charges and reversals, accounting for complex contracts, dividend distribution capacity and marked-to-market derivatives/uni00A0accounting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe AC reviewed with management areas which required significant judgement, the sources of estimation uncertainty and other key assumptions in light of economic and market uncertainty, climate risk and the energy transition, and evolving stakeholder expectations. In addition, the AC discussed with management the robustness of the risk and internal control management framework, results of internal control testing performed throughout the year and remediation activities.\n\nThese discussions also covered how risks to controls stemming from the organisational restructuring aspects of Reshape were managed. The AC also received briefings from the Chief Internal Auditor on the effectiveness of Shell's risk management and internal control system and on the outcomes of significant audits and notable control matters.\n\nThe impacts of climate change and the energy transition touch on many aspects of the AC's work. The AC's focus areas for 2021 included a number of discussions on the financial statement impacts of climate change and energy transition and the increasing calls for expanded climate-related information. Non-financial reporting was one such topic and included discussions on planned enhanced disclosures related to climate change reporting and other ESG information. The AC reviewed the pricing methodology for oil and gas and discussed with management how the impact of climate change was reflected in the methodology. This/uni00A0topic provided greater insights to the AC as to how macroeconomic conditions, major trends in the industry, and geopolitical factors, including carbon pricing and long-term demand for oil and gas, are considered in/uni00A0developing the outlook for commodity prices and refining margin assumptions, which are important considerations in business planning, asset impairment analyses, and investment and divestment decisions. Further, the quarterly reports reviewed by the AC from Ernst and Young LLP (EY), our external auditor, and the Chief Internal Auditor, also included specific steps they have taken to incorporate climate change considerations into all facets of their work.\n\nThe AC reviewed the additional disclosures in relation to the potential financial impacts of climate change. The AC, recognising the evolving nature of climate change risks and responses, concluded that climate change has been appropriately considered by management in key judgements and estimates and agreed with the disclosure made by/uni00A0management.\n\n'The primary role of the AC is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in areas such as the integrity of financial reporting, the effectiveness of the risk management framework and system of internal controls as well as consideration of/uni00A0ethics and compliance matters.'",

Other focus topics for 2021 included pensions, trading and supply, and/uni00A0contracting and procurement, all of which represent significant financial activities and obligations.\n\nAs part of its oversight of compliance with applicable legal and regulatory/uni00A0requirements, including monitoring ethics and compliance risks, the AC discussed with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer activities undertaken in the ethics and compliance programme related to conduct risks stemming from the continued effects of COVID-19 as well as Reshape, and steps taken to manage those risks.\n\nDue to continued COVID-19 travel restrictions, the AC conducted virtual/uni00A0visits to Shell's Energy Transition Campus in Amsterdam and Shell's/uni00A0Houston offices. As part of its virtual visit to the US, the AC also toured virtually the Shell Geismar Chemicals facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. These site visits deepen the AC's understanding of the risks and/uni00A0opportunities arising in key markets as well as of how the Company's Powering Progress strategy is being implemented in those locations. The visits also provide the opportunity for the AC to engage with a diverse range of Shell staff in each location and to hear directly from them.\n\nOn a final note, the AC acknowledges the financial reporting team's substantial work during 2021. While continuing under a remote work environment, the team has demonstrated resilience and continued focus on enhancements in reporting while working to maintain a robust control environment. The AC conveys its gratitude and appreciation for their strong commitment and dedication.\n\n## ANN GODBEHERE\n\nChair of the Audit Committee March/uni00A09, 2022\n\n## Focus areas for 2021\n\n- \u25a0 Non-financial reporting (including enhanced disclosures related to climate change)\n- \u25a0 New business models and ventures/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Oil and gas pricing methodology (including carbon pricing and/uni00A0long-term demand for oil and gas)\n- \u25a0 Contracting and procurement/uni00A0\n- \u25a0 Pensions\n- \u25a0 Trading and Supply\n\n## Priorities for 2022\n\n- \u25a0 Non-operated ventures controls and governance\n- \u25a0 Portfolio activities (refineries) and managing post-completion rights and obligations\n- \u25a0 Update on regulatory developments (including in relation to/uni00A0climate change and energy transition)\n- \u25a0 Asset Management System\n- \u25a0 GHG reporting and assurance framework\n\n## COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE FOR 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnn Godbehere\n\nMartina Hund-Mejean\n\nJane Holl Lute\n\nDuring 2021, the members and meeting attendance of the AC were as follows:\n\nNumber of\n\n| Committee  Member      | Member since   |   Maximum  possible  meetings |   meetings  attended  [A] | % of  meetings  attended   |\n|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Ann Godbehere  (Chair) | May 23, 2018   |                             6 |                         6 | 100%                       |\n| Dick Boer              | May 20, 2020   |                             6 |                         6 | 100%                       |\n| Jane Holl Lute [B]     | July 28, 2021  |                             2 |                         2 | 100%                       |\n| Martina Hund- Mejean   | May 20, 2020   |                             6 |                         6 | 100%                       |\n| Gerrit Zalm            | March 8, 2017  |                             6 |                         6 | 100%                       |\n\nDick Boer\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the AC annually identifies certain business and function areas to focus on during that year. The focus areas generally encompass aspects of risk management and internal control, financial reporting and compliance. The AC is authorised to seek any information it requires from management and external parties and to investigate issues or concerns as it deems appropriate. The AC may/uni00A0also obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense. No such independent advice was requested in 2021.\n\nThe AC keeps the Board informed of its activities and recommendations, and the Chair of the AC provides an update to the Board after every AC/uni00A0meeting.

The discussions included information on any enhancements to strengthen controls and how areas identified for improvement had been addressed, monitoring activities around key risks,/uni00A0and steps being taken to identify new or emerging risk areas.\n\nIn addition to the significant accounting and reporting considerations discussed on page 160, the business and function areas reviewed by/uni00A0the/uni00A0AC in 2021 included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Oil and gas pricing methodology - The AC reviewed the process, methodology and approach to price assumptions used in Shell for such purposes as business planning, accounting (for example, impairment and deferred tax assessments) and investment and divestment decisions. The AC considered the overall governance framework, how the key principles of independence, expertise, consistency and stability are applied and management's oversight responsibilities. The AC also reviewed how factors such as supply and demand outlooks, the pace and extent of energy transition in different energy sources and markets, and macroeconomic conditions are considered when developing Shell's short and long-term price assumptions. The AC also discussed with the external auditor its independent analysis of price assumptions and external benchmarks for price assumptions.\n- \u25a0 Non-Financial Reporting (NFR) - The AC was briefed on the increasing pace of change in external regulatory and voluntary frameworks in non-financial reporting, which includes ESG reporting. The AC and management discussed the key shifts in the external landscape and in particular requests for expanded disclosure regarding: (i) a company's resilience to climate-related financial impacts, (ii) quantification of climate risks likelihood and impacts (including physical risks), (iii) explanations on emissions methodologies, (iv) further granularity on targets, and (v) details on low-carbon activities such as/uni00A0capital expenditure, revenues and research and development. The/uni00A0AC/uni00A0noted that Shell's NFR and ESG disclosures are included in Shell/uni00A0publications such as the Annual Report, the Sustainability Report, the Shell Energy Transition Strategy and Shell's website. The AC was informed of key regulatory and ESG frameworks and Shell advocacy activities in this area. The AC and management also discussed planned climate-related disclosure enhancements in Shell's reporting in line with/uni00A0the framework of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and guidance from regulators. The AC and management discussed the expanded disclosures around governance, strategy, risk management, and targets and metrics and how to describe these elements and demonstrate the interdependencies that exist in practice between them. Management and the AC discussed the scenarios included in the expanded disclosure to assist stakeholders to understand the robustness of Shell's forward-looking strategy and plans across a range of possible future states. The AC and management also discussed a new note to the financial statements which summarises key areas where climate related risks are considered and the related impact on the financial statements.",

The/uni00A0AC and management discussed the activities in 2021 to govern the/uni00A0implementation of the Shell Control Framework in the R&ES portfolio companies and the status of such activities. Management also/uni00A0provided the AC with an overview of recent internal audit results. The/uni00A0AC reviewed with management the challenges and risks related to/uni00A0the R&ES businesses and the learnings and planned governance improvements to support the R&ES ambitions.\n- \u25a0 Trading and Supply's (T&S) control framework - Noting the continued regulatory demands in this area, the AC met with T&S leaders, including the Risk Officer, to gain a deeper understanding of/uni00A0the controls and processes enhancements undertaken in 2021. The AC was briefed on the Integrated Risk Management Framework being developed and the capabilities and systems improvements identified through the market risk road map. The AC and T&S leaders also discussed the progress on strengthening IT general controls, front and mid-office controls and compliance functions. T&S leaders briefed the AC on the structural organisational changes being made to enable effective implementation of systems and processes enhancement while/uni00A0managing the risks arising from a volatile commodity price environment and the impact of Reshape.\n- \u25a0 Contracting and Procurement (C&P) - As part of a joint session with the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo), the AC was briefed on Shell's C&P programme. This included an overview of how (i) C&P and business lines work together to procure services and goods, (ii) C&P digital tools are designed to ensure that potential risks relating to procurement contracts, such as credit risks, regulatory requirements and ethics and compliance matters, are appropriately addressed at individual and Group level, and (iii) through its procurement activities, Shell manages stakeholders' expectations that Shell will positively influence third parties in environmental and social issues; such as climate change, conserving natural resources and biodiversity, and promoting human rights, worker welfare, safety, and diversity. C&P leaders, the AC and SESCo discussed efforts to ensure continued competitive performance and resilience amid increasing volatility, rising inflation and supply chain disruption. In response to a/uni00A0request from the AC, the C&P leaders provided the supply chain risks/uni00A0matrix and how each risk is being managed.\n- \u25a0 Pensions - Treasury leaders provided the AC with an overview of Shell's pension plans which cover around 230,000 current and past employees in 46 countries. The AC reviewed the governance arrangements and operating model for Shell's pension plans that result from their independent trust structures in different jurisdictions. The AC was briefed on pension risks and risk management governance, actuarial and investment management, operational oversight, and assurance activities undertaken by two centres of expertise which support Shell's pension plans. The AC gained insights into the control framework, standards, modelling and guidelines that are designed to ensure appropriate measurement and reporting of pension liabilities, assets, and annual payments.\n\nIn January 2022, the AC conducted a virtual visit to Shell's Houston, Texas/uni00A0offices. As part of this visit, the AC received briefings on how the/uni00A0US/uni00A0businesses are implementing Shell's Powering Progress strategy through an overview of various energy transition projects and initiatives. The AC also was informed of the initiatives under the Racial DEI Plan, which focuses on inclusion, representation and outreach, and planned activities focused on issues of race, ethnicity, which also include diversity, equity, and inclusion as it relates to gender, LGBT+, and people with disabilities. The AC also gained insight into the cyber-security defence and risk operations; the regional advancement of the energy transition in the USA; the integrated Power approach between Trading and Supply and R&ES businesses; and engaged with staff on how Shell is powering lives. The AC also conducted a virtual visit to Shell's Geismar chemicals facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which is the centre of a suite of potential projects that are focused on infrastructure and emissions mitigations to deliver low-carbon products to its customers. As part of this virtual facility visit, the AC reviewed risk management through the deep-water Gulf of Mexico lens of dealing with COVID-19, rapid and significant oil price declines and Hurricane Ida.\n\nIn February 2022, the AC undertook a virtual visit to Shell's Energy Transition Campus in Amsterdam. As part of this visit, the AC and Project and Technology (P&T) leaders discussed P&T's business risk management and risk matrix. The AC was also provided with an overview of P&T's portfolio, including those that support the energy transition and Shell's net-zero emissions target, and was briefed on a current P&T project.\n\nAs part of its review of new business models and ventures, the AC had intended to visit one of Shell's new ventures in 2021. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, this visit has now been rescheduled to take place in/uni00A02022.\n\nSite visits are a welcome addition to the AC's annual work plan, as they provide the opportunity for the AC to gain a deeper understanding of the/uni00A0various businesses and functions at each location, the local external environment within which those activities take place and how they contribute to Shell achieving its strategic ambitions. In addition to in-depth examinations of specific business areas, these visits enable the AC members to interact with a diverse group of staff and learn about their experiences, challenges they face and their opportunities for career development. The AC is also briefed on the impact of the energy transition at a local level, how risks associated with climate change are managed, and the results of the Shell People Survey.",

The Group Assurance Letter process involves each Executive Director conducting a structured internal assessment of compliance with legal and/uni00A0ethical requirements and the Shell Control Framework. The AC also reviews the Company's evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX/uni00A0404). The AC updated the Board on compliance with internal controls across the Shell Group and on any major matters for which action/uni00A0or improvement was recommended.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Activities performed                                                                                                                                                | Frequency   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Risk Management and Internal Control                                                                                                                                |             |\n| Review the policies and practices and monitor the effectiveness relating  to Shell's risk management and internal control system.                                   |             |\n| Receive briefings on regulatory developments.                                                                                                                       |             |\n| Review management's SOX 404 assessment.                                                                                                                             |             |\n| Discuss significant matters arising from completed internal audits with  the Chief Internal Auditor, management and the external auditors.                          |             |\n| Assess management's responses to significant audit findings,  recommendations and notable control weaknesses, including potential  improvements and agreed actions. |             |\n| Review significant legal matters with Shell's Legal Director.                                                                                                       |             |\n| Review the oil and gas reserves control framework.                                                                                                                  |             |\n| Review Shell's information risk management.                                                                                                                         |             |\n| Review Shell's tax function, key tax risks and Shell's approach to the  evolving area of tax transparency.                                                          |             |\n| Committee Activity Key:   Annually   Quarterly   Periodically                                                                                                       |             |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThroughout the year, the AC and management discuss the Company's overall approach to risk management and internal control, including compliance, tax, and information risk management matters and the adequacy of disclosure controls and procedures. The AC receives quarterly reports from the EVP Taxation and Controller on the status of actions to address control weaknesses identified via business control incidents and the trends in other measures used to monitor the robustness of the risk management framework and internal control systems. The AC is also briefed on litigation matters (see 'Governance' on page 198 and Note 26/uni00A0to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 278-279.\n\nThe AC regularly reviews the status of management's SOX 404 testing of/uni00A0controls and remediation actions to address any identified weaknesses. Similar to 2020, for 2021, these reviews included consideration of how the/uni00A0COVID-19 pandemic affected the controls and assurance landscape, including the financial reporting process. The AC and management discussed the steps taken to maintain an effective control environment, to/uni00A0demonstrate 'management in control' during the pandemic and to address any new or emerging risks due to the working-from-home setting.\n\nThe AC was also briefed on how management was monitoring and/uni00A0addressing any impacts on the control environment from the/uni00A0organisational restructuring from Reshape.\n\nIt is important that the AC monitor and learn about evolving external developments in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the AC was informed of developments in the legal, regulatory and financial reporting landscape that could affect the Company. The AC's briefings in this area were supplemented by the overview of the ESG reporting landscape provided/uni00A0as part of its non-financial reporting focus topic for 2021./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, the AC dedicated time to the following topics:\n\n- \u25a0 Information risk management - The CIO briefed the AC on the diverse risk landscape and the steps being taken to manage the increased external threats observed. The AC was informed of the investments made to build a robust cyber-security framework over the last decade with enhanced cyber-incident detection, response and recovery capabilities, and expanded monitoring and data protection. The AC and CIO also discussed the transformation occurring in Shell's IT systems as part of the Powering Progress strategy, reflecting the evolving portfolio of businesses and the greater number of digital products for customers.\n- \u25a0 Tax risks - In addition to the regular review of Shell's tax provisions, the AC and management discussed the Tax function's operational performance and key developments and challenges for a global company like Shell operating across many differing tax jurisdictions. The AC was briefed on the tax integrated assurance model which is designed to ensure compliance with applicable tax, disclosure and accounting requirements. Management outlined for the AC the potential implications of the current external tax environment and increasing demand for scrutiny and transparency. These included expected higher compliance burden, increased risk of double taxation, tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy, and potential upward pressures on effective tax rates.\n- \u25a0 Oil and gas reserves control framework - The AC annually reviews the framework that supports Shell's internal reporting and external disclosures of oil and gas reserves. The AC also reviews the processes and controls that prevent and/or mitigate the risks of non-compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. This annual review of Shell's oil and gas reserves control framework supports the AC's review of Shell's reported proved oil and gas reserves discussed later in this report.\n\nIn addition to the above, the AC also had quarterly discussions with the/uni00A0Chief Internal Auditor regarding the Company's risk management and/uni00A0internal control system, significant matters arising from the internal audit/uni00A0assurance programme and management's response to significant audit findings and notable control weaknesses, including planned improvements and agreed actions.\n\nThe AC similarly holds discussions with EY on a quarterly basis regarding how risks to audit quality are addressed, key accounting and audit judgements, results from audit procedures and management's response to/uni00A0any significant audit findings and any material communications between EY and management.",

The AC regularly considers the APMs used in Shell's reporting, the reconciliations to IFRS financial statements and explanations for changes from the previous quarter. The AC reviews the/uni00A0overall presentation of APMs with management to ensure they are/uni00A0not/uni00A0given undue prominence. The AC discusses adjusting items with/uni00A0management including any changes to methodology.\n\nIn 2021, the AC was briefed on a new APM: Adjusted EBITDA on a FIFO and CCS basis. The APMs disclosed by Shell are subject to the same internal controls process as for other financial reporting.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe AC advised the Board that in its view the 2021 Annual Report including the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess Shell's position and performance, business model and strategy (see 'Governance' on page 198). To arrive at this conclusion, the AC critically assessed drafts of the 2021 Annual Report including the financial statements and discussed with/uni00A0management the process undertaken to ensure that the relevant requirements were met. This process included: verifying that the contents of the 2021 Annual Report are consistent with the information shared with the Board during the year to support their assessment of Shell's position and performance; ensuring that consistent materiality thresholds are applied for favourable and unfavourable items; considering observations from the external auditor; and receiving assurance from the Executive Committee (EC).\n\n## Going concern and viability statement\n\nThe AC reviewed and considered the Directors' half-year and full-year statements with respect to the going concern basis of accounting. As noted in the viability statement, the Board also reviews the strategic plan/uni00A0which takes account of longer-term forecasts and a wide range of/uni00A0outlooks. Key assumptions included: the impact of commodity prices; exchange rates; future carbon costs; agreements like liquid natural gas contract renewals; production levels and product demand, schedules of growth programmes; the financial framework; Shell's business portfolio developments including consideration of the impacts of various possible energy pathways and scenarios for changes in societal expectations in relation to climate change and Shell's commitment to the Paris Agreement goals; the project funnel to support future growth; and using severe but possible scenarios to run models of the financial impact if certain of Shell's/uni00A0principal risks materialised. The AC reviewed management's determination that the associated material impacts from climate change and energy transition risk, including the recent Dutch court ruling, were appropriately considered in the context of the three-year viability statement period. The AC considered the mitigating measures and sensitivities that management had applied to the modelling of scenarios when evaluating the viability statement and noted that assumptions do go/uni00A0well beyond the three-year period and do take into account climate change and energy transition. The AC also considered the merits of extending the viability statement beyond a period of three years and concluded that the three-year period selected by the Board for the review/uni00A0of Shell's prospects, in line with the operating plan, remained appropriate. The AC supported the going concern basis of accounting and the inclusion of Shell's viability statement in 'Governance' on/uni00A0page/uni00A0199 and considered such statement to be in line with best practice guidance issued by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).",

        "page_content": "## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT continued\n\n## FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\ncontinued\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe AC assessed the following significant accounting and reporting areas, including those related to Shell's 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements. The AC was satisfied with how each of the areas below was addressed. As part of this assessment, the AC received reports, requested and received clarifications from management, and sought assurance and received input from the internal and external auditors.\n\nIssue\n\nAC activity and outcome\n\n## Climate change and energy transition\n\nClimate change and energy transition related risks are continually/uni00A0monitored to ensure impacts are reflected within/uni00A0Shell's financial statements.\n\nAfter a claim by Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth Netherlands),/uni00A0other NGOs and a group of private individuals, in/uni00A0May 2021 the District Court in The Hague ruled that Shell must/uni00A0reduce its global net carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels.\n\nThe external landscape related to non-financial disclosures continues to change at unprecedented speed. In the absence of/uni00A0one global standard for climate related reporting there are/uni00A0growing demands from various regulatory and voluntary bodies all with their own expectations for disclosures.\n\n## Impairment and impairment reversals\n\nThe carrying amount of an asset should be tested for impairment or impairment reversal whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount for that asset may have changed, for example if there is a change in the outlook for commodity prices or refining margin assumptions, or revisions to future activity plans and developments. On classification as held for sale, the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and intangible assets must also be reviewed.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe determination of tax assets and liabilities requires the application of judgement as to the ultimate outcome, which can/uni00A0change over time. In particular, tax exposures and the recognition of deferred tax assets require management to make/uni00A0assumptions regarding future profitability. As a result they/uni00A0are inherently uncertain.\n\nThe AC was briefed on key regulatory requirements including (but not limited to) the FRC, SEC and EU disclosure requirements and their implications for Shell's external disclosures.\n\nThe AC reviewed the new Note 4 of the financial statements summarising the key climate risks impacts on the/uni00A0Financial Statements as well as the new impairment sensitivity disclosures using price outlooks based on/uni00A0different climate change scenarios, including external scenarios.\n\n## See Note 4 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 242-245.\n\nThe AC has considered the impact of the Dutch climate court case ruling on financial reporting. As at the second quarter of 2021 it agreed with management's conclusion that the outcome of the case had no impact on the 2021 interim financial statements.\n\nIn the third quarter 2021 Shell announced absolute GHG emissions reduction target of 50% on all Scope 1 and 2 emissions under Shell's operational control by 2030, compared to 2016 levels on a net basis. This target/uni00A0has been reflected in the operating plan as reviewed by the Board. The AC sought assurance from management that assumptions used for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent/uni00A0with the operating plan.\n\nThe AC was briefed on the non-financial reporting external landscape developments and regulatory requirements. In doing so, the AC considered the potential implications required for Shell's external disclosures going forward (see Shell Powering Progress on pages 6-11). The AC reviewed the TCFD disclosure in the Energy Transition and Climate Change section and other non-financial disclosures as part of the Annual Report review and was briefed on the new EU taxonomy voluntary disclosures included as supplementary information to the Annual Report.\n\nUpdates regarding climate change and energy transition have been included in the risk factors section on pages 75-98.\n\nThe AC reviewed the impairment assessments that were performed each quarter, and the methodology applied in conducting impairment assessments. The AC reviewed the changed estimation technique to/uni00A0determine the value in use for impairment testing, including the change to a post-tax WACC based/uni00A0methodology and the appropriateness of the resulting new discount rate applied.\n\nThe AC considered the updated oil and gas price and refining margin outlooks against market developments and benchmarks. The 2022 short term oil and gas price assumptions have been updated to reflect the current market environment. Notwithstanding the current buoyant oil and gas commodity markets, the long-term oil and gas price assumptions have not materially changed and therefore there have been no impairment or impairment reversal triggers.\n\nThe AC also reviewed other impairment triggers, including for exploration and evaluation assets, held-for-sale classification for asset disposals (e.g. Puget Sound and Deer Park) and plans to convert refineries into energy and chemicals parks.\n\nThe AC review of impairments covered a significant proportion of the balance sheet.\n\nSee Notes 2, 8, 9 and 10 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 233-241 and 249-254.\n\nThe AC considered the uncertain tax positions and discussed management's assumptions of future taxable profits, including the impact of foregone future profits due to disposals. The AC also evaluated the appropriateness of the recognition of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities. The AC acknowledged that assumptions regarding future taxable profits are inherently uncertain because they involve assessing factors such as the pace of economic recovery in different countries and the potential impacts of climate change and energy transition. The AC deemed the assessments of uncertain tax exposures and the recognition of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities to be reasonable. The AC also assessed the accounting judgments made regarding the treatment of tax provision releases relating to Nigeria. The AC also reviewed the impact on tax balances and disclosures as a result of the simplification of Shell's structure in 2021 and aligning Shell's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK.\n\nSee Notes 2 and 17 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 233-241 and 259-261.",

In particular, there was  rationalisation of the refinery portfolio, divestment of Upstream  assets and investments in Renewables and Energy Solutions. was implemented during 2021 with related redundancy provisions,  pension curtailments and charges recognised in the 2021  Consolidated Financial Statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The AC discussed the accounting implications of these decisions and the recognition of: (i)  decommissioning and restoration provisions; (ii) deferred tax balances; (iii) impairment; and (iv) assets  held for sale. The AC also considered the complex accounting treatments associated with some of the  new business arrangements, such as the Amazon transaction and Hollandse Kust Noord CrossWind. The  AC provided support for projects to develop detailed accounting guidance for these types of transaction. See Notes 2 and 19 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 233-241 and 267. During Q1 2021 the AC considered the accounting implications and whether the criteria to recognise  a/uni00A0restructuring provision as per IAS 37.72 were fulfilled. The AC concurred with management that the  criteria had been met by March 31, 2021 and that it was appropriate to recognise the restructuring  provision. The AC also considered the effect of Reshape, received updates and reviewed associated  accounting implications as Reshape activities progressed throughout the year.                                                                                       |\n| Reshape restructuring provisions A comprehensive portfolio and organisational review, Reshape,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Reshape restructuring provisions A comprehensive portfolio and organisational review, Reshape,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Decommissioning and restoration provisions are one of the/uni00A0main  components of balance sheet liabilities.

reflect changes in geological, technical, contractual and economic information (including yearly average price assumptions) and the effectiveness of financial controls.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, Shell announced its intention to exit its ventures in Russia with Gazprom and related entities. Subsequently, on March 8, 2022, Shell announced its intention to withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons in a phased manner, including shut its service stations, aviation fuels, and lubricant operations in Russia. These announcements have been included as non-adjusting post balance sheet events (PBSE) in the Consolidated Financial Statements and have been reviewed by the AC (see note 32 on page 283).",

The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer summarised the specific emerging conduct risks and management's actions to manage and mitigate them. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer briefed the AC on communications to staff from both senior leaders and mid-level management reinforcing the importance of/uni00A0adherence to and affirming Shell's commitment to the Ethics and Compliance framework and Code of Conduct throughout the pandemic.\n\nWith staff returning to the workplace and the roll-out of the Future of Work initiative, the AC and the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer discussed the potential challenges of hybrid work environments. These included the risk of employees feeling disadvantaged by working remotely and the possible loss of the informal learning and development that occurs when/uni00A0employees are together in the workplace. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer informed the AC of management's considerations to address these challenges, which include using digital technology, novel approaches to training, and developing bite-sized and focused training to/uni00A0give staff targeted information.\n\nAs part of the annual assessment of the system of risk management and internal control, the AC discussed with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer his annual report on compliance matters. The report included an overview of the effectiveness of the Shell ethics and compliance programme in managing ethics and compliance risk in Shell's business activities, regulatory developments and compliance activities. The AC also/uni00A0discussed investigations of cases involving ethics and compliance concerns. The AC discussed management's findings in such cases to satisfy itself that a rigorous process had been followed, and that appropriate disciplinary action had been taken where necessary and management had embedded learnings into Shell's systems and controls.\n\n## Whistleblowing investigations\n\nThe AC is responsible for establishing and monitoring the implementation of procedures for the receipt, retention, investigation and follow-up actions\n\nof complaints received, including those from the Shell Global Helpline. The/uni00A0AC reviewed whistleblowing reports and internal audit reports and considered management's responses to the findings in these reports.\n\n## Regulatory developments\n\nThe AC was briefed on regulatory developments in areas including sustainable finance (in particular management's work on the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy); non-financial reporting (in particular management's assessment of the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive Revision); accounting and reporting; environmental liabilities and treasury/uni00A0activities.\n\nIn March 2021, the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) launched a consultation paper entitle 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance'. This paper contained wide ranging proposed reforms to strengthen the UK's audit and corporate governance regime. The AC and management discussed the proposed reforms, including implications for the Company, the Board and the AC. The AC reviewed management's proposed responses to certain topics in the consultation paper. The AC supports the Company's response to BEIS.\n\n## AC annual evaluation\n\nThe AC undertakes an annual evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Consistent with the Board's annual performance evaluation for 2021, the AC's performance evaluation was facilitated by Lintstock Limited, a London-based corporate advisory firm. Each AC member responded to a confidential questionnaire about the AC's performance with questions on: the management of the AC in areas such as the annual cycle of work, agenda for meetings and time and input in meetings; the quality of the information provided to the AC; the value of the briefings provided to the AC on specific topics; the effectiveness of the AC's oversight in areas such as financial reporting, risk management and internal control, compliance and governance and the work of internal and external audit; rating the AC's performance in reviewing and assessing significant accounting and reporting judgements; and how to improve the/uni00A0AC's performance.\n\nIn assessing its progress against 2020 goals, the AC concluded it had achieved the 2021 priorities identified in the 2020 evaluation discussion (including the planned visits to Shell's Houston offices and to Shell's Energy Transition Campus in Amsterdam, reviews related to pensions, new/uni00A0business models and ventures, non-financial reporting, oil and gas pricing methodology, regulatory developments, C&P, and integrated risk management). The AC discussed the outcome of this review as part of its annual evaluation. The AC concluded that its performance in 2021 had been effective and that it had fulfilled its role in accordance with its Terms/uni00A0of Reference.\n\nIn preparing its workplan for 2022, the AC has agreed to the following focus areas in addition to the standing items: joint venture and nonoperated ventures controls and governance; update on regulatory developments (including in relation to climate change and energy transition); portfolio activities (refineries) and managing post-completion rights and obligations; the GHG reporting and assurance framework; and the Asset Management System. As noted earlier, the AC also plans to visit one of Shell's new ventures in 2022 as a continuation of its focus on new business models and ventures in 2021.",

The AC also regularly holds private sessions separately with the Chief Internal Auditor without members of management, except for the Legal Director, being present. The AC's time for these activities is included in Risk Management and Internal Control described earlier in this report. Outside of the formal AC meetings, the AC Chair meets regularly with the Chief Internal Auditor.\n\n## Internal audit remit\n\nThe internal audit function is an independent assurance function which supports Shell's continuous efforts to improve its overall control framework. The internal audit function contributes to the maintenance of a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the design and effectiveness of Shell's risk management, control and governance processes. The primary role of the internal audit function's assurance and/uni00A0investigation activities is to safeguard value by protecting Shell's assets, reputation and sustainability in relation to the organisation's defined goals and objectives.\n\nThe AC defines the responsibility and scope of the internal audit function and approves its annual plan. The Chief Internal Auditor reports functionally to the Chair of the AC and administratively to the Chief Financial Officer. The Chair of the AC approves, in consultation with the/uni00A0Chief Financial Officer, all decisions regarding the performance evaluation, appointment or removal of the Chief Internal Auditor.\n\n## Annual internal audit plan and assessment of internal/uni00A0audit's effectiveness\n\n- \u25a0 talent and capability (professional audit development and technical capabilities);\n\nThe AC considered and approved the internal audit function's annual audit plan, including focus areas for 2021 consisting of:\n\n- \u25a0 quality (developing first-line staff competence and clarity on selfverification and supervisory controls);\n- \u25a0 engagement (mainly in the area of keeping staff and Shell stakeholders/uni00A0engaged and informed on effective risk management and/uni00A0internal control).\n- \u25a0 alignment (improved integration of risk management and alignment of/uni00A0assurance processes across Shell); and\n\nBeginning August 2021, audits of the Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance Control Framework were added to internal audit's remit, creating a unified internal audit function. Recognising that 2021 was a transition year for internal audit due to Reshape, the Chief Internal Auditor updated the AC quarterly on the approved 2021 internal audit plan and discussed whether the plan remained fit for purpose in addressing the most critical areas of risk in a year of transition. The AC assessed the performance of the internal audit function as effective. The/uni00A0AC also assessed the performance of the Chief Internal Auditor as/uni00A0effective.\n\nThe Chief Internal Auditor periodically assesses whether the purpose, authority and responsibilities of the internal audit function continue to enable it to accomplish its objectives. The results of this periodic assessment are communicated to the EC and AC. The Chief Internal Auditor maintains an internal quality assurance and improvement programme. This covers all aspects of internal audit's activities and evaluates whether they conform with the standards of the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors. The Chief Internal Auditor conducts an annual assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of internal audit's activities, identifying opportunities for improvement. The Chief Internal Auditor discusses the results of this annual assessment with the EC and AC. The Chief Internal Auditor also confirms to the AC of the continued validity of the charter of the internal audit function or puts forward proposals for updates to it. At least every five years, the effectiveness and quality of the internal audit function are independently assessed externally, and the Chief Internal Auditor reviews the report with the AC. An independent assessment of internal audit was conducted in 2018. The next such external assessment is planned to take place in 2022, one year ahead of the five-year review cycle.",

In/uni00A0particular, the AC and EY discussed how the audit would take into/uni00A0consideration risks associated with:\n\n- \u25a0 the organisational restructuring aspects of Reshape; and\n- \u25a0 Shell's Powering Progress strategy.\n\nThe AC considered the annual audit plan, which included assessing whether the planned materiality levels and proposed resources to execute/uni00A0the audit plan were consistent with the scope of the audit.\n\nEY regularly updated the AC on the status of their procedures and preliminary findings, providing an opportunity for the AC to monitor the execution and results of the audit. The AC and EY discussed how risks to/uni00A0audit quality were addressed, key accounting and audit judgements, material communications between EY and management and any issues arising from them. Quarterly, the AC met privately with EY representatives without management being present in order to encourage open and transparent feedback from both parties. In addition, the AC Chair meets separately with the external auditor on a regular basis.\n\nAs part of its oversight of the external auditor, the AC annually assesses the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and the audit process. This includes assessing the quality of the audit, how the auditor handled key judgements, and the auditor's response to the AC's questions. The assessment also involves the AC evaluating the objectivity and independence of EY and the quality and effectiveness of the external audit process.\n\nThe AC's evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the external auditor and the audit process includes the following key criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 EY's quality assurance procedures and internal quality control procedures;\n- \u25a0 professionalism in areas including competence, integrity and objectivity;\n- \u25a0 audit quality priorities and actions taken as part of maintaining a/uni00A0sustainable audit quality programme;\n- \u25a0 efficiency, covering aspects such as service level and innovation in/uni00A0the/uni00A0audit process, use of data analytical and digital audit tools, and/uni00A0opportunities for improvement;\n- \u25a0 constructive challenge of management and key judgements;\n- \u25a0 the orderly transition of the recent partner rotation;\n- \u25a0 thought leadership and actions, especially in the areas of climate change, and value added; and\n- \u25a0 the most recent EY Transparency Report;\n- \u25a0 compliance with relevant legislative, regulatory and professional requirements.\n\nIn addition to reflecting on its own experiences, including interactions with/uni00A0the external auditor throughout the year, the AC considered and discussed the results of management's internal survey relating to EY's performance over the financial year 2021, which reflected a broadly comparable performance to 2020 and the views and recommendations from management and the Chief Internal Auditor.\n\nTaking into account the above, the AC is satisfied that EY has continued to/uni00A0provide a high-quality and effective audit in its sixth year as auditor and/uni00A0has maintained its independence and objectivity. As required under/uni00A0UK and US auditing standards, the AC received a letter from EY confirming its independence. As required by applicable regulations, EY also informed the AC in writing and discussed with the AC any significant relationships and matters that may reasonably be thought to affect its objectivity and independence.\n\nIn July 2021, the AC was informed by EY that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were provided to a Shell subsidiary in Denmark in May 2021. The services involved the provision of XBRL tagging services for local statutory 2020 accounts, and were performed by EY Denmark personnel that are not part of the audit engagement team and represented less than two hours of work. EY did not charge any fees to Shell for the performed services. The Shell subsidiary in Denmark was subsequently disposed of in July 2021. Based on the facts presented and discussion with EY, the AC noted that the provision of such services did not create a mutual or conflicting interest between EY and Shell; place EY in a/uni00A0position of auditing its own work; result in EY acting as management or an employee of Shell; or place EY in a position of being an advocate for Shell. Accordingly, the AC determined that EY continued to be able to exercise objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within the audit engagement. This breach of the FRC's Ethical Standard is/uni00A0reported by EY in its UK audit report issued pursuant to International Standards on Auditing (UK) and applicable law.",

        "page_content": "## EXTERNAL AUDITOR\n\ncontinued\n\nDuring 2021, there was no review of EY's audits of Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements by the Audit Quality Review (AQR) team of the FRC.\n\n## Reappointment\n\nThe AC is responsible for considering whether there should be a rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm in order to ensure continuing auditor quality and/or independence, including consideration of the advisability and potential impact of conducting a tender process for the appointment of a different independent public accounting firm. The AC is also responsible for recommending to the Board whether it should ask the Company's shareholders to appoint, reappoint or remove the external auditor at the AGM.\n\nAt the AGM in May 2021, the shareholders approved a resolution to reappoint EY as external auditor until the conclusion of the next AGM. EY was first appointed at the AGM in May 2016 after a competitive tender process. This means that 2021 represents EY's sixth year as the Company's external auditor. Under UK legal requirements, the Company may retain EY as its external auditor for 20 years. For the 2021 financial year, the/uni00A0Company has complied with The Statutory Audit Services for Large/uni00A0Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\nIn its oversight of the external audit, the AC considered whether it/uni00A0would/uni00A0be appropriate to conduct an audit tender at this time. The/uni00A0AC/uni00A0took/uni00A0into account:\n\n- \u25a0 any new external auditor would need a transition period to develop sufficient understanding of the business given Shell's size and complexity;\n- \u25a0 its continued satisfaction with the quality and independence of EY's audit;\n- \u25a0 frequent changes of external auditor would be inefficient and could lead to increased risk and the loss of cumulative knowledge;\n- \u25a0 any change in auditor should be scheduled to limit operational disruption.\n- \u25a0 a change in auditor would be expected to have a significant impact on/uni00A0Shell, including on the Finance function; and\n\nThe AC also considered the orderly rotation to Mr Gary Donald as the new audit partner for the 2021 audit and EY's leadership and activities in/uni00A0the area of climate change.\n\nAfter due consideration the AC determined that it would not be appropriate to re-tender for the external audit at this time. The AC has recommended to the Board that at the 2022 AGM the Board should propose that EY be reappointed as the external auditor of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2022. The AC's recommendation is free from third-party influence and there are no contractual obligations that restrict the AC's ability to make such a recommendation.\n\nThe AC acknowledges the UK legal requirements relating to mandatory audit rotation (maximum 20-year engagement) and audit tendering under which the Company will be required to tender for the audit no later than the financial year 2026. The AC regularly reviews auditor performance and may decide to conduct the tender earlier than the financial year 2026 if it considers this to be in the interests of the Company's shareholders.\n\n## NON-AUDIT SERVICES\n\nThe AC maintains an auditor independence policy (AIP) in respect of the provision of services by the external auditor. The AC regularly reviews this policy for necessary changes in response to changes in related standards and regulatory requirements.\n\nThis policy is designed to safeguard auditor objectivity and independence. It includes rules on the provision of audit services, audit-related services and other non-audit services and stipulates which services require specific prior approval by the AC.\n\nThe policy also defines prohibited services that are not to be provided by/uni00A0the auditor because they represent a risk to the external auditor's independence. Prohibited services are any that relate to management decision-taking or any other service that could compromise auditor independence or be perceived to compromise auditor independence. These prohibited services include all services listed as prohibited in the UK/uni00A0and US auditor independence rules. For certain services that are not/uni00A0prohibited, because of the knowledge and experience of the external auditor and/or for reasons of confidentiality, it can be more efficient or prudent to engage the external auditor rather than another party. This is particularly the case with audit-related assurance services that are closely connected to the audit function where the external auditor has the benefit of knowledge gained from work already performed as part of the audit.\n\nUnder the AIP, the AC will only approve services to be carried out by the/uni00A0external auditor or its affiliates where such services do not present a/uni00A0conflict of interest risk in fact or in appearance. The AC reviews quarterly reports from management on the audit and non-audit services reported in/uni00A0accordance with the policy or for which specific prior approval from the AC is being sought. To the extent that the fee value of an additional audit service contract does not individually exceed $500,000, no prior approval of the AC is required. All non-audit services where the fee for an individual contract exceeds $100,000, including audit-related services, require individual prior approval by the AC. In each case where the audit or non-audit service contract does not exceed the relevant threshold, the matter is approved by management by delegated authority from the AC and is subsequently presented for approval by the AC at the next quarterly AC meeting. The AC is mindful of the overall proportion of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining whether to approve such services.\n\nThe scope of the non-audit services contracted with the external auditor in 2021 consisted mainly of interim reviews and other audit-related assurance services. The associated compensation for these audit-related services and other non-audit services amounted to 5% and 5%, respectively, of the external auditor's audit and audit-related remuneration.\n\n## FEES\n\nAfter due consideration, the AC approved the auditor's remuneration, satisfying itself that the level of fees payable in respect of the audit and non-audit services provided was appropriate and that an effective, high-quality audit could be conducted for such fees.\n\n- Note 29 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on page 281 provides details of the auditor's remuneration.",

The Board has approved this report. This report consists of/uni00A0two further sections:\n\n- \u25a0 the Directors' Remuneration Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nIt has been a year of impressive financial performance and strong strategic progress.\n\nShell delivered a very strong set of financial results in 2021, generating more than $45 billion of cash flow from operations (CFFO) including working capital and $40 billion of free cash flow (FCF). This reflects the/uni00A0strength of Shell's integrated business and the ongoing development of a/uni00A0strong and resilient portfolio. Together with robust operational performance in 2021, this enabled Shell to capitalise on dynamic energy markets and improved prices in the second half of the year. The strong financial performance in 2021 allowed Shell to reduce net debt, increase our quarterly dividend and start share buybacks again. The remaining $5.5 billion of proceeds from the divestment of our US/uni00A0Permian business that have been allocated for share buybacks will/uni00A0be/uni00A0distributed to shareholders in the first half of 2022.\n\nOver the year, Shell also delivered a number of key strategic milestones to accelerate the transition to being a net-zero emissions business, including:\n\n- \u25a0 being the first energy company to ask shareholders to cast an advisory vote on its energy transition strategy, achieving support of 88.74% votes cast in May 2021;\n- \u25a0 launching of our updated strategy, Powering Progress in February 2021;\n- \u25a0 implementing a simpler, more cost-effective organisation needed to support delivery of our strategic ambitions under Powering Progress, in/uni00A0August 2021;\n- \u25a0 proposing to simplify the share structure and increase the speed and flexibility of capital and portfolio actions. In December 2021, 99.77% of shareholder votes cast were in support of amending the required Articles of Association of Shell plc (then named Royal Dutch Shell plc) to enable the changes. The alignment of Shell's tax residence with its country of incorporation took place in December 2021, including relocating the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to the UK. The corporate name change and implementation of a single line of shares, eliminating the complex A/B share structure, occurred in early 2022.\n- \u25a0 setting a new target, in October 2021, for Shell to halve the absolute emissions from our operations and the energy it uses to run them by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis;\n\nAmong this success, however, we were also deeply saddened by a number of tragic deaths that occurred as the result of three separate incidents during the year. Six contractor colleagues working under Shell operational control were deliberately killed in an attack by gunmen in Nigeria. In Pakistan, a lorry driver died during a refuelling accident, and in/uni00A0Indonesia, a contractor died following a construction accident. Later in/uni00A0this letter, I will share the REMCO's assessment of these incidents and how we have reflected on them in determining the final pay outcomes.\n\nI also reflect on REMCO's assessment of Shell's wider performance and its/uni00A0progress in adapting to the energy transition, when considering the pay/uni00A0outcomes for 2021 and the year ahead.\n\n## NEIL CARSON\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

        "page_content": "## 2021 PERFORMANCE AND REMUNERATION DECISIONS Annual bonus\n\nSummary of scorecard outcome: the overall mathematical outcome of the/uni00A0annual bonus scorecard was above target, at 1.32. But after reflecting on safety performance, in particular the number of fatalities, the REMCO used/uni00A0downwards discretion to determine the final outcome for Executive Directors to be 1.29. Taking into account the impact of the fatalities on the formulaic outcome and the discretionary adjustment, the total reduction in bonus outcome as a result of the fatalities was equal to 10% of base salary.\n\nThis brings our 10-year average scorecard outcome to 1.03.\n\n## The complete scorecard with all targets, ranges and weightings is set out on page 174./uni00A0\n\nFinancial delivery (35%): robust operational performance and a strong portfolio have led to very strong cash generation. CFFO (including working capital) of $45.1 billion exceeded our outstanding performance threshold of $34 billion, leading to a maximum outcome on/uni00A0this measure.\n\nIt is worth repeating that the REMCO has long had a policy of not adjusting remuneration measures to take account of changes in energy prices and currency fluctuations. This means Senior Management also experience the ups and downs of the macroeconomic environment that affect our business and shareholders. In engagements with our largest shareholders, many have appreciated the transparency that this brings.\n\nOperational excellence (35%): Powering Progress emphasises operational excellence and the delivery of value over volume. In 2021, the REMCO updated the scorecard to reflect this by removing measures based on hydrocarbon production. The focus now is on ensuring Shell operates its/uni00A0assets efficiently and to plan, and that material projects are delivered on time and on budget. Performance was mixed across the segments. Downstream availability was better than target, as was delivery of projects against schedule. But Upstream and midstream availability was/uni00A0lower than plan, and aggregated project costs exceeded budget. Overall, the outcome was below target.\n\nProgress in the energy transition (15%): Powering Progress sets out a strategy to accelerate our transition to net-zero emissions. We linked this/uni00A0to the scorecard in 2021 by focusing on our operational emissions. The/uni00A0outcome was broadly on target.\n\n- \u25a0 GHG abatement tracks the implementation of identified projects that will reduce absolute GHG emissions. Shell made excellent progress in/uni00A02021, with a score that was close to outstanding, reflecting the cumulative effect of a wide range of actions taken across the portfolio to reduce absolute emissions, including abatement projects in QGC Australia and Pearl GTL in Qatar.\n- \u25a0 On greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity, performance has been mixed. Intensities from the Chemicals business were better than target, partly because of higher utilisation at Bukom and Deer Park. But shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Ida and operational difficulties in Nigeria led to a below-threshold result for the combined Upstream and Integrated Gas intensity measure. Refining intensities were also below target due to the impact of Hurricane Ida and the February freeze on our refineries in the USA.\n\nSafety (15%): overall, the outcome on safety was slightly above target.\n\n- \u25a0 In 2021, Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) was introduced as the measure of personal safety performance which focuses on the incidents with the most serious consequences. The outcome was consistent with our expectations based on the number of serious incidents experienced across our businesses in recent years, but not our aspirations.\n- \u25a0 Process safety continues to be measured through the number of Tier 1 and 2 operational safety incidents and was above target for 2021, meaning a better than expected safety performance was achieved.\n\n## REMCO REFLECTIONS ON SAFETY\n\nSafety is Shell's number one priority. The Powering Progress strategy is/uni00A0underpinned by our focus on safety, and it is critical that our day-to-day operations run safely, and the well-being of all our people is ensured. As a result, the REMCO and the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) have carefully considered the fatalities which occurred in the year, paying attention to both the nature of the incidents and Shell's wider progress on safety.\n\nNigeria is a high-risk country, in which we review our larger contractors' safety plans, including those for moving personnel to/uni00A0sites in the Delta. These plans are then implemented by the contractors. At times, there have been up to around 4,500 escorted personnel movements per month for Shell companies in Nigeria. The number is significantly larger for our contractor movements. Existing safety protocols have been effective in supporting these movements. The 2021 incident in Nigeria was unprecedented. The attack on a/uni00A0routine personnel transport was perpetrated by a criminal group which operates for extortion. The criminal group's leader has been arrested and has admitted responsibility. The extreme violence of/uni00A0the attack has been shocking to Shell and the local community. A/uni00A0review is ongoing, which given the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria, may lead to some changes.\n\nSadly, two contractors also died following separate incidents at retail sites in Pakistan and in Indonesia. In Pakistan, a contractor colleague died after a fire at a dealer-operated retail site. Another contractor lost his life when a wall fell over during demolition work at a retail site in Indonesia.\n\nIn addition to reflecting on these tragedies, the REMCO also considered safety performance as a whole over the year. The REMCO noted that, in an industry where road safety continues to present one of the single most material risk areas, we passed 1 billion kilometres of road journeys without a recordable fatality in our operated assets. The REMCO also noted that in 2021, the ongoing transition of the Safety refresh programme reached full implementation, creating the bedrock for the changes aimed at eradicating fatalities and life-changing incidents from Shell's business. Our updated approach to safety is rooted in a consistent focus on human performance, and the way people, culture, equipment, work systems and processes all interact. People are key to completing complex tasks and to finding solutions to/uni00A0problems. To deliver the Safety refresh, Shell aims to apply a learner/uni00A0mindset, believing people can always improve, enhance their/uni00A0capabilities, learn from mistakes and successes, and speak up freely. The REMCO acknowledges the commitment and contributions of the Executive Directors in embracing a learner mindset and driving this cultural change across the organisation. The Safety refresh also/uni00A0included the introduction of the Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F) metric designed to ensure we focus on those incidents with the potential to cause most harm. This metric ensures a/uni00A0heavy weighting is given to fatalities in determining the scorecard outcome, in a manner that was not captured by Total Recordable Case/uni00A0Frequency (TRCF) metrics.\n\nThe REMCO carefully considered the fatalities in the context of Shell's overall safety performance in 2021. It took account of the impact the fatalities had on the formulaic outcome. Without the fatalities, the overall scorecard outcome would have been 1.37, not 1.32, reflecting the heavy emphasis that SIF-F rightly gives to serious incidents. The REMCO determined that the overall scorecard outcome should be further adjusted downwards to 1.29. The overall reduction in the bonus outcome for the CEO and CFO as a result of fatalities is equal to 10% of their base salary.\n\nce",

For the avoidance of doubt, no LTIP targets were adjusted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other reason.\n\nCFFO (22.5%): In absolute terms, 2021 performance was very strong with/uni00A0CFFO at $45 billion, including working capital. The LTIP, though, does/uni00A0not consider the absolute value of CFFO. Instead, it looks at/uni00A0growth from a base year, in this case 2018, when Shell's CFFO performance was also exceptional with more than $50 billion generated. The LTIP compares the growth of Shell's CFFO with the increases in CFFO of the other energy majors (BP, Chevron, Exxon and TotalEnergies). On/uni00A0this basis, Shell ranked/uni00A0fifth, resulting in a nil vesting for this measure.\n\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) (22.5%): Over the performance period, Shell returned more than $43 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. However, similarly to CFFO, TSR is measured on a relative basis, compared with the other energy majors, Shell ranked fourth, resulting in a nil vesting for this measure.\n\nReturn on average capital employed (ROACE) (22.5%): Shell's absolute 2021 ROACE for LTIP purposes was 7.8% (note ROACE for the LTIP calculation is based on disclosed net income and is not adjusted for the after tax interest expense and therefore differs from disclosed ROACE). Again performance is measured on a relative basis against the 2018 base year when Shell had ROACE (for LTIP purposes) of 8.3% and on growth Shell ranked fifth, resulting in a nil vesting.\n\nFCF (22.5%): Performance is assessed on an absolute basis over the/uni00A0three-year performance period. Strong performance in 2021 has more/uni00A0than offset the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with FCF of/uni00A0$87.5 billion generated over the three years, above the target of/uni00A0$82/uni00A0billion. This/uni00A0resulted in a 137% vesting outcome on this measure.\n\nEnergy transition (10%): The vesting of the 2019 LTIP/uni00A0also marks the first time that we have vested an element under the LTIP energy transition performance condition.\n\nShell was the first major energy company, that we are aware of, to include such a comprehensive metric, which measures progress in transforming Shell's businesses for a lower-carbon future, within long-term pay frameworks. This is a broad metric that assesses performance against a range of strategic business developments, as well as measuring our ultimate success in reducing the net carbon intensity of all energy products sold.\n\nThe first set of metrics were focused on laying the foundations for Shell's future growth, building the customer base and developing the organisational capability to deliver against the key strategic ways of decarbonising Shell's business: growing a power business, developing lower-carbon energy products and developing emission sinks. The REMCO has been pleased with the tangible progress shown over the performance cycle, with management demonstrating that it can create a pipeline of new business opportunities and mature projects through to investment. This includes reaching new customers through our growing power business, with acquisitions like ERM in Australia, developing renewables projects such as CrossWind, and investment in ventures such as Enerkem Varennes, which will produce low-carbon fuels and renewable chemicals products from non-recyclable waste, and LanzaJet, which converts ethanol from waste materials into low-carbon jet fuel. While many of these projects are small in comparison to some of Shell's existing businesses, they lay the foundations for future growth.\n\nThe REMCO paid particular attention to the metric of net carbon intensity of all energy products sold. This provides a concrete marker of Shell's success in decarbonising, with Shell the only major energy producer which/uni00A0has sought to connect executive pay with an intensity reduction target based on the full Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from all energy products sold./uni00A0The/uni00A0REMCO noted that the target for this had also been/uni00A0met with a/uni00A0reduction of 2.5% against the target range of 2-3%. The/uni00A0REMCO is/uni00A0pleased to see this target met over the performance period.\n\nTaking everything into account, the REMCO determined that the final vesting outcome of the element of the 2019 LTIP weighted to the energy transition should vest at 180%.\n\nBased on the above outcomes, the overall LTIP vesting outcome was 49%. This brings the ten-year average vesting outcome to 97%. This is broadly aligned with our target grant, although there have been a number of high and low-vesting outcomes over the last 10 years. The REMCO believes this illustrates the fundamental effectiveness of the LTIP and the close alignment between pay and performance the structure has provided over time.\n\n## Finalising the 2021 pay outcomes/uni00A0\n\n- \u25a0 safety performance, in particular the eight fatalities within Shell's operational control which occurred in three incidents and the downward adjustment to the annual bonus scorecard resulting in/uni00A0an/uni00A0overall bonus reduction equivalent to 10% of base salary of the Executive Directors;\n\nIn finalising pay outcomes, the REMCO considered the wider performance of Shell during 2021 and the LTIP performance period. It/uni00A0paid particular attention to:\n\n- \u25a0 the strong financial and operational performance in 2021, with/uni00A0more/uni00A0than $45 billion of CFFO, including working capital, and/uni00A0$40 billion of/uni00A0FCF generated in the year;\n- \u25a0 the shareholder experience, including the decline and extent of recovery in the share price over the LTIP performance period, as well/uni00A0as/uni00A0shareholder feedback provided during my engagements with/uni00A0major/uni00A0shareholders during March and April 2021;\n- \u25a0 the work to accelerate Shell's progress in the energy transition, including setting out our Powering Progress strategy, reshaping the/uni00A0organisation, simplifying the share structure, aligning Shell's tax/uni00A0residence with its country of incorporation and setting targets for/uni00A0reducing absolute emissions;\n- \u25a0 the reduction in net debt, which has supported the restart of share buybacks in 2021, and the progressive dividend policy;\n- \u25a0 the year-on-year comparison between single figure outcomes in 2020 and 2021, noting that the REMCO had decided there would be no 2020 annual bonuses for Executive Directors and Senior Management and year-on-year increases are primarily as a result of a 2021 bonus being awarded; and\n- \u25a0 the employee experience, where the REMCO noted that the Group scorecard for all employees was set at 1.50 following an upwards management adjustment in recognition and appreciation of the extraordinary contributions made by our employees over a challenging period, and the Performance Share Plan, used to/uni00A0make discretionary share awards below senior executive level, which vested at/uni00A067%;\n- \u25a0 the ten-year average outcomes of the annual bonus scorecard (1.0) and LTIP (97%), which demonstrate the effectiveness of the current reward structures in aligning pay outcomes with targets over the longer/uni00A0term.\n\nThis resulted in a single-figure outcome of \u20ac7.4m for the CEO, an increase of 26% from 2020. The CFO's single-figure outcome was \u20ac4.6m, a 24% increase from 2020. The REMCO was satisfied that the remuneration policies had operated as intended, and these outcomes were appropriate in the context of Company performance and the target pay opportunity under the shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy.",

Their transition to the UK is being supported in line with our existing shareholder-approved Directors' Remuneration Policy, including the Group's international mobility policies:\n\n## Relocation of the CEO and CFO to London\n\n- \u25a0 There is no change to the target pay opportunity as a percentage of/uni00A0base salary. Base salaries have been converted from euros to pounds sterling using a 12-month average exchange rate.\n- \u25a0 The CEO has moved from his Dutch pension plan to the standard UK Shell pension. This provides a contribution level of up to 20% of base salary, which is the same as that available to the general Shell employee population in the UK. This is less than the benefits provided/uni00A0under the CEO's Dutch arrangements.\n- \u25a0 Target annual bonus and long-term incentive awards are unchanged.\n- \u25a0 The CFO will remain within her existing US pension arrangements. The/uni00A0REMCO manages this membership prudently as the annual bonus/uni00A0continues to be not pensionable for the CFO while it is for other/uni00A0US employees.\n- \u25a0 The CEO and CFO will be responsible for their own taxes in the/uni00A0UK,/uni00A0except for some limited benefits such as relocation.\n- \u25a0 The CEO will receive a gross housing allowance for a time-limited period of 24 months from when his family relocates. This is a reduced benefit from Shell's usual arrangements as Shell's International Mobility/uni00A0policy would normally provide for housing throughout the/uni00A0overseas position where the employee is asked to move at the/uni00A0Company's request.\n- \u25a0 In line with our Group-wide International Mobility policies, the CEO and CFO will receive support with temporary commuting costs such as/uni00A0travel and accommodation for the first six months, while their families remain in the Netherlands as their children complete their respective school years. The CEO will receive relocation benefits for/uni00A0his family's move to the UK in due course.\n- \u25a0 The approach the REMCO has taken is within the confines and provisions of the existing approved remuneration policy and the REMCO has taken a prudent approach in applying elements of Shell's/uni00A0International Mobility policies.\n\nce",

Mrs Gorman will be based in London and will receive an annual base salary of \u00a3900,000 from appointment as CFO. There will be no change to the current target bonus and LTIP awards for the CFO of 120% (annual bonus) and 270% (LTIP). Mrs Gorman's pension provision is aligned with the standard UK pension arrangement for new employees in the UK, with an employer contribution of 20% which she has elected to receive as a cash allowance. A further announcement regarding the terms of Mrs Uhl's departure will be made in due course.\n\n## Other changes to 2022 remuneration\n\n- \u25a0 The progress in the energy transition measure has to date focused on/uni00A0managing and reducing our operational emissions. However, succeeding in the energy transition requires us to change what we sell. To date, this has been reflected in pay through the LTIP's energy transition performance condition. Starting in 2022, we will widen the/uni00A0scope of the progress in the energy transition measure on the annual bonus scorecard, to be based on three key themes:\n\nTo ensure that Shell's remuneration structures continue to be closely aligned with strategy, we will make the following changes to the 2022 annual bonus scorecard:\n\n- - Selling lower-carbon products - as an energy supplier, we help customers to reduce their emissions by supplying lower-carbon products. We will measure our success at this according to the/uni00A0earnings share of our Marketing business from low- and no-carbon products.\n- - Partnering to decarbonise - as a partner, we work with our customers to help them reduce their emissions. In 2022, we will measure success in this area in terms of our progress in rolling out/uni00A0our electric vehicle charging network.\n- - Reducing our emissions - as an energy user, our target is to achieve/uni00A0a/uni00A050% reduction by 2030; and this measure will be based/uni00A0on reducing our Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions.\n- \u25a0 Powering Progress emphasises the importance of building on our strong customer relationships to help transform Shell in the energy transition. To emphasise the importance of becoming increasingly customer-led, we will introduce a new customer excellence measure for 2022 under operational excellence. This will be based on our customer satisfaction scores, and the extent to which people prefer Shell over competitor brands, measured via brand preference scores. The customer excellence measure will combine elements of business-to-business and/uni00A0business-to-customer performance./uni00A0\n\n## LOOKING AHEAD\n\nThe year ahead promises to be another busy one, as the REMCO continues to make changes that will help Shell succeed in the energy transition and finalises proposals for the 2023 Directors' Remuneration Policy, ahead of a vote at the 2023 AGM. I look forward to ongoing dialogue with our shareholders in the coming months.\n\n## NEIL CARSON\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee March 9, 2022",

The REMCO monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior executives below Senior Management and makes recommendations if appropriate to ensure consistency and alignment with Shell's remuneration objectives. When setting the policy for/uni00A0Executive Director remuneration, the REMCO reviews and considers workforce remuneration and related policies, and how pay and benefits align with culture.\n\nIn exercising its responsibilities, the REMCO takes into account a variety of/uni00A0stakeholder considerations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe REMCO operates within its Terms of Reference, which are reviewed annually. They were last updated on December 7, 2021, and are available on www.shell.com.\n\nAdvice from within Shell was provided by:\n\n- \u25a0 Ronan Cassidy, Chief Human Resources and Corporate Officer and Secretary to the REMCO; and\n- \u25a0 Ben van Beurden, Chief Executive Officer (CEO);\n- \u25a0 Stephanie Boyde, Executive Vice President Performance and Reward.\n\nThe Chair of the Board was consulted on remuneration proposals affecting the CEO. The CEO was consulted on proposals relating to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Senior Management.\n\nThe REMCO met eight times in 2021 and its activities included:\n\n- \u25a0 determining 2021 target bonuses and 2021 LTIP awards for Senior Management;\n- \u25a0 determining vesting of the 2018 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) award for Senior Management;\n- \u25a0 approving the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report;\n- \u25a0 considering matters relating to the updated strategy and the transition of our business to net-zero emissions, and the potential implications for the 2022 annual bonus and LTIP performance measures and targets;\n- \u25a0 setting 2021 annual bonus and LTIP performance measures and targets;\n- \u25a0 setting exit and appointment remuneration for changes in the Executive Committee;\n- \u25a0 monitoring external developments and assessing their impact on the Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n- \u25a0 setting terms for the relocation, and pay arrangements of the Executive Directors from the Hague to London; and\n\nAfter a competitive tender process, in 2021 Deloitte was chosen to provide external advice on Shell's remuneration structures and developments in market practice around remuneration. The choice was based on ability to assess the risk profile of policies, knowledge of investors' expectations and familiarity with international market practices. Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and operates according to the group's code of conduct when advising clients. REMCO is satisfied that the advice provided was objective and independent. The total fees in relation to the advice were \u00a355,000 (excluding value-added tax). Deloitte provided other consultancy and accountancy services to Shell during the year, but the REMCO is satisfied that this did not compromise the independence of/uni00A0the advice on executive remuneration. The REMCO also reviewed benchmarking data and analysis prepared by Shell's internal HR function/uni00A0on market developments in executive pay.\n\n## PRINCIPLES\n\nThe principles that underpin the REMCO's approach to executive remuneration are set out on page 189.\n\nThe REMCO considered the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code when deciding 2021 pay outcomes. It also sought to reflect the principles of clarity, simplicity, risk management, predictability, proportionality and alignment with culture.\n\nShell has a consistent global reward and performance philosophy that sets clear expectations of employees. The annual bonus scorecard and LTIP are designed to ensure that remuneration is clearly aligned with Shell's operating plan and strategic ambitions. The same measures apply to Executive Directors and Senior Management and to a significantly broader employee base. This provides alignment throughout the organisation with Shell's culture and strategy. The annual operating plan translates into targets on the annual bonus scorecard, and a quarterly update on performance against scorecard targets is provided to employees. The LTIP is largely based on outperforming the competition./uni00A0Employees receive regular updates on Shell's performance against competitors./uni00A0To assist in the mitigation of reputational risk and to/uni00A0ensure proportionality, the REMCO will use discretion to ensure the highest pay outcomes are delivered only for outstanding performance.\n\nce",

On the relative measures, Shell ranked fourth on total shareholder return (TSR), and fifth on cash flow/uni00A0from operations (CFFO) and return on average capital employed (ROACE), leading to a nil vesting outcome on each of the relative measures. On the absolute measures, Shell exceeded the free cash flow (FCF) target of $82 billion, generating $87.5 billion over the performance period, and substantively met all of the four energy transition performance targets. (See below for more details.)\n\n2019 LTIP vesting outcomes - performance measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe REMCO also noted the impact of the decline in share price between award and vesting on the overall outcome. The REMCO further reflected on the overall single outcome for the CEO. The REMCO decided that the/uni00A0outcome was consistent with the target opportunity and intended operation of the plan under the remuneration policy and no adjustment to/uni00A0the vesting outcomes was required.\n\nAccordingly, the REMCO decided that the LTIP should vest at 49% without/uni00A0the use of discretion. This is illustrated below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 168 for more detail.\n\nFCF\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntransition\n\nEnergy\n\n18%\n\n| Performance Measures                                                                                       |                   | Weighting   | Threshold performance   | Maximum performance   | Outcome (out of the  maximum 200%)   |    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|----|\n| Relative Performance ranked  against the other energy  majors: BP, Chevron,  ExxonMobil and  TotalEnergies | CFFO              | 22.5%       | Third                   | First                 | Fifth                                | 0% |\n| Relative Performance ranked  against the other energy  majors: BP, Chevron,  ExxonMobil and  TotalEnergies | TSR               | 22.5%       | Third                   | First                 | Fourth                               | 0% |\n| Relative Performance ranked  against the other energy  majors: BP, Chevron,  ExxonMobil and  TotalEnergies | ROACE             | 22.5%       | Third                   | First                 | Fifth                                | 0% |\n| Absolute Performance assessed  against internal financial  and strategic targets                           | FCF               | 22.5%       | $73bn                   | $97bn                 | $87. 5 b n                           |    |\n| Absolute Performance assessed  against internal financial  and strategic targets                           | Energy transition | 10%         | 1/4 target areas        | 4/4 target areas      |                                      |    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe REMCO reviewed Shell's performance over the vesting period, considering/uni00A0financial and safety performance, whether there had been any/uni00A0breaches of ethics and compliance standards or other events that might damage Shell's reputation, and individual performance. The REMCO decided that the LTIP outcome was a fair reflection of performance and should/uni00A0vest without discretionary adjustment.\n\n## Vesting of the energy transition performance condition\n\nThe energy transition condition supports delivery of Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) target (measured by Shell's Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology). This is a broad metric which consists of a mix of strategic measures that set the foundations for Shell achieving our longer-term ambitions in the energy transition, as well as Shell's success in reducing the/uni00A0NCI of all energy products sold. The outcome was intended to be determined holistically by the REMCO, after taking advice from the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo), taking account of performance against quantifiable targets but also with regard/uni00A0to Shell's wider progress in the energy transition beyond the defined measures.\n\nFinal vesting outcome\n\n49%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe metrics for the first LTIP cycle (2019-2021) were focused on laying the/uni00A0foundations for Shell's future growth, building the customer base and/uni00A0developing the organisational capability to deliver against the key/uni00A0strategic ways of decarbonising Shell's business: growing a power business, developing lower-carbon energy products and developing emission sinks.\n\nTSR",

        "page_content": "## ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION\n\nBuild a material Power business: The first cycle of the LTIP was orientated toward creating the foundations on which a material power business can be built: entering new markets to access customers, and developing new commercial pathways by creating a funnel of renewable power capacity options and then converting those options to realised investments. The REMCO considered that this target had substantively being met. Noting the movement into new markets for direct power sales to end customers through acquisitions such as ERM in Australia (now trading as Shell Energy), and the expansion of the North American renewables power business with the acquisition of Inspire. Strong progress has also been made on renewables, with a funnel of installed renewable capacity and/uni00A0pipeline of options well ahead of what was expected in 2019 following the acquisition of solar and energy storage developer, Savion. Demonstrable progress was made on converting those options into the renewable energy projects that a lower-carbon energy future will require, for example with the CrossWinds joint venture in the Netherlands.\n\nAdvanced biofuels technology: Biofuels are expected to play an important role in energy transition, providing a key decarbonisation lever for sectors that will continue to need to use liquid fuels. This element of the LTIP measure reflects our strategy, which is to prove multiple technology platforms that can be subsequently replicated at pace, with performance assessed based on Shell developing or taking an equity position in commercial scale biofuels projects. The initial target was focussed on/uni00A0taking the first steps to implement this strategy, and the REMCO considered this had been met in full through Enerkem Varennes, a/uni00A0biofuels/uni00A0plant in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, that will produce low-carbon fuel/uni00A0and/uni00A0chemicals from non-recyclable waste, and LanzaJet, which will/uni00A0produce/uni00A0jet/uni00A0fuel from ethanol from a plant in Georgia in the US.\n\nDeveloping emissions sinks: The development of systems that capture and/uni00A0absorb carbon are required as part of the global response to climate change. The target for the first LTIP cycle was based on setting the\n\nfoundations to develop future commercial value chains and REMCO considered this element of the LTIP measure had been met in full. This was through the Northern Lights project in Norway, with the REMCO noting that this project provided the opportunity to build the commercial knowledge and organisational capacity for future carbon capture projects. The REMCO also took account of the significant progress made on investment in the nature based solutions (NBS), which will make a big contribution to Shell reaching net-zero emissions, with nine investments in NBS projects that are verified by recognised carbon credit standards over the performance period.\n\nNet carbon intensity: Finally, the REMCO paid particular attention to the outcome on the metric based on the NCI reduction. This a comprehensive metric covering the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from all energy products sold by Shell and provides a concrete marker of Shell's success in decarbonising. The REMCO believes that Shell remains the only major energy company to tie executive pay to a target for reducing the Scope 1,/uni00A02 and 3 emissions intensity from the sale of all energy products. The outcome of this metric is a reduction of 2.5% against a target range of 2-3%. This target has evolved over time to reflect the decarbonisation actions necessary to meet our longer-term NCI targets (NCI reduction targets for later LTIP cycles are 2020-2022: 3-4%, 2021-2023: 6-8%, 2022-2024 9-12%, compared to the 2016 base year).\n\n## Further detail is available on page 94.\n\nThe REMCO considered the alignment to the financial statements and/uni00A0the/uni00A0enhancement of the quality of our emissions data when making/uni00A0their decision.\n\nAfter taking advice from the SESCo REMCO decided the energy transition/uni00A0performance condition should vest at 180%.\n\nThe overall vesting outcome, including an illustration of the impact of share price movement and accrued dividends, is set out below. The CEO and/uni00A0CFO's vested awards are subject to a further three-year holding period which extends beyond their tenure as Executive Director.\n\n## 2019 LTIP vesting outcome\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 194,625 x 49% =  95,366 Ordinary shares  \u20ac2,593,955  Vesting outcome:  [A]   | 95,366 x -\u20ac2.41 -\u20ac229,832 Change in share price:  [B]   | 18,079 Ordinary shares  \u20ac448,178 Accrued dividends: [C]   | Total LTIP Vesting:  [C][D] 113,445 Ordinary shares  \u20ac2,812,302   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CFO                                                                          | CFO                                                     | CFO                                                       | CFO                                                               |\n| 49,927 x 49% = 24,464 ADS  $1,537,318 Vesting outcome:  [A]                  | 24,464 x -$9.99  -$244,395 Change in share price:  [B]  | 4,670 ADS  $246,810 Accrued dividends: [C]                | Total LTIP Vesting:  [C][D] 29,134 ADS $1,539,732                 |",

        "page_content": "In determining the final pay outcomes, the REMCO also considered the personal performance of the Executive Directors.\n\n## Personal performance 2019 - 2021/uni00A0\n\nIt has been a challenging period for business as the world has grappled with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and, for the energy sector in/uni00A0particular, as society accelerates towards a future of cleaner energy. Responding to these challenges has demanded strong leadership which both the/uni00A0CEO and CFO have provided. The REMCO acknowledges the exceptional personal contributions made by both the CEO and CFO in delivering a/uni00A0very strong set of financial results, coupled with a number of key strategic and organisational developments in 2021. This includes an updated strategy, Powering Progress, the first shareholder advisory vote on Shell's Energy Transition Report and the implementation of a new organisational structure (Project Reshape). This culminated with the simplification, an important step, which the Board believes will strengthen Shell's competitiveness and accelerate both shareholder distributions and delivery of its strategy to become a net-zero emissions energy business.\n\n## Ben van Beurden\n\n## Jessica Uhl\n\nAgainst a backdrop of transformational strategic and organisational change, the strength of Shell integrated business, quality of portfolio and operational delivery allowed Shell to capitalise on improved prices to deliver adjusted earnings of $19.3bn and generated an outstanding $45.1bn of CFFO (including/uni00A0working capital). The work has also continued to reshape Shell's portfolio with the delivery of/uni00A0divestment proceeds of $15.1bn in 2021, far beyond target. These operating cash/uni00A0flows and divestment proceeds significantly contributed to reducing net debt to/uni00A0$52.6 billion at the end 2021, down from $75.4 billion at the end of/uni00A02020. This strong financial performance has enabled Shell to deliver on our commitment to increase shareholder distributions in keeping with our successful net/uni00A0debt reduction. Starting from Q2 2021, we rebased our quarterly dividend to/uni00A024/uni00A0US/uni00A0cents per share and started share buybacks. The REMCO acknowledges the fundamental role the CEO's strategic and operational leadership has played in/uni00A0enabling these financial outcomes and delivery of shareholder returns.\n\nTackling climate change is an urgent challenge. This is why Shell has set a target to/uni00A0become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society and/uni00A0our customers. The CEO has led the development of Shell's updated strategy, Powering Progress, which sets out a comprehensive strategy on how Shell intends to/uni00A0decarbonise energy customers while running legacy businesses for value rather than/uni00A0volume, integrating business and investment decisions with Shell's longer-term ambitions. This was supported by the implementation of the new organisation (Project Reshape) necessary to support this updated strategy, which was completed/uni00A0in August 2021 without operational disruption.\n\nExternally, the CEO has played a leading role in the energy transition debate through such initiatives as the first joint statement with institutional shareholders, encouraging other companies to adopt the net carbon intensity methodology. He/uni00A0has been instrumental in galvanising coalitions to start action on sectoral decarbonisation. His personal role, for example in the Aviation Clean Skies Initiative, is recognised by both customers and external stakeholders. His interventions have helped in shifting the climate agenda towards the practical measures that will be needed for creating sustained demand for lower-carbon products.\n\nThe refreshed safety programme was rolled out and a new personal safety measure designed to focus attention on the most serious incidents was introduced. To deliver the safety refresh Shell aims to apply a learner mindset, believing people can always improve, enhance their capabilities, learn from mistakes and successes, and/uni00A0speak up freely. The REMCO recognise the work across the leadership team at/uni00A0Shell, from the CEO down, in embracing a learner mindset and driving this across/uni00A0the organisation.\n\nThe REMCO considered the single-figure outcomes for the CEO and CFO. It noted that the overall remuneration outcomes were higher than in 2020, by 26% for the CEO and 24% for the CFO. The REMCO was satisfied that these single-figure outcomes represented a fair level of remuneration.\n\nIn finalising its remuneration decisions for 2021, the REMCO considered a/uni00A0range of factors, including:\n\n- \u25a0 The impact of the fatalities on the formulaic scorecard outcome, and/uni00A0further downwards adjustment applied by the REMCO on the/uni00A0bonus scorecard;\n- \u25a0 Shell's performance in 2021 and over the LTIP performance period 2019-2021;\n- \u25a0 the ongoing leadership shown by the CEO and CFO in continuing to set out a clear strategic direction for Shell in the energy transition and delivering the organisational redesign necessary to deliver on those strategic promises;\n\nThe REMCO recognises the leadership of the CFO in delivering a number of key enterprise initiatives over the course of 2021. Notably this included the successful delivery of the simplification of Shell plc. This was a complex and challenging undertaking that involved the establishment of a single line of shares to eliminate the/uni00A0complexity of Shell's A/B share structure and aligning Shell's tax residence with/uni00A0its country of incorporation in the UK.\n\nShell's strong financial results were underpinned by discipline on capital, operating and lease expenditure and by the delivery of a divestment programme in excess of/uni00A0$15 billion. This enabled a reduction in net debt by $23 billion over the course of 2021. Dividends were increased twice in the year and share buybacks commenced, accelerating the pace of shareholder distributions. The CFO played a critical role in guiding the company through the implementation of an updated capital allocation framework to balance growth and shareholder distributions.\n\nTo support ongoing transparency for shareholders, the CFO led the introduction of/uni00A0significantly improved external financial and operational quarterly disclosures in/uni00A02021 with positive feedback from the market.\n\nOver the performance period, the CFO has made significant progress maturing the internal management systems relating to carbon dioxide (CO/uni2082) and ensuring these are reflected in decisions about portfolio, planning and resource allocation. In 2021, this included the delivery of carbon budgets within the annual business planning cycle for the first time. From the 2021 Annual Report, improved disclosure in the Annual Report.\n\nThe CFO led the delivery of the Shell Energy Transition Strategy publication, which/uni00A0is/uni00A0part of our continuing work to implement the recommendations of the Task/uni00A0Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The report sets out how/uni00A0Shell plans to be resilient to expected changes in the energy system and how/uni00A0its/uni00A0strategy helps/uni00A0it/uni00A0to/uni00A0thrive as the world transitions to lower-carbon energy/uni00A0culminating in/uni00A0the/uni00A0first shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 AGM in/uni00A0May/uni00A0(88.74%/uni00A0of votes cast/uni00A0were in/uni00A0favour).\n\n- \u25a0 a range of other factors taking account of Shell's performance beyond the formulaic outcomes of defined pay architecture, including safety, ethics and compliance, and feedback from the Audit Committee and the Safety, Environment and/uni00A0Sustainability Committee (SESCo);\n- \u25a0 the CEO's and CFO's remuneration compared with the variable pay outcomes for the general workforce;\n- \u25a0 the final LTIP vesting outcome;\n- \u25a0 the alignment of the CEO and CFO with the shareholder experience through their high shareholding requirements; and\n- \u25a0 the personal performance of the Executive Directors.\n\nAfter reflecting on the above factors, the REMCO was satisfied that the remuneration policies had operated as intended.",

        "page_content": "## ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION continued\n\n## Pension\n\nIn 2021, Ben van Beurden's pension arrangements comprised a defined benefit plan with a maximum pensionable salary of \u20ac100,861; and a net pay defined contribution pension plan with a 2021 employer contribution of 27% of/uni00A0salary in excess of \u20ac100,861. He has the option of taking cash as an alternative to pension contributions (in either case subject to income tax). He elected to take his benefit in the form of contributions up to and including November/uni00A02021.\n\nThe employer contribution levels were in line with those applicable to other/uni00A0Netherlands-based employees. Under the Dutch pension regulations applicable to the pension arrangement in which the CEO participates, the contribution rate increases with age and is shown below. At December 31, 2021, the average employer contribution rate for Netherlands employees who participate in the net pay defined contribution pension arrangement on the same terms as Ben van Beurden was 22%.\n\nAfter relocating to the UK, from December 31, 2021, the CEO is eligible to/uni00A0participate in the UK Shell Pension Plan, with a contribution rate of 20%, or to take this as a pension cash alternative. The UK Shell Pension Plan and associated pension cash alternative are available to new employees in the UK at the same contribution levels and currently around half of the UK employees participate in these arrangements. The majority of the remainder participate in a legacy defined benefit plan which closed/uni00A0to/uni00A0new members from March 2013.\n\nJessica Uhl is a member of the Shell US retirement benefit arrangements, which include the Shell Pension Plan (a defined benefit plan), and a defined contribution plan where she receives an employer contribution of 10% of salary. This is the same as the average employer contribution rate for US employees, which was 10%. As for all other pre-2013 members of the Shell Pension Plan, she has an annual choice of two accrual formulas with different forms of benefits, one in the form of a lifetime annuity and the other allowing for a lump-sum payment. She elected to accrue benefits for 2021 under the former. Around 9,000 out of 15,000 Shell US\n\n## Shell Netherlands Pension Stichting net pay defined contribution ladder\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nemployees have the option of choosing between the two formulas. These arrangements are the same for all employees who joined Shell US at the same time as Jessica Uhl. The difference in Jessica Uhl's pension provision, compared with other employees who joined before 2013, is that because she is an Executive Director her bonus is not pensionable. For other relevant US employees the bonus is pensionable. She also has a deferred Dutch defined benefit pension plan, as a result of/uni00A0a previous Shell assignment on local Dutch terms and conditions.\n\nThe REMCO believes these arrangements are aligned with corporate governance developments in the UK which emphasise the desirability of/uni00A0Executive Directors'/uni00A0pension arrangements being the same as those for/uni00A0the general employee/uni00A0population.\n\n## Scheme interests awarded in 2021\n\nScheme interests awarded to Executive Directors in 2021 (audited)\n\nPotential amount vesting\n\n| Scheme interest type   | Type of interest  awarded   | End of  performance  period   | Target award [A]                                                                                                                                                         | Minimum  performance (% of  shares awarded)  [B]   | Maximum performance (% of  shares of the target award) [A]                          |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LTIP                   | Performance  shares         | December 31,  2023            | Ben van Beurden: 231,679 A shares, equivalent  to 2.645 x base salary or \u20ac4,200,344.

They are as follows:\n\nLagging measure - a measure of our progress in meeting our ambition:\n\n- \u25a0 Reducing the carbon intensity of all energy products sold: a target for reducing the NCI of the energy products Shell sells (a carbon intensity measure that takes into account the full life-cycle emissions of products, including customers' emissions associated with using them).\n\nLeading measures - Shell will use these to reduce our NCI in the future:\n\n- \u25a0 Offer more lower-carbon energy products: biofuels are expected to play a valuable role in the changing energy mix. They are likely to be one of the main ways to reduce carbon emissions in sectors that need to keep using liquid fuels for a significant number of years, such as some/uni00A0segments of transport and industry.\n- \u25a0 The growth of our Power business: all scenarios recognise that one of/uni00A0the main ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions is to use more electricity, produced via lower-carbon means such as renewables and/uni00A0gas-fired power generation. Our ambition is to expand our Power/uni00A0business through selective investments in generation and by/uni00A0reselling power generated by others.\n- \u25a0 The development of systems to capture and absorb carbon: carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS) and carbon sinks, such as nature-based solutions, need to be part of the global response to/uni00A0climate change.\n\nShell has set targets for each element. Progress in the energy transition is/uni00A0not expected to be linear because it will reflect the pace of change of/uni00A0society as a whole and the speed at which Shell makes progress with/uni00A0its/uni00A0strategic business objectives. As a result, targets have been set/uni00A0as/uni00A0ranges. These targets are commercially sensitive, so they will not be/uni00A0disclosed until the end of the performance period (or until they are no longer considered commercially sensitive). An update on our performance in relation to the/uni00A0measures set for the 2019 LTIP is provided on page/uni00A0180.\n\nThe vesting outcome for the part of the LTIP weighted to the energy transition condition ranges from 0% to 200% of award. The REMCO, at/uni00A0its/uni00A0sole discretion, will determine vesting outcomes after considering achievement against the target ranges and feedback from the SESCo. The/uni00A0REMCO will consider, in relation to each element, progress over the performance period relative to short-term aims that encourage progress towards Shell's long-term NCI ambition. The starting point for determining the vesting outcome will be how many of the targets have been met for each of the four areas. One out of four will equal 40%, two will equal 100%, three will equal 150%, and 200% will be awarded for scoring four out of four. It/uni00A0is important to note that performance against these elements will serve/uni00A0simply as a starting point for the REMCO, which will also take into account/uni00A0any other considerations it deems appropriate, including (without limitation) the relative importance of these elements in meeting the long-term ambition announced by Shell. For example, the REMCO may decide to allocate a greater importance to overall performance in relation to the NCI than the other three elements. The REMCO believes this approach is appropriate, given the uncertainties around the speed and/uni00A0direction of progress in the energy transition. The REMCO will fully disclose and explain the application of any discretion.\n\n## 2021 energy transition performance condition - measures\n\nPerformance is assessed based on our reduction in the carbon intensity of all energy products sold and progress on the key strategic means of/uni00A0achieving/uni00A0decarbonisation:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reducing the carbon intensity of all energy products sold\n\n- Reduction in net carbon intensity vs. base year measured by Net Carbon Footprint \u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Build a material Power business\n\n## Grow new lower-carbon energy product offerings\n\n## Develop emission sinks\n\n- Total power sales \u00b7\n- Reduce the carbon intensity of the Power portfolio \u00b7\n- Renewable power generation capacity \u00b7\n- Electric vehicle charging network \u00b7\n- Advanced biofuels \u00b7\n- Deployment of low-carbon fuels \u00b7\n- Hydrogen business development \u00b7\n\nQuantitative targets are set for each metric.

Given that FCF is heavily influenced by the volatility of oil and gas prices, the annual operating plans are updated each year to set an annual target to reflect a changing oil price premise. As a result, FCF targets are set annually for each annual operating plan and will only be disclosed in aggregate retrospectively after the three-year period. The/uni00A0REMCO has considered setting a three-year target at the outset, but it/uni00A0believes such an approach would require adjustments for the oil and gas/uni00A0price premise and other matters at the end of/uni00A0the period, given the unpredictability and volatility in oil and gas prices. The REMCO has a/uni00A0long-standing no-adjustments policy which leads it to believe that a/uni00A0more appropriate approach is to set the target based on the aggregation of/uni00A0the/uni00A0annual operating plans.\n\nThe amounts payable under this measure will range from 20% of the/uni00A0available maximum, for threshold performance, to full vesting for outstanding performance. A straight-line vesting schedule will apply for/uni00A0performance between threshold and outstanding.\n\n## Relative measures\n\nThe relative measures are based on our performance on a number of/uni00A0key/uni00A0financial measures against the our closest comparators.\n\nFor relative measures, we rank growth based on the data points at the end/uni00A0of the performance period compared with those at the beginning of/uni00A0the period, using publicly reported data.\n\n- \u25a0 ROACE growth. For this purpose, to facilitate the comparison, the calculation of ROACE differs from that described in 'Performance indicators' on page 36 because there is no adjustment for after-tax interest expense; and\n- \u25a0 TSR, calculated in US dollars using a 90-day averaging period, 45/uni00A0days either side of the/uni00A0start and end of the performance period;\n- \u25a0 growth in cash flow from operating activities.\n\nEach relative measure affects vesting independently, with the amounts payable ranging from 0% to 200%, in accordance with the following vesting schedule:\n\n- \u25a0 ranking second equals 150% vesting for the LTIP element weighted to/uni00A0that measure;\n- \u25a0 ranking first equals 200% vesting for the LTIP element weighted to/uni00A0that/uni00A0measure;\n- \u25a0 ranking third equals 80% vesting for the LTIP element weighted to/uni00A0that/uni00A0measure; and\n- \u25a0 ranking fourth or fifth equals 0% vesting for the LTIP element weighted/uni00A0to that measure.\n\n## TSR Underpin\n\nIf the TSR ranking is fourth or fifth, the level of the award that can vest on the basis of the other measures will be capped at 50% of the maximum.\n\n## Performance update on FCF\n\nAt December 31, 2021, FCF performance is above target, with a below-threshold outcome for 2020 of $20.8 billion (target $38 billion) balanced by a strong performance in 2021 of $40.3 billion (target $9/uni00A0billion). As one year of FCF performance remains, and 77.5% of/uni00A0the/uni00A0award is subject to relative and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect/uni00A0the/uni00A0potential vesting of the award.\n\n## 2020 LTIP award\n\n## 2021 LTIP award\n\nAt December 31, 2021, FCF performance, $40.3 billion for 2021, is above target ($9 billion). As two years of FCF performance remain, and 80% of the award is subject to relative and energy transition performance conditions, this does not reflect the potential vesting of/uni00A0the/uni00A0award.\n\n## Statement of Directors' shareholding and share interests/uni00A0(audited) Shareholding guidelines\n\nThe REMCO believes that Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in Shell plc (the Company). The CEO is expected to build a shareholding with a value of 700% of base salary, and the CFO 500%. The shareholding requirement extends post employment, such that Executive Directors will be required to maintain their shareholding requirement, or the number of shares actually held if this is less than the shareholding requirement, for a period/uni00A0of two years post employment. There is a Company-sponsored nominee account which allows for restrictions to be applied on the sale or transfer of shares that are subject to holding periods and individual shareholding requirements. The restrictions remain in force beyond the Executive Director's employment.\n\nOnly unfettered shares count. Shares delivered that are subject to holding/uni00A0requirements also count towards the guidelines. The values of/uni00A0shares counting towards the shareholding guideline (as a percentage of/uni00A0base salary) were 904% for the CEO and 693% for the CFO at March/uni00A04, 2022.\n\n## Executive Directors' shareholding (audited)\n\n|                 | Shareholding guideline  (% of base salary)   | Value of shares  counting towards  guideline (% of base  salary at December  31, 2021) [A]   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ben van Beurden | 700%                                         | 972%                                                                                         |\n| Jessica Uhl     | 500%                                         | 555%                                                                                         |\n\nNon-executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their fixed annual fee and to maintain that holding during their tenure.",

The local employee population of these countries is considered to be a suitable employee comparator group because: these are countries with a significant Shell employee base; a/uni00A0large proportion of/uni00A0senior managers come from these countries; and/uni00A0the/uni00A0REMCO considers remuneration levels in these countries when setting base salaries for\n\nExecutive Directors. For the purposes of comparison, the change in employee remuneration is calculated by reference to the change in salary scale, benefits and annual bonus for a/uni00A0notional employee in each of the base countries, not by reference to the/uni00A0actual change in pay for a group of employees.\n\nTaxable benefits are those that align with the definition of taxable benefits applying in the respective country. In line with the 'Single total figure of remuneration for Executive Directors' table, the annual bonus is included in the year in which it was earned.\n\n## Percentage change in remuneration of Directors and employees [A]\n\n|                             |                        | 2020-2021   | 2019-2020   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Employees [B]               |                        |             |             |\n| UK, USA and the Netherlands | Salaries/fees          | 0.6%        | 3.0%        |\n|                             | Benefits               | -%          | -%          |\n|                             | Bonus                  | N/A         | (100.0)%    |\n| Executive Directors         |                        |             |             |\n| CEO                         | Salaries/fees          | -%          | 2.0%        |\n|                             | Benefits               | 8.6%        | (23.7)%     |\n|                             | Bonus                  | N/A         | (100.0)%    |\n| CFO                         | Salaries/fees          | -%          | 2.0%        |\n|                             | Benefits               | (22.8)%     | 28.1%       |\n|                             | Bonus                  | N/A         | (100.0)%    |\n| Non-executive Directors [C] |                        |             |             |\n| Dick Boer                   | Salaries/fees          | 70.4%       | N/A         |\n|                             | Benefits               | -%          | N/A         |\n| Neil Carson                 | Salaries/fees          | 4.3%        | 85.6%       |\n|                             | Benefits               | -%          | -%          |\n| Ann Godbehere               | Salaries/fees          | 2.9%        | 15.8%       |\n|                             | Benefits               | N/A         | -%          |\n| Euleen Goh                  | Salaries/fees          | 11.4%       | 0.2%        |\n|                             | Benefits               | N/A         | -%          |\n| Jane Holl Lute              | Salaries/fees          | N/A         | N/A         |\n|                             | Benefits               | N/A         | N/A         |\n| Charles O.

Under option A, a comparable single total figure for/uni00A0all UK employees has been calculated in order to identify the employees whose pay and benefits are at the 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentiles for comparison with the CEO. Employee pay has been calculated based on/uni00A0the total pay and benefits paid in respect of 2021 for all employees who were employed on December 31, 2021. For part-time workers and joiners in the year, pay and benefits have been annualised based on the/uni00A0proportion of their working time in the UK during the year. This is/uni00A0calculated with an approach consistent with the methodology for/uni00A0determining annual bonuses. The REMCO believes that this provides a/uni00A0fair/uni00A0and reasonable calculation of the pay ratios for Shell employees in/uni00A0the UK.\n\nThe ratio of the CEO's pay to the median UK worker is 57. The global pay/uni00A0ratio, calculated by comparing the CEO's single figure with the average employee headcount cost, is 64. The ratio at median is unchanged for 2021 from that reported for 2020. This follows a decline in/uni00A0the ratios since 2018, this is due to a decrease in the variable pay outcomes for the CEO. The pay and benefits for the 25th, 50th and 75th/uni00A0percentile employees have increased in relation to 2020, primarily because there was a strong bonus outcome for all employees in 2021 and/uni00A0employees also did not receive an annual bonus for 2020. The/uni00A0REMCO believes this outcome/uni00A0is/uni00A0appropriate and consistent with/uni00A0Shell's philosophy of pay/uni00A0for/uni00A0performance.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\n- \u25a0 The one-off award of Shell shares to all eligible employees globally under the Powering Progress Share Award plan. Powering Progress provides a blueprint for generating value at Shell, but it is our employees who will deliver this strategy. To support engagement with our Powering Progress strategy and to help employees benefit from its successful delivery, all eligible employees, regardless of job grade or location, were granted $1,000 of Shell shares in June 2021 (for the avoidance of/uni00A0doubt, the CEO and CFO did not receive this award also).\n\nThe REMCO bases its decisions about remuneration on a wide range of factors including a careful consideration of the pay and conditions of the general workforce. In 2021, the REMCO considered factors that included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Remuneration markers such as the CEO pay ratio and gender pay/uni00A0reporting under the UK Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations, and voluntary ethnicity pay reporting in the UK narrowed slightly in 2021 to 17.8% from 18% in 2020, continuing the positive trend since 2017 (22.2%). This is due to a continued upward trend in the proportion of women in our upper and upper middle pay quartiles. The REMCO has confidence in Shell policies that/uni00A0aim to increase the representation of women at all levels in the/uni00A0organisation.\n- \u25a0 The scorecard and Performance Share Plan (PSP) outcomes for employees (when the REMCO was determining the 2021 variable pay outcomes for Executive Directors). In particular, the REMCO noted the decision by management to adjust upwards the annual bonus scorecard for employees in recognition and appreciation of the extraordinary contributions made by our employees over a challenging/uni00A0period.\n- \u25a0 The planned general employee salary increases in the UK, USA and the Netherlands (when the REMCO was reviewing 2022 base salaries and target remuneration packages).\n\nExecutive remuneration structures in Shell are strongly aligned with Shell's broader policy on pay:\n\n- \u25a0 Executive Directors and Executive Committee members participate in/uni00A0the LTIP. Around 150 senior executives participate in the same plan. The measures and metrics for that plan also apply to/uni00A050% of the PSP awarded to around 16,500 employees.\n- \u25a0 In recent years the Group scorecard architecture has been identical to/uni00A0the Executive Committee and Senior Executive scorecard in terms of/uni00A0measures, weightings and targets.\n- \u25a0 All employees in the Group participate in the relevant pension plan for/uni00A0their country based on their date of joining. Shell does not operate/uni00A0separate executive pension arrangements.\n\nThis consistency means that less explanation of executive remuneration structures is required than in companies where alignment is not the default practice. Employee engagements aimed to create an ongoing dialogue about how pay outcomes for all employees are linked to delivering the Powering Progress strategy. As part of this process, articles on Shell's internal intranet explored the Powering Progress Share Award and how the refreshed bonus scorecard connects with Shell's strategy and priorities. These articles generated a high level of interest among employees. Engagement scores, as measured by the number of page views, comments, likes and shares, were well above the average for Shell's/uni00A0intranet.\n\nce",

It will be effective until the 2023 AGM, unless a further policy is proposed by Shell and approved by shareholders before then. This section describes elements of the policy that will apply/uni00A0for/uni00A02022.\n\n## Executive Directors Salaries\n\nNo salary increases were made for 2021. Effective from December 31, 2021, the date at which they transferred to UK employment, the base salaries were set at \u00a31,420,000 for Ben van Beurden and at \u00a3921,000 for Jessica Uhl. Both base salaries were set in accordance with the shareholder-approved 2020 Remuneration Policy and included a 3.5% increase for the CEO and/uni00A03% for the CFO. The REMCO decided these salary increases in acknowledgement of the significant personal contributions made by the CEO and CFO to the Shell Group in delivering the strategic progress over 2021. In particular, the simplification of Shell, which entailed establishing a single line of shares to eliminate the complexity of Shell's A/B share structure and aligning Shell's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK./uni00A0These are measures which the Board believes will strengthen Shell's competitiveness and accelerate both shareholder distributions and delivery of its strategy, and the salary increases are consistent with the principles for managing the development of employee remuneration across the Group in cases where individuals make significant personal contributions in the year. The REMCO also paid close attention to the benchmarking analysis from the defined comparator groups. No specific benchmark position is defined, but the REMCO were satisfied that the positioning was appropriate against the benchmark groups following the increases. Finally, the REMCO noted that the salary increases were broadly consistent with the increases provided to/uni00A0the general workforce in the key markets of the UK, USA, and Netherlands (average 2.4%).\n\nSinead Gorman's base salary will be set at \u00a3900,000 on appointment as CFO, effective April 1, 2022.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nTo ensure that the scorecard remains well aligned with our strategic and operational priorities, the REMCO has reviewed the structure of the 2022 scorecard. The REMCO will continue to focus on four key areas: financial delivery, operational excellence, progress in the energy transition, and safety.\n\nCash flow from operations (CFFO) remains the measure we will use to judge financial delivery. CFFO reflects our ability to generate the cash necessary to fund investment in our future business and distributions to our/uni00A0shareholders.\n\nReflecting the ongoing importance of operational delivery, performance will be assessed on the basis of three measures:\n\n- \u25a0 project delivery excellence: our ability to successfully deliver large and/uni00A0complex projects remains essential, and we will continue measuring the delivery of material projects on time and to budget; and\n- \u25a0 asset management excellence: measures the availability of Upstream, midstream and Downstream facilities, each equally weighted, so we maintain a strong focus on operating assets to plan, delivering scheduled downtime activities on time and minimising unscheduled shutdowns;\n- \u25a0 customer excellence: Powering Progress emphasises the importance of our customer relationships, and from the start of 2022 we will measure performance in this area using scores for customer satisfaction and brand preference.\n\nSucceeding in the energy transition and accelerating our transition to net-zero emissions means updating our business models and changing what we sell./uni00A0From the start of 2022, we will reflect these ambitions in the progress in the energy transition section of the scorecard, using three measures:\n\n- \u25a0 selling lower-carbon products - based on the share of earnings from our marketing business that can be attributed to low- and no-carbon products;\n- \u25a0 partnering to decarbonise - measured against progress towards an annual target for the global number of EV charging points.\n- \u25a0 reducing our emissions - an absolute emissions reduction target; and\n\nOur commitment to safety remains at the heart of everything we do. The/uni00A0measures relating to safety are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 process safety: based on the number of Tier 1 and 2 operational safety/uni00A0incidents.\n- \u25a0 personal safety: Serious Injury and Fatality Frequency (SIF-F), which ensures we focus our attention and learning on those incidents with the/uni00A0potential to cause the most serious harm; and\n\nThe performance measures, weightings and link to strategy for the 2022 performance/uni00A0year are/uni00A0set out below:\n\n## 2022 annual bonus scorecard measures and weightings\n\n| Performance measure                                                                   | Weighting                                                                                                                                                                                    | Weighting   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial                                                                             | 35%                                                                                                                                                                                          |             |\n| Operational excellence                                                                | 35%                                                                                                                                                                                          |             |\n| Progress in the energy transition                                                     | 15%                                                                                                                                                                                          |             |\n| Safety                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                              | 15%         |\n| Financial \u25a0 Cash flow from  operating activities                                      | Link to strategy  Aligned with our financial priorities,  reflecting our ability to generate cash to  service and reduce debt, pay dividends                                                 |             |\n| Progress in the  energy/uni00A0transition \u25a0                                           | These measures focus on the business  of Powering Progress.                                                                                                                                  |             |\n| Selling lower-carbon products  \u25a0 Reducing our emissions \u25a0 Partnering to decarbonise   |                                                                                                                                                                                              |             |\n| Safety \u25a0 Serious Injury and  Fatality/uni00A0Frequency  \u25a0 Tier 1 and 2 process safety | transformations necessary to succeed in the  energy transition and deliver the ambitions  These metrics are designed to ensure  an/uni00A0ongoing focus on personal and  operational safety. |             |\n\nAnnual bonus scorecard targets are not disclosed prospectively because/uni00A0to do so in a meaningful manner would require the disclosure of/uni00A0commercially sensitive information.

The award had a face value of 300% (maximum performance outcome 600%) of the base salary for the CEO and 270% (maximum performance outcome 540%) of the base salary for the/uni00A0CFO, excluding potential share price appreciation and dividends.\n\nFor LTIP awards made in 2022, performance will be assessed over a three-year period based on four financial measures and an energy transition condition, each equally weighted.",

These targets are considered commercially sensitive and will be disclosed retrospectively, with annual updates on progress.\n\nFor the energy transition performance condition, the NCI target range for the 2022-2024 LTIP grant is set as a 9-12% reduction from the 2016 NCF of 79 grams of CO/uni2082 equivalent per megajoule. For the leading indicators, we will assess performance according to three sets of measures:\n\n- \u25a0 offering more lower-carbon energy products; and\n- \u25a0 establishing the foundations of a material Power business;\n- \u25a0 developing emissions sinks.\n\nThe targets for these leading energy transition measures are commercially sensitive, and will be disclosed retrospectively where possible.

Instead, he was offered participation in the UK Shell Pension Plan. This is the same pension arrangement as offered to all new employees in the UK. It is a defined contribution pension scheme which provides an employer contribution of up to 20% of salary. Sinead Gorman was also offered participation in the same plan. Employees who may potentially exceed the UK fiscal limits on pension contribution (the annual allowance and/or the lifetime allowance) may voluntarily opt to receive a cash allowance in lieu of a contribution to the pension plan at the same rate. Ben van Beurden and Sinead Gorman have both chosen to receive a cash allowance.\n\nJessica Uhl's US retirement benefit arrangements include the Shell Pension Plan, a defined benefit plan, and a defined contribution plan with an employer contribution of 10% of salary. She also has a deferred Dutch defined benefit pension plan, as a result of a prior Shell assignment on local Dutch terms and conditions.\n\n## Further details of Executive Director pension arrangements can be found/uni00A0on page 178.\n\n## Benefits\n\nIn line with our Group-wide international mobility policies, the CEO and CFO will receive support with temporary commuting costs such as travel and accommodation for up-to six months from their date of relocation to/uni00A0the UK while their families remain in the Netherlands to complete their respective school years. The CEO will receive relocation benefits for his family's move to the UK in due course, and he will also receive a gross housing allowance for a time-limited period of 24 months from when their/uni00A0families relocate.\n\nExecutive Directors are provided with a chauffeured car for business travel, including home to office commuting. Other benefits, such as medical and other risk-benefits are in-line with those provided to the general workforce (including in some cases benefits provided to employees working outside their home country).",

This is the first increase since 2015 and recognises the positioning of the fee relative to other major FTSE and European companies. The Chair of the Board does not receive any additional fee for chairing the Nomination and Succession Committee or/uni00A0attending any other Board committee meeting.\n\nThe Non-executive Directors receive a basic fee. There are additional fees/uni00A0for the Senior Independent Director, a Board committee chair or a Board committee member. Non-executive Directors receive an additional fee of \u00a34,000 for most Board meetings involving intercontinental travel. Business expenses (including transport between home and office and occasional business-required partner travel) and associated tax are paid/uni00A0or reimbursed by Shell.\n\nThe Board reviews Non-executive Directors' fees periodically to ensure that they are aligned with those of other major listed companies. During these reviews the Board uses the/uni00A0largest 30 companies by market capitalisation listed on the FTSE and the European comparator group as/uni00A0its primary points of reference. The last general review was in 2021. Other than the adjustment to the Chair's fee, fees will remain unchanged for 2022. Following the relocation of Shell's headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK, Non-executive directors fees have been converted from euros to pounds sterling, using the average EUR/GBP exchange rate for 2020 (this rate was chosen as the data used by the Board to review the competitive positioning was largely sourced from 2020 pay disclosures), rounded downwards to the nearest \u00a31,000.\n\nNon-executive Directors receive an additional fee of \u00a34,000 for any Board meeting involving intercontinental travel - except for one meeting a year held in/uni00A0a location other than London.",

This consistency builds a culture of alignment with Shell's purpose and a common approach to sharing in Shell's success;\n- \u25a0 Long-term creation of shareholder value: Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in/uni00A0Shell;\n- \u25a0 Compliance: decisions should be made in the context of the Shell General Business Principles and Code of Conduct. The REMCO also\n\nRemuneration\n\n- seeks to ensure compliance with applicable laws and corporate governance requirements when designing and implementing policies/uni00A0and plans; and\n- \u25a0 Risk assessment: the remuneration structures and rewards should meet/uni00A0risk-assessment tests to ensure that shareholder's interests are/uni00A0safeguarded and that inappropriate actions are avoided.\n\nThe Executive Directors' remuneration structure is made up of a fixed element of basic pay and two variable elements: the annual bonus (50% delivered in shares) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Variable pay outcomes are conditional on the successful execution of the operating plan/uni00A0in the short term and the delivery of strategic goals and financial outperformance over the longer term. The award of shares under the bonus and LTIP, along with significant shareholding requirements, are intended to/uni00A0ensure executives have a sizeable shareholding in Royal Dutch Shell plc (the Company) and experience the same outcomes as shareholders.\n\nDuring 2018 and 2019, the REMCO reviewed the Remuneration Policy to/uni00A0ensure that the Policy continues to be aligned with Shell's strategy, including delivery of shareholder returns. REMCO determined that while the current policy remains appropriate in many respects, certain changes will support the REMCO to simplify remuneration structures and address the management of quantum. For each area of the policy, the REMCO has considered market practice, the corporate governance environment and feedback from shareholders. The Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) has provided input to the development of the sustainable development and energy transition metrics. Any potential conflict of interest is mitigated by the independence of the REMCO members and the REMCO Terms of Reference.\n\nA summary of the main changes to the Policy for the Executive Directors is/uni00A0outlined below. No significant changes were made to the Policy for/uni00A0Non-executive Directors.\n\n| element                          | Proposed Changes to Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Rationale for the change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annual Bonus                     | \u25a0 Reduction of the CEO's target bonus from 150% to 125%;

The last review took place in 2019 in preparation for the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy vote. No changes to the comparator group are proposed.\n\nThe other oil majors are included in the comparator group as these represent our closest direct competitors operating in similar market conditions. The Europe-based companies are selected based on their size,/uni00A0complexity and global reach. The REMCO uses benchmark data from these companies only as a guide to the competitiveness of the remuneration packages. We do not seek to position our remuneration at/uni00A0any defined point against the benchmarked positions.\n\nThe REMCO retains the right to alter the comparator group as it sees fit in/uni00A0order to ensure it remains an appropriate and relevant benchmark.\n\n## 2020 European comparator group\n\n| Allianz      | Daimler         | Rio Tinto   |\n|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| AstraZeneca  | Diageo          | Roche       |\n| BAT          | GlaxoSmithKline | Siemens     |\n| Bayer        | Nestle          | Unilever    |\n| BHP Billiton | Novartis        | Vodafone    |\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits for Executive Directors deemed taxable in the UK are included as/uni00A0taxable benefits in the single total figure of remuneration table. These elements may include transport to and from home and office, the provision of home security, and occasional business-required partner travel, which are generally considered legitimate business expenses rather than components of remuneration.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nFor the 2020 performance year, the scorecard framework will consist of cash flow from operating activities (30% weight), operational excellence (50% weight) and sustainable development (20% weight). Targets are derived from the annual business plan. These measures are designed to drive focus on the financial and operational performance critical to our success as a world-class investment case and to maintain a strong licence to operate, underpinned by our commitment to safety and journey to thrive in the energy transition. The REMCO believes it is important for annual variable pay to remain balanced, with operational and environmental components, complementing the LTIP's focus on longer-term financial and strategic outcomes. The same annual bonus scorecard applies to the majority of group employees, supporting consistency of/uni00A0remuneration and alignment of objective across employees and senior/uni00A0management.\n\nFor future years, the specific measures and weightings for the annual bonus scorecard will be reviewed annually by the REMCO and adjusted accordingly to evolve with Shell's strategy and circumstances. The annual review will also consider the scorecard target and outcome history over a/uni00A0decade to ensure that the targets set remain stretching but realistic.\n\nThe REMCO retains the right to exercise its judgement to adjust the mathematical bonus scorecard outcome to ensure that the bonus scorecard outcome for Executive Directors reflects other aspects of Shell's performance which the REMCO deems appropriate for the reported year.\n\n## Annual bonus - time horizon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term Incentive Plan\n\nThe LTIP rewards longer-term performance linked to Shell's strategy, which includes cash generation, capital discipline, value created for shareholders as well as progress towards meeting our ambition to thrive in the energy transition.\n\nFor 2020, the absolute measures will be FCF and energy transition, and/uni00A0relative growth compared with our peers will be based on: TSR, ROACE and CFFO. The relative measures, which focus on outperforming our closest competitors on key financial metrics, are supported by the absolute FCF metric which provides cash to service and repay debt, make shareholder distributions and fund capital investment. These are aligned with our strategic ambition to be a world-class investment case, and are supported by an energy transition measure focused on thriving in the energy transition and delivering our NCF target.\n\nFor the relative measures, 200% vests for first position, 150% for second, 80% for third and 0% for ranking fourth or fifth. The comparator group consists of four of the strongest companies in our industry (BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Total). Outperforming Shell's closest competitors on/uni00A0key/uni00A0financial metrics is challenging. A vesting outcome of 80% for median performance (40% of maximum) in a small comparator group is/uni00A0considered appropriate by the REMCO. The REMCO is aware that vesting for median performance is generally set at a limit of 25% of/uni00A0maximum for other UK companies. However, these are typically applied against a larger comparator group.\n\nThe REMCO will regularly review the measures, weightings and comparator group, and retains the right to adjust these to ensure that the LTIP continues to serve its intended purpose with a stretching level of challenge. If the REMCO was to propose any material changes to the LTIP/uni00A0performance metrics, it would consult with major shareholders.\n\n## TSR underpin\n\nIf the TSR ranking is fourth or fifth, the level of the award that can vest on the basis of the other measures will be capped at 50% of the maximum payout for the LTIP.\n\nThe detailed weightings and metrics applicable to the 2021 bonus scorecard are set out on page 174.\n\nThe detailed weightings and metrics applicable to the 2021 grant are set out on page 178.",

        "page_content": "## Performance Period\n\nLTIP performance is assessed over a three-year period. Vested shares from/uni00A0the LTIP are subject to a further three-year holding period postvesting. This holding period commences on the date of vesting and remains in force beyond an Executive Director's tenure. This time horizon is/uni00A0deemed to be suitable for incentive purposes but is recognised as short relative to some of Shell's operations. However, the REMCO believes that it provides for broad alignment with shareholder interests when coupled with significant shareholding requirements.\n\n## LTIP time horizon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Discretion, malus and clawback\n\nVariable pay awards may be made subject to adjustment events. At the discretion of REMCO, such an award may be adjusted before delivery (malus) or reclaimed after delivery (clawback) if an adjustment event occurs.\n\nAdjustment events will be specified in award documentation and it is intended that they will, for example, relate to restatement of financial statements due to material non-compliance with a financial reporting requirement; misconduct by an Executive Director or misconduct through their direction or non-direction; any material breach of health and safety or environment regulations; serious reputational damage to Shell; material failure of risk management; corporate failure; or other exceptional events as determined at the discretion of the REMCO. The REMCO retains the right to alter the list of adjustment events in respect of future awards.\n\nIn addition, the REMCO retains the discretion to adjust mathematical outcomes if and to the extent that it considers this appropriate. This power to adjust the outcomes is broad and includes adjusting the outcomes to zero. For example, an adjustment might be made if the REMCO considers:\n\n- \u25a0 The LTIP vesting percentage is not appropriate in the context of circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at award; and\n- \u25a0 The mathematical outcomes do not reflect the wider financial or non-financial performance of RDS or the participant over the performance period;\n- \u25a0 There is any other reason why an adjustment is appropriate.\n\nIt is not anticipated that discretion would be used for upwards adjustment. If, in exceptional circumstances, it was considered, this would be done only after consultation with major shareholders.\n\nPerformance outcomes and/or share price appreciation make it difficult to/uni00A0predict the final amounts delivered under the LTIP at the time of award. In years where the vesting outcome makes the total remuneration inappropriate for any Executive Director, the REMCO will consider an adjustment to the annual bonus outcome or the LTIP vesting outcome for/uni00A0the purposes of managing remuneration quantum. In making any adjustment to the annual bonus or LTIP vesting outcome for this purpose REMCO will consider the overall level of remuneration for the Executive Director, the operation of the annual bonus, the operation of the LTIP, the wider performance of Shell over the performance periods, as well as the internal context for other employees.\n\nAn explanation of any discretionary adjustment would be set out in the relevant Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## Treatment of outstanding awards\n\nAwards granted prior to the approval and implementation of this Policy and/or prior to an individual becoming an Executive Director will continue to vest and be delivered in accordance with the terms of the original award even if this is not consistent with the terms of this Policy.\n\nAs at March 10, 2020, this applies to Executive Directors Ben van Beurden and Jessica Uhl who each have outstanding awards under the LTIP.\n\n## Shareholding\n\nThe REMCO believes significant shareholding by Executive Directors is an/uni00A0important way of ensuring that shareholders and Executive Directors share the same priorities. Shareholding is one of Shell's core remuneration principles as it creates a balanced connection between individual wealth and Shell's long-term performance. This will support effective governance and an ownership mindset. Significant shareholding requirements reflect the performance timescales of Shell and are aligned with absolute shareholder return.\n\nThe CEO is expected to build up a shareholding of seven times their base salary over five years from appointment. The CFO is expected to build up a shareholding of five times their base salary over the same period. In the event of an increase to the guideline multiple of salary, for every additional multiple of salary required, the director will have one extra year to reach the increased guideline, subject to a maximum of five years from the date of the change.\n\nExecutive Directors will be required to maintain their shareholding requirement (or their existing shareholding if less than the guideline) for/uni00A0a/uni00A0period of two years post-employment.\n\nThe holding periods for LTIP vested shares and shares delivered as part of/uni00A0the annual bonus continue to apply after Executive Directors leave employment.\n\n## Differences for Executive Directors from other employees\n\nThe remuneration structure and approach to setting remuneration levels is consistent across Shell, with consideration given to location, seniority and responsibilities. However, a higher proportion of total remuneration is tied to variable pay for Executive Directors and members of Senior Management.\n\nThe salary for each Executive Director is determined based on the indicators in the 'Executive Directors' remuneration policy table', which reflect the international nature of the Executive Directors' labour market. The salary for other employees is normally set on a country basis.",

The provisions which are not/uni00A0generally available for other employees are described in 'Benefits'.\n\nThe methodology used for determining the annual bonus for Executive Directors is broadly consistent with the approach for Shell employees generally. However, bonuses for the majority of Shell employees are determined taking into account individual and business performance, whereas bonuses for Executive Directors are based solely on business performance. Although the makeup and weightings scorecard used for the majority of Shell employees is currently aligned with the scorecard, these scorecards may differ if required to support the achievement of business objectives. All Executive Directors and Executive Committee members receive 50% of their annual bonus in shares, which are subject/uni00A0to/uni00A0a three-year holding period.\n\nExecutive Directors are not eligible to receive new awards under employee share plans other than the LTIP, although awards previously granted will continue to vest in accordance with the terms of the original award. Selected employees participate in the Performance Share Plan (PSP). The operation of the PSP is similar to the LTIP, but currently differs, for/uni00A0example, in some performance measures and their relative weightings. As at March 2020, around 51,000 employees participate in one or more of Shell's global share plans and/or incentive plans, further supporting alignment with shareholder interests.\n\nExecutive Directors' retirement benefits are maintained in line with those of/uni00A0the wider workforce in their base country.\n\n## Illustration of potential remuneration outcomes\n\nThe charts on this page represent estimates under four performance scenarios ('Minimum', 'On-target', 'Maximum' and 'Maximum, assuming a 50% share price appreciation between award and vest') of/uni00A0the potential remuneration outcomes for each Executive Director resulting from the application of 2020 base salaries to awards made in accordance with the proposed Policy. The majority of Executive Directors' remuneration is delivered through variable pay elements, which are conditional on the achievement of stretching targets.\n\nThe REMCO will review the formulaic Single Figure outcome relative to the/uni00A0quality of performance outcomes and adjust these, taking into account Shell's performance, shareholder experience, the operation of the remuneration structures and any other relevant factors, to ensure that the highest variable pay outcomes are only achieved in years with the highest quality performance.\n\nThe scenario charts are based on future Policy award levels and are combined with projected single total figures of remuneration. The pay scenarios are forward-looking and only serve to illustrate the future Policy. For simplicity, the minimum, on-target and maximum scenarios assume no share price movement and exclude dividend accrual, for the portion of the bonus paid in shares and the LTIP, although dividend accrual during the performance and holding period applies. The scenarios are based on the current CEO (Ben van Beurden) and CFO (Jessica Uhl) roles.\n\n## Performance scenarios\n\n|                         | Minimum   | Target   | Maximum[A]   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------|\n| Base salary (2020)      |           |          |              |\n| Benefits (2019 actual)  |           |          |              |\n| Pension (2020 estimate) |           |          |              |\n| Bonus                   | NIL       | 125% CEO | 250% CEO     |\n| Bonus                   |           | 120% CFO | 240% CFO     |\n| LTIP                    | NIL       | 300% CEO | 600% CEO     |\n| LTIP                    |           | 270% CFO | 540% CFO     |\n\n[A] Maximum assuming 50% share price appreciation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recruitment\n\nThe REMCO determines the remuneration package for new Executive Director appointments. These appointments may involve external or internal recruitment or reflect a change in role of a current Executive Director.\n\nWhen determining remuneration packages for new Executive Directors, the REMCO will seek a balanced outcome which allows Shell to:\n\n- \u25a0 take into account the individual's current remuneration package and/uni00A0other contractual entitlements;\n- \u25a0 attract and motivate candidates of the right quality;\n- \u25a0 seek a competitive pay position relative to our comparator group, without overpaying;\n- \u25a0 honour entitlements (for example, variable remuneration) of internal candidates before their promotion to the Board.

Executive Directors with the Netherlands as their base country will be employed on the basis of a contract of employment governed by Dutch employment law. For Executive Directors with a base country other than the Netherlands, REMCO will determine their employment arrangements based on a number of considerations, including Dutch immigration requirements and base country retirement benefits. Executive Directors' employment arrangements are available for inspection at the AGM or/uni00A0on/uni00A0request. For further details on appointment and re-appointment of/uni00A0Directors, see the 'Governance Framework' on page 135 and 'Other/uni00A0Regulatory and Statutory Information' on page 205.\n\n## End of employment Notice period\n\nEmployment arrangements of Executive Directors can generally end by either the employee or the employer providing one month's notice, or the/uni00A0applicable statutory notice period. For example, under Dutch law, the/uni00A0statutory notice period for the employer will vary in line with the length of/uni00A0service, with the maximum being four months' notice. Under Dutch law,/uni00A0termination payments are not linked to the contract's notice period.\n\n## The Netherlands statutory end-of-employment compensation\n\nWith effect from July 1, 2015, employment legislation in the Netherlands introduced statutory end-of-employment compensation. Under this legislation, every termination (other than following retirement or for cause)/uni00A0of a Dutch employment contract that has continued for a minimum of two years will give rise to an obligation to pay the departing employee transition compensation ('transitievergoeding'). The statutory compensation is capped at one times the annual salary, which is deemed to include variable pay such as the annual bonus. Executive Directors are expected not to claim transition compensation or any other applicable statutory compensation over and above the agreed compensation for loss/uni00A0of office as set out in the 'End of employment' table on page 196.\n\n## Outstanding entitlements\n\nIn cases of resignation or dismissal for cause, fixed remuneration (base salary, benefits, and employer pension contributions) will cease on the last/uni00A0day of employment, variable remuneration elements will generally lapse and the Executive Director is not eligible for compensation for loss/uni00A0of/uni00A0office.\n\nThe information, on page 196, generally applies to termination of employment by Shell giving notice, by mutual agreement, or in situations where the employment terminates because of retirement with Shell consent at a date other than the normal retirement date, redundancy or/uni00A0in/uni00A0other similar circumstances at the REMCO's discretion.",

        "page_content": "## Non-executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nNEDs, including the Chair, have letters of appointment. NEDs' letters of/uni00A0appointment are available for inspection at the AGM or on request. For/uni00A0further details on appointment and re-appointment of Directors, see/uni00A0the 'Governance Framework' on page 135 and 'Other Regulatory/uni00A0and/uni00A0Statutory Information' on page 205.\n\n## Non-executive Director recruitment\n\nThe REMCO's approach to setting the remuneration package for NEDs is to offer fee levels and specific benefits (where appropriate) in line with the 'Non-executive Directors' remuneration policy table' and subject to the Articles of Association. NEDs are not offered variable remuneration or retention awards.\n\nWhen determining the benefits for a new Chair, the individual circumstances of the future Chair will be taken into account.\n\n## Non-executive Director termination of office\n\nNo payments for loss of office will be made to NEDs.\n\n## Consideration of overall pay and employment conditions\n\nWhen setting the Policy, no specific employee groups were consulted. However, Shell seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employee representative bodies as part of its employee engagement performance as required.\n\nWhen determining Executive Directors' remuneration structure and outcomes, the REMCO reviews a set of information, including relevant reference points and trends, which includes internal data on employee remuneration (for example, employee relations matters in respect of remuneration and average salary increases applying in the Netherlands, UK and the USA). During the Policy review, pay and employment conditions of the wider Shell employee population were taken into account by adhering to the same performance, rewards and benefits philosophy for the Executive Directors, as well as overall benchmarking principles. Furthermore, any potential differences from other employees (see 'Differences for Executive Directors from other employees') were taken into account when providing the REMCO with advice in the formation of this Policy.\n\nDialogue between management and employees is important, with the/uni00A0annual Shell People Survey being one of the principal means of gathering employee views on a range of matters. The Shell People Survey includes questions inviting employees' views on their pay and benefit arrangements. Shell also encourages share ownership among employees, and many are shareholders who are able to participate in the vote on the/uni00A0Policy at the AGM.\n\nThe REMCO is kept informed by the CEO, the Chief Human Resources &/uni00A0Corporate Officer and the Executive Vice President Remuneration and HR Operations on the bonus scorecard and any relevant remuneration matters affecting other senior executives, extending to multiple levels below the Board and Executive Committee.\n\n## Consideration of shareholder views\n\nThe REMCO engages with major shareholders on a regular basis throughout the year and this allows it to hear views on Shell's remuneration approach and test proposals when developing or evolving the Policy. Recent examples of the REMCO responding to shareholder views include: considering the quantum of executive pay and the use of/uni00A0alternative reward structures; introducing the Energy Transition metric to/uni00A0the LTIP in line with our strategic ambitions; removing the individual performance modifier from the calculation of annual bonus outcomes to/uni00A0make remuneration structures simpler and more transparent to shareholders; reducing the CEO's target bonus from 150% to 125%; reducing the CEO's LTIP grant; and enabling the broader use of discretion/uni00A0to manage remuneration outcomes.\n\nThe REMCO will review the Policy regularly to ensure it continues to reinforce Shell's long-term strategy and remains closely aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\n## Additional policy statement\n\nThe REMCO reserves the right to make payments outside the Policy in/uni00A0limited exceptional circumstances, such as for regulatory, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation or/uni00A0exchange controls, and only where the REMCO considers such payments are necessary to give effect to the intent of the Policy.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board\n\n/s/ Linda M.

The standards include those relating to human rights, labour practices and business integrity and are governed by the Shell Supplier Principles. Monitoring is undertaken centrally in connection with the preparation of the Shell Group's Modern Slavery Act (MSA) Statement which is prepared by taking proposed inputs from Shell companies in scope of the MSA as to their steps taken to ensure modern slavery does not occur in their supply chain or organisation. The Shell Group Statement is approved by the Board of Shell plc, after approval by/uni00A0the boards of Shell companies which are in scope of the MSA.\n\n## DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS\n\nIn accordance with section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this Report confirms that, so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware.

The Board may choose to return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. When setting the level of shareholder remuneration, the Board looks at a range of factors, including the macro environment, the underlying business earnings and cash flow of the Shell Group, the/uni00A0current balance sheet, future investment and divestment plans, and/uni00A0existing commitments.\n\nInterim dividends are currently declared by the Board and paid on a quarterly basis. Shell does not currently pay a 'final' dividend, which would need to be voted on by shareholders, requiring the introduction of/uni00A0a/uni00A0resolution at the AGM. This would delay the payment of the fourth quarter dividend (currently paid in late March) until after the AGM, which is towards the end of May, a delay of around seven weeks. Our approach to dividend payments is not uncommon for companies distributing returns to shareholders on a quarterly basis.\n\nShell pays its dividend in USD, EUR or GBP fully electronically either in/uni00A0CREST or via interbank transfers.\n\nThe Directors have announced a fourth quarter interim dividend payable on March 28, 2022, to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on February 18, 2022. The closing date for dividend currency elections was March 4, 2022 [A] and the euro and sterling equivalents announcement date is March 14, 2022.\n\n- [A]  A different dividend currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Such shareholders can contact their broker, financial intermediary, bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.\n\n## 2021 VIABILITY STATEMENT AND GOING CONCERN STATEMENT\n\nThe 'Strategic Report' includes information about Shell's strategy, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, as well as the factors, including the principal risks, likely to affect Shell's future development. It also describes Shell's business model, including competitive advantages and key strengths. The Directors assess Shell's prospects both at an operating and strategic level, each involving different time horizons. To/uni00A0this/uni00A0end, the Directors assess Shell's portfolio and strategy against a/uni00A0wide range of outlooks, including assessing the potential impacts of various possible energy transition pathways and scenarios for changes in societal expectations in relation to climate change. Shell recognises in its strategy that the world is transitioning to a lower-carbon energy system (see 'Climate change and energy transition').\n\nThe Risk Factors section (see page 22-33) provides an overview of the principal risks Shell is exposed to in its operations. We have assessed which scenarios linked to the principal risks could lead to a severe but possible outcome. Consideration was given to the climate change and energy transition risk, however the associated material impacts are of a/uni00A0longer-term nature, outside the three-year viability statement period. Therefore, it was not assessed as a stress case scenario for the viability statement. However, it is worth noting that key assumptions that underpin the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, such as future oil and gas prices, discount rates, future costs of decommissioning and restoration, and tax rates, all go well beyond 3 years and do take climate change and energy transition into account.\n\nWe have also assessed the impact of the announcement of Shell's intention to exit its ventures in Russia with Gazprom and related entities,\n\nas/uni00A0well as end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (for more details see Note 32 on page 283). We concluded that these events are covered by the scenario on 'unplanned shutdown of major cashgenerating asset' for viability statement assessment purposes.\n\n## Viability Statement Process\n\nThroughout the year, the Board received regular updates on the financial framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board approved the detailed three-year operating plan which includes Shell's cash flows and ability to service financing requirements [A]\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe identified and modelled five severe but possible scenarios that could potentially impact Shell's viability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe assessed and concluded on the long-term viability of the Company (we have deemed a three-year period of assessment to be appropriate)\n\n[A]  Shell's three-year operating plan contains assumptions in relation to internal and external parameters, including recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the key assumptions include the impact of commodity prices, exchange rates, future carbon costs, agreements like LNG contract renewals, production levels and product demand and schedules of growth programmes.\n\n## SCENARIOS AND RISKS\n\n| Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                         | Link to  principal risks   | Severity of  Impact   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Unplanned shutdown of a major cash-generating  asset (for the viability statement period i.e.  three/uni00A0years)                                                                               | [A]                        | Low                   |\n| A low oil and gas price environment (Brent at  2022: $50, 2023: $50, 2024: $50)                                                                                                                  | [B] and [D]                | Medium                |\n| A significant HSSE event                                                                                                                                                                         | [A]                        | Medium                |\n| Global macroeconomic uncertainties (including  those from a pandemic) - low oil and gas price  environment, negative impact on oil product and  chemical margins, and long-term demand reduction | [B], [C] and [D]           | Medium                |\n| A significant HSSE event and a low oil and gas  price environment                                                                                                                                | [A], [B] and [D]           | Higher                |\n\n- A.

This assessment confirmed that Shell has adequate cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due in order to continue its operations during the going concern period. Therefore, the Directors consider it appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION STATEMENT\n\nThe Non-Financial Information Statement below forms part of the Strategic Report on pages 2-119.\n\n## Non-Financial Information Statement\n\n| Reporting requirement                     | Where to read more in this Report                              | Page    |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Business Model                            | Shell Powering Progress                                        | 6       |\n| Non-financial KPIs                        | Performance indicators                                         | 36      |\n| Environmental matters                     | Environment and society, Climate  change and energy transition | 99      |\n|                                           |                                                                | 75      |\n| Employees                                 | Our people and Directors' Report                               | 114 131 |\n| Social matters                            | Environment and society                                        | 99      |\n| Respect for human rights                  | Environment and society                                        | 99      |\n| Anti-corruption and  anti-bribery matters | Our people                                                     | 114     |\n\n## REPURCHASES OF SHARES\n\nAs announced on July 7, 2021, Shell will target the distribution of 20-30% of its cash flow from operations to shareholders. The Board may choose to return cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. As part of this financial framework, Shell announced the distribution of $2 billion worth of capital to shareholders via share buybacks on July 29, 2021, which were completed on November 19, 2021.\n\nIn addition, Shell announced on September 20, 2021, that after the Shell Group's divestment of the Permian assets, it would distribute $7 billion worth of capital to shareholders. This was subsequently confirmed to be via share buybacks and at pace. The first tranche of up to $1.5 billion was announced on December 2, 2021, and completed on January 28, 2022. On February 3, 2022, Shell announced an additional buyback programme of $8.5 billion, comprising the additional $5.5 billion of Permian divestment proceeds and $3.0 billion as part of the Company's capital allocation framework. In the first tranche of this programme the Company has entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement for the purchase of up to $4.0 billion of/uni00A0shares in the period up to and including May 4, 2022.\n\nTo ensure that the Company had the necessary authority to continue to buy back its shares when the time is considered appropriate, at the 2021 AGM, shareholders granted an authority for the Company to repurchase up to a maximum of 780 million of its shares (excluding purchases for employee share plans). This authority expires on the earlier of the close\n\nof/uni00A0business on August 18, 2022, or the end of the 2022 AGM. This means that, as at close of February 21, 2022, 589 million further shares could still/uni00A0be repurchased under the current AGM authority.\n\nThe Board continues to regard the ability to repurchase issued shares in/uni00A0suitable circumstances as an important part of Shell's financial management. A new resolution will be proposed at the 2022 AGM to/uni00A0renew the authority for the Company to purchase its own share capital, up to specified limits, for a further year. This proposal will be described in more detail in the 2022 Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe names of the Directors who held office during the year can be found/uni00A0on pages 121-128. Information on the Directors who are seeking reappointment is included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.\n\n## SIMPLIFICATION\n\nAt a General Meeting, on December 10, 2021, the shareholders of the Company supported a resolution to amend Shell's Articles of Association (Articles) to enable the simplification of the Company. The simplification entailed establishing a single line of shares to eliminate the complexity of Shell's A/B share structure; and aligning the Company's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK; and consequently, changing the Company's name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to Shell plc.\n\nOn December 20, 2021, the Board decided to proceed with the simplification. The alignment of the Company's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK resulted in recognition in 2021 of a taxable deemed disposal gain fully offset by taxable losses in the Netherlands.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, at a Board meeting held in the UK the Board approved the key steps required to move the Company's tax residence to/uni00A0the UK.\n\nOn January 21, 2022, the Company changed its name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to Shell plc.\n\nOn January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through assimilation of each A share and each B share into one single line of/uni00A0ordinary shares of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on/uni00A0voting/uni00A0rights or dividend entitlements.\n\nAs stated in the Notice of Meeting and Circular and subsequent announcements, the Board believes that the simplification will strengthen Shell's competitiveness and accelerate both shareholder distributions and delivery of its strategy to become a net-zero emissions energy business.\n\n## QUALIFYING THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITIES\n\nThe Company has entered into a Deed of Indemnity (Deed) with each Director of the Company who served during the year. The terms of each of/uni00A0these Deeds are identical and they reflect the statutory provisions on indemnities contained in the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006). Under the terms of each Deed, the Company has agreed to indemnify the Director, to the fullest extent permitted by the CA 2006, against any loss, liability or/uni00A0damage, howsoever caused (including in respect of a Director's own negligence), suffered or incurred by a Director in respect of their acts or omissions while or in the course of acting as a Director or employee of the/uni00A0Company, any associated company or affiliate (within the meaning of/uni00A0the CA 2006). In addition, the Company shall lend funds to Directors as required to meet reasonable costs and expenses incurred or to be incurred by them in defending any criminal or civil proceedings brought against them in their capacity as a Director or employee of the Company, associated company or affiliate, or, in connection with certain applications brought under the CA 2006. The provisions in the Company's Articles relating to arbitration and exclusive jurisdiction are incorporated, mutatis mutandis, into the Deeds entered into by each Director and the Company.",

The Board has adopted a procedure to address these requirements. Detailed conflict of interest questionnaires are reviewed by the Board and, if considered appropriate, authorised. Conflicts of interest as well as any gifts and hospitality received by and provided by Directors are kept under review by the Board. Further information relating to conflicts of interest can be found in/uni00A0the Articles, available on the Shell website.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS OF THE CHAIR\n\nThe Chair's other significant commitments are given in his biography on/uni00A0page 121.\n\n## SHELL GENERAL BUSINESS PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Shell General Business Principles define how Shell subsidiaries are expected to conduct their affairs and are underpinned by the Shell core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people. These principles include, among other things, Shell's commitment to support fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business and to contribute to/uni00A0sustainable development. They are designed to mitigate the risk of damage to our business reputation and to prevent violations of local and/uni00A0international legislation. They can be found at www.shell.com/sgbp. See 'Risk factors' on pages 22-33.\n\n## SHELL CODE OF CONDUCT\n\nDirectors, officers, employees and contract staff are required to comply with the Shell Code of Conduct, which instructs them on how to behave in/uni00A0line with the Shell General Business Principles. This Code clarifies the basic rules and standards they are expected to follow and the behaviour expected of them. These individuals must also complete mandatory Code/uni00A0of Conduct training.\n\nDesignated individuals are required to complete additional mandatory training on antitrust and competition laws, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, financial crime, data protection laws and/uni00A0trade compliance requirements (see 'Risk factors' on page 22-33).

All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The Company has provided both indemnities and Directors' and officers' insurance to the Directors in connection with the performance of their responsibilities. Copies of these indemnities and the Directors' and officers' insurance policies are open to/uni00A0inspection. A copy of the form of these indemnities has been previously filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n## RESULTS PRESENTATIONS AND ANALYSTS' MEETINGS\n\nThe planned dates of the quarterly, half-yearly and annual results presentations, as well as all major analysts' meetings, are announced in/uni00A0advance on the Shell website and through a regulatory release.\n\nGenerally, presentations are broadcast live via webcast and teleconference. Other meetings with analysts or investors are not normally announced in advance, nor can they be followed remotely by webcast or any other means. Procedures are in place to ensure that discussions in such meetings are always limited to non-material information or information already in the public domain.\n\nResults and meeting presentations can be found at www.shell.com/investor. This is in line with the requirement to ensure that all shareholders and other parties in the financial market have equal and simultaneous access to information that may influence the price of the Company's securities.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS\n\nThe Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control, and for regularly reviewing its effectiveness.\n\nA single overall control framework exists for the Company and its subsidiaries. This is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of/uni00A0failure to achieve our business objectives. It provides reasonable, but/uni00A0not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe Control Framework (see diagram) encompasses the key components - 'foundation elements', 'management processes' and 'structural' that/uni00A0together establish the structure and context within which Shell companies operate. 'Foundation elements' consist of the principles and/uni00A0rules that underpin and establish boundaries for Shell activities. 'Management processes' define our critical processes. These include how/uni00A0strategy, planning and appraisal are used to improve performance and how risks are to be managed, such as through the application of effective controls and assurance. The 'structural' component defines the organisational structures and key governance principles that are applied to/uni00A0facilitate the/uni00A0achievement of the Shell Group's overall business objectives.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe 'Statement on Risk Management' is a foundation element of the Shell Control Framework and a key enabler of many of its management processes.\n\n## Risk identification\n\n- \u25a0 Strategic risks: we consider current and future portfolio issues, examining parameters such as country concentration or exposure to higher-risk countries. We also consider long-range developments in order to test key assumptions or beliefs in relation to energy markets.\n\nWe identify and define risks across the Shell Group from three distinct perspectives:\n\n- \u25a0 Operational risks: we consider material operational exposures across Shell's entire value chain which provide a more granular assessment of/uni00A0key risks facing the organisation.\n- \u25a0 Conduct and culture risks: we consider how our policies and practices/uni00A0align with our purpose, core values and desired mindset and/uni00A0behaviours.\n\n## CONTROL FRAMEWORK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- [A] The foundation elements of the Shell Control Framework define the/uni00A0principles that underpin the Shell Group's activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe management processes define activities critical to an effective control framework.\n\nThe structural component defines how businesses and functions facilitate achievement of the Shell Group's overall business objectives, while respecting the separate legal identity of the individual Shell companies that implement them.\n\nA foundation element of the Shell Control Framework and a key enabler of many of its management processes .\n\nThese perspectives help us to maintain a comprehensive view of the different types of risks we face and the different time horizons in which they may affect us.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nTo further understand the risks we face, we evaluate the impact and likelihood of each risk.\n\nWhen assessing the potential impact of a risk, we consider the possible financial consequences. We also look at more qualitative issues such as/uni00A0the impacts on our reputation, our ability to comply with external regulations and impacts on health, safety and the environment.\n\nWhen assessing the likelihood of a risk occurring, we consider several factors, such as the level of risk exposure, our ability to prevent the risk happening and whether the risk has materialised in the past.\n\nTo support risk assessments, we also seek to establish and articulate our/uni00A0risk appetite, which is the level of risk that we are willing to accept in/uni00A0pursuit of Shell's strategy and objectives. There are risks that Shell accepts, or does not seek to fully mitigate. The financial framework sets an/uni00A0overarching boundary condition for risk appetite. This is because Shell's financial resilience informs the aggregate level of risk appetite that/uni00A0could be sustained.",

        "page_content": "The impact and likelihood assessment, combined with risk appetite, determine the type of risk responses, such as controls and assurance activities, that may be required to manage each risk. The impact and likelihood assessments also help us to prioritise risks.\n\n## Risk response\n\nA key foundation of the Shell Control Framework is Shell's standards and manuals, including the Code of Conduct. These establish requirements and guidance that help management design and develop controls to manage risks consistently across the Group.\n\nShell's principal risks and the broad array of measures used to manage each risk are described on pages 22-33.\n\nDuring the year, management regularly reviews the principal risks and associated risk responses, implementing further remedial actions as appropriate. The Executive Committee and the Board regularly consider Group-level risks. They frame them in terms of strategic, operational or conduct and culture risks, and assess them alongside the relevant control mechanisms and risk responses. These periodic reviews are supplemented by dedicated reviews of specific risks, as needed.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to pay attention to our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its varied impacts (see 'Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic' on page 204).\n\n## Examples of how some principal risks are managed\n\nWe operate in more than 70 countries that have differing degrees of political, legal and economic stability. This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could cause changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. We and our joint arrangements and associates also face the risk of litigation and disputes worldwide (see 'Risk Factors' on page 22). We continually monitor geopolitical developments and societal issues relevant to our interests. Employees who engage with government officials are subject to specific training programmes, procedures and/uni00A0regular communications, as well as the Shell General Business Principles and Shell Code of Conduct. We are prepared to exit a/uni00A0country if we/uni00A0believe we can no longer operate there in accordance with our standards and applicable law, and we/uni00A0have/uni00A0done so in the past.\n\nMany of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint arrangements or with associates, which may reduce our level of control and ability to identify and manage risks (see 'Risk Factors' on page 22). In each case, Shell appoints a representative to manage its interests. This representative seeks to ensure that the projects operate under standards that are equivalent to Shell's for/uni00A0certain critical areas.\n\nClimate change and risks resulting from greenhouse gas emissions are significant risk factors for Shell. They are monitored, like other significant risks, by the Executive Committee and the Board. Shell/uni00A0has a climate change risk management structure which is supported by standards, policies and controls (see 'Risk factors' on/uni00A0page 22 and 'Climate change and energy transition' on/uni00A0pages/uni00A075).\n\nThe system of risk management and internal control over financial reporting is an integral part of the Shell Control Framework. Regular reviews are performed to identify the significant risks to financial reporting and the key/uni00A0controls designed to address them. These controls are documented, responsibility is assigned, and they are monitored for design and operating effectiveness. Controls found to be ineffective are remediated.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nManagement and the Board also consider emerging risks, defined as/uni00A0risks/uni00A0where the scope, impact and likelihood are still uncertain, but which/uni00A0could have a significant effect on achieving Shell's strategy and objectives in the future. These risks are identified through the monitoring of/uni00A0external developments, the status of risk indicators, learnings from incidents and assurance findings, and the appraisal of Shell's forwardlooking plans. Once identified, we undertake activities to monitor, prepare/uni00A0for and reduce the future impact, where possible, should such/uni00A0emerging risks materialise.\n\n## Board review of principal and emerging risks\n\nThe Board confirms it has carried out a robust assessment of Shell's principal risks, including a robust process for identifying, evaluating and managing Shell's principal risks. The Board also confirms it has carried out/uni00A0a robust assessment of Shell's emerging risks. These assessments have been in place throughout 2021 and up to the date of this Report, are regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the Financial Reporting Council guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting.\n\n## Review of the effectiveness of the system of/uni00A0risk/uni00A0management and internal control\n\nThe Board has delegated authority to the Audit Committee to assist it in/uni00A0fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control system, the integrity of/uni00A0financial reporting, and consideration of compliance matters (see/uni00A0'Audit Committee Report' on pages 153-165).\n\nThe Audit Committee receives regular reports from the Chief Internal Auditor on notable internal audits and those with a significant impact on the effectiveness of controls. The Committee reviews significant incidents involving financial, business and compliance controls and receives regular reports on business integrity issues. The Audit Committee also requests updates on specific financial, operational and compliance control issues throughout the year. The Audit Committee Chair provides an update to the Board after every Audit Committee meeting.\n\nDuring and after such sessions, the Board has the opportunity to request further information and ask clarifying questions. The Chairs of the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) and the Nigeria Special Litigation Committee, an ad hoc Board committee, provide regular updates after each of their meetings. These updates cover, among other matters, the respective aspects of controls that they monitor in accordance with their Terms of Reference. The Board receives the approved minutes of the Audit Committee and SESCo minutes. They are incorporated into the Board minutes so all Directors can read and review them. This helps the Board with its ongoing monitoring and annual review of material controls. The Board is also helped with its monitoring and review responsibilities by/uni00A0the reports of:\n\n- \u25a0 the Chief Internal Auditor;\n- \u25a0 the Executive Vice President Taxation and Controller;\n- \u25a0 the External Auditors;\n- \u25a0 the Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer;\n- \u25a0 the Chairs of the Disclosure Committee and the Financial Reporting Control Committee;\n- \u25a0 as well as summaries of the Annual Proved Reserves Disclosure.\n\nThe Executive Committee and the Audit Committee conduct an annual review of the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control. This is based on their own insights and experience during the year and the outcomes of the Group-level risk reviews and the Group Assurance Letter process. In the Group Assurance Letter process, each Executive Director conducts a structured internal assessment of compliance with legal/uni00A0and ethical requirements and the Shell Control Framework.",

The Board reviews and discusses the insights and conclusions from this annual assessment.\n\nThe Board confirms that it has conducted its annual review of the effectiveness of Shell's system of risk management and internal control in respect of 2021, and that this review covered all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls.\n\n## Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic\n\n- \u25a0 We took many steps to protect the health of our colleagues, including requiring or encouraging office-based staff to work from home, depending on the advice of local authorities. We provided support to ensure all our colleagues can work remotely each day. We maintained comprehensive return-to-site approaches for Shell's offices and these were reviewed and updated as necessary.\n\nAlthough recovery is under way in many parts of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect people's lives, government policies, markets and businesses. In 2020, Shell implemented a broad, structured response to the pandemic. This aimed to ensure we supported our colleagues, suppliers, customers and the communities where we work. It also sought to maintain resilience in our day-to-day operations and our overall financial framework. Many of these responses remained in place throughout 2021 and were embedded in/uni00A0our day-to-day operational activities. For example:\n\n- \u25a0 We continued to enforce social distancing at our offshore platforms and onshore facilities. We conducted health screening and implemented procedures to allow the safe evacuation of any suspected cases of COVID-19 from our offshore platforms or onshore/uni00A0facilities.\n- \u25a0 Management at all levels continued to engage with staff to understand and respond to the stresses placed on them by the pandemic. A confidential counselling service was made available\n- \u25a0 In our global network of retail service stations, we enforced social distancing and carry out deeper cleaning. We also used other protective measures, such as screens for till operators.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OF SHELL\n\nShell's CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of Shell's disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2021. Based on/uni00A0that/uni00A0evaluation, they concluded that Shell's disclosure controls and/uni00A0procedures are effective.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF SHELL\n\nManagement, including the CEO and CFO, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Shell's financial reporting and the preparation of the 'Consolidated Financial Statements'. It conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Shell's internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' based on the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of this evaluation, management concluded that, at December 31, 2021, the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the preparation of the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' was effective.\n\nto/uni00A0help colleagues experiencing the psychological impact of the pandemic. We provided extra online resources to help people manage their physical and mental well-being.\n\n- \u25a0 We accelerated the adoption of digital technology (including the use of drones and robots) to monitor offshore and manufacturing equipment remotely.\n- \u25a0 To sustain our operations and supply chains, which in turn support our suppliers and customers, we ensured business continuity plans were in place for all our businesses, functions and operating sites.\n- \u25a0 We strengthened our global web content filtering capability in response to the switch from office to remote working and added new/uni00A0measures to improve cyber-awareness.\n- \u25a0 Our country chair network addressed specific challenges that arose/uni00A0at local levels.\n- \u25a0 We continued to reiterate Shell's compliance rules (including the Code of Conduct) and the importance of adhering to them. The Crisis Management Standard was used to guide our operational risk/uni00A0responses.\n\nAs governments and society continue to adjust and recover from the pandemic, we monitor the changing external environment and emerging risks across Shell's entire operations. In this way, we seek to ensure we remain resilient and ready and able to respond to developments.\n\n- More detailed information about the impact of the pandemic on Shell's principal risks and our responses to these impacts is provided in 'Risk Factors' on pages 22-33.\n\n## THE TRUSTEE'S AND MANAGEMENT'S EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ROYAL DUTCH SHELL DIVIDEND ACCESS TRUST\n\nThe Trustee of the Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust (the Trustee) and Shell's CEO and CFO have evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures in respect of the Dividend Access Trust/uni00A0(the Trust) at December 31, 2021. On the basis of this evaluation, these officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust are effective.\n\n## THE TRUSTEE'S AND MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF/uni00A0THE/uni00A0ROYAL DUTCH SHELL DIVIDEND ACCESS TRUST\n\nThe Trustee and the Company's management are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over the Trust's financial reporting. The Trustee and the Company's management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. On the basis of this evaluation, the Trustee and management concluded that, at December 31, 2021, the Trust's internal control over financial reporting was effective.",

Material financial information of the Trust is included in the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and is therefore subject to the same disclosure controls and procedures as Shell. See the 'Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust Financial Statements' on pages 316-319 for additional information.\n\n## ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION\n\nThe Company's Articles were adopted on December 20, 2021. The Articles may only be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting. A full version of the Company's Articles can be found at www.shell.com/investors.\n\n## MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS\n\nThe Company has a single-tier Board of Directors headed by a Chair, with/uni00A0management led by a CEO. See 'The Board of Shell plc' on page/uni00A0121 and Senior Management on page 129.\n\n## DIRECTORS' SHAREHOLDING QUALIFICATION\n\nWhile the Articles do not require Directors to hold shares in the Company, the Remuneration Committee believes that Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in the Company. The CEO is expected to build up a shareholding of seven times base salary over five years from appointment and the CFO is expected to/uni00A0build up a shareholding of five times base salary over the same period./uni00A0In the event that another Executive Director joins the Board, the/uni00A0Remuneration Committee will determine their shareholding requirement, which will not be less than 200% of their base salary.\n\nExecutive Directors will be required to maintain their requirement (or existing shareholding if less than the guideline) for a period of two years post employment. Non-executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their fixed annual fee and to maintain that holding during their tenure. Information on the Directors with shares in/uni00A0the Company can be found in the 'Directors' Remuneration Report' on/uni00A0pages 166-170.\n\n## APPOINTMENT AND RETIREMENT OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe Company's Articles, the Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006 govern the appointment and retirement of Directors. Board membership and biographical details of the Directors are/uni00A0provided on pages 121 to 128. However, Directors follow the direction laid out in the Code and stand for re-election annually.\n\nOn May 18, 2021, following the conclusion of the AGM, Chad Holliday stepped down from the Board after more than 10 years' service as a Director, six years of which were as Chair of the Company. Sir Andrew Mackenzie succeeded him as Chair on the same day.\n\nOn May 19, 2021, Jane Holl Lute was appointed to the Board. On May 18, 2021, following the conclusion of the AGM, Sir Nigel Sheinwald stood/uni00A0down from the Board.\n\n## RIGHTS ATTACHING TO SHARES\n\nThe full rights attaching to shares are set out in the Company's Articles. The Company can issue shares with any rights or restrictions attached to/uni00A0them as long as this is not restricted by any rights attached to existing shares. These rights or restrictions can be decided either by an ordinary resolution passed by the shareholders or by the Board as long as there is/uni00A0no conflict with any resolution passed by the shareholders.\n\n## VOTING\n\nCurrently, the voting rights of each ordinary share carry one vote at a general meeting of the Company.\n\nThe sterling deferred shares are not ordinary shares and therefore have different rights and restrictions attached to them.\n\n## CHANGE OF CONTROL\n\nThere are no provisions in the Articles that would delay, defer or prevent a/uni00A0change of control.\n\n## DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE PREPARATION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS\n\n- \u25a0 adopt the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to do so;\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. These require the Directors to prepare financial statements for/uni00A0each financial year. As such, the Directors have prepared the (i) Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, and therefore in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards; and (ii) Parent Company Financial Statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of/uni00A0affairs of Shell and the Company and of the profit or loss of Shell and/uni00A0the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements,/uni00A0the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u25a0 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u25a0 state whether international accounting standards in conformity with the/uni00A0requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006, UK-adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB have been followed.\n- \u25a0 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and/uni00A0prudent; and\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of Shell and the Parent Company and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of Shell and the Parent Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) and, as regards the Consolidated Financial Statements, with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and therefore are in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of Shell and the Parent Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of/uni00A0fraud and other irregularities.\n\nce",

OUR OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements of Shell plc (the Parent Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, Shell or Group):\n\n## 1.1 Our unmodified opinion on the financial statements\n\n- \u25a0 give a true and fair view of the state of Shell's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at December 31, 2021 and of Shell's income and the Parent Company's income for the year then ended;\n- \u25a0 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n- \u25a0 have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); and\n\n## 1.2 What we have audited\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of Shell plc and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2021, which are included in the Annual Report and comprise:\n\n| Shell                                                                                                                          | Parent Company                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2021                                                                             | Balance Sheet as at December 31, 2021                            |\n| Consolidated Statement of Income for the year then ended                                                                       | Statement of Income for the year then ended                      |\n| Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended                                                         | Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year then ended        |\n| Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended                                                            | Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended           |\n| Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended                                                                   | Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended                  |\n| Related Notes 1 to 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, including  a/uni00A0summary of significant accounting policies | Related Notes 1 to 15 to the Parent Company Financial Statements |\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK adopted international accounting standards and/uni00A0IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\n## 2. BASIS FOR OUR OPINION\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISA (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## 3. INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe are independent of Shell and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company, with only one inconsequential exception and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit. This exception related to the provision of XBRL tagging services in May 2021 for local statutory 2020 accounts of an immaterial subsidiary in Denmark, which was subsequently disposed of in July 2021. The service was performed by EY Denmark and was less than two hours of work and no fees were charged. The provision of the service did not create a self-review threat as the subsidiary was immaterial, not part of the scope of the group audit and the individual who performed the service was not part of the audit engagement team. We informed the Audit Committee of the inadvertent breach in July 2021. We considered this to be a minor breach of the Ethical Standard and we consider that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would not conclude that our independence was/uni00A0impaired, and we remain independent of Shell and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## 4. CONCLUSIONS RELATING TO GOING CONCERN\n\n- \u25a0 we obtained an understanding of management's going concern evaluation process and the controls over management's evaluation. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. This included testing management's controls over the review and/uni00A0approval of the operating plan and the underlying economic assumptions that form the basis of management's assessment;\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and Parent Company are appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Shell Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following:\n\n- \u25a0 we checked the consistency of information used in management's assessment with the operating plan and information obtained through auditing other areas of the business. We also considered the reasonableness of the estimated financial impact of each of the severe but possible scenarios that were identified by management on page 199, and the possible mitigation steps and assumptions regarding the availability of future funding options, including credit lines, debt facilities, possible asset disposals, changing levels of shareholder returns, and the ability to raise future financing in/uni00A0line with the operating plan window. In checking the consistency of this information with the operating plan and information obtained through auditing other areas of the business, we challenged the central assumptions and sensitives applied. This included considering whether other scenarios/uni00A0should have been considered and the assumptions relating to climate change and the energy transition;\n- \u25a0 given that management's operating plan go beyond March 31, 2023 (the going concern period), we have considered events and conditions beyond/uni00A0the period of management's assessment and any potential implications of these on Shell's going concern assessment;",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 we verified that Shell's operating plan reflects the actions that management intend to take in order to achieve their stated Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions, as stated in Note 4 to the financial statements, including confirming that the operating and capital expenditure estimates to deliver the reductions are included in the operating plan;\n- \u25a0 we considered the likelihood of there being a material cash outflow as a result of the various climate change claims and allegations involving Shell, including the maturity of climate change litigation;\n- \u25a0 we tested the carbon price assumptions included in Shell's operating plan for 25 countries, including the 10 countries with the highest forecast Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, by comparing to a range of external carbon price assumptions. As a stress, we applied the stated IEA Net Zero Emissions carbon price assumptions;\n- \u25a0 we considered how Shell's intention to exit their equity partnerships held with Gazprom entities could impact Shell's going concern assessment; and\n- \u25a0 we conducted severe but plausible independent stress testing and a reverse stress test to determine the conditions under which Shell could potentially experience a liquidity shortfall. This included assuming lower Brent prices of $20/bbl for 2022 and 2023 and overlaying the assumptions that Shell will not achieve any further asset sales over this period, will not have access to new capital raising and no access to commercial paper programmes. Under this stress testing, we concluded that there would still be sufficient facilities available for Shell to continue as a going concern.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as going concerns until March 31, 2023.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement on page 200 of the Annual Report and Accounts about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant section of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's or Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## 5. OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH\n\nOur global audit team has deep industry experience through working for many years on the audits of large integrated international energy companies and commodity trading organisations. Our audit planning starts with updating our view on/uni00A0external market factors, for example geopolitical risk, the potential impact of climate change and the energy transition, commodity price risk and major trends in the industry.\n\nUPDATING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SHELL'S BUSINESS AND ITS ENVIRONMENT\n\nIn 2021, the macro-economic environment stabilised, when compared to 2020. However, climate change and the energy transition continue to heighten estimation uncertainty and to elevate the risk of material misstatement of Shell's asset carrying values and liabilities recorded. These factors had a pervasive impact on Shell's financial statements and increased the risk around key areas of accounting judgement.\n\nAs part of our risk assessment, we also updated our understanding of Shell's business environment. The factors that impacted our/uni00A02021 risk assessment included:\n\n- \u25a0 Shell's announcement of an absolute emissions reduction target of 50% by 2030, compared to 2016 levels on a net basis, for/uni00A0all scope 1 and 2 emissions under Shell's operational control;\n- \u25a0 Shell's 'Powering Progress' strategy;\n- \u25a0 the impact of the organisational review announced in 2020 (Project Reshape);\n- \u25a0 the operating environment within Nigeria.\n- \u25a0 heightened counterparty risks; and\n\nOur updated understanding of Shell's business and the environment in which it operates informed our risk assessment procedures.\n\nt\n\ns",

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH continued\n\nWe continued to believe that it was appropriate to base materiality on normalised Adjusted Earnings on a pre-tax basis. This/uni00A0approach removed both the effects of changes in oil price on inventory carrying amounts and non- recurring gains and charges disclosed as identified items that can significantly distort Shell's results in any one particular year. By applying a normalised Adjusted Earnings approach, we concluded that it was appropriate to maintain planning materiality at $1 billion, which is the same level as in the 2020 audit. Performance materiality for the 2021 audit was set at 75% of our overall materiality, which was set at 50% in 2020.\n\nIn summary, we adopted the following materiality measures in our 2021 audit:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe kept our assessment of materiality under review throughout the year.\n\nOur scope was tailored to the circumstances of our audit of Shell and is influenced by our determination of materiality and our assessed risks of material misstatement. In comparison to the prior year, during the course of the 2021 audit, we did not make any substantial changes to our assessment of the components where we performed full or specific scope audit procedures, nor the number of IT applications to test; however, what did change was the nature and emphasis of our testing in response to our significant audit risks and areas of audit focus. By following this approach, our audit effort focused on higher risk areas, such as/uni00A0management judgements.\n\nWe identified the following key audit matters that, in our professional judgement, had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and in directing the global audit team's efforts:\n\n- \u25a0 estimation of oil and gas reserves;\n- \u25a0 impact of climate change and the energy transition on the financial statements;\n- \u25a0 impairment assessment of property plant and equipment (PP&E) and joint ventures and associates (JVAs);\n\n\u25a0\n\n- \u25a0 decommissioning and restoration (D&R) provisions;\n\nexploration and evaluation (E&E) assets;\n\n- \u25a0 recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets; and\n- \u25a0 revenue recognition: the measurement of unrealised trading gains and losses.\n\n## 6. OUR ASSESSMENT OF MATERIALITY\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, as well as in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on our audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Overall materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our procedures.\n\n## Level set\n\n## Group materiality\n\nWe set our preliminary overall materiality for Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements at $1 billion (2020: $1 billion). We kept this under review throughout the year and reassessed the appropriateness of our original assessment in the light of Shell's results and external market conditions. We did not find it necessary to revise our level of overall materiality.\n\n## Parent Company materiality\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be $1 billion (2020: $1 billion), which is 0.4% of equity (2020: 0.4%). We concluded that equity remains an appropriate basis to determine materiality for an investment holding company. The range we normally apply when determining materiality on an equity measurement basis is 1- 2%. We applied a lower percentage to align the materiality of the parent company with that of the group.\n\n## ASSESSING MATERIALITY (SECTION 6)\n\n## DETERMINING THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT (SECTION 7)\n\n## IDENTIFYING KEY AUDIT MATTERS (SECTION 8)",

        "page_content": "## Our basis of determining materiality\n\nOur assessment of overall materiality that we applied throughout the year was $1 billion. This was derived from an average of Shell's earnings, including an estimated result for 2021, on an Adjusted Earnings basis and that we have adjusted for an average effective tax rate. At the end of the year, we reassessed materiality based on the actual results for 2021. As disclosed on page 326 within non-GAAP measures reconciliations, the 'Adjusted Earnings' measure aims to facilitate a comparative understanding of Shell's financial performance from period to period by removing the effects of oil price changes on inventory carrying amounts and removing the effects of identified items. Shell's identified items are discussed on page 327.\n\nOur key criterion in determining materiality remains our perception of the needs of Shell's stakeholders. We consider which earnings, activity or capital-based measure aligns best with their expectations. In so doing, we apply a 'reasonable investor perspective', which reflects our understanding of the common financial information needs of the members of Shell as a group.\n\nWe continue to believe that these needs are best met by basing materiality on normalised Adjusted Earnings on a pre-tax basis. This approach removes both the effects of changes in oil price on inventory carrying amounts (current cost of supplies adjustment as defined on page 326) and non-recurring gains and charges disclosed as identified items on page 327 that can significantly distort Shell's results in any one particular year. Through applying a normalised earnings approach, large year-on-year swings in materiality are minimised. These swings would be driven primarily by price fluctuations rather than specific structural changes to Shell's business.\n\nWe have considered alternative benchmarks to Adjusted Earnings, including revenue, EBITDA, total assets and equity. These indicate a range of $1.0 billion to $1.9 billion, with the capital-based benchmarks being at the top end of this range.\n\nWe believe that a normalised Adjusted Earnings approach remains appropriate on the basis that:\n\n- \u25a0 Adjusted Earnings exclude the effect of changes in the oil price on inventory carrying amounts, allowing investors to understand how management has performed despite the commodity price environment, as opposed to because of it;\n- \u25a0 segment earnings are presented on an Adjusted Earnings basis, which is the earnings measure used by CEO for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance;\n- \u25a0 analyst forecasts predominately feature Adjusted Earnings, which exclude identified items, as the basis for earnings. The analyst consensus data supports our judgement that Adjusted Earnings remains the key indicator of performance from a reasonable investor perspective; and\n- \u25a0 although this is an unprecedented time for Shell and the industry and there is uncertainty around the future price environment, views of economists and market participants was that demand would return during 2021 and that the supply/demand balance will be re-addressed over time.\n\nBy applying a normalised Adjusted Earnings approach, we have concluded that it is appropriate to maintain materiality at $1 billion, which is the same level as in the 2020 audit.\n\nThe Adjusted Earnings were as follows:\n\n$ billion\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n| Adjusted Earnings (see page 326)                                | 19.3      | 4.8   | 16.5   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------|--------|\n| Estimated tax impact based on the average effective tax rate    | 10.7      | 1.2   | 11.7   |\n| Adjusted Earnings pre-tax                                       | 30.0      | 6.0   | 28.2   |\n| Materiality percentage on the average Adjusted Earnings pre-tax | 2019-2021 | 4.7%  |        |\n\n## Performance materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\nHaving established overall materiality, we determined 'performance materiality', which represents our tolerance for misstatement in an individual account. It is calculated as a percentage of overall materiality in order to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality of $1 billion for Shell's financial statements as a whole. We assigned performance materiality to our various in-scope operating units. The performance materiality allocation is dependent on the size of the operating unit, measured by its contribution of earnings to Shell, or other appropriate metric, and the risk associated with the operating unit.\n\n## Level set\n\nOur 2020 performance materiality was set at 50% of planning materiality, which was based on the potential impacts of remote working through the year-end close, heightened estimation uncertainty as a result of oil and gas price levels, together with significant increased uncertainty around future demand and supply, the potential impact on the control environment of Project Reshape and the level of anticipated audit errors. In our assessment for 2021, we considered the nature, number and impact of the audit differences identified in 2020 and the more stable price environment in 2021. We also noted the way in which management navigated the financial statement close throughout 2020, and the fact that we did not experience any notable increase in control deficiencies in the prior year audit, despite the remote working environment. Based on our assessment of these factors, our judgement was that performance materiality for the 2021 audit should be 75% of our overall materiality or $0.75 billion (2020: $0.5 billion).\n\nThe planning and performance materiality was kept under ongoing review, but the conclusion remained unchanged at our year-end re-assessment of materiality. The range of performance materiality allocated to operating units was $113 million to $488 million (2020: $75 million to $325 million).\n\n## Audit difference reporting threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are clearly trivial. The threshold is the level above which we collate and report audit differences to the Audit Committee. We also report differences below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in the light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Level set\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences more than $50 million (2020: $50 million), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF SHELL'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## What we mean\n\nWe are required to establish an overall audit strategy that sets the scope, timing and direction of our audit. Audit scope comprises the physical locations, operating units, activities and processes to be audited that, in aggregate, are expected to provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to express an audit opinion.\n\n## Criteria for determining our audit/uni00A0scope and selection of in-scope operating units\n\nOur assessment of audit risk and our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determined our audit scope for each operating unit within Shell/uni00A0which, when taken together, enabled us to form an opinion on the financial statements. Our audit effort was focused towards higher risk areas, such as management judgements, and on operating units that we considered significant based upon size, complexity or risk.\n\nWe assessed our 2021 audit scope following the completion of our 2020 audit. We identified those Areas of Operation (AoOs or operating units) that were significant by/uni00A0virtue of their contribution to Shell's results or significant by virtue of their associated risk or complexity. In doing this we considered the history or expectation of unusual or/uni00A0complex transactions, potential for or history of material misstatements, the previous effectiveness of controls, our forensic assessment in relation to fraud, bribery or corruption, and internal audit findings. We then considered the adequacy of account coverage and remaining audit risk of AoOs not directly covered by audit procedures. Finally, we sense checked our scope to the prior year and also ensured that there was appropriate unpredictability in our scope and made the necessary changes where appropriate. We applied our Risk Scan analytics techniques, which consolidate internal and external data to inform us on higher risk components to be included in scope. This allowed us to risk rate the group's operating units. We identified 244 operating units where we believed that it was appropriate to carry out targeted testing.\n\nBy following this approach, our audit effort focused on higher risk areas, such as management judgements. Our group wide procedures enabled us to obtain audit evidence over the AoOs that were not full, specific or specified procedure scope.\n\nWe did not make any substantial changes to our 2020 assessment of the components where we performed full or specific scope audit procedures. Also, there were no significant changes to the number of IT applications we tested. However, what did change was the nature and emphasis of our testing in response to our significant audit risks and areas of audit focus.\n\nWe kept our audit scope under review throughout the year to reflect changes in Shell's underlying business and risks; however, no significant changes were required.\n\nThe table below illustrates the scope of work performed by our audit teams:\n\n| Operating units        |   2021 |   2020 | No. of countries   | Basis of inclusion       | Extent of procedures                 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Full scope             |     13 |     17 | 9                  | Size or significant risk | Complete financial information       |\n| Specific scope         |     35 |     31 | 10                 | Significant risk         | Individual account balances          |\n| Specified procedures 1 |     45 |     45 | 21                 | Other risk factors       | Individual transactions or processes |\n| Other procedures       |    683 |    697 | 85                 | Residual risk of error   | Supplementary audit procedures 2     |\n| Total                  |    776 |    790 |                    |                          |                                      |\n\n- 1 These procedures were performed by components and at the group level and included the testing of Shell's centralised activities addressing the implications of significant and complex accounting matters across all operating units, testing controls for the revenue and purchase to pay processes, including IT general and IT application controls, review of impairment or impairment reversal indicators by segments, procedures over the forecasts as they relate to deferred tax asset recoverability and review of pension scheme assumptions, procedures over unusual accounting transactions including acquisitions, divestments and redundancies and cash testing.\n- 2 We performed supplementary audit procedures in relation to Shell's centralised group accounting and reporting processes. These included, but were not limited to, Shell's activities addressing the/uni00A0appropriate elimination of intercompany balances and the completeness of provisions for litigation and other claims, including those related to non-compliance with laws and regulations. We/uni00A0performed testing of both manual and consolidation journal entries throughout the year, homogenous processes and controls at the Business Service Centres (BSCs) and testing of group wide/uni00A0IT systems. We performed a disaggregated analytical review on each financial statement line item and also tested Shell's analytical procedures performed at a group, segment and function/uni00A0level. We also performed cash testing.\n\n## Coverage\n\nOur coverage by full, specific, specified and group procedures is illustrated below. The summary is by Total Assets, Adjusted Earnings and Revenue. Overall, our full, specific and specified procedures accounted for 61% of Shell's absolute Adjusted Earnings reported by Shell in its quarterly results announcements and adjusted for an effective tax rate. The remaining Adjusted Earnings were covered by Group wide procedures.\n\nThe Parent Company is located in the United Kingdom and audited directly by the Group engagement team\n\n<!-- image -->",

He is supported by 15 segment and function partners and associate partners, who are based in the Netherlands and the UK, and who together with related staff comprise the integrated group engagement team. This group engagement team established the overall group audit strategy, communicated with component auditors, performed work on the consolidation process, and evaluated the/uni00A0conclusions drawn from the audit evidence as the basis for forming EY's opinion on the group financial statements.\n\nThe group engagement team is responsible for directing, supervising, evaluating and reviewing the work of EY global network firms operating under their instruction (local/uni00A0EY teams) to assess whether:\n\n- \u25a0 the work was performed and documented to a sufficiently high standard;\n- \u25a0 the local EY audit team had the appropriate level of experience;\n- \u25a0 the local EY audit team demonstrated that they had challenged management sufficiently and had executed their audit procedures with an appropriate level of scepticism; and\n- \u25a0 there is sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the conclusions reached.\n\nThe group engagement team provided detailed instructions to our component teams to drive the audit strategy and execution in a coordinated manner. Under normal circumstances, Gary Donald and other group audit partners and directors would visit all in-scope operating units and Shell's BSCs. Travel restrictions presented challenges to us exercising direction, supervision, oversight and review of our overseas EY audit teams; however, we were satisfied that we have had adequate involvement in their work and that we exercised sufficient and appropriate direction to the component teams.\n\nIn the absence of group team members being able to travel to visit local EY teams at component locations the process of oversight of component teams included maintaining a continuous and open dialogue with our global component teams, as well as holding formal closing meetings quarterly, to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures. Between quarters, and during critical periods of the audit, we increased the use of online collaboration tools to facilitate team meetings, information sharing and the evaluation, review and oversight of component teams. We requested more detailed deliverables from component teams, and we utilised fully the interactive capability of EY Canvas, our global audit workflow tool, to review remotely the relevant underlying work performed.\n\nAlso, as this was Gary Donald's first year as the Senior Statutory Auditor, he met virtually with the engagement partners on the component teams where we carried out either full or specific scope procedures. In addition, Gary attended the component closing meetings with Australia (Integrated Gas), Brazil (Upstream), the Netherlands (Tax) and the US (Trading and supply). During the year, Gary joined the Upstream and Integrated Gas segment partners in meetings with the Executive Committee members for Upstream and Integrated Gas. From September to November 2021, with the easing of travel restrictions, Gary was based at Shell's offices in the Hague and/uni00A0in January 2022 in Shell's headquarters in London. These activities allowed Gary to build his knowledge of Shell's business and operations in order to identify the risks/uni00A0of material misstatement within Shell's financial statements and to determine the scope of the audit.\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF SHELL'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n\n## Involvement with local EY teams\n\nShell has centralised processes and controls over key areas within its BSCs. Members of the group engagement team provide direct oversight, review, and coordination of/uni00A0our BSC audit teams. Our BSC teams performed centralised testing in the BSCs for certain accounts, including revenue, cash and payroll. In establishing our overall approach to the group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the operating units or BSCs by the group engagement team or by/uni00A0auditors from other local EY teams.\n\nThe group engagement team performed procedures directly on 122 of the in-scope operating units. For the operating units where the work was performed by local EY auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement of the group engagement team to enable us to conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been/uni00A0obtained, as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nDuring the 2021 audit, the group team were able to carry out two physical site visits at Shell's US Upstream operations and Shell's US Trading and supply function. In addition, we performed virtual site visits in Brazil, Nigeria, Qatar, UK, USA, India, Malaysia, Philippines and Poland. These visits were carried out multiple times during the/uni00A0audit and were attended by either the Senior Statutory Auditor or other group audit partners or associate partners on the group engagement team. We also joined all/uni00A0the Audit Committee virtual site visits and deep-dives that are discussed in the Audit Committee report on pages 153 to 165.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact Shell and to the steps that investors expect auditors to perform. Our audit efforts in considering climate change are described in Section 8, key audit matters, which includes details of our procedures and the key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee. We also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern (see section 4) and viability and associated disclosures (see section 9).",

        "page_content": "## 8. OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nKey audit matters (KAMs) are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThe key audit matters have been addressed in the context of the audit of Shell's Consolidated and Parent Company Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinions thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The table below describes the key audit matters, a/uni00A0summary of our procedures carried out and our key observations that we communicated to the Audit Committee.\n\nIn the current year, we have included Exploration and Evaluation (E&E) assets as a separate key audit matter given the heightened risk that these assets will not be developed because of the energy transition. In 2020, E&E was considered as part of the impairment of property plant and equipment KAM. Also, in 2020 we included KAMs for the estimation of future refining margins, the recoverable amount of investments held by the Parent company and the dividend distribution process. In/uni00A02021, our consideration of refining margins was included within impairment of property plant and equipment. We/uni00A0did not include the recoverable amount of investments held by the Parent company as a key audit matter in 2021 given both the improvement in/uni00A0commodity prices and Shell's share price. Also, we did not include the dividend distribution process as a key audit matter given that Shell returned to a net profit in the current year.\n\n## THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENERGY TRANSITION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThe financial statement and audit risks related to climate change and the energy transition remain an area of audit focus and the risk is elevated compared to 2020. This is due to the increased uncertainty surrounding the impact of climate change, and because climate change risks have a pervasive impact on many areas of accounting judgement and estimate and, therefore, our/uni00A0audit.\n\nClimate related issues impact Shell in many ways, as set out in Climate change and energy transition on pages 75 to 98, within the Strategic report, which forms part of the 'Other information' rather than the audited financial statements. Within this section, Shell have described how climate-related issues are considered when reviewing and guiding strategy, major plans of action and risk management policies, annual budgets, and business plans.\n\nAs stated in Note 4 to the financial statements, in 2021 Shell launched their Powering Progress strategy to accelerate the transition of their business to net-zero emissions, including targets to reduce the carbon intensity of energy products they sell (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) by 6-8% by 2023, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and 100% by 2050. Further in October 2021, Shell announced their target to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, compared to 2016 levels. Also, in Note 4, Shell describe how they consider climate related impacts in key areas of the Consolidated Financial Statements and how this translates into the valuation of assets and measurement of liabilities.\n\nShell has identified climate-related risks and opportunities, which are set out within the Climate change and energy transition section of the Strategic Report on pages 79 to 82 and in risk factors on pages 23 to 24, which form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements.\n\n## Overall response\n\nIn order to respond to the impact of climate change and the energy transition, we ensured that we had the appropriate skills and experience on the audit team. Our primary audit engagement team included professionals with significant experience in/uni00A0climate change, climate change litigation and energy valuations. Most of the audit procedures were performed by the primary audit engagement team. Where work was carried out by component teams, this was under the direction of team members with significant experience in climate change.\n\nIn addition, during the planning phase of our audit, the primary audit engagement team, including climate change and sustainability specialists, held a series of climate change risk workshops. In these workshops, the team focused on industry and regulatory developments on climate change and how these developments apply to/uni00A0Shell's business. The team also assessed the physical and transition climate risks facing Shell's business, the audit risks associated with climate change and our planned audit response. An output from the workshops was a specific audit plan to/uni00A0address climate change risk in the 2021 audit, the key aspects of which are set out/uni00A0below.\n\nIn designing our audit procedures, we also considered the content of the document entitled 'Investor Expectations for Paris-aligned Accounts', published on 5 November 2020 by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), which was reiterated in a letter that EY received from Sarasin and Partners on 1 November 2021 on Investor expectations: net zero-aligned accounts.\n\nThe procedures we carried out included the following:\n\n## Alignment of statements made in Strategic Report with the financial/uni00A0statements\n\n- \u25a0 we evaluated whether the effects of material climate risks, as disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts on pages 23 to 24 and on pages 79 to 82, had been/uni00A0appropriately reflected in asset values and associated financial statement disclosures, and the timing, nature and measurement of liabilities recognised in accordance with IFRS, which is discussed further below;\n- \u25a0 in connection with our audit of the financial statements, we read the Other information in the Annual Report and Accounts (as defined in section 9) and, in/uni00A0doing so, considered whether the Other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appeared to be materially misstated;\n- \u25a0 assessed the consistency of the assumptions used in preparing the financial statements with the Other information in the Annual Report and Accounts relating to energy transition and climate change;\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE RISK AND THE ENERGY TRANSITION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\n- The related audit risks that we have considered in our audit are as follows: \u25a0 the alignment of Shell's financial statements and their Strategic Report around material climate change with the Powering Progress strategy, which is described on pages 6 to 11;\n- \u25a0 whether material climate change risks are appropriately reflected in/uni00A0critical accounting estimates and judgements; and\n- \u25a0 the reflection of Shell's emissions reduction targets within their operating plan (see pages 242 and 245), which is forecasted for a 10-year period and updated every year, which would impact forecast cash flows, thereby impacting future income and estimated recoverable amounts of/uni00A0assets and measurement of liabilities;\n- \u25a0 whether the financial statements, including note disclosures, appropriately reflect known climate change-related litigation.\n\nThe critical accounting judgements and estimates that are impacted by/uni00A0climate change and the energy transition include the following:\n\n- \u25a0 the useful economic lives of PP&E and the estimation of depreciation, depletion, and amortisation (DD&A);\n- \u25a0 the estimation of oil and gas reserves and resources (see separate KAM/uni00A0on page 218);\n- \u25a0 impairment assessments for PP&E and JVAs, including E&E assets. These/uni00A0assets may no longer be considered economic due to the impact of/uni00A0climate change and the energy transition on oil and gas prices, production volumes and increased cost exposure from increased adoption of carbon pricing in key markets (see separate KAMs on impairment of PP&E and E&E assets on pages 219 and 221). There is/uni00A0a/uni00A0risk that material impairments could have a direct impact on Shell's/uni00A0ability to pay dividends;\n- \u25a0 the recognition and measurement of Deferred Tax Assets (see separate KAM on page 223);\n- \u25a0 the recognition and measurement of decommissioning and restoration (D&R) provisions, including operations that historically have been assumed to have indefinite lives (see separate KAM on page 222);\n- \u25a0 climate change-related litigation brought against Shell that may lead to/uni00A0an outflow of resources or otherwise impact Shell's business;\n- \u25a0 going concern and viability assessments and disclosures as increased stakeholder concern on climate change from Shell's investors and current and potential future providers of finance may pose a risk to Shell's ability to raise finance (see section 4 and section 9 of our opinion).\n- \u25a0 the disclosure of information about the assumptions Shell makes that could, in the future, have a significant risk of material adjustments to/uni00A0the/uni00A0carrying amounts of assets and measurement of liabilities, including sensitivity disclosures; and\n\n## Incorporation of emissions reduction assumptions within Shell's operating/uni00A0plan\n\n- \u25a0 tested management's internal controls over the accounting for and disclosure of/uni00A0the potential impacts associated with energy transition and climate change;\n- \u25a0 held discussions with Group Planning, Group Reporting and Shell's Carbon Strategy group to understand how transition and physical risks of climate change were being factored into Shell's 2021 operating plan;\n- \u25a0 we performed procedures to understand how management intend to achieve their planned Scope 1 and 2 and Net Carbon Footprint reductions and whether these actions have been reflected in the operating plan and, ultimately, the areas where they impact Shell's financial statements and note disclosures, specifically in assessing impairment of PP&E and JVAs, E&E assets, D&R provisions, recognition and measurement of DTAs and the assessments of going concern and viability. This/uni00A0involved obtaining an understanding of Shell's processes to develop, challenge and approve the operating plan and the design and operating effectiveness of the controls over this process. The team carrying out this work included auditors with expertise in climate change risk in the energy industry;\n- \u25a0 engaged our climate change and sustainability specialists to consider the appropriateness of the methodology adopted and the reasonableness of the carbon prices applied in 25 countries, including the 10 highest forecast carbon emitters. As part of this we independently determined our view of a range of acceptable carbon price assumptions. Where countries were outside of our benchmarking ranges, we performed sensitivity analysis to ensure the impact of/uni00A0these different assumptions was not material;\n- \u25a0 assessed the appropriateness of the operating and capital expenditure assumptions that were assumed necessary to achieve the emission reductions. This/uni00A0also involved assessing the credibility of assumptions on acquisitions, divestments, investments in Carbon Capture Solutions (CCS) technologies and/uni00A0Nature Based Solutions (NBS), including whether such assumption is appropriately reflected in impairment assessments;\n- \u25a0 tested the carbon pricing included in cash flows and performed sensitivity analysis by using a range of carbon prices, such as those disclosed in the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario;\n\n## Reflection of material climate change risks within the critical accounting estimates, judgements and financial statement disclosures\n\n- \u25a0 considered specifically the extent to which management's mid-price outlook and production assumptions incorporated the potential impact of climate change and the energy transition;\n- \u25a0 read Shell's disclosure in the financial statements of information about the assumptions Shell makes that could, in the future, have a significant risk of material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and measurement of liabilities, including sensitivity disclosures in Note 4 in the financial statements;\n- \u25a0 evaluated the reasonableness of Shell's refining margin assumptions, by comparing Shell's assumptions to external benchmarks, in light of the expected impact on demand for oil products in a transition to a net zero economy. Refining margin assumptions underpin the recoverable amount of refineries;\n- \u25a0 in order to identify assets that are carbon intensive, where there may be a higher risk of the reserves not ultimately being produced (stranded assets), we analysed those assets that are currently forecast to be producing beyond 2030 and estimated the carbon intensity of the most significant fields that are expected to be/uni00A0producing after 2030. We estimated the net book value of assets currently recognised that will not have been fully depreciated by 2030 in order to assess the risk of material stranded assets;\n- \u25a0 read and challenged management's disclosures in Note 4. We audited the sensitivity disclosures in Note 4 of the carrying value of Shell's Upstream and Integrated Gas PP&E assets to a range of future oil and gas price assumptions, reflecting reduced demand scenarios due to climate change and the energy transition, including the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario. This included considering whether the downside sensitivities could have reduced the level of Shell's distributable profits such that their 2021 dividend would not have been in compliance with the Companies Act;\n- \u25a0 we analysed further the carbon intensity per barrel of those fields. For the assets where forecast emissions were highest, we evaluated whether Shell's operating plan assumptions included planned actions and associated expenditures to reduce the carbon emissions of these projects;",

We/uni00A0assessed whether the various climate change litigations represented obligations where the likelihood of a cash outflow was probable and therefore requiring provision. Also, we considered the appropriateness of the disclosures within Note 26, Legal proceedings and other contingencies, by comparing the/uni00A0disclosures to our understanding of the claims and allegations.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team. Our audit response relating to oil and gas reserves, the impairment assessment of/uni00A0PP&E and JVAs, E&E assets, D&R provisions and DTAs is included in the KAMs on/uni00A0pages 218-223.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nWe reported to the Audit Committee the key procedures that we had performed and the results of those procedures, which are set out below:\n\n## Alignment of statements made in Strategic Report with the financial statements\n\n- \u25a0 We reported that we had not identified any material inconsistencies between Shell's disclosures in Note 4 on the material impacts of climate-related matters, included within the Other information, and the financial statements.\n\n## Incorporation of Shell's emissions reduction targets within Shell's operating plan\n\n- \u25a0 With support from our climate change and sustainability specialists, we concluded an appropriate methodology had been adopted to forecast carbon prices and, through our independent testing verified that Shell's forecast carbon prices were within a reasonable range, or where the assumptions applied were outside of this range, they did not have a material impact on Shell's forecast cash flows.\n- \u25a0 We reported that Shell's operating plan reflected the expected financial impact of management's current planned actions to address these risks. This included confirming that the operating and capital expenditure estimates to deliver the emissions reductions are included in the operating plan, including assumptions on/uni00A0acquisitions, divestments, investments in CCS technologies and NBS, and that it is appropriate to include these assumptions in impairment assessments performed in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\n\n## Reflection of material climate change risks within the critical accounting estimates, judgements and financial statement disclosures\n\n- \u25a0 We confirmed that the material climate risks that impact Shell's critical accounting estimates, judgements and financial statement disclosures have been appropriately reflected by Shell in the preparation of their financial statements.\n- \u25a0 We reported that management's controls over the accounting for, and disclosure of, the potential financial statement impacts associated with climate change and energy transition were designed and operating effectively.\n- \u25a0 We audited Shell's long-term oil and gas price assumptions and concluded they are reasonable and represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exists in the foreseeable future. We have included our observations on Shell's price assumptions, including refining margins, within the impairment of PP&E key audit matter.\n- \u25a0 We reported to the Audit Committee that it is reasonable to assume that the proved reserves recognised beyond 2030 will be recoverable and that they should be included in management's best estimates. This was based on the likelihood of extracting reserves beyond 2030 being supported by macro factors, including demand from emerging markets and the speed and scale of government and regulatory changes globally.\n- \u25a0 With regards to the sensitivity analysis provided by Shell in Note 4 to the financial statements, we were satisfied that the description of the sensitivity reflected the sensitivity performed. Also, the prices applied by Shell in their calculations were agreed to the scenarios as described. We reperformed the sensitivities and were satisfied that the ranges disclosed by Shell in Note 4 were materially correct, including the illustrative disclosures on the impact of prices averaged from four two-Celsius or less external climate scenarios.\n- \u25a0 Our estimate of the net book value of assets currently recognised that will not have been fully depreciated by 2030 was around $20 billion of the Upstream and/uni00A0IG PP&E as at 31 December 2021, which is based on 29% of SEC reserves being left by 2030. We reported that, for the assets we regarded as having the highest estimated carbon intensity, there was sufficient evidence to indicate that these proved reserves will be produced. Given we estimated that over 80% of/uni00A0Shell's current Upstream and Integrated Gas PP&E will be fully depreciated by 2030, and the evidence that the remaining reserves will be recoverable, we/uni00A0reported that, based on evidence that exists today, the risk that there will be material stranded assets is low.\n- \u25a0 Our audit observations relating to oil and gas reserves, impairment assessment of PP&E and JVAs, E&E assets, deferred tax assets and D&R provisions are included in the KAMs on pages 218-223.\n- \u25a0 We reported to the Audit Committee that we had considered Shell's dividend resilience statement in Note 4. Had Shell applied the averaged from four two-Celsius or less external climate scenarios commodity prices, and had this impairment directly reduced the carrying value of investments within Shell plc, this/uni00A0would not have impacted the distributable reserves available to Shell from which to pay dividends in 2021. This is on the basis that the Shell parent company/uni00A0had a merger reserve of $234 billion and any impairments would first be charged to the income statement and then transferred to the merger reserve,/uni00A0as opposed to impacting distributable reserves.\n\n## Climate change related legal claims\n\n- \u25a0 We reported that, given the relatively early maturity of climate change litigation, we were satisfied that there was not a higher risk of a material provision being omitted and that we were satisfied that the various climate change litigations did not represent obligations where the likelihood of a cash outflow is probable. We also reported that, based on our understanding of the claims and allegations, we were satisfied with the disclosures within Note 26, Legal proceedings and/uni00A0other contingencies.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 160 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed climate change and energy transition.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## THE ESTIMATION OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nThis is a forecast-based estimate. Oil and gas reserves estimates are used in the calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortisation (DD&A), impairment testing and in the estimation of/uni00A0decommissioning and restoration (D&R) provisions. The risk is/uni00A0the inappropriate recognition of proved reserves that impacts these accounting estimates. Given the current environment, there/uni00A0may be a heightened risk of proved reserves with a high/uni00A0carbon intensity not ultimately being produced (also see/uni00A0climate change and energy transition key audit matter).\n\nAs described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,/uni00A0at December 31, 2021, production assets amounted/uni00A0to/uni00A0$118.4 billion and had an associated DD&A charge/uni00A0of $15.8 billion. Also, as described in Note 9, exploration and evaluation assets amounted to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2021. As further described in Note 9, impairment charges of $1.5/uni00A0billion of production and E&E assets and impairment reversals of $0.2 billion of E&E were recorded during the year./uni00A0As/uni00A0described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, D&R provisions amounted to $22.1 billion.\n\nIf proved reserves are recognised that are not ultimately produced, depreciation will be understated, and the recoverable amount of assets may be overstated. In-year reserve movements are driven by revisions of/uni00A0previous estimates resulting from reclassifications, changes to recovery assumptions, extensions and discoveries and purchases and sales of/uni00A0reserves in place. Revisions generally arise from new information, for/uni00A0example additional drilling results, changes in production patterns and/uni00A0changes to development plans, which are an input to the cash flows/uni00A0used/uni00A0in/uni00A0the measurement of production assets and D&R provisions.\n\nAuditing the estimation of oil and gas reserves is complex, as there is significant estimation uncertainty in assessing the quantities of reserves and/uni00A0resources in place. The estimates are based on the Company's central group of experts' assessments of petroleum initially in place, production curves and certain other inputs, including forecast production volumes, future capital and operating cost assumptions and life of field assumptions, all of which are inputs used by reservoir engineers to estimate oil and gas reserves. Estimation uncertainty is further elevated given the transition to/uni00A0a/uni00A0low-carbon economy, which could impact life-of-field assumptions and/uni00A0increase the risk of underutilised or stranded oil and gas assets. Also,/uni00A0given/uni00A0the estimation of oil and gas reserves is complex, there is/uni00A0a/uni00A0risk/uni00A0that inappropriate management bias influences the estimate.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's oil and gas reserves' estimation process. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested management's controls over review of changes to year-on-year estimated oil and gas reserves volumes.\n\nWe involved professionals with substantial oil and gas reserves audit experience, including a partner with relevant qualifications in energy economics, to assist us in/uni00A0evaluating the key assumptions and methodologies applied by management.\n\nOur procedures included, amongst others:\n\n- \u25a0 verifying that they were in compliance with Shell's reserves and resources guidance;\n- \u25a0 testing that significant additions or reductions in reserves had been made in the period in which the new information became available by understanding the change in circumstance that drove the change;\n- \u25a0 evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of management's experts (internal reservoir engineers) who performed the detailed preparation of the reserve estimates and those who are primarily responsible for providing independent review and challenge, and ultimately endorsement of, the reserve/uni00A0estimates;\n- \u25a0 evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the inputs used by management in/uni00A0estimating the oil and gas reserves by agreeing the inputs to source documentation;\n- \u25a0 evaluating management's estimation of the point at which the operating cash flow from a project becomes negative (the economic limit), as this impacts DD&A and impairment. Where relevant, we assessed whether the economic limit test incorporated Shell's estimate of future carbon costs to reflect the potential impact of climate change and the energy transition;\n- \u25a0 performing backtesting of historical data to identify indications of estimation bias over time; and\n- \u25a0 evaluating management's development plan for compliance with SEC rules that undrilled locations must be scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer period. This evaluation was made by assessing the consistency of the development projections with Shell's development plans and capital allocation framework. Also, where reserves are recognised beyond current licence terms, we obtained evidence to support the assumption that the licence would be renewed.\n\nOur procedures were led by the group engagement team, with input from our teams/uni00A0in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Kazakhstan, Norway, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia and/uni00A0the USA.\n\nWe reported to the Audit Committee in January 2022 that we did not identify any significant errors in the oil and gas reserves and concluded that the inputs and/uni00A0assumptions used to estimate reserves and resources were reasonable. We reported that we had verified that significant additions to or reductions in reserves/uni00A0had been recorded in the appropriate period, and that they were in compliance with Shell's reserves and resources guidance.\n\nAlso, we have not identified any impairment triggers as a result of any of the movements in reserves during the year. Please see key audit matter on the impact of/uni00A0climate change and the energy transition on the financial statements for details of our considerations on the carbon intensity associated with reserves expected to be produced beyond 2030.\n\nIn our view, Shell follows a robust process for recognising oil and gas reserves. We saw no evidence that the recognition of the reserve volumes expected to/uni00A0be/uni00A0lif ted beyond 2030 results in the overstatement of Shell's balance sheet by overstating the recoverable amounts of Shell's assets or understatement of/uni00A0D&R/uni00A0liabilities.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 160 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed assurances for oil and gas reserves.

        "page_content": "## IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (PP&E) AND JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES (JVA)\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is a forecast-based estimate. The risk is that potential impairments are not identified on a timely basis, including whether the impacts of climate change and the energy transition have been considered in Shell's impairment trigger assessments (also see climate change and energy transition key audit matter).\n\nAs described in Notes 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, Shell recognised $118.4 billion of production assets, $49.1 billion of manufacturing, supply and distribution assets (refineries) and $23.4 billion of joint ventures and associates (JVAs). As disclosed in Note 9, Shell recognised $0.3 billion impairment charges and $0.2 billion impairment reversals relating to production assets and $2.3 billion impairment charges relating to/uni00A0manufacturing, supply and distribution assets. As discussed in Note 10, Shell recognised no/uni00A0impairment charges relating to JVAs.\n\nAs Shell recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $26.7 billion of PP&E and/uni00A0JVAs in 2020, the carrying values are sensitive to smaller changes in key assumptions, which increases the risk of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal not being identified. Our audit effort has therefore focused on the completeness and timely identification of indicators of impairment charges or impairment reversals.\n\nAuditing the impairment of PP&E and JVAs is subjective due to the significant/uni00A0amount of judgement involved in determining whether indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist, particularly for longer term assets. Indicators should reflect significant upward or downward revisions in/uni00A0assumptions impacting the future potential long-term value of an asset, rather than drivers of short-term fluctuations in value.\n\nKey judgements in determining whether indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist include changes in forecast commodity price and refining margin assumptions, movements in oil and gas reserves, changes in/uni00A0asset performance and future development plans and, the expected useful lives of assets. In performing our audit, we are mindful of the risk of/uni00A0management override in the assessment of whether or not impairment indicators exist.\n\nAs described in Note 2, the most complex of these judgements relate to management's view on the long-term oil and gas price outlook. Forecasting future prices is inherently difficult, as it requires forecasts that reflect developments in demand such as global economic growth, technology efficiency, policy measures and, on the supply side, consideration of investment and resource potential, cost of development of new supply and behaviour of major resource holders. These judgements are particularly difficult because of increased demand uncertainty and pace of decarbonisation due to climate change and the energy transition.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's asset impairment process. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested the controls over management's identification of indicators of impairment and reversals of impairment and the approval of oil and gas prices and refining margins.\n\n## Indicators of impairment or impairment reversal\n\nWe evaluated Shell's assessment of impairment and impairment reversal triggers, including changes in the forecast commodity price assumptions, movements in oil and gas reserves (see oil and gas reserves key audit matter), changes in asset performance, changes in Shell's operating plan assumptions, including those relating to Shell's carbon emissions reductions targets, and whether these are indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.\n\nSeparately from management, for material assets, we also assessed independently whether or not indicators of impairment or reversal triggers exist, considered the existence of other contradictory evidence that could indicate a significant increase or/uni00A0decrease in the recoverable amount of any of Shell's assets.\n\nOur procedures included, amongst others:\n\n## Oil and gas price and refining margin assumptions\n\n- \u25a0 comparing Shell's oil and gas price scenarios to the IEA's Net Zero Emissions 2050 (NZE) and to the IEA's Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) price assumptions as potential contradictory evidence for best estimates of future oil and gas prices. The/uni00A0APS assumes that all climate commitments made by governments around the/uni00A0world, including Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and longer-term/uni00A0net zero targets, will be met in full and on time;\n- \u25a0 assessing the reasonableness of future short and long-term oil and gas price assumptions by comparing these to an independently developed reasonable range of forecasts based on consensus analysts' forecasts and those adopted by/uni00A0other international oil companies;\n- \u25a0 evaluating the reasonableness of Shell's refining margin assumptions by comparing these to independent market and consultant forecasts. We also involved our oil and gas valuations specialists to assess the reasonableness of/uni00A0Shell's refining margin estimation methodology and assumptions;\n- \u25a0 performing benchmarking to determine whether Shell's oil and gas company peers/uni00A0reflected changes in oil and gas price and refining margin assumptions as/uni00A0indicators of impairment or impairment reversal;\n- \u25a0 given the continued improvement in commodity prices and short-term refining margins, assessing whether or not these higher price markers represented a trigger/uni00A0for impairment reversal;\n\n## Carbon intensity\n\n- \u25a0 in order to determine whether there is any risk that reserves recognised will not be produced, we estimated the carbon intensity of Shell's Upstream and Integrated Gas fields, focussing on the most carbon intensive assets. We assessed Shell's plans to reduce the carbon intensity of these assets, therefore reducing the risk of/uni00A0potential impairment of the current carrying value, and verified that the costs associated with these activities were reflected in Shell's operating plans;\n\n## Operating plan outcomes\n\n- \u25a0 considered the existence of other contradictory evidence, such as the results of any comparable market transactions that could indicate a significant increase or decrease in the recoverable amount of any of Shell's assets, public comments or commitments made by Shell in relation to the Powering Progress strategy and whether these could impact the future potential value of any assets; and\n- \u25a0 evaluating the assumptions used in the preparation of the 2021 operating plan at a group, segment and asset level and compared the actual performance of assets to the forecasts made in the prior year;\n\n## Unplanned shutdowns\n\n- \u25a0 assessing potential operational changes that have or are expected to have a significant adverse effect on an asset and whether such unplanned shutdowns should be considered as impairment triggers.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed primarily by our group engagement team as well as our local audit teams in Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, the UK and the USA.\n\nt\n\ns",

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\nIMPAIRMENT OF PP&E (INCLUDING EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS AND REFINERIES) AND JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES (JVA) continued\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nIn January 2022, we reported to the Audit Committee that management's review to determine whether or not any indicators of impairment were present had considered all relevant information available at the end of each reporting period. Also, that based on our independent assessment, we had not identified impairment triggers as a result of changes in commodity price or refining margin assumptions, any of the movements in reserves during the year, changes in/uni00A0the/uni00A0discount rate for D&R provisions, carbon intensity considerations, operating plan outcomes or unplanned shutdowns.\n\nFor the assets where management's impairment assessment resulted in an impairment charge, the charges were within an acceptable range. Also, we were satisfied that the impairment charges were recorded in the appropriate period.\n\nIn respect of our independent assessment of the existence of indicators of impairment, we reported in January 2022 the following:\n\n## Oil and gas price assumptions\n\n- \u25a0 We were satisfied that the short-term improvements in commodity prices do not represent potential impairment reversals triggers as Shell's long term commodity prices remain unchanged and the assets are of long term nature, thereby reducing the impact of short term fluctuations on asset values.\n- \u25a0 We obtained external evidence, including published price forecasts by banks, brokers, consultants and also our peer group analysis, to support the reasonableness of Shell's price assumptions. Overall, Shell's assumptions for Brent sat within the benchmarks that we had identified. Shell's Henry Hub, TTF and/uni00A0JKM gas price assumptions are at the bottom end of our benchmarks.\n- \u25a0 Shell's oil and gas price assumptions are higher than the IEA Net Zero Emissions scenario; however, Shell's assumptions are more consistent with the IEA Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), being around 7% higher than the APS assumptions. The APS scenario assumes that all climate commitments made by governments around the world will be met in full and on time. Given governmental, societal and regulatory responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, it is highly uncertain as to whether future prices will reflect the IEA Net Zero Emissions 2050 scenario. Nevertheless, management estimated the impact on the recoverable amount of Upstream and Integrated assets recognised as at 31 December 2021 of applying different price outlooks using prices from external climate change scenarios. We have recalculated the sensitivities included in Note 4 and these sensitivity ranges disclosed are reasonable.\n\n## Refining margins\n\n- \u25a0 Given short term refining margin assumptions have improved in Shell's 2021 operating plan, compared to the 2020 operating plan, we challenged management as to whether this represented a trigger for impairment reversal. However, as the only asset in 2020 where an impairment charge was based on its/uni00A0value in use, rather than disposal proceeds, was a 50+ year refinery, we were satisfied that short term fluctuations in refining margins should not be viewed as/uni00A0an impairment reversal trigger.\n\n## Carbon intensity\n\n- \u25a0 We did not identify any assets where the current or forecast carbon emissions intensity indicate that the assets are impaired.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 160 for details on how the Audit Committee considered impairments. Also, see Notes 2, 4, 9 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

E&E activity/uni00A0carries inherent risk that projects do not progress to/uni00A0development, requiring the write-off or impairment of the related capitalised costs when the relevant IFRS criteria are met. Risk is elevated compared to 2020 because of energy transition (also see climate change and energy transition key audit matter).\n\nAs described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December, 31, 2021, Shell recognised $7.1/uni00A0billion of E&E assets.\n\nThe risk is whether it is appropriate to continue carrying capitalised E&E/uni00A0costs. Auditing impairment assessments of E&E assets is inherently judgemental given the exploration for and evaluation of the resources has/uni00A0not always reached a stage at which information sufficient to estimate future cash flows is available. Given the current environment, and the capital allocation and emissions reductions decisions that Shell intend to take through the energy transition, there/uni00A0is a heightened risk that projects will no longer proceed, in/uni00A0which case they may need to be written off.\n\nAs a result of these factors, there is significant judgement relating to the risk/uni00A0that certain E&E costs are not written off in the appropriate reporting period, which also represents a risk of potential management bias. During the year, management recorded $1.8/uni00A0billion of E&E write offs and impairments (2020: $4.0 billion).\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's E&E impairment assessment process. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their/uni00A0operating effectiveness.\n\nTo test the completeness and appropriateness of the E&E asset write off and impairment charges recorded, our procedures included, amongst others:\n\n- \u25a0 through this analysis, independently identifying the assets that we considered most at/uni00A0risk of not being developed by Shell or being divested as a consequence of Shell's emissions reductions strategies. We have challenged management on the likelihood of progressing the E&E assets, including the strategic fit of the assets, carbon intensity of the developments, planned capex and project economics and the expectation that sufficient cash resources will be available to/uni00A0fund the expected development of assets;\n- \u25a0 performing a licence-by-licence risk assessment of Shell's E&E assets to identify assets with a significant risk of impairment and assessing each significant licence area against the impairment criteria within IFRS 6 with a particular focus on those assets that were expected to be developed over the medium and long term, those assets where the dominant commodity that will be produced is oil, or highly carbon intensive projects;\n- \u25a0 corroborating key internal and external evidence relevant to the judgements made in/uni00A0respect of the group's E&E portfolio, including analysing evidence of further activity being included in Shell's operating plan and any contra evidence that suggests government or regulatory approvals will not be provided;\n- \u25a0 considering the disclosure of E&E asset write offs and impairments.\n- \u25a0 in respect of E&E write offs and impairments recorded during the year, considering whether evidence about current project activity, forecast future expenditure and operational plans was consistent with the decisions taken by/uni00A0management to write off or impair these assets; and\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team/uni00A0and our component teams in Australia, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, the/uni00A0UK/uni00A0and USA.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nIn January 2022, we reported to the Audit Committee that we had challenged management's assessment of the existence of indicators of impairment for Shell's E&E asset portfolio and identified the E&E assets that we believed were most at risk of not being developed by Shell or being divested, and therefore potentially being written off or impaired. Whilst the E&E impairment assessment involves significant judgement about future actions of management and other stakeholders, we satisfied ourselves that sufficient evidence existed at the balance sheet date to support the carrying value of the E&E assets based on planned capex in Shell's operating plan, expected final investment decision dates, first production estimates and expected break-even prices.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 160 for details on how the Audit Committee considered impairments.

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SHELL PLC continued\n\n## 8. OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION (D&R) PROVISIONS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is an estimation based on uncertain outcomes. The risk is the expected timing of decommissioning activity and the estimated cost of activities that are expected to occur in the future.\n\nAs described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2021, Shell recognised $22.1 billion in D&R provisions.\n\nAuditing D&R provisions is complex because management's estimation of future cash outflows involves significant judgement. As explained in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the estimate is based on current legal and constructive obligations, technology and price levels. However, the extent and timing of the actual outflows incurred in the future may differ due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions at the time of decommissioning, and can take place many years in the future. There is a risk of management bias in the determination of both the timing of activity and estimation of the costs that will be incurred.\n\nThe timing of estimated future decommissioning activity is also a key judgement with the energy transition increasing the risk that oil and gas fields will be decommissioned earlier than anticipated (also see climate change and energy transition key audit matter). The key factor in determining the timing will be the life of field assumptions, which is discussed in our oil and gas reserves key audit matter.\n\nIn respect of Oil Products and Chemicals operations, the key judgement is management's views on the expected useful lives of manufacturing and production assets and, where an asset's life is expected to extend far into the future, that it is not possible to make an estimate of the obligation that is sufficiently reliable to use in recognising a D&R provision. Contingent liabilities are disclosed by Shell in respect of refineries where decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away and the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. These refineries are integrated with chemicals facilities and are expected to out-perform refineries that are not. This is driven by the expectation that chemicals demand will continue to grow, and as demand for oil products decreases, more advanced refineries are expected to continue much longer into the energy transition. Shell has D&R provisions in respect of six production and manufacturing facilities, with contingent liabilities disclosed/uni00A0for the remaining six energy parks within the Oil Products and/uni00A0Chemicals portfolio.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's process for the estimation of decommissioning and restoration provisions. We then evaluated the design of, and/uni00A0tested the operating effectiveness of, controls over the estimation of the D&R provision. For example, we tested controls over the review of the estimation and completeness of cost estimates.\n\n## Our audit procedures included, amongst others:\n\n- \u25a0 auditing cost assumptions relating to labour rates, rig type and rates, number of/uni00A0wells, well durations, and any contingencies applied by inspecting contracts. Also, evaluating whether the nature of the costs expected to be incurred were in accordance with the requirements of IAS 37;\n- \u25a0 assessing changes in D&R cost estimates, and whether they reflected the latest/uni00A0regulatory requirements and technical developments;\n- \u25a0 evaluating the expected timing of decommissioning by comparing these factors to/uni00A0the estimated life-of-field assumptions and considering the impact of energy transition and climate change. We also evaluated the estimated carbon intensity of the post 2030 production of Shell's assets, in order to identify assets where there may be a higher risk of the reserves not ultimately being produced (see oil and gas reserves key audit matter) as this may impact the estimated cessation of/uni00A0production date for these assets;\n- \u25a0 evaluating the timing of recognition of D&R liabilities related to contingent liabilities and D&R liabilities arising from assets previously disposed of, including assessing the counterparty risk associated with those disposals;\n- \u25a0 testing the D&R accounting models and assumptions therein, including discount rates, and inflation rates. We validated the assumptions to external data sources and reconciled the assumptions with those used in other areas of measurement, such as impairment assessment;\n- \u25a0 evaluating management's assessment of the useful lives of manufacturing assets in/uni00A0the Oil Products and Chemicals portfolio in light of the changed supply and demand economics due to the energy transition. In particular, we evaluated whether D&R provisions were required for certain refineries and petrochemical facilities based on Shell's plans to rationalise their manufacturing portfolio and to/uni00A0convert or dismantle existing units. This included assessing management's ability to/uni00A0repurpose the units to increase production capabilities of refined products with lower carbon intensity; and\n- \u25a0 assessing the disclosure of D&R provisions and contingent liabilities in the financial statements. We also evaluated management's re-assessment of the need for contingent liability disclosures in respect of certain manufacturing assets.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team/uni00A0and our component teams in Australia, Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, the/uni00A0UK/uni00A0and USA.\n\nIn January 2022, we reported that the D&R provisions recorded at December 31, 2021 were fairly stated and that changes in D&R provisions during the year, had been reflected appropriately in the financial statements. Also, we saw no evidence that the recognition of the reserve volumes expected to be lifted beyond 2030 results in the understatement of D&R liabilities for Shell's oil and gas assets.\n\nIn respect of Oil Products and Chemicals assets, we remain satisfied that the accounting treatment adopted appropriately reflects the expected useful lives of the/uni00A0Group's refineries and chemicals parks. In reaching this conclusion, where an asset's life is expected to extend far into the future, it is not possible to make an estimate of the obligation that is sufficiently reliable to use in recognising a D&R provision and therefore a contingent liability is disclosed. This is on the basis that the settlement dates are indeterminate and other inputs, such as extremely long-term discount rates for which there is no observable measure, are not reliable.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 161 on how the Audit Committee reviewed D&R provisions.

        "page_content": "## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\n## This is an estimation based on uncertain outcomes. The risk is/uni00A0that/uni00A0forecast taxable profits that support certain deferred tax/uni00A0assets do not materialise.\n\nAs described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2021 Shell recognised gross DTAs of $29.4 billion, which are recognised on the balance sheet as either DTAs or as an/uni00A0offset against deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), depending on the/uni00A0overall tax position in a particular jurisdiction.\n\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of DTA balances is subjective because the estimation requires significant judgement, including the timing of reversals of DTLs and the availability of future profits against which tax deductions represented by the DTA can be offset. In addition, auditing the recognition of DTA balances that are supported by the expectation of future taxable profits arising beyond Shell's regular forecast planning horizon required significant audit judgement, which is heightened in complexity given the future demand and price uncertainty due to climate change and the energy transition (also see climate change and energy transition key audit matter).\n\nA key judgement applied by management in assessing whether it is\n\nappropriate to recognise certain DTAs includes the expectation of probable taxable profits arising beyond Shell's 10-year planning horizon. There is greater uncertainty regarding future taxable profits that exist outside the 10-year planning period and where future taxable profits relate to new and emerging businesses with less history and therefore greater forecasting uncertainty. There is a risk of management bias relating to the use of inappropriate assumptions regarding the future profitability of businesses.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's processes for the recognition and measurement of DTAs. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For example, we tested controls over projections of future taxable income and the deferred tax calculations that support the recognition of DTAs.\n\n## Our audit procedures included, amongst others:\n\n- \u25a0 testing management's forecasted timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences by evaluating the projected sources of taxable income and considering the nature of the temporary differences and the relevant tax law.\n- \u25a0 assessing management's determination of the expected timing of utilisation of the DTAs, including the application of relevant tax laws that apply to the utilisation of tax losses;\n- \u25a0 performing sensitivity analyses over Shell's risk-weighted future taxable profits by/uni00A0jurisdiction, which take into account potential costs of decarbonisation, and reconciled the forecast to that used in other areas of analysis, such as impairment;\n- \u25a0 involving EY auditors with expertise in renewable businesses, including EV charging, in challenging management's assumptions and the outcome of the stress/uni00A0testing performed.\n- \u25a0 evaluating management's negative stress test to assess the tolerance of the estimation uncertainty to further risking. This included specific risking of profits forecast to be generated through new and growing business activities, including biofuels and electric vehicle (EV) charging in jurisdictions; and\n\nOur audit procedures over the recognition and valuation of DTAs were performed by/uni00A0our tax specialist teams in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Qatar, Singapore, the UK and USA. We also performed specified procedures over the recognition and valuation of DTAs in Albania, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Switzerland, Trinidad &/uni00A0Tobago and Tunisia.\n\nIn January 2022, we reported to the AC that the majority of the DTAs are either offset against DTLs or are expected to be recovered from forecast profits within the operating planning horizon. In aggregate, these factors supported 95% of the recognised DTAs. Our audit effort focussed on $0.8 billion of DTAs that are supported by forecast Oil Products and Chemicals taxable profits beyond Shell's planning horizon, as these are significantly more judgemental than setting the DTAs against DTLs or using forecast taxable profits from Shell's operating plan to utilise the DTAs. Whilst the application of risking is judgemental, we satisfied ourselves that management's risking of forecast profit was appropriate to reflect the uncertainty throughout the forecast period.\n\nWe have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to support Shell's recognition of DTAs, although there is a greater degree of judgement required in respect of/uni00A0the $0.8 billion of DTAs where profits beyond Shell's operating plan planning horizon are necessary to support the asset recognition.\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 160 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed certain tax matters, in particular the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY AUDIT MATTERS continued\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION: THE MEASUREMENT OF UNREALISED TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES\n\nDescription of the key audit matter\n\nOur response to the risk\n\nThis is an estimation based on complex and uncertain valuations. There is a risk of error in revenue due to the complexity of Shell's trading and supply function and the volume and complexity of trades that are executed. There is an inherently higher risk of error, of unauthorised trading activity or of deliberate misstatement of the group's overall trading position.\n\nAs described in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2021 Shell recognised $262 billion of revenue. As described in Note 20, Shell recognised derivative financial instrument assets of $12.2 billion and derivative financial instrument liabilities of $17.2 billion.\n\nShell's trading and supply function is integrated within the Oil Products, Chemicals, Integrated Gas and Upstream segments and is spread across multiple regions. Auditing unrealised trading gains and losses is complex because of the significant judgement used in determining the key assumptions used in valuing the trades, the risk of error, of unauthorised trading activity or of deliberate misstatement of Shell's trading positions. Trading is not always carried out in active markets where prices are readily available, increasing subjectivity used in determining the pricing curve and volatility assumptions, which are key inputs to valuing the trades.\n\nIdentifying unrealised trading gains and losses is also complex due to the significant volume of transactions entered into by Shell and the lack of market transparency of executed deals.\n\nThe deliberate misstatement of Shell's trading positions or mismarking of positions could result in understated trading losses, overstated trading profits and/or individual bonuses being manipulated through inappropriate inter-period profit/loss allocations.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Shell Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 the valuation of derivative contracts as at December 31, 2021 was appropriate;\n- In January 2022, we reported to the Audit Committee that:\n- \u25a0 the unrealised gains and losses had been recorded appropriately;\n- \u25a0 our testing did not identify any indications of unauthorised trading activity or deliberate misstatement of Shell's trading positions.\n- \u25a0 our completeness testing did not identify any unrecorded liabilities or significant cut-off issues; and\n\nCross-reference: See the Audit Committee Report on page 161 for details on how the Audit Committee reviewed the Trading and Supply's control framework. Also see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over Shell's process for the recognition of revenue relating to unrealised trading gains and losses, including controls over management's processes around complex deal valuations. We then evaluated the design of these controls and tested their operating effectiveness. For/uni00A0example, we tested controls around the review of pricing curve and volatility assumptions applied in the valuation models.\n\nWe involved professionals with significant experience auditing both large commodity trading organisations and financial institutions. Our audit procedures in respect of the measurement of trading positions included, amongst others:\n\n- \u25a0 testing the pricing curve and volatility assumptions in management's valuation models, including by comparing these to external broker quotes, market consensus providers, and our independent assessments;\n- \u25a0 assessing Shell's valuation methodology against market practice, analysing whether a consistent framework was applied across the business and assessing the consistency of inputs used in deal valuations and other assumptions;\n- \u25a0 involving EY valuation specialists to assist us in performing independent testing of the valuation models of Level 3 contracts, including the valuation of long-dated offtake contracts and those with illiquid tenor or price components. Our valuations were established using independently sourced inputs, where available;\n- \u25a0 gaining an understanding of the commercial rationale of complex deals by analyzing transaction documentation and agreements, and through discussions with management.\n- \u25a0 evaluating contract terms and key assumptions against independent market information, including assessing complex deals for the existence of non-standard contractual terms or features; and\n\nIn addressing the existence and completeness of open trading positions, we focused specifically on over the counter (OTC) physical and financial transactions. Our audit procedures included, amongst others:\n\n- \u25a0 performing additional confirmation testing by obtaining confirmations from key counterparties who had open positions in the prior trading year, but no reported trading positions in the current year; and\n- \u25a0 obtaining external confirmation of a sample of open trading positions with brokers and counterparties and, where necessary, testing the existence of the position by agreement to signed contracts;\n- \u25a0 performing procedures to identify unrecorded liabilities by comparing sales to/uni00A0trade receivables and purchases to trade payables that occurred near the end/uni00A0of/uni00A0the financial year to evaluate whether or not the transactions had been/uni00A0recorded appropriately and in the correct period. We assessed the Level/uni00A03/uni00A0financial statement disclosures.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team and the UK and US component teams.",

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS\n\nAs explained more fully in the statement of Directors' responsibilities set out on page 16, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is/uni00A0necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing Shell and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate Shell or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 11. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## 12. EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT EXTENT OUR AUDIT WAS CONSIDERED CAPABLE OF DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined/uni00A0above, to detect irregularities, including fraud.\n\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for/uni00A0the/uni00A0prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.\n\n## Our approach was as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 We understood how Shell is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company Secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of Board minutes, papers provided to the Audit Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.\n- \u25a0 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to Shell and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards, Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code, the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority) and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which Shell operates. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations that may have an effect on the/uni00A0determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those laws and regulations relating to health and safety, employee matters, environmental, and bribery and corruption practices.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the susceptibility of Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by embedding forensic specialists into our group engagement team. Our forensic specialists worked with the group engagement team to identify the fraud risks across various parts of the business. In addition, we utilised internal and external information to perform a fraud risk assessment for each of the countries of operation. We considered the risk of fraud through management override and, in response, we incorporated data analytics across manual journal entries into our audit approach. We also considered the possibility of fraudulent or corrupt payments made through third parties and/uni00A0conducted detailed analytical testing on third party vendors in high risk jurisdictions. Where instances of risk behaviour patterns were identified through our data analytics, we performed additional audit procedures to address each identified risk. These procedures included the testing of transactions back to source information and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. We also conducted specific audit procedures in relation to the risk of bribery and corruption across various countries of operation determined on a risk-based approach.\n- \u25a0 If any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations were identified, these were communicated to the relevant local EY teams who performed sufficient and appropriate audit procedures, supplemented by audit procedures performed at the group level.\n- \u25a0 Based on the results of our risk assessment we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations identified above. Our procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on journals meeting our defined risk criteria based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit and all full and specific scope management; review of the volume and nature of complaints received by the whistleblowing hotline during the year; review of internal audit reports issued during the year; review of news releases published by external parties; and\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https:// www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

As applied to Shell, there are no material differences from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in/uni00A0accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\nAs described in the accounting policies in Note 2, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain items measured at fair value. Those accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements were approved and authorised for/uni00A0issue by the Board of Directors on March 9, 2022.\n\n## Simplification of share structure\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the shareholders of the Company supported the/uni00A0resolution to amend Shell's Articles of Association to enable the simplification of the Company. The simplification entailed the assimilation of the Company's shares into a single line, the alignment of the Company's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK and granting the Board the power to change the Company's name. On December 20, 2021, the Board decided to proceed with the proposal.\n\n## 2/uni00A0- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThis Note describes Shell's significant accounting policies, which are those relevant to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements. It/uni00A0includes the measurement bases used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. It allows an understanding as to how transactions, other events and conditions are reported. It also describes: (a) judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that management makes in applying the policies that have the most significant effect on the/uni00A0amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and (b)/uni00A0estimations, including assumptions about the future, that management makes in applying the policies. The sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of/uni00A0assets and liabilities within the next financial year are specifically identified as a significant estimate.\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the previous/uni00A0financial year except for the adoption as from January 1, 2021, of/uni00A0amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7) and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16).\n\nThe transition to the accounting pronouncements as listed below has no/uni00A0material impact.\n\n## IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial/uni00A0Instruments:/uni00A0Disclosures/uni00A0and IFRS 16 Leases Inter-Bank Offered Rate (IBOR) Reform - Phase 2\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7, and IFRS 16 complement those amendments effective from January 1, 2020, (IBOR Reform - Phase 1) and/uni00A0focus on the effects of the IBOR reform on a company's financial statements that arise when, for example, an IBOR used to calculate interest on a financial asset is replaced with an alternative benchmark/uni00A0rate.\n\nIn this phase the IASB amended requirements relating to: changes in/uni00A0the/uni00A0basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities; hedge accounting; and disclosures. These amendments apply only to changes required by the IBOR reform to/uni00A0financial instruments and hedging relationships.\n\nThe derivatives hedging Shell's fixed-rate debt will be affected by the market-wide replacement of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) with alternative risk-free reference rates, most significantly by reform of/uni00A0US/uni00A0dollar LIBOR.\n\nShell has established a Group-wide IBOR Transition Project, with oversight from the Group Treasurer. The project spans all business lines and has cross-functional senior governance which includes Legal, IT and Finance, including treasury, tax and accounting experts. During 2021, Shell has put/uni00A0in place detailed plans, processes and procedures to support the transition of the affected portfolio including making changes to systems, processes and risk management, as well as related tax and accounting implications. Shell is confident that it has the operational capability to process the transitions to risk-free rates for those interest rate benchmarks such as USD LIBOR that will cease to be available after 30 June 2023.\n\n## Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US dollars (dollars) and comprise the financial statements of the Company and/uni00A0its/uni00A0subsidiaries, being those entities over which the Company has/uni00A0control, either directly or indirectly, through exposure or rights to/uni00A0their/uni00A0variable returns and the ability to affect those returns through its/uni00A0power over the entities. Information about subsidiaries at December 31,/uni00A02021, can be found in Appendix 1: Significant Subsidiaries and Other/uni00A0Related Undertakings.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained until the date that such control ceases, using consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from such transactions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Non-controlling interest represents the proportion of income, other comprehensive income and net assets in subsidiaries that is not attributable to the Company's shareholders.\n\nt\n\ns",

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at quarter-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (including those in respect of inter-company balances, unless related to loans of a long-term investment nature) are recognised in income unless when recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow or/uni00A0net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses in income are presented within interest and other income or within purchases where not related to financing. Share capital issued in currencies other than the/uni00A0dollar is translated at the exchange rate at the date of issue.\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of non-dollar entities are translated to dollars at year-end rates of exchange, while their statements of income, other comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at quarterly average rates. The resulting translation differences are recognised as currency translation differences within other comprehensive income. Upon/uni00A0sale of all or part of an interest in, or upon liquidation of, an entity, the appropriate portion of cumulative currency translation differences related to that entity is generally recognised in income.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from sales of oil, natural gas, chemicals and other products is recognised at the transaction price to which Shell expects to be entitled, after deducting sales taxes, excise duties and similar levies. For contracts that contain separate performance obligations, the transaction price is/uni00A0allocated to those separate performance obligations by reference to/uni00A0their/uni00A0relative stand-alone selling prices.\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of the products has been transferred to the customer. For sales by Integrated Gas and Upstream operations, this generally occurs when the product is physically transferred into a vessel, pipe or other delivery mechanism; for sales by refining operations, it is either when the product is placed onboard a vessel or offloaded from the vessel, depending on the contractually agreed terms; and for sales of oil products and chemicals, it is either at the point of delivery or the point of receipt, depending on contractual conditions.\n\nRevenue resulting from hydrocarbon production from properties in which Shell has an interest with partners in joint arrangements is recognised on the basis of Shell's volumes lifted and sold. Revenue resulting from the production of oil and natural gas under production-sharing contracts (PSCs) is recognised for those amounts relating to Shell's cost recoveries and Shell's share of the remaining production. Gains and losses on derivative contracts and the revenue and costs associated with other contracts that are classified as held primarily for the purpose of being traded are reported on a net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of hydrocarbons under exchange contracts that are necessary to obtain or reposition feedstocks for oil products manufacturing facility operations are presented net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nRevenue resulting from arrangements that are not considered contracts with customers is presented as revenue from other sources.\n\n## Research and development\n\nDevelopment costs that are expected to generate probable future economic benefits are capitalised as intangible assets. All other research and development expenditure is recognised in income as incurred.\n\n## Exploration costs/uni00A0\n\nHydrocarbon exploration costs are accounted for under the successful efforts method: exploration costs are recognised in income when incurred,/uni00A0except that exploratory drilling costs, including in respect of the recapitalisation of the depreciation, are included in property, plant and equipment pending determination of proved reserves. Exploration costs capitalised in respect of exploration wells that are more than 12 months old are written off unless: (a)/uni00A0proved reserves are booked; or (b)/uni00A0(i)/uni00A0they have found commercially producible quantities of reserves and (ii)/uni00A0they are subject to further exploration or appraisal activity in that either drilling of additional exploratory wells is under way or firmly planned for the near/uni00A0future or other activities are being undertaken to sufficiently progress/uni00A0the assessing of reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project./uni00A0\n\n## Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment comprise assets owned by Shell, assets held by Shell under lease contracts, and assets operated by Shell as contractor in PSCs. They include rights and concessions in respect of properties with proved reserves ('proved properties') and with no proved/uni00A0reserves ('unproved properties'). Property, plant and equipment, including expenditure on major inspections, and intangible assets are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost where it is probable that they will generate future economic benefits. This includes capitalisation of decommissioning and restoration costs associated with provisions for asset retirement (see 'provisions'), certain development costs (see 'research and development') and the effects of associated cash/uni00A0flow hedges (see 'financial instruments') as applicable. Interest is capitalised as an increase in property, plant and equipment, on major capital projects during construction. The accounting for exploration costs/uni00A0is described separately (see 'exploration costs'). Intangible assets/uni00A0include goodwill, liquefied natural gas (LNG) off-take and sales/uni00A0contracts obtained through acquisition, environmental certificates,/uni00A0software costs/uni00A0and trademarks.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortisation (including any impairment). Gains and losses on sale are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amounts of assets sold and are/uni00A0recognised in income, within interest and other income.\n\nAn asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use, which is when the sale is highly probable, and it is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Assets classified as held for sale are/uni00A0measured at the lower of the carrying amount upon classification and/uni00A0the fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale and/uni00A0the associated liabilities are presented separately from other assets/uni00A0and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Once assets are/uni00A0classified as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are no longer subject to depreciation or amortisation.\n\n## Depreciation, depletion and amortisation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment related to hydrocarbon production activities are in principle depreciated on a unit-of-production basis over the proved developed reserves of the field concerned, other than assets whose useful lives differ from the lifetime of the field which are depreciated applying the straight-line method. However, for certain Integrated Gas and Upstream assets, the use for this purpose of proved developed reserves, which are determined using the SEC-mandated yearly average oil and gas prices, would result in depreciation charges for these assets",

Therefore, in these instances, other approaches are applied to determine the reserves base for the purpose of calculating depreciation, such as using management's expectations of future oil and/uni00A0gas prices rather than yearly average prices, or total proved reserves/uni00A0to provide a phasing of periodic depreciation charges that more/uni00A0appropriately reflects the expected utilisation of the assets concerned. (See Note 9)\n\nRights and concessions in respect of proved properties are depleted on the unit-of-production basis over the total proved reserves of the relevant area. Where individually insignificant, unproved properties may be grouped and depreciated based on factors such as the average concession term and past experience of recognising proved reserves.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment held under lease contracts and capitalised LNG off-take and sales contracts are depreciated or amortised over the term of the respective contract. Other property, plant and equipment and/uni00A0intangible assets are depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis/uni00A0over their estimated useful lives, except for goodwill, which is not amortised. They include oil products manufacturing facilities and chemical plants (for which the useful life is generally 20 years), retail service stations (15 years), and major inspection costs, which are depreciated over the estimated period before the next planned major inspection (three to five/uni00A0years).\n\nOn classification of an asset as held for sale, depreciation ceases.\n\nEstimates of the useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed annually and adjusted if/uni00A0appropriate.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is tested for impairment annually; in/uni00A0addition, assets other than unproved properties (see 'exploration costs') are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those assets may/uni00A0not/uni00A0be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the/uni00A0carrying amounts of those assets are written down to their recoverable/uni00A0amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of/uni00A0disposal/uni00A0(see 'fair/uni00A0value measurements') and value in use.\n\nValue in use is determined as the amount of estimated risk-adjusted discounted future cash flows. For this purpose, assets are grouped into cash-generating units based on separately identifiable and largely independent cash inflows. Estimates of future cash flows used in the evaluation of impairment of assets are made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply and demand, potential costs/uni00A0associated with operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, mainly related to CO/uni2082, and forecast product and refining margins. In addition, management takes into consideration the expected useful lives of the manufacturing facilities, exploration and production assets, and expected production volumes. The latter takes into account assessments of/uni00A0field and reservoir performance and includes expectations about both proved reserves and volumes that are expected to constitute proved reserves in the future (unproved volumes), which are risk-weighted utilising geological, production, recovery and economic projections. Cash flow projections are based on management's most recent operating plan that represents management's best estimate and are risked as appropriate. The discount rate is based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost of/uni00A0capital (WACC). Prior to 2021, cash flow estimates were discounted\n\nat/uni00A0a rate based on Shell's marginal cost of debt. The change in discount rate to a nominal post-tax WACC has been reflected in a commensurate manner in the risk adjustments to cash flow projections. Using a post-tax discount rate to calculate value in use does not result in a materially different outcome than using a pre-tax discount rate. (See Note 9)\n\nImpairments, except those related to goodwill, are reversed as applicable to the extent that the events or circumstances that triggered the original impairment have changed.\n\nImpairment losses and reversals are reported within depreciation, depletion and amortisation.\n\nUpon classification of an asset as held for sale, the carrying amount is/uni00A0impaired if this exceeds the fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Judgements and estimates\n\nUnit-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are principally measured based on management's estimates of proved developed oil and gas reserves. Also, exploration drilling costs are capitalised pending the results of further exploration or appraisal activity, which may take several years to complete, and before any related proved reserves can be booked.\n\n## Proved oil and gas reserves\n\nProved reserves are estimated by a central group of reserves experts. The estimated proved reserves are determined by reference to available geological and engineering data and only include volumes for which access to market is assured with reasonable certainty. Yearly average oil and gas prices are applied in the determination of proved reserves. Estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject to regular revision, either upward or downward, based on new information such as from the drilling of additional wells, observation of long-term reservoir performance under producing conditions and changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract terms, legislation or development plans.\n\nChanges to estimates of proved developed reserves affect prospectively the amounts of depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged and, consequently, the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets. Generally, in the normal course of business the diversity of the asset portfolio will limit the net effect of such revisions. The outcome of, or assessment of plans for, exploration or appraisal activity may result in the related capitalised exploration drilling costs being recognised in income in that period.\n\nJudgement is involved in determining when to use an alternative reserves base in order to appropriately reflect the expected utilisation of the assets concerned (see 'depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\nInformation about the carrying amounts of exploration and production assets and the amounts charged to income, including depreciation, depletion and amortisation and the quantitative impact of the use of/uni00A0an alternative reserves base, is presented in Note 9.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n\n## 2/uni00A0- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES continued\n\n## Judgements and estimates continued\n\nFor the purposes of determining whether impairment of assets has occurred, and the extent of any impairment loss or its reversal, the key assumptions management uses in estimating risk-adjusted future cash flows for value in use measures are future oil and gas prices and refining margins. In addition, management uses other assumptions such as potential costs associated with operational GHG emissions and expected production volumes appropriate to the local circumstances and environment. These assumptions and the judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new information becomes available. Changes in assumptions could affect the carrying amounts of assets, and any impairment losses and reversals will affect income. Changes in economic conditions can affect the rate used to discount future cash flow estimates or the risk-adjustment in the future cash flows. Judgement is applied to conclude whether changes in assumptions or economic conditions are an indicator that an asset may/uni00A0be impaired or that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods/uni00A0may no longer exist, or may have decreased.\n\n## Impairment\n\nExpected production volumes, which comprise proved reserves and unproved volumes, are used for impairment testing because management believes this to be the most appropriate indicator of expected future cash/uni00A0flows. As discussed in 'Proved oil and gas reserves' above, reserves/uni00A0estimates are inherently imprecise. Furthermore, projections about unproved volumes are based on information that is necessarily less/uni00A0robust than that available for mature reservoirs.\n\nEstimation is involved with respect to the expected life of oil products manufacturing facilities and chemicals plants, and also including management's view on the future development of refining margins.\n\nThe determination of cash-generating units requires judgement. Changes in this determination could impact the calculation of value in/uni00A0use and therefore the conclusion on the recoverability of assets' carrying amounts when performing an impairment test.\n\nJudgement, which is subject to change as new information becomes available, can be required in determining when an asset is classified as/uni00A0held for sale. A/uni00A0change in that judgement could result in impairment charges affecting income, depending on whether classification requires a write-down of the asset to its fair value less costs to sell.\n\nIn assessing the value in use, the estimated risk-adjusted future post-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects Shell's post-tax WACC. The discount rate applied does not reflect asset-specific risks for which future cash flow estimates have been adjusted.\n\n## Significant estimates\n\nFuture commodity price assumptions used in the impairment testing in Integrated Gas and Upstream (see Note 9) are regularly assessed by management, noting that management does not necessarily consider short-term increases or decreases in prices as being indicative of long-term levels.\n\nUntil 2019, management's estimate of longer-term refining margins used in the impairment testing in Oil Products was based on the reversion to mean methodology, unless a fundamental shift in markets had been identified, over the life of the oil products manufacturing facilities. Under this approach, it was assumed that refining margins would revert to historical averages over time. As from 2020, a different/uni00A0price methodology applies, based on Shell management's understanding and interpretation of demand and supply fundamentals in the near term and taking into account various other factors such as/uni00A0industry rationalisation and energy transition in the long term.\n\nFuture commodity prices and refining margins used in impairment testing provide a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in/uni00A0paragraph 125 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (IAS/uni00A01.125).\n\nInformation about the carrying amounts of assets and impairments and/uni00A0their sensitivity to changes in significant estimates is presented in/uni00A0Notes 8 and 9.\n\n## Leases/uni00A0\n\nA contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for payments to be made to the owners (lessors) is accounted for as a lease. Contracts are assessed to determine whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception of a contract or when the terms and conditions of a contract are/uni00A0significantly changed. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of/uni00A0a/uni00A0lease, together with contractual options to extend or to terminate the/uni00A0lease early, where it is reasonably certain that an extension option will/uni00A0be exercised or a termination option will not be exercised.\n\nAt the commencement of a lease contract, a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised, unless the lease term is 12/uni00A0months or less. The commencement date of a lease is the date on which/uni00A0the underlying asset is made available for use. The lease liability is/uni00A0measured at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date. The lease liability includes contingent rentals and variable lease payments that depend on an index, rate, or where they are fixed payments in substance. The lease liability is remeasured when the contractual cash flows of/uni00A0variable lease payments change due to a change in an index or/uni00A0rate/uni00A0when the lease term changes following a reassessment.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate is not readily available, the incremental borrowing rate is applied. The incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment.\n\nIn general, a corresponding right-of-use asset is recognised for an amount equal to each lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any pre-paid lease/uni00A0payment relating to the specific lease contract. The depreciation on/uni00A0right-of-use assets is recognised in income unless capitalised as exploration drilling cost (see 'exploration cost') or capitalised when the/uni00A0right-of-use asset is used to construct another asset.\n\nWhere Shell is the lessor in a lease arrangement at inception, the lease arrangement will be classified as a finance lease or an operating lease. Classification is based on the extent to which the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset lie with the lessor or/uni00A0the/uni00A0lessee.",

        "page_content": "Where Shell, usually in its capacity as operator, has entered into a lease contract on behalf of a joint arrangement, a lease liability is recognised to/uni00A0the extent that Shell has primary responsibility for the lease liability. A/uni00A0finance sublease is subsequently recognised if the related right-of-use asset is subleased to the joint arrangement. This is usually the case when/uni00A0the joint arrangement has the right to direct the use and obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from using the asset.\n\n## Impairment of the right-of-use asset\n\nRight-of-use assets are subject to existing impairment requirements as/uni00A0set/uni00A0out in 'property, plant and equipment' (see Note 9).\n\n## Judgements and estimates\n\nA lease term includes optional lease periods where it is reasonably certain Shell will exercise the option to extend or not exercise the option to terminate the lease. Determination of the lease term is subject/uni00A0to judgement and has an impact on the measurement of the lease liability and related right-of-use asset. When assessing the lease term at the commencement date, Shell takes into consideration the broader economics of the contract. Reassessment of the lease term is/uni00A0performed upon changes in circumstances that may affect the probability that an option to extend or to terminate the lease will/uni00A0be/uni00A0exercised.\n\nWhere the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available, an incremental borrowing rate is applied. This incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-use asset in/uni00A0a similar economic environment. Determination of the incremental borrowing rate requires estimation.\n\n## Joint arrangements and associates/uni00A0\n\nArrangements under which Shell has contractually agreed to share control (see 'Nature of the Consolidated Financial Statements' for the definition of control) with another party or parties are joint ventures where the parties have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, or joint operations where the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Investments in entities over which Shell has/uni00A0the right to exercise significant influence but neither control nor joint control are classified as associates. Information about incorporated joint arrangements and associates at December 31, 2021, can be found in Appendix 1: Significant Subsidiaries and Other Related Undertakings.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method, under which the investment is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Shell share of post-acquisition income less dividends received and the Shell share of other comprehensive income and other movements in equity, together with any loans of a long-term investment nature. Where necessary, adjustments are made to/uni00A0the financial statements of joint ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of Shell. In an exchange of assets and liabilities for an interest in a joint venture, the non-Shell share of any excess of the fair value of the assets and liabilities transferred over the pre-exchange carrying amounts is recognised in income. Unrealised gains on other transactions between Shell and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of Shell's interest in them; unrealised losses are treated similarly but may also result in an assessment of whether the asset transferred is impaired.\n\nShell recognises its assets and liabilities relating to its interests in joint operations, including its share of assets held jointly and liabilities incurred jointly with other partners.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost comprises direct purchase costs (including transportation), and associated costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present condition and location, and is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method for oil, gas and chemicals and by the weighted average cost method for materials.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe charge for current tax is calculated based on the income reported by/uni00A0the Company and its subsidiaries, as adjusted for items that are non-taxable or disallowed and using rates that have been enacted or/uni00A0substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is determined, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and/uni00A0their/uni00A0carrying amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and/uni00A0on/uni00A0unused/uni00A0tax losses and credits carried forward.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when an asset is/uni00A0realised or a liability is settled. They are not recognised where they arise/uni00A0on the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction (other than in a business combination) that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, or in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where the reversal of the respective temporary difference can be controlled by Shell and it is probable that it will not reverse in the/uni00A0foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that/uni00A0future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward can/uni00A0be utilised.\n\nIncome tax receivables and payables as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities include provisions for uncertain income tax positions/treatments.\n\nIncome taxes are recognised in income except when they relate to items recognised in other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income. Income tax assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except where there is a right of offset within fiscal jurisdictions and an intention to settle such balances on a net basis.\n\nt\n\ns",

In such cases, provision is made for the amount that is expected to be settled, where this can be reasonably estimated. Provisions for uncertain income tax positions/treatments are measured at the most likely amount or the expected value, whichever method is more appropriate. Generally, uncertain tax treatments are assessed on an individual basis, except where they are expected to be settled collectively. It is assumed that taxing authorities will examine positions taken if they have the right to/uni00A0do so and that they have full knowledge of the relevant information. A/uni00A0change in estimate of the likelihood of a future outflow and/or in the/uni00A0expected amount to be settled would be recognised in income in/uni00A0the period in which the change occurs. This requires the application of judgement as to the ultimate outcome, which can change over time depending on facts and circumstances. Judgements mainly relate to transfer pricing, including inter-company financing, interpretation of PSCs, expenditure deductible for tax purposes and taxation arising on/uni00A0disposal.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves an assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the assets when they do reverse. This requires assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. To the extent assumptions regarding future profitability change, there can be an increase or decrease in the amounts recognised in respect of deferred tax assets as well as in the amounts recognised in income in the period in which the change occurs.\n\nTaxation information, including charges and deferred tax assets and liabilities, is presented in Note 17. Income taxes include taxes at higher rates levied on income from certain Integrated Gas and Upstream activities.\n\n## Retirement benefits/uni00A0\n\nBenefits in the form of retirement pensions and health care and life insurance are provided to certain employees and retirees under defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\nObligations under defined benefit plans are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, which takes into account employees' years of service and, for pensions, average or final pensionable remuneration, and are discounted to their present value using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and of a duration consistent with the plan obligations. Where plans are funded, payments are made to/uni00A0independently managed trusts; assets held by those trusts are measured at fair value. Defined benefit plan surpluses are recognised as/uni00A0assets to the extent that they are considered recoverable, which is generally by way of a refund or lower future employer contributions.\n\nThe amounts recognised in income in respect of defined benefit plans mainly comprise service cost and net interest. Service cost comprises principally the increase in the present value of the obligation for benefits resulting from employee service during the period (current service cost) and also amounts relating to past service and settlements or amendments of plans. Plan amendments are changes to benefits and are generally\n\nrecognised when all legal and regulatory approvals have been received/uni00A0and the effects have been communicated to members. Net/uni00A0interest is calculated using the net defined benefit liability or asset/uni00A0matched against the discount rate yield curve at the beginning of/uni00A0each year for each plan. Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability or asset resulting from actuarial gains and losses, and the return on/uni00A0plan assets excluding the amount recognised in income, are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, pension expense represents the amount of/uni00A0employer contributions payable for the period.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimates\n\nDefined benefit obligations and plan assets, and the resulting liabilities and assets that are recognised, require significant estimation as these are subject to volatility as (actuarial) assumptions regarding future outcomes and market values change. Substantial judgement is required in determining the actuarial assumptions, which vary for the different plans to reflect local conditions but are determined under a/uni00A0common process in consultation with independent actuaries. The/uni00A0assumptions applied in respect of each plan are reviewed annually and adjusted where necessary to reflect changes in experience and actuarial recommendations.\n\nActuarial assumptions applied in determining defined benefit obligations provide a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in IAS 1.125.\n\nInformation about the amounts reported in respect of defined benefit pension plans, assumptions applicable to the principal plans and their sensitivity to changes in significant estimates is presented in Note 18.\n\n## Provisions/uni00A0\n\nProvisions are recognised at the balance sheet date at management's best/uni00A0estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. Non-current amounts are discounted at a rate intended to reflect the time value of money. The carrying amounts of provisions and the discount rate applied are regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts or changes in/uni00A0law, technology or financial markets.\n\nProvisions for decommissioning and restoration costs, which arise principally in connection with hydrocarbon production facilities, oil products manufacturing facilities and pipelines, are measured on the basis of current requirements, technology and price levels; the present value is calculated using amounts discounted over the useful economic life of the assets. The liability is recognised (together with a corresponding amount as part of the related property, plant and equipment) once a legal or constructive obligation arises to dismantle an item of property, plant and/uni00A0equipment and to restore the site on which it is located and when a/uni00A0reasonable estimate can be made. The effects of changes resulting from/uni00A0revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of the provision are reflected on a prospective basis, generally by adjustment to/uni00A0the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment. However, where there is no related asset, or the change reduces the carrying amount to nil, the effect, or the amount in excess of the reduction/uni00A0in the related asset to nil, is recognised in income.\n\nShell reviews its oil products manufacturing facilities and chemical plants on a regular basis to determine whether any changes in assumptions, including expected life, trigger the need to recognise a provision for decommissioning and restoration.",

        "page_content": "Redundancy provisions are recognised when a detailed formal plan identifies the business or part of the business concerned, the location and number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the associated costs and an appropriate timeline, and the employees affected have been notified of the plan's main features.\n\nAn onerous contract provision is recognised when the unavoidable cost of meeting the obligations under the contract exceeds the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable cost under a contract is/uni00A0the lower of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any compensation or/uni00A0penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. The cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. Before an onerous provision is recognised Shell first recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract.\n\nOther provisions are recognised in income in the period in which an obligation arises and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Provisions are measured based on current legal requirements and existing technology where applicable. Recognition of any joint and several liability is based on management's best estimate of the final pro rata share of the liability. Provisions are determined independently of expected insurance recoveries. Recoveries are recognised when virtually certain of realisation.\n\n## Estimates\n\nEstimates of provisions for future decommissioning and restoration costs are recognised and based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology and price levels. Because actual cash outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take account of such changes.\n\n## Significant estimate\n\nThe discount rate applied to reflect the time value of money in the carrying amount of provisions requires estimation. The discount rate/uni00A0applied is reviewed regularly and adjusted following changes in/uni00A0market rates.\n\nThe discount rate applied to determine the carrying amount of provisions provides a source of estimation uncertainty as referred to in/uni00A0IAS 1.125.\n\nInformation about decommissioning and restoration provisions and their/uni00A0sensitivity to changes in estimates is presented in Note 19.\n\n## Financial instruments/uni00A0\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet except where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and Shell has the intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Financial Assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified at initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets is determined by the contractual cash flows and where applicable the business model for managing the financial assets.\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortised cost, if the objective of the business model is to hold the financial asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. It is initially recognised at fair value plus or minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset. Subsequently the financial asset is measured using the effective interest method less any impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.\n\nAll equity instruments and other debt instruments are recognised at fair value. For equity instruments, on initial recognition, an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) can be made to designate these as/uni00A0at fair value through other comprehensive income instead of fair value/uni00A0through profit or loss. Dividends received on equity instruments are/uni00A0recognised as other income in profit or loss when the right of payment has/uni00A0been established, except when Shell benefits from such proceeds as/uni00A0a/uni00A0recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case such/uni00A0gains are recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Investments in securities\n\nInvestments in securities ('securities') comprise equity and debt securities. Equity securities are carried at fair value. Generally, unrealised holding gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are transferred to retained earnings. Debt securities are generally carried at fair value with unrealised holding gains and losses recognised in/uni00A0other comprehensive income. On sale, net gains and losses previously accumulated in other comprehensive income are recognised in income.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe expected credit loss model is applied for recognition and measurement of impairments in financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The expected credit loss model is also applied for financial guarantee contracts to which IFRS 9 applies and which are not accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses. If the credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance for the financial asset is measured at an amount equal to/uni00A0the lifetime expected credit losses. Changes in loss allowances are/uni00A0recognised in profit or loss. For trade receivables, a simplified impairment approach is applied recognising expected lifetime losses/uni00A0from/uni00A0initial recognition.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, including offsetting bank overdrafts, short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments that generally have a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.\n\n## Financial Liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, unless they are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss, such as instruments held for trading, or Shell has opted to measure them at fair value through profit or loss. Debt and trade payables are recognised initially at fair value based on amounts exchanged, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost except for fixed rate debt subject to fair value hedging which is remeasured for the hedged risk (see/uni00A0below). Interest expense on debt is accounted for using the effective interest method, and other than interest capitalised, is recognised in/uni00A0income. For financial liabilities that are measured under the fair value/uni00A0option, the change in the fair value related to own credit risk is/uni00A0recognised in other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value/uni00A0change is recognised at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n\n## 2/uni00A0- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES continued\n\nDerivative contracts are used in the management of interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk, and foreign currency cash balances. Derivatives that are not closely related to the host contract in terms of economic characteristics and risks and the host contract of which/uni00A0is not a financial asset are separated from their host contract and/uni00A0recognised at fair value with the associated gains and losses recognised in income.\n\n## Derivative contracts and hedges\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash are accounted for as financial instruments, with the exception of those contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with Shell's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognised in income.\n\nCertain derivative contracts qualify and are designated either: as a fair value hedge of the change in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment; or as a cash flow hedge for the change in cash flows to be received or paid relating to a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction; or as a net investment hedge of the change in foreign exchange rates associated with net investments in foreign operations with a different functional currency than/uni00A0Shell's functional currency.\n\nA change in the fair value of a hedging instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recognised in income, together with the consequential adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item. The effective portion of a change in fair value of a derivative contract designated as a/uni00A0cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income until the/uni00A0hedged transaction occurs; any ineffective portion is recognised in income. Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset or liability, the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income is transferred to the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability (reclassified to the balance sheet); a net investment hedge is accounted for similarly to a cash flow hedge. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the income statements. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement.\n\nThe effective portion of a change due to retranslation at quarter-end exchange rates in the carrying amount of debt and the principal amount of derivative contracts used to hedge net investments in foreign operations is recognised in other comprehensive income until the related investment is/uni00A0sold or liquidated; any ineffective portion is recognised in income.\n\nAll relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items are documented, as well as risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. The effectiveness of hedges is also continually assessed and hedge accounting is discontinued when there/uni00A0is/uni00A0a change in the risk management strategy.\n\nUnless designated as hedging instruments, contracts to sell or purchase non-financial items that can be settled net as if the contracts were financial/uni00A0instruments and that do not meet expected own-use requirements (typically, forward sale and purchase contracts for commodities in trading operations), and contracts that are or contain written options, are recognised at fair value; associated gains and losses/uni00A0are recognised in income.\n\nDerivatives that are held primarily for the purpose of trading are presented as current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Judgements\n\nJudgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell LNG are capable of being settled on a net basis. Due to the limited liquidity in the LNG market and the lack of net settlement history, contracts to buy or sell LNG are not considered capable of being settled on a net basis. As a result, these contracts are accounted for/uni00A0on/uni00A0an accrual basis and not as a financial instrument.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nFair value measurements are estimates of the amounts for which assets or/uni00A0liabilities could be transferred at the measurement date, based on the/uni00A0assumption that such transfers take place between participants in/uni00A0principal markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best use/uni00A0into/uni00A0account.\n\n## Estimates\n\nWhere available, fair value measurements are derived from prices quoted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. In the absence of such information, other observable inputs are used to/uni00A0estimate fair value. Inputs derived from external sources are corroborated or otherwise verified, as appropriate. In the absence of publicly available information, fair value is determined using estimation techniques that take into account market perspectives relevant to the asset or liability, in as far as they can reasonably be ascertained, based on predominantly unobservable inputs. For derivative contracts where publicly available information is not available, fair value estimations are generally determined using models and other valuation methods, the key inputs for which include future prices, volatility, price correlation, counterparty credit risk and market liquidity, as appropriate; for other assets and liabilities, fair value estimations are/uni00A0generally based on the net present value of expected future cash/uni00A0flows.\n\n## Share-based compensation plans/uni00A0\n\nThe fair value of share-based compensation expense arising from the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) -/uni00A0Shell's main equity-settled plans - is estimated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model and is recognised in income from the date of grant over the vesting period with a corresponding increase directly in equity. The model projects and averages the results for a range of potential outcomes for the vesting conditions, the principal assumptions for which are the share price volatility and dividend yields for Shell and four of its main competitors over the last three years and the last 10 years.\n\n## Shares held in trust/uni00A0\n\nShares in the Company, which are held by employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities, are not included in assets but are reflected at/uni00A0cost as a deduction from equity as shares held in trust.\n\n## Acquisitions and sales of interests in a business/uni00A0\n\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed when control is obtained over a business, and when an interest or an additional interest is acquired in a joint operation which is a business, are recognised at their fair value at the date of the acquisition; the amount of the purchase consideration above this value is recognised as goodwill. When control is obtained, any non-controlling interest is recognised as the proportionate share of the identifiable net assets. The acquisition of a non-controlling interest in a",

The difference between the purchase consideration or sale proceeds after tax and the relevant proportion of the/uni00A0non-controlling interest, measured by reference to the carrying amount of the interest's net assets at the date of acquisition or sale, is recognised in/uni00A0retained earnings as a movement in equity attributable to Shell plc/uni00A0shareholders.\n\n## Emission schemes and related environmental programmes\n\nEmission certificates, biofuel certificates and renewable power certificates (together 'environmental certificates') held for trading purposes are recognised at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower, and classified under inventory.\n\n## Emission trading schemes\n\nEmission certificates acquired for compliance purposes are initially recognised at cost and classified under intangible assets. In the schemes where a cap is set for emissions, the associated emission certificates granted are recognised at cost, which may be zero. An emission liability is/uni00A0recognised under other liabilities when actual emissions occur that give rise to an obligation. To the extent the liability is covered by emission certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to the value of these emission certificates held and for the remaining uncovered portion at market value. The associated expense is/uni00A0presented under 'production and manufacturing expenses'. Both the/uni00A0emission certificates and the emission liability are derecognised upon/uni00A0settling the liability with the respective regulator.\n\n## Biofuel programmes\n\nBiofuel certificates acquired that are held for compliance purposes are/uni00A0initially recognised at cost under intangible assets. Self-generated biofuel certificates are recognised at nil value, as they primarily offset the obligation. A biofuel liability is recognised under other liabilities when the obligation arises under local regulations. To the extent covered by biofuel certificates held for compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to the value of these certificates held and for the remaining uncovered portion at market value. Biofuel certificates and the biofuel liability are both derecognised upon settling the liability with the respective regulator.\n\n## Renewable power programmes\n\nRenewable power certificates acquired for compliance purposes are/uni00A0initially recognised at cost as an intangible asset. Self-generated renewable power certificates are generally transferred to the customer upon sales of electricity. A renewable power liability is recognised under/uni00A0other liabilities when electricity sales take place that give rise to/uni00A0an/uni00A0obligation to retire renewable power certificates. The associated cost is/uni00A0recognised in 'Purchases' in the income statement. If the obligation relates to power consumed in business operations, it is presented in other/uni00A0liabilities with cost reflected in 'Production and manufacturing expenses'. To the extent covered by renewable power certificates held/uni00A0for/uni00A0compliance purposes, the liability is measured with reference to/uni00A0the/uni00A0value of these renewable power certificates and for the remaining uncovered portion at market value. Renewable power certificates and/uni00A0the/uni00A0renewable power liability are derecognised upon settling the/uni00A0liability with the respective regulator.\n\n## Consolidated Statement of Income presentation/uni00A0\n\nPurchases reflect all costs related to the acquisition of inventories and the/uni00A0effects of the changes therein, and include associated costs incurred in/uni00A0conversion into/uni00A0finished or intermediate products. Production and manufacturing expenses are the costs of operating, maintaining and managing production/uni00A0and manufacturing assets. Selling, distribution and/uni00A0administrative expenses include direct and indirect costs of marketing/uni00A0and selling products.\n\n## 3/uni00A0- CHANGES TO IFRS NOT YET ADOPTED Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment (IAS 16))\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, any proceeds and related costs from selling items produced while bringing property, plant and equipment classified as assets under construction to the location and condition necessary for it/uni00A0to/uni00A0be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are/uni00A0recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income in accordance with applicable accounting policies.\n\nThese amendments are applied retrospectively, but only to items of property, plant and equipment on or after the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements in which the entity first applies the amendments.\n\nBased on the assessment performed, this accounting policy change has no material impact.\n\n## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes (IAS 12))\n\nIn May 2021, amendments to IAS 12 were published to require companies to recognise deferred tax on particular transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. The amendments will typically apply to transactions where assets and liabilities are recognised from a single transaction, such as leases for the lessee and decommissioning and restoration obligations.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on/uni00A0or after January 1, 2023, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis.\n\nShell is in the process of evaluating the impact of these amendments. They are not expected to have a significant effect on future financial reporting.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (IAS 37))\n\nThe amendments to IAS 37 add additional clarity on which costs an entity includes when assessing whether a contract is onerous. The amendments specify that the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. Those costs include both incremental costs and an/uni00A0allocation of other costs as long as these relate directly to fulfilling a/uni00A0contract.\n\nThe amendments are effective from January 1, 2022, and apply to/uni00A0all/uni00A0contracts within the scope of IAS 37. These amendments have no/uni00A0material impact.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (IFRS 17)\n\nIFRS 17 was issued in 2017, with amendments published in 2020 and 2021, and is required to be adopted for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The IFRS 17 model combines a/uni00A0current balance sheet measurement of insurance contracts with recognition of profit over the period that services are provided. The general model in the standard requires insurance contract liabilities to/uni00A0be/uni00A0measured using probability-weighted current estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment for risk, and a contractual service margin representing the profit expected from fulfilling the contracts. Effects of/uni00A0changes in the estimates of future cash flows and the risk adjustment relating to future services are recognised over the period services are provided rather than immediately in profit or loss. Shell is in the process of/uni00A0evaluating the initial impact of this standard.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## continued\n\n## 4 - CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nIn 2021, Shell launched its Powering Progress strategy to accelerate the transition of its business to net-zero emissions, including targets to reduce the carbon intensity of energy products sold (Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) by 6-8% by 2023, 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035, and 100% by 2050, in step with society. In October 2021, Shell announced a new target to halve the absolute emissions from its operations and the energy it buys to run them by 2030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. This additional target will help Shell to step up the pace of change to become a net-zero emissions energy business.\n\nThis note describes how Shell has considered climate-related impacts in some key areas of the financial statements and how this translates into the valuation of assets and measurement of liabilities as Shell makes progress in the energy transition.\n\nNote 2 Significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates describes uncertainties, including those that have the potential to have a material effect on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the next 12 months. This note describes the key areas of climate impacts that potentially have short- and longer-term effects on amounts recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021. Where relevant, this note contains references to other notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and aims to provide an overarching summary.\n\n## Financial planning and assumptions\n\nThis section provides an overview of how key assumptions that underpin these financial statements interact with scenarios. Subsequently, the/uni00A0sensitivity of carrying amounts to commodity prices, if different assumptions were applied, is described.\n\nThere is no one single scenario that underpins the financial statements. Shell's scenarios are designed to challenge management's perspectives on/uni00A0the future business environment and stretch management to consider even events that may be only remotely possible. As a result, scenarios are/uni00A0not intended to be predictions of likely future events or outcomes and/uni00A0are not/uni00A0the basis for Shell's financial statements and operating plans.\n\nShell scenarios (see 'About this Report' on page iii) and the range of possible outcomes inform the development of Shell's strategy and Shell's view on future oil and gas price outlooks. These oil and gas price outlooks are one of the key assumptions that underpin Shell's financial statements. Shell's scenarios inform high-, mid- and low-price outlooks. The mid-price outlook represents management's reasonable best estimate and is the basis for Shell's financial statements, operating plans and impairment testing.\n\nShell's targets to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by/uni00A02030, compared with 2016 levels on a net basis, and 20% reduction of/uni00A0net carbon intensity of Scope 3 emissions by 2030, have been included in Shell's operating plan. The operating plan also includes expected cost for evolving carbon regulations based on a forecast of Shell's equity share/uni00A0of emissions from operated and non-operated assets also taking into/uni00A0account the estimated impact of free allowances. Carbon cost estimates are forecasted on a country-by-country basis and range from/uni00A0around $25 to around $200 per tonne of GHG emissions in 2030.\n\nThe financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future. Shell/uni00A0will continue to update its operating plan, pricing outlooks and assumptions that it uses, to take account of changes in the economic environment and the pace of the energy transition.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment and joint ventures and/uni00A0associates\n\nAs noted, in accordance with IFRS, Shell's financial statements are based on/uni00A0reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future. The mid-price outlook informed by Shell's scenario planning represents management's best estimate. Impairment sensitivities of/uni00A0-10% or +10% to the mid-price outlook, as an average percentage over/uni00A0the full period are provided in Note 9 Property, plant and equipment. They would result in around $12-15 billion impairment or of some $6-9/uni00A0billion impairment reversal respectively in Integrated Gas and Upstream.\n\n## Price sensitivities using climate pricelines\n\nThe energy transition is expected to bring volatility and there is large/uni00A0uncertainty as to how commodity prices will develop over the next/uni00A0decades. Some price lines see a structural lower price during the/uni00A0transition period, while other price lines see structural higher commodity prices as a/uni00A0result of changes in both supply and demand. As/uni00A0the risk of stranded assets is prevalent with downside price risk in energy transition scenarios, sensitivities have only been undertaken for/uni00A0such downside scenarios. If/uni00A0different price outlooks from external and/uni00A0often normative climate change scenarios were used, this would impact the recoverability of/uni00A0certain assets recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as/uni00A0at/uni00A0December 31, 2021. These external scenarios are not/uni00A0representative/uni00A0of/uni00A0management's mid-price reasonable best estimate.\n\nSensitivity of carrying amounts to prices described below is under the/uni00A0assumption that all other factors in the models used to calculate recoverability of carrying amounts remain unchanged. Changes to prices are/uni00A0applied because of the significant impact on Shell's business. It should be/uni00A0noted that a significant decrease in long-term forecasted prices would probably lead to further changes, such as in portfolio choices and cost levels.\n\nPriceline 1 - Average prices from four 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate change scenarios: in view of the broad range of price outlooks across the various scenarios, the average of four external price outlooks was taken:\n\n- \u25a0 Woodmac WM AET-2 degree - under this scenario oil prices (RT21) gradually decrease towards $10/b in 2050. Gas prices (RT21) gradually increase towards 2050 to some $4/MMBtu for Henry Hub. For Asia and Europe, gas prices (RT21) increase to some $8/MMBtu around 2040, gradually decreasing towards 2050 to $6/MMBtu for/uni00A0Asia and $5/MMBtu for Europe.\n- \u25a0 IHS Markit / ACCS 2021 - under this scenario oil prices (real terms 2021 (RT21)) gradually decrease towards $20 per barrel (/b) in 2039, recovering to $46/b in 2046 and decreasing again towards $40/b in/uni00A02050. Gas prices (RT21) gradually increase towards 2050 to some/uni00A0$3 per million British thermal units (/MMBtu) for Henry Hub and/uni00A0$6/MMBtu for Asia and Europe.\n- \u25a0 IEA NZE50 - under this scenario oil prices (RT21) gradually decrease towards $25/b in 2050. Gas prices (RT21) are around $2/MMBtu for Henry Hub. For Asia and Europe gas prices (RT21) decrease to some $4/MMBtu around 2040, with further slight decreases towards 2050.\n- \u25a0 IEA SDS - under this scenario oil prices (RT21) gradually increase towards $56/b in 2030, and gradually decrease to $50/b in 2050. Gas prices (RT21) are around $2/MMBtu for Henry Hub. For Asia gas prices (RT21) decrease to around $5/MMBtu in 2050. For Europe gas prices (RT21) are slightly above $4/MMBtu for the whole period.",

The development of future oil prices is uncertain and oil prices have been subject to significant volatility in the past. Future oil prices may be impacted by future changes in macroeconomic factors, available supply, demand, geopolitical and other factors. The pricelines as per the scenarios NGFS GCAM NZE 2050, IEA NZE50 and the average prices from four 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate change scenarios differ from Shell's best estimate and view of the future oil price.\n\n## Sensitivity + 10% to the mid-price outlook\n\n## Sensitivity - 10% to the mid-price outlook\n\n$ billion\n\n|                |   Carrying  amount |   Sensitivity |   Sensitivity |\n|----------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Integrated Gas |                 65 |             3 |             5 |\n| Upstream       |                 89 |             3 |             4 |\n| Total          |                154 |             6 |             9 |\n\n## Average prices from four 1.5-2 degrees Celsius external climate/uni00A0change scenarios\n\n$ billion\n\n|                |   Carrying  amount |   Sensitivity |   Sensitivity |\n|----------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Integrated Gas |                 65 |           -13 |           -16 |\n| Upstream       |                 89 |           -14 |           -17 |\n| Total          |                154 |           -27 |           -33 |\n\n|                |   Carrying  amount |   Sensitivity |   Sensitivity |\n|----------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Integrated Gas |                 65 |            -8 |           -10 |\n| Upstream       |                 89 |            -4 |            -5 |\n| Total          |                154 |           -12 |           -15 |\n\n$ billion\n\n## Sensitivity Hybrid Shell Plan + IEA NZE50\n\n$ billion\n\n|                |   Carrying  amount |   Sensitivity |   Sensitivity |\n|----------------|--------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Integrated Gas |                 65 |           -10 |           -12 |\n| Upstream       |                 89 |            -5 |            -6 |\n| Total          |                154 |           -15 |           -18 |\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n\n## 4 - CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY TRANSITION continued Carrying value of Oil Products and Chemicals assets\n\nRefineries in the Oil Products segment (carrying amount as at December 31, 2021, $6 billion of which $5 billion related to refineries in the five energy and chemicals parks, excluding refineries classified as held for sale) may be impacted under a two-degrees-Celsius or less external climate scenario. In/uni00A0line with Shell's strategy, Shell's refining footprint is being transformed into five energy and chemicals parks that will provide feedstocks for the chemicals and lubricants business, as well as other low-carbon energy products, including biofuels and hydrogen. This transformation will involve investments in assets that are expected to be resilient in the energy transition, and hence may have stable or increasing carrying amounts.\n\nAssets in the Chemicals segment and Marketing assets in the Oil Products segment are also resilient to the energy transition with products in chemicals, lubricants, biofuels, bitumen, electric vehicle charging and convenience retail having no or low Scope 3 emissions. The demand for these products is/uni00A0also/uni00A0expected to be increasing in many markets and as a result are not expected to be impacted by lower commodity price scenarios.\n\n## Portfolio changes\n\nSince 2016, the carrying amount of production assets in Integrated Gas and Upstream decreased from $169 billion as at December 31, 2016, to/uni00A0$118/uni00A0billion as at December 31, 2021. Over this period, depreciation was higher than additions for each year, and disposals of property, plant and/uni00A0equipment with a carrying amount of some $25 billion occurred. Since 2016, the carrying amount of joint ventures and associates decreased from/uni00A0$33 billion as at December 31, 2016, to $23 billion as at December 31, 2021. The carrying amount of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenses decreased from $19 billion as at December 31, 2016, to $7 billion at December 31, 2021. This is the result of final investment decisions and reclassifications to production assets and amounts charged to expenses exceeding additions (specifically significantly lower additions since 2020).\n\n## Carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets\n\n- $ billion as at December 31\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- [A] In 2017 two refineries were acquired following dissolution of/uni00A0the Motiva joint venture in the USA.\n\n## Carrying amount of production assets $ billion as at December 31\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n[A] Including right-of-use assets for the implementation of/uni00A0IFRS/uni00A016 Leases in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- [A] In 2017 two refineries were acquired following dissolution of the Motiva joint venture in the USA.\n\n## Carrying amount of refineries $ billion as at December 31\n\n16\n\n- [B]  Includes refineries held for sale ($1.5 billion).\n\nSince 2016, Shell's Oil Products portfolio has evolved, shifting from 15 refineries at the end of 2016 towards five energy and chemicals parks. During/uni00A0that/uni00A0period Shell assumed the sole ownership of two refineries through the dissolution of the Motiva joint venture, and disposed of, converted or/uni00A0closed/uni00A0nine refineries (two of which are held for sale as at December 31, 2021). The carrying amount of refineries decreased from $10 billion as at/uni00A0December 31, 2016, to $6 billion as at December 31, 2021, (excluding refineries classified as held for sale). It is anticipated that Shell will continue to/uni00A0invest in the transformation of its refining portfolio into five energy and chemicals parks which produce chemicals and low- or no-carbon products.\n\nLong term, it is expected that the current Shell portfolio will change and evolve with the energy transition. Decision-making on the future portfolio is guided by the pace of society's progress and the aim of being in step with society as it moves towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. Getting the energy system on a path to net-zero emissions will require unprecedented, coordinated action between energy providers, consumers and, crucially, governments. Shell has set out its strategy of how it will achieve its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society.\n\n## Impact on remaining life of assets\n\nThe energy transition and the pace at which it progresses may impact the remaining life of assets. Integrated Gas and Upstream assets are generally depreciated using a unit-of-production methodology where depreciation depends on production of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proved reserves (see Note 2). Based on production plans of existing assets, some 29%, 3% and 0% of SEC proved reserves as at December 31, 2021, would currently be left by 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. An analysis of Integrated Gas and Upstream production assets of $118 billion as at December 31,/uni00A02021, based on planned reserves depletion shows that these assets would be significantly further depreciated under the unit-of-production method by/uni00A02030 and fully depreciated by 2050, providing a further perspective on the risk of stranded assets carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at/uni00A0December 31, 2021. For refineries in Oil Products, depreciation of assets is on a straight-line basis over the life of the assets over a period of 20 years (see Note 2). Over the course of the energy transition, the current carrying amount of refineries will be fully depreciated, offset by anticipated investments in assets that are expected to be resilient in the energy transition as described above.",

        "page_content": "## Deferred tax assets\n\nIn general, it is expected that sufficient deferred tax liabilities and forecasted taxable profits within the planning period of 10 years are available for recovery of the deferred tax assets recognised at December 31, 2021. Integrated Gas and Upstream deferred tax assets recognised are expected to be recovered within the period of production of each asset. For deferred tax assets of $711 million as at December 31, 2021, mainly related to Brazil, Malaysia and Australia, this period extends beyond 10 years. Deferred tax assets in Oil Products to be recovered in more than 10 years are limited to $854 million as at December 31, 2021, and mainly relate to retail operations in Germany and France. In the light/uni00A0of the potential impact of the accelerated energy transition in Oil/uni00A0Products, cash flows in Oil Products beyond 10 years (for a maximum of an additional 10 years) were further risked to determine recoverability of deferred tax assets beyond 10 years (see Note 17).\n\n## Decommissioning and other provisions\n\nThe energy transition may result in decommissioning and restoration occurring earlier than expected. The risk on the timing of decommissioning and restoration activities for Integrated Gas and Upstream fields is limited, supported by production plans in the foreseeable future (see 'Impact on remaining life of assets' above). Acceleration of decommissioning and restoration activities has also been reflected in the assessment of the appropriate discount rate. In 2021, the discount rate has been revised from/uni00A0a/uni00A030 -year to a 20-year term in line with the average remaining life/uni00A0of/uni00A0Integrated Gas and Upstream assets.\n\nAlso, the current discount rate applied for calculating provisions (see Note/uni00A019) is equal to the inflation rate applied in estimation of provisions. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0result, a potential acceleration of decommissioning and restoration activities would have no time value of money impact for the decommissioning/uni00A0and restoration provision.\n\nIn Oil Products, it was industry practice not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions associated with manufacturing facilities in Oil Products and Chemicals. This was on the basis that these assets were considered to have indefinite lives, so it was considered remote that an outflow of economic benefits would be required. In 2020, Shell considered the changed macroeconomic fundamentals, together with Shell's plans to rationalise the Group's manufacturing portfolio. Shell also reconsidered whether it remained appropriate not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions for manufacturing facilities. In 2020, provisions of $899 million were recognised for certain shorter-lived manufacturing facilities (see Notes 19 and 26). The remaining five energy and chemicals parks are considered longer-lived facilities that are expected to be resilient in the energy transition, and decommissioning would generally be more than 50/uni00A0years away.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nClosure or early termination of activities may lead to supply contracts becoming onerous. Onerous contract provisions (see Note 19) have been recognised as at December 31, 2021, to reflect changes in expected future utilisation of certain assets. These include contracts in relation to unused terminals and refineries.\n\n## Dividend resilience\n\nExternal stakeholders have requested disclosures on how climate change affects dividend-paying capacity. If a further impairment had been recognised in 2021 using any of the climate change scenarios described above, this would not have impacted the ability to pay dividends in this financial year because of the strong cash flow generation/uni00A0and financial reserves.\n\nA forward-looking statement regarding future dividend-paying capacity cannot be provided because of unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nMitigation of physical risks, whether or not related to climate change, are/uni00A0considered and embedded in the design and construction of assets and the associated costs are included in the initial recognition of assets in/uni00A0the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Over the past few years Shell has conducted studies aimed at expanding the understanding of physical risks. Shell continues to develop its understanding of all relevant aspects of/uni00A0climate resilience. Analyses have been performed addressing a range of typical climate change features for a select group of assets and it was concluded that currently any adaptation costs for those selected assets is/uni00A0not expected to be significant. Shell recognises the need to deepen and/uni00A0widen these analyses for a more comprehensive climate resilience assessment. Shell continues to monitor this and plans to conduct further analysis on other assets as well as assess long-term physical impacts.\n\nAcute risks, such as flooding and droughts, wildfires and more severe tropical storms, could potentially impact Shell's operations and supply chains. The frequency of these hazards and impacts is expected to increase in certain high-risk locations. The physical risks are assessed at an/uni00A0asset level. Metocean (meteorology and oceanography) engineering experts assess and monitor the physical risks and logistic activities for certain of Shell's assets. These studies aim to ensure Shell's operations are/uni00A0safe and that Shell's facilities can be accessed safely under extreme/uni00A0conditions.\n\nExtreme weather events could have a negative impact on earnings. Recent examples in 2021 include the Texas winter storm and Hurricane Ida. These had an impact on Shell's operations and an adverse impact on/uni00A02021 earnings of around $200 million and $400 million respectively.\n\n## 5/uni00A0- SEGMENT INFORMATION/uni00A0 General information\n\nShell is an international energy company engaged in the principal aspects of the oil and gas industry and reports its business through segments: Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products, Chemicals and Corporate, reflecting the way Shell reviews and assesses its performance.\n\nThe Integrated Gas segment manages liquefied natural gas (LNG) activities and the conversion of natural gas into gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuels and other products, as well as the New Energies portfolio. It includes natural gas and liquids exploration and extraction, and the operation of the upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver gas and liquids to market. It markets and trades natural gas, LNG, electricity and carbon-emission rights, and also markets and sells LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels.\n\nThe Upstream segment explores for and extracts crude oil, natural gas/uni00A0and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil and gas, and operates the infrastructure necessary to deliver them to market.\n\nThe Oil Products segment comprises the Refining and Trading, and Marketing classes of business. The Refining and Trading class of business turns crude oil and other feedstocks into a range of oil products which are/uni00A0moved and marketed around the world for domestic, industrial and/uni00A0transport use. The Marketing class of business includes the Retail, Lubricants, Business-to-Business (B2B), Pipelines and Biofuels businesses.\n\nThe Chemicals segment operates manufacturing plants and its own marketing network.\n\nThe Corporate segment covers the non-operating activities supporting Shell, comprising Shell's holdings and treasury organisation, its selfinsurance activities and its headquarters and central functions.\n\nt\n\ns",

Third-party revenue and non-current assets information by geographical area are based on the country of operation of the Group subsidiaries that report this information. Separate disclosure is/uni00A0provided for the UK as this is the Company's country of domicile.\n\nSegment earnings are presented on a current cost of supplies basis (CCS earnings).

If no alternative reserves base had been used, the pre-tax depreciation charge for the year ended December 31, 2021, would have been $1,184/uni00A0million higher (2020: $1,012 million, 2019: $77 million).\n\nContractual commitments for the purchase and lease of property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2021, amounted to $5,984/uni00A0million (2020:/uni00A0$5,699/uni00A0million).\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nWithin property, plant and equipment the following amounts relate to leases:\n\n## 2021\n\n$ million\n\n|                                                                 | Exploration/uni00A0and/uni00A0production   | Exploration/uni00A0and/uni00A0production   |                                          |          |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n|                                                                 | Exploration  and/uni00A0evaluation         | Production                                 | Manufacturing,  supply and  distribution | Other    | Total   |\n| Cost                                                            |                                            |                                            |                                          |          |         |\n| At January 1                                                    | 5                                          | 14,440                                     | 14,526                                   | 7, 3 8 4 | 36,355  |\n| Additions                                                       | -                                          | 311                                        | 2,149                                    | 1,420    | 3,880   |\n| Sales, retirements and other movements                          | -                                          | (365)                                      | (868)                                    | (259)    | (1,492) |\n| Currency translation differences                                | -                                          | (64)                                       | (59)                                     | (514)    | (637)   |\n| At December 31                                                  | 5                                          | 14,322                                     | 15,748                                   | 8,031    | 38,106  |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortisation, including impairments |                                            |                                            |                                          |          |         |\n| At January 1                                                    | -                                          | 6,997                                      | 5,013                                    | 1,793    | 13,803  |\n| Charge for the year                                             | -                                          | 1,373                                      | 2,060                                    | 783      | 4,216   |\n| Sales, retirements and other movements                          | -                                          | (400)                                      | (1,093)                                  | (157)    | (1,650) |\n| Currency translation differences                                | -                                          | (35)                                       | (34)                                     | (146)    | (215)   |\n| At December 31                                                  | -                                          | 7, 9 3 5                                   | 5,946                                    | 2,273    | 16,154  |\n| Carrying amount at December 31                                  | 5                                          | 6,387                                      | 9,802                                    | 5,758    | 21,952  |\n\nn\n\nt\n\ns",

They are mainly related to two refineries in the USA within Oil Products impaired on classification as held for sale ($1,357/uni00A0million), exploration and evaluation assets both within Integrated Gas ($600 million) and Upstream ($373 million) and one site in the USA within Chemicals impaired on classification as/uni00A0held for sale ($180/uni00A0million). Only one asset (in Upstream) was impaired because of an asset-specific trigger for which the recoverable amount was/uni00A0determined through value in use and an impairment of $97 million was recognised.\n\nImpairment losses in 2020 were mainly triggered by Shell's revision of the mid- and long-term commodity price and refining margin outlook reflecting the/uni00A0expected effects of the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 pandemic as well as energy market demand and supply fundamentals. The/uni00A0impairment losses for exploration and production assets related primarily to Integrated Gas ($11,539/uni00A0million), including the Queensland Curtis LNG and Prelude floating LNG operations, and Upstream ($8,629/uni00A0million), including assets in the Gulf of Mexico, unconventional assets in North America, offshore assets in Brazil and Europe and a project in Nigeria (OPL 245). The impairment losses for manufacturing, supply and distribution related primarily to Oil Products ($6,493/uni00A0million), including assets in Europe and the shutdown of the Convent oil products manufacturing facility in the USA.\n\nImpairment losses in 2019 were mainly triggered by the revision to Shell's long-term oil and gas price outlook and change to future capital expenditure plans. The impairment losses related primarily to Upstream shale and deep-water properties in North and South America, in Integrated Gas to properties in Australia and in Oil Products to the refining portfolio.\n\nFor impairment testing purposes, the respective carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were compared with their value in use. Cash flow projections used in the determination of value in use were made using management's forecasts of commodity prices, market supply and demand, potential costs associated with operational GHG emissions, product margins including forecast refining margins and expected production volumes (see Note 2).",

        "page_content": "In 2021, Shell changed its estimation technique to determine the value in use for impairment testing purposes. A key element is the update of the discount rate, which is now based on a nominal post-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 5% for Power activities and a nominal post-tax WACC of/uni00A06.5% for all other businesses. Prior to 2021 the rate used by Shell was the same for all activities and was based on a pre-tax discount rate reflecting the marginal cost of debt, current market assessments of the time value of money and residual risk (2021: 6%; 2020: 6%; 2019: 6%). The change in/uni00A0discount rate to a nominal post-tax WACC has been reflected in a commensurate manner in the risk adjustments to post-tax cash flow projections. The/uni00A0impact of the change in impairment valuation technique is not material to the impairment assessments performed in 2021 and it is not expected to/uni00A0result/uni00A0in a materially different outcome in future periods. The pre-tax discount rate used for goodwill testing ranged between 7-11%.\n\nOil and gas price assumptions applied for impairment testing are reviewed and, where necessary, adjusted on a periodic basis. Reviews include comparison with available market data and forecasts that reflect developments in demand such as global economic growth, technology efficiency, policy measures and, in supply, consideration of investment and resource potential, cost of development of new supply, and behaviour of major resource holders. The near-term commodity price assumptions applied in impairment testing in/uni00A02021 were as follows:\n\n## Commodity price assumptions [A]\n\n|                                 |   2022 |   2023 |   2024 |   2025 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent crude oil ($/b)           |  60    |  60    |  60    |     63 |\n| Henry Hub natural gas ($/MMBtu) |   2.75 |   2.75 |   2.75 |      3 |\n\n[A] Money of the day.\n\nFor periods after 2025, the real-term price assumptions applied were $60 per barrel (/b) (2020: $60/b) for Brent crude oil and $3.00 per/uni00A0million British/uni00A0thermal units (/MMBtu) (2020: $3.00/MMBtu) for Henry Hub natural gas.\n\nUntil 2019, management's estimate of longer-term refining margins in Oil Products was based on the reversion to mean methodology, unless a fundamental shift in markets had been identified, over the life of the oil products manufacturing facilities. Under this approach, it was assumed that refining margins will revert to historical averages over time. As from 2020, a different price methodology has been applied, based on management's understanding and interpretation of demand and supply fundamentals in the near term and taking into account various other factors such as industry rationalisation and energy transition in the long term. This resulted in a downward revision of average long-term refining margins by around 30% from previous assumptions applied.\n\nThe main sensitivities in relation to impairment are the commodity price assumptions in Integrated Gas and Upstream and refining margins in Oil Products. A change of -10% or +10% in the commodity price assumptions over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in/uni00A0some/uni00A0$12-15/uni00A0billion impairment or some $6-9/uni00A0billion impairment reversal, respectively, in Integrated Gas and Upstream. A change of -10% or/uni00A0+10%/uni00A0in/uni00A0long-term refining margins over the entire cash flow projection period would ceteris paribus result in some $1-3/uni00A0billion impairment or/uni00A0up/uni00A0to/uni00A0$2/uni00A0billion impairment reversal, respectively, in Oil Products.\n\n## Capitalised exploration drilling costs\n\n|                                                                           | 2021      | 2020    | $ million 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|------------------|\n| At January 1                                                              | 3,654     | 5,668   | 6,629            |\n| Additions pending determination of proved reserves                        | 1,024     | 1,016   | 2,036            |\n| Amounts charged to expense                                                | (639)     | (815)   | (1,218)          |\n| Reclassifications to productive wells on determination of proved reserves | (577)     | (1,385) | (1,655)          |\n| Other movements                                                           | (447) [A] | (830)   | (124)            |\n| At December 31                                                            | 3,015     | 3,654   | 5,668            |\n\nProjects\n\nWells\n\n|                         |   Number | $ million   |   Number | $ million   |\n|-------------------------|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|\n| Between 1 and 5 years   |       17 | 1,189       |       33 | 821         |\n| Between 6 and 10 years  |       14 | 961         |       38 | 1,110       |\n| Between 11 and 15 years |        5 | 184         |       21 | 366         |\n| Between 16 and 20 years |        1 | 28          |        4 | 65          |\n| Total                   |       37 | 2,362       |       96 | 2,362       |\n\nExploration drilling costs capitalised for periods greater than one year at December 31, 2021, analysed according to the most recent year of activity, are/uni00A0presented in the table above.

The ECL at December 31, 2021, is $155/uni00A0million (2020: $112/uni00A0million), which represents 0.45-0.51% (2020: 0.27-0.51%) of all trade receivables.\n\nA loss allowance provision of $876/uni00A0million (2020: $349/uni00A0million) was established, in addition to all other impairments to trade receivables as at December 31, 2021, that are outside of the provision matrix calculations.\n\n## Lease receivables/uni00A0\n\nLease contracts where Shell is the lessor are classified as finance leases or operating leases.

In 2021, no debt was issued under this programme (2020: $6,734/uni00A0million).\n\nThe US shelf registration provides Shell with the flexibility to issue debt securities, ordinary shares, preferred shares and warrants. The registration is updated every three years and was last updated in March 2021. During 2021, debt totalling $1,500/uni00A0million (2020: $6,250/uni00A0million) was issued under the/uni00A0US shelf registration.\n\nOn December 13, 2019, Shell refinanced its revolving credit facilities, which are linked to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate ('SOFR'). The committed credit facilities are available at pre-agreed margins, with $1.92/uni00A0billion expiring in 2022 (2020: expiring in 2021), $320/uni00A0million expiring in 2025 and $7.68/uni00A0billion expiring in 2026 (2020: expiring in 2025). The terms and availability are not conditional on Shell's financial ratios nor its financial credit ratings. The interest and fees paid on these facilities are linked to Shell's progress towards reaching its short-term Net Carbon Footprint intensity target.\n\nThe following tables compare contractual cash flows for debt excluding lease liabilities at December/uni00A031 with the carrying amount in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contractual amounts reflect the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates; differences from carrying amounts reflect the effects of discounting, premiums and, where fair value hedge accounting is applied, fair value adjustments. Interest is estimated assuming interest rates applicable to variable-rate debt remain constant and there is no change in aggregate principal amounts of debt other than repayment at scheduled maturity, as reflected in the table.\n\n## 2021\n\n|                            | Less/uni00A0than   | Between        | Between  2 and 3  years   | Between  3 and 4   | Between        |                    |        | Difference  from/uni00A0carrying  amount   | Carrying  amount   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                            | 1 year             | 1 and 2  years |                           | years              | 4 and 5  years | 5 years  and later | Total  |                                            |                    |\n| Bonds                      | 3,423              | 3,376          | 4,362                     | 6,310              | 3,882          | 38,327             | 59,680 | 578                                        | 60,258             |\n| Bank and other borrowings  | 646                | 452            | 36                        | 9                  | 143            | 35                 | 1,321  | -                                          | 1,321              |\n| Total (excluding interest) | 4,069              | 3,828          | 4,398                     | 6,319              | 4,025          | 38,362             | 61,001 | 578                                        | 61,579             |\n| Interest                   | 1,637              | 1,587          | 1,524                     | 1,416              | 1,268          | 15,642             | 23,074 |                                            |                    |\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "The presentation in the balance sheet takes into consideration the offsetting of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction, where this is permitted. The overall deferred tax position in a particular tax jurisdiction determines if a deferred tax balance related to/uni00A0that/uni00A0jurisdiction is presented within deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities.\n\nOther movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities principally relate to acquisitions, sales of non-current assets and businesses, and amounts recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe deferred tax category 'Other' primarily includes deferred tax positions in respect of leases, financial assets and liabilities, inventories, intangible assets and investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe deferred tax category 'Plant, property and equipment' includes deferred tax positions in respect of tangible fixed assets and investments in/uni00A0partnerships in the USA which are considered pass-through entities by its parent for tax purposes.\n\nDeferred tax assets of $12,426 million (2020: $16,311 million) are recognised only to the extent it is considered probable that those assets will be recoverable. This involves an assessment of when those assets are likely to be recovered, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the assets. It is considered probable based on business forecasts that such taxable profits will be available. For Oil Products, additional judgement is required; in some European jurisdictions the assessment of forecasted taxable profits resulting in deferred tax asset recognition of $854 million (2020: $778/uni00A0million) extends for an additional 10-years beyond Shell's regular 10 years planning horizon. In those situations, additional risking has been applied to the forecast of taxable profits. For Integrated Gas and Upstream, deferred tax assets recognised are expected to/uni00A0be recovered within the period of production of each asset. For deferred tax assets of $711 million as at December 31, 2021, mainly related to Brazil, Malaysia and Australia, this period extends beyond 10 years.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets which are dependent on future taxable profits not arising from the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities, and/uni00A0which relate to tax jurisdictions where Shell has suffered a loss in the current or preceding year, was $10,195/uni00A0million at December 31, 2021 (2020:/uni00A0$12,759/uni00A0million). The decrease compared with 2020 is primarily attributable to the utilisation of deferred tax assets in 2021 and a higher number/uni00A0of entities which have generated profit in both the current and preceding year.\n\nUnrecognised taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed retained earnings of investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates amounted to $5,680/uni00A0million at December 31, 2021 (2020: $6,705/uni00A0million). These retained earnings are subject to withholding tax upon distribution.\n\nUnrecognised deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and credits carried forward amounted to $37,410/uni00A0million at December 31, 2021 (2020: $42,836/uni00A0million), including amounts of $31,349/uni00A0million (2020: $31,873/uni00A0million) that are subject to time limits for utilisation of five years or later, or/uni00A0are not time limited.\n\nFurthermore, there are unrecognised losses for Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) in Australia which due to the annual augmentation increased to/uni00A0$42,511 million as at the end of the most recent PRRT fiscal year, June 30, 2021 (June 30, 2020: $39,402/uni00A0million).\n\nThe alignment of the Company's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK resulted in recognition in 2021 of a taxable deemed disposal/uni00A0gain fully offset by taxable losses in the Netherlands. (See Note 1)\n\n## 18 - RETIREMENT/uni00A0BENEFITS\n\nRetirement benefits are provided in most of the countries where Shell has operational activities. Shell offers these benefits through funded and unfunded/uni00A0defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The most significant pensions plans are in the Netherlands, UK and USA.\n\nOther post-employment benefits (OPEB) comprised of retirement health care and life insurance are also provided in certain countries. The most significant OPEB plan is in the USA.\n\n## Financial position\n\n$ million\n\n|                                                        | Dec 31, 2021     | Dec 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Obligations                                            | ( 1 0 7, 3 3 6 ) | (115,792)      |\n| Plan assets                                            | 104,495          | 102,678        |\n| Asset ceilings                                         | (13)             | (17)           |\n| Deficit                                                | (2,854)          | (13,131)       |\n| Retirement benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet: |                  |                |\n| Non-current assets                                     | 8,471            | 2,474          |\n| Non-current liabilities:                               | (11,325)         | (15,605)       |\n| Non-current liabilities - Pensions                     | (6,458)          | (10,237)       |\n| Non-current liabilities - OPEB                         | (4,867)          | (5,368)        |\n| Total                                                  | (2,854)          | (13,131)       |\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## Characteristics of significant defined benefit and defined contribution plans and regulatory framework The Netherlands\n\nThe principal defined benefit pension plan in the Netherlands is a funded career-averaged pension arrangement with retired employees drawing benefits as an annuity, with a surplus of $1,756/uni00A0million reported as at December 31, 2021, (2020: $405 million surplus). Whilst the plan was closed to employees hired or rehired after July 1, 2013, it currently remains open for ongoing accrual for existing active members. 26% (2020: 31%) of the overall defined benefit liability in the Netherlands relates to active members. From July 1, 2013, onwards new employees in the Netherlands are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan.\n\nIn line with Dutch regulations, the defined benefit pension plan has a joint Trustee Board with trustee representatives nominated by the company, the Central Staff Council and retired members. The defined benefit pension plan also has an Accountability Council comprised of members nominated by the company, the Central Staff Council and retired members. Furthermore, there is a Supervisory Committee which includes external experts from the pension industry to oversee management, compliance and operations of the fund. The defined contribution pension plan has a/uni00A0one-tier Trustee Board with an independent chairperson, and trustee representatives nominated by the company and the Central Staff Council (currently no retired members in the fund to act as trustee) as well as two/uni00A0executive board members. The defined contribution fund also has an/uni00A0Accountability Council comprised of members nominated by the company and the Central Staff Council.\n\nThe Dutch government is currently drafting a new regulatory framework for pensions in the Netherlands. The development of new regulations by the government was postponed in 2021 to January 2023 with subsequent implementation by January 2027. It is expected that these regulatory changes will have an impact on both the defined benefit pension plan and/uni00A0the defined contribution pension plan. The proposed changes will have to be submitted for consent with the Central Staff Council.\n\n## UK\n\nThe three largest defined benefit pension plans for employees in the UK/uni00A0are funded final salary pension arrangements with retired employees mainly drawing benefits as an annuity with the option to take a portion as/uni00A0a lump sum. The three plans are separate and independent plans and cannot be netted against each other. In total, the plans reported a surplus of $3,807/uni00A0million as at December 31, 2021 (2020: deficit of $76/uni00A0million), which is after netting of unfunded plans of $473/uni00A0million which are reported as non-current liabilities on the balance sheet. All three plans were closed to new employees hired or rehired, however, two plans currently remain open for ongoing accrual for existing active members. 20% (2020: 23%) of the overall defined liability in the UK relates to active/uni00A0members. From March 1, 2013 onwards new employees in the UK/uni00A0are entitled to membership of a defined contribution pension plan.\n\nIn line with UK regulations, the principal defined benefit pension plan is/uni00A0governed by a corporate trustee whose board is comprised of four trustee directors nominated by the company including the chair and four member-nominated trustee directors. The defined contribution pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is comprised of/uni00A0three company-nominated directors including the chair and two member-nominated trustee directors. The trustees are responsible for/uni00A0administering the plans in line with the Trust Deed and Regulations, including setting the investment strategy for the pension plans' assets and/uni00A0paying member benefits, and are required to act in the best interests/uni00A0of the members of the pension plans.\n\n## USA\n\nThe principal defined benefit pension plan in the USA is a funded final average pay pension plan with a surplus of $182/uni00A0million reported as at/uni00A0December 31, 2021 (2020: $1,846 million deficit). After retirement, all/uni00A0retirees can choose to draw their benefits as an annuity, whereas others also have the choice to take their benefit in a lump sum. There is/uni00A0also an/uni00A0unfunded defined benefit pension plan with a deficit of $1,129/uni00A0million (2020: $1,475 million deficit). The benefits under this plan are taken primarily in a lump sum. In addition, the company provides a defined contribution benefit plan. The funded defined benefit, unfunded defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans are subject to the/uni00A0provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). 24%/uni00A0(2020: 25%) of the overall defined liability of the funded defined benefit plan in the USA relates to active members.\n\nBoth the funded defined benefit pension plan and the defined contribution pension plan are governed by trustees who are appointed by the Plan Sponsor and are named fiduciaries with respect to the plans. The trustees are generally responsible for investment-related matters, appointing the Plan Administrator, maintaining general oversight and deciding appeals of/uni00A0participants.\n\n## USA OPEB\n\nThe company also sponsors 'other post-retirement employee benefits' (OPEB) mainly in the USA. The OPEB plans in the USA provide medical, dental, and vision benefits as well as life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs with a deficit of $4,067/uni00A0million reported as at December 31, 2021 (2020: $4,497 million deficit). The plan that provides postretirement medical benefits in the USA is closed to employees hired or/uni00A0rehired on or after January 1, 2017. Certain life insurance benefits are/uni00A0paid by the company.\n\n## Significant funding requirements:\n\n- \u25a0 There are no set minimum statutory funding requirements for the UK/uni00A0plans. A professional qualified independent actuary, appointed by/uni00A0the/uni00A0trustee board, undertakes a local funding valuation typically every three years. The most recent completed funding valuation for the/uni00A0principal defined benefit plan was undertaken as at December 31, 2020 and revealed a funding ratio of 103% and therefore no sponsor contributions (except for salary sacrifice contributions) were payable under the schedule of contributions.\n- \u25a0 Additional contributions to the Dutch defined benefit pension plan/uni00A0would be required if the 12-month rolling average local funding percentage falls below 105% for six months or more. At the most recent/uni00A0(2021) funding valuation the local funding percentage was/uni00A0above this level;\n- \u25a0 Under the Pension Protection Act, US pension plans are subject to/uni00A0minimum required contribution levels based on the funding position./uni00A0No/uni00A0contributions are required based on the most recent/uni00A0funding valuation.\n\n## Associated risks to which retirement benefits are exposed\n\nThere are inherent risks associated with defined benefit pension and OPEB/uni00A0plans. These risks are related to various assumptions made on valuation of the liabilities and the cash funding requirement of the underlying plans. Volatility in capital markets or government policies, and/uni00A0the resulting consequences for investment performance, interest and inflation rates, as well as changes in assumptions for mortality, retirement age or pensionable remuneration at retirement, could result in significant changes to the funding level of future liabilities, and in case of a shortfall, there could be a requirement to make substantial cash contributions (depending on the applicable local regulations).\n\nt\n\ns",

The forum is supported by a risk committee in reviewing the results of the assurance process with respect to the pension risk.\n\n## Investment strategies\n\nLong-term investment strategies of plans are generally determined by the relevant pension plan trustees using a structured asset/liability modelling approach to define the asset mix that best meets the objectives of optimising returns within agreed risk levels while maintaining adequate funding levels.\n\n## Principal and actuarial assumptions\n\n- \u25a0 rates of increase in pensionable remuneration, pensions in payment and health-care costs: historical experience and management's long-term expectation;\n\nThe principal assumptions applied in determining the present value of defined benefit obligations and their bases were as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 discount rates: prevailing long-term AA corporate bond yields, chosen to match the currency and duration of the relevant obligation; and\n- \u25a0 mortality rates: published standard mortality tables for the individual countries concerned adjusted for Shell experience where statistically significant.\n\nThe weighted averages for those assumptions and related sensitivity information at December/uni00A031 are presented below. Sensitivity information indicates by how much the defined benefit obligations would increase or decrease if a given assumption were to increase or decrease with no change in other assumptions. The sensitivity analyses may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in/uni00A0assumptions would occur in isolation from one another. The weighted averages are at nominal terms and based on market expectations at/uni00A0December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n$ million, except where indicated\n\n|

Reviews of estimated future decommissioning and restoration costs and the discount rate applied are carried out regularly. The/uni00A0discount rate applied at December 31, 2021, was 2% (2020: 1.75%). An increase of 0.5% or a decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate could result in/uni00A0a/uni00A0decrease of $1.5/uni00A0billion (2020: $1.7/uni00A0billion) or an increase of $1.7/uni00A0billion (2020: $2.2/uni00A0billion) of decommissioning and restoration provisions, respectively. Such increase or decrease will be reflected in the carrying amount of the related asset. Where applicable that carrying amount is tested/uni00A0for/uni00A0impairment.\n\nIn 2021, there was a decrease of around $700/uni00A0million (2020: increase of $3,999/uni00A0million) in the decommissioning and restoration provision as a result/uni00A0of/uni00A0the change in the discount rate, partly offset by an increase in the provision resulting from changes in cost estimates of around $140/uni00A0million (2020:/uni00A0decrease of $1,909/uni00A0million), reported within remeasurements and other movements.\n\nOf the decommissioning and restoration provision at December 31, 2021, an estimated $3,863 million is expected to be utilised within one to five years, $3,584 million within six to 10 years, and the remainder in later periods.\n\nLegal provisions at December 31, 2021, include legal proceedings in Integrated Gas at $669 million, Upstream $94 million, Oil Products $255 million and Chemicals $393 million.\n\nOther provisions at December 31, 2021, include amounts recognised in respect of employee benefits.\n\nt\n\ns",

These policies cover: financing structure; interest rate and foreign exchange risk management; insurance; counterparty risk management; and use of derivative contracts. Wherever possible, treasury operations are carried out through specialist regional organisations without removing from each subsidiary the responsibility to formulate and implement appropriate treasury policies.\n\nApart from forward foreign exchange contracts to meet known commitments, the use of derivative contracts by most subsidiaries is/uni00A0not/uni00A0permitted by their treasury policy.\n\nOther than in exceptional cases, the use of external derivative contracts is confined to specialist trading and central treasury organisations that have appropriate skills, experience, supervision, control and reporting systems.\n\nShell's operations expose it to market, credit and liquidity risk, as described below.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the possibility that changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or the prices of crude oil, natural gas, LNG, refined products, chemical feedstocks, power and carbon-emission rights will adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities or expected future cash/uni00A0flows.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nMost debt is raised from central borrowing programmes. Shell's policy continues to be to have debt principally denominated in dollars and to maintain a largely floating interest rate exposure profile; however, Shell\n\nhas issued a significant amount of fixed rate debt in recent years, taking advantage of historically low interest rates available in debt markets. As a result, the majority of the debt portfolio at December 31, 2021, is at fixed rates and this reduces Shell's adverse exposure to rising floating dollar interest rates (see Note 2).\n\nThe financing of most subsidiaries is structured on a floating-rate basis, and any further interest rate risk management is only applied under exceptional circumstances.\n\nOn the basis of the floating-rate net cash position at December 31, 2021, (both issued and hedged), and assuming other factors (principally foreign exchange rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further interest rate management action was taken, an increase in interest rates of 1% would have increased 2021 income before taxation by $174/uni00A0million (2020: $62/uni00A0million increase, based on the floating rate net cash position at December 31, 2020).\n\nThe carrying amounts and maturities of debt and borrowing facilities are presented in Note 15. Interest expense is presented in Note 7.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nMany of the markets in which Shell operates are priced, directly or indirectly, in dollars. As a result, the functional currency of most Integrated Gas and Upstream entities and those with significant cross-border business is the dollar. For Oil Products and Chemicals entities, the functional currency is typically the local currency. Consequently, Shell is exposed to varying levels of foreign exchange risk when an entity enters into transactions that are not denominated in its functional currency, when foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date and as a result of holding net investments in operations that are not dollar-functional. Each entity is required to adopt treasury policies that are designed to measure and manage its foreign exchange exposures by reference to its functional currency.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arise in the normal course of business from the recognition of receivables and payables and other monetary items in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. Foreign exchange risk may also arise in connection with capital expenditure. For/uni00A0major projects, an assessment is made at the final investment decision/uni00A0stage of whether to hedge any resulting exposure.\n\nAssuming other factors (principally interest rates and commodity prices) remained constant and that no further foreign exchange risk management action were taken, a 10% appreciation against the dollar at December/uni00A031 of the main currencies to which Shell is exposed would have the following effects:\n\n$ million\n\n|                                         | Increase/(decrease)  in income before taxation   | Increase/(decrease)  in income before taxation   |       |       |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n|                                         | 2021                                             | 2020                                             | 2021  | 2020  |\n| 10% appreciation against the dollar of: |                                                  |                                                  |       |       |\n| Euro                                    | (123)                                            | (263)                                            | 601   | 451   |\n| Malaysian ringgit                       | 119                                              | 255                                              | 399   | 270   |\n| Australian dollar                       | (3)                                              | 179                                              | 591   | 598   |\n| Sterling                                | (180)                                            | (166)                                            | 738   | 328   |\n| Canadian dollar                         | (44)                                             | 1                                                | 1,439 | 1,299 |\n\nThe above sensitivity information was calculated by reference to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at December 31 only. The effect on income before taxation arises in connection with monetary balances denominated in currencies other than an entity's functional currency; the effect on net assets arises principally from the translation of assets and liabilities of entities that are not dollar-functional.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses included in income are presented in Note 6.",

        "page_content": "## Commodity price risk\n\nCertain subsidiaries have a mandate to trade crude oil, natural gas, LNG, refined products, chemical feedstocks, power and environmental certificates, and to use commodity derivative contracts (forwards, futures, swaps and options) as a means of managing price and timing risks arising from this trading activity. In effecting these transactions, the entities concerned operate within procedures and policies designed to ensure that risks, including those relating to the default of counterparties, are managed within authorised limits.\n\nValue-at-risk (VAR) techniques based on variance/covariance or Monte Carlo simulation models are used to make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 1-day holding period and within a 95% confidence level. The calculation of potential changes in fair value takes into account positions, the history of price movements and the correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is maintained. The VAR average and year-end positions in respect of commodities traded in active markets, which are presented in the table below, are calculated on a diversified basis in order to reflect the effect of offsetting risk within combined portfolios.\n\n## Value-at-risk (pre-tax)\n\n|                             | 2021    | 2021     | $ million 2020   | $ million 2020   |\n|-----------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|------------------|\n|                             | Average | Year-end | Average          | Year-end         |\n| Global oil                  | 26      | 30       | 32               | 24               |\n| North America gas and power | 12      | 15       | 11               | 14               |\n| Europe gas and power        | 11      | 13       | 8                | 11               |\n| Environmental certificates  | 8       | 10       | 6                | 7                |\n\nFurthermore, commodity derivative hedge contracts are used to partially mitigate price volatility on future LNG sales and purchases.\n\nAs the underlying physical commodity LNG is accounted for an accrual basis (see Note 2) and commodity derivatives are accounted for on a fair-value basis, this creates an accounting mismatch over periods. The fair value accounting of commodity derivatives can result in gains or losses in the income statement, which for adjusted earnings are part of identified items.\n\nThese derivative contracts are based on a mix of European and North American gas price indices, global crude price indices and Asian LNG price indices. Shell has seen high volatility in these gas price markets in 2021. On that basis a sensitivity analysis has been performed for a 50% price increase or decrease of this basket of derivative contracts at year-end 2021, which would result in a gain or loss of $0.3 billion (pre-tax) in the income statement.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nPolicies are in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. These policies include credit analysis and monitoring of trading partners against counterparty credit limits. Credit information is regularly shared between business and finance functions, with dedicated teams in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of credit deterioration. Mitigation measures are defined and implemented for higher-risk business partners and customers, and include shortened payment terms, collateral or other security posting and vigorous collections. In addition, policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any individual financial institution. There are no material concentrations of credit risk, with individual customers or geographically.\n\nSurplus cash is invested in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentrating risk in any one instrument, country or counterparty. Management monitors the investments regularly and adjusts the investment portfolio in light of new market information where necessary to ensure credit risk is effectively diversified.\n\nIn commodity trading, counterparty credit risk is managed within a framework of credit limits with utilisation being regularly reviewed. Credit risk exposure is monitored and the acceptable level of credit exposure is determined by a credit committee. Credit checks are performed by a department independent of traders, and are undertaken before contractual commitment. Where appropriate, netting arrangements, credit insurance, prepayments and collateral are used to manage specific risks.\n\nt\n\ns",

The carrying amount of collateral held at December 31, 2021, presented within trade and other payables, was $1,909 million (2020: $1,675 million). Collateral mainly relates to initial margins held with commodity exchanges and over-thecounter counterparty variation margins. Some derivative contracts are fully cash collateralised, thereby eliminating both counterparty risk and the Group's own non-performance risk.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for Shell's business activities may not be available. Management believes that it has access to sufficient debt funding sources (capital markets) and to undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable requirements.

As part of Shell's normal business, commodity derivative hedge contracts are entered into for mitigation of future purchases, sales and inventory. The losses in the current year are mainly related to gas and power trading in Europe to hedge supply and purchase contracts as well as inventory and to physical global LNG sales that are partially hedged through paper derivative positions. As from 2020, what is reported includes realised gains and losses on physical commodity derivatives (arising up to the point of settlement), resulting in what is reported includes $807 million of realised losses in 2021 (2020: $2,216 million gains). As from 2021, the disclosure applies the International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) guidance concerning the physical settlement of a contract to buy/uni00A0or sell a non-financial item, irrespective of whether the sales and purchases are presented on a gross or net basis. Comparative numbers have been revised to conform with the current year presentation. In 2020, the disclosure of net gains of $3,295 million (of which realised gains and losses on physical commodity contracts were $2,216 million) applied the/uni00A0IFRIC guidance only to physical derivatives where the subsequent sales and purchases were presented on a gross basis. The $2,216 million comparative was disclosed on its net basis of $597 million related to the/uni00A0aforementioned IFRIC guidance.\n\nCertain contracts, mainly to hedge price risk relating to forecast commodity transactions, were designated in cash flow hedging relationships and are presented after the offset of related margin balances with exchanges. Contracts to hedge foreign exchange risks were also designated in cash flow hedging relationships and the net carrying amount of these contracts at December 31, 2021, was a liability of $173/uni00A0million (2020: $556/uni00A0million asset). See Note 23 for the accumulated balance recognised within other comprehensive income.\n\nCertain interest rate and currency swaps were designated in fair value hedges, principally in respect of debt for which the net carrying amount of/uni00A0the related derivative contracts, net of accrued interest, at December 31, 2021, was a liability of $250/uni00A0million (2020: $1,422/uni00A0million asset).\n\nIn 2021, \u20ac3/uni00A0billion (2020: \u20ac3/uni00A0billion) of debt instruments were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, relating to the foreign exchange risk arising between certain intermediate holding companies and their subsidiaries. See Note 23 for the accumulated balance recognised within other comprehensive income.\n\nIn the course of trading operations, certain contracts are entered into for/uni00A0delivery of commodities that are accounted for as derivatives. The resulting price exposures are managed by entering into related derivative contracts. These contracts are managed on a fair value basis and the maximum exposure to liquidity risk is the undiscounted fair value of derivative liabilities.\n\nt\n\ns",

This authority expires at the earlier of the close of business on August 18, 2022, and the end of the AGM to be held in 2022, unless previously renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in a general/uni00A0meeting.\n\nAt the May/uni00A018, 2021, AGM, shareholders granted the Company the authority to repurchase up to 780/uni00A0million ordinary shares (excluding any treasury shares), renewing the authority granted by the shareholders at previous AGMs. The authority will expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 18, 2022, and the end of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2022. Ordinary shares purchased by the Company pursuant to this authority will either be cancelled or held in treasury. Treasury shares are shares in the Company which are owned by the Company itself. The minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is \u20ac0.07. The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is the higher of: (i) an amount equal to 5% above the average market value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out.\n\nSubsequent to the balance sheet date, one line of shares was established through assimilation of A shares and B shares into a single line of ordinary shares of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or dividend entitlements.

The weighted average number of shares outstanding excludes shares held in trust.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are based on the same income figures. The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is increased by dilutive shares related to share-based compensation plans. If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares could decrease diluted loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share.\n\nEarnings per share are identical for A and B shares.\n\n## 26/uni00A0- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES General\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, Shell subsidiaries are subject to a number of contingencies arising from litigation and claims brought by governmental authorities, including tax authorities, and private parties. The operations and earnings of Shell subsidiaries continue, from time to time, to be affected to varying degrees by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to the protection of the environment and indigenous groups in the countries in which they operate. The industries in which Shell subsidiaries are engaged are also subject to physical risks of various types.\n\nThe amounts claimed in relation to such events and, if such claims against Shell were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. Based on information available to date and taking into account that in some cases it is not practicable to estimate the possible magnitude or timing of any resultant payments, management believes that the foregoing are not expected to have a material adverse impact on Shell's Consolidated Financial Statements. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty around these contingencies, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 26/uni00A0- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES/uni00A0 continued\n\nIn certain divestment transactions, liabilities related to decommissioning and restoration are de-recognised upon transfer of these obligations to the buyer. For certain of these obligations, Shell has issued guarantees to/uni00A0third parties and continues to be liable in case the primary obligor is/uni00A0not/uni00A0able to meet its obligation. These potential obligations arising from/uni00A0issuance of these guarantees are assessed to be remote.\n\n## Decommissioning and restoration of manufacturing/uni00A0facilities\n\nIndustry practice had been not to recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions associated with manufacturing facilities in Oil Products and Chemicals. This was on the basis that these assets were considered to have indefinite lives and, therefore, that it was considered remote that an outflow of economic benefits would be required.\n\nIn 2020, the changed macroeconomic fundamentals were considered, together with Shell's plans to rationalise the Group's manufacturing portfolio. It was also reconsidered whether it remained appropriate not/uni00A0to/uni00A0recognise decommissioning and restoration provisions for manufacturing facilities.\n\nIt was concluded that the assumption of indefinite lives for manufacturing facilities is no longer appropriate, and the need for either recognition of/uni00A0decommissioning and restoration provisions or contingent liability disclosure was reviewed. In 2020, provisions had been recognised for/uni00A0certain shorter-lived manufacturing facilities (see Note 19). For the remaining longer-lived facilities, where decommissioning would generally be more than 50 years away, it was concluded that, while there is a present obligation that has arisen from past events, the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. This conclusion was reached on the basis that the settlement dates are indeterminate; and/uni00A0that other estimates, such as extremely long-term discount rates for which there is no observable measure, are not reliable. Consequently, a/uni00A0decommissioning and restoration obligation exists that cannot be recognised or quantified and that is disclosed as a contingent liability.\n\n## Pesticide litigation\n\nShell Oil Company (SOC), along with another agricultural chemical pesticide manufacturer and several distributors, has been sued by public and quasi-public water purveyors, water storage districts, and private landowners alleging responsibility for groundwater contamination caused by applications of chemical pesticides. There are approximately 37 such cases currently pending, seven claims made but not yet filed, and an active subpoena for records. These matters assert various theories of strict liability and negligence, seeking to recover actual damages, including drinking well treatment and remediation costs. Most assert claims for punitive damages. While the Company continues to vigorously defend these actions, in January/uni00A02018 an environmental regulatory standard became effective in the State of California, where a majority of the suits are pending. The 2018 standard requires public water systems state-wide to perform quarterly or monthly sampling of their drinking water sources for a chemical contained in certain pesticides. Water systems deemed out of compliance with the regulatory standard must take corrective action to resolve the exceedance or take the potable water source out of service. In response to this regulatory standard, the Company monitors the sampling results to determine the number of wells potentially impacted. Based on the claims asserted and SOC's history with regard to amounts paid to resolve varying actions, management does not expect the outcome of the matters pending at December 31, 2021, to have a material adverse impact on Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential outcome of some of these pending lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition.\n\n## Climate change litigation\n\nIn the USA, 21 lawsuits filed by several municipalities and/or states against oil and gas companies, including Shell plc, are pending as of December 31, 2021. The plaintiffs seek damages for a variety of claims including harm to their public and private infrastructure from rising sea levels and other alleged impacts of climate change caused by the defendants' fossil fuel products. A similar suit has been filed by a crab-fishing industry group claiming harm to their fisheries as a result of alleged ocean-related impacts of climate change. In the Netherlands, in a case against Shell brought by a group of environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGOs) and individual claimants, the Court found that while Shell is not/uni00A0currently acting unlawfully, Shell must reduce the aggregate annual volume of CO/uni2082 emissions of Shell Group operations and energy-carrying products sold across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 45% (net) by the end of 2030 relative to its 2019 emissions levels. For Scopes 2 and 3, this is a significant best efforts obligation. Shell has appealed that ruling. Management believes the outcome of these matters should be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell, but there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits, as well as their potential/uni00A0effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's/uni00A0financial condition.\n\n## Louisiana coast litigation\n\nThe State of Louisiana and multiple local governments have initiated 43 lawsuits against more than 200 oil and gas companies, claiming either current or historical oil and gas operations caused or contributed to contamination, land loss and the erosion of the Louisiana coastline. Shell entities are named in 14 of the suits. Although the State and local parishes fail to claim specified amounts, these claims represent potentially material matters. The cases are of first impression, arise out of an untested 1980 Louisiana statute and represent a novel attempt to render illegal operations that federal and state agencies permitted and authorised at the time. Management believes the outcome of these matters should ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell; there remains a high degree of uncertainty, however, concerning the scope of the claims and the ultimate outcomes, as well as their potential effects on future operations, earnings, cash flows, reputation and Shell's financial condition. The cases continue to go through jurisdictional challenges with respect to whether the cases should be tried in federal court or state court.\n\n## NAM (Groningen gas field) litigation\n\n- \u25a0 housing claims where NAM was found liable for value loss;\n\nSince 1963 NAM - a joint venture between Shell and ExxonMobil (50:50) - has been producing gas from the Groningen field, the largest gas field in Western Europe. After smaller tremors in the 1990s and the late 2000s, an earthquake measuring 3.6 on the Richter scale occurred in/uni00A02012, causing damage to properties in the affected area, and the area/uni00A0continues to experience tremor/earthquake-type events. NAM has/uni00A0received more than 100,000 claims for physical damage to property - the majority of which have been successfully settled. The Dutch State has taken over the damage-claim-handling from NAM for all claim categories (strengthening, physical damage to property, housing value loss, emotional damages and loss of living enjoyment) while NAM remains financially responsible. In February 2022 NAM commenced arbitral proceedings against the State to get clarity on these financial responsibilities. NAM still faces claims in civil litigation from claimants who/uni00A0elect not to use the government arrangement or from claims pre-dating the governmental arrangements. These claims include, but/uni00A0are/uni00A0not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 emotional damages and loss of living enjoyment, around 5,000 claimants;/uni00A0and\n- \u25a0 other civil litigation matters.\n\nThere remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning the ultimate outcomes and their potential effects on future operations, earnings, cash/uni00A0flows, reputation and Shell's financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## Nigerian litigation\n\nShell subsidiaries and associates operating in Nigeria are parties to various environmental and contractual disputes brought in the courts of Nigeria, England and the Netherlands. These disputes are at different stages in litigation, including at the appellate stage, where judgements have been rendered against Shell entities. If taken at face value, the aggregate amount of these judgements could be seen as material. Management, however, believes that the outcomes of these matters will/uni00A0ultimately be resolved in a manner favourable to Shell. However, there/uni00A0remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding these cases, as/uni00A0well/uni00A0as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash/uni00A0flows/uni00A0and/uni00A0Shell's financial condition.\n\n## OPL 245\n\nAuthorities are investigating Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Ltd.'s (SNEPCO's) investment in Nigerian oil block OPL 245 and/uni00A0the 2011 settlement of litigation pertaining to that block with regard to/uni00A0potential anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\n\nOn January 27, 2017, the Nigeria Federal High Court issued an Interim Order of Attachment for Oil Prospecting Licence 245 (OPL 245), pending the conclusion of the investigation. SNEPCO applied for and was granted a discharge of this order on constitutional and procedural grounds. Also in Nigeria, in March 2017, criminal charges alleging official corruption and conspiracy to commit official corruption were filed against SNEPCO, one current Shell employee and third parties including ENI SpA and one of its/uni00A0subsidiaries. Those proceedings are in abeyance. In January 2020, criminal charges alleging disobeying direction of law related to tax waivers were filed in Nigeria against Shell Nigeria Ultra Deep Ltd., SNEPCO, and third parties including Nigeria Agip Exploration Limited (NAE). Those proceedings are ongoing. In March 2017, parties alleging to be shareholders of Malabu Oil and Gas Company Limited. (Malabu) filed two actions to challenge the 2011 settlement and the award of OPL 245 to/uni00A0SNEPCO and an ENI SpA subsidiary by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Both actions are currently stayed awaiting the outcome of appeals filed against procedural decisions. Those appeal proceedings are ongoing. On May 8, 2018, Human Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA) sought permission from the Federal High Court of Nigeria to apply for an order to direct the Attorney General of the Federation to revoke OPL 245 on grounds that the entire Malabu transaction in relation to the OPL is unconstitutional, illegal and void as it was obtained through fraudulent and corrupt practice. On July 3, 2019, the Nigerian Federal High Court upheld objections from SNEPCO and NAE and struck the lawsuit filed by HEDA. The suit was struck because of the statute of limitations and lack of jurisdiction to hear the matter. HEDA has appealed/uni00A0the judgement, which is ongoing.\n\nOn December 12, 2018, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN) issued a claim form in the UK against Shell and six of its subsidiaries, ENI SpA and two of its subsidiaries, Malabu as well as two other entities for the amount of $1,092 million plus damages for having participated in a fraudulent and corrupt scheme leading to the acquisition by Shell and ENI corporate defendants in 2011 of OPL 245. The Shell entities were served with proceedings in April and May 2019, following which they, and other defendants, challenged the jurisdiction of the English courts. Following a/uni00A0hearing in April 2020, the English High Court rendered judgement in/uni00A0May 2020, dismissing the claims in England and refusing the FRN's request for permission to appeal. In September 2020, the UK Court of/uni00A0Appeal also refused the FRN's permission to appeal, meaning the case/uni00A0is now concluded.\n\nOn February 14, 2017, Shell plc received a notice of request for indictment from the Milan public prosecutor with respect to this matter. On December 20, 2017, Shell plc and four former Shell employees including one former executive were remanded to trial in Milan. On May 14, 2018, a trial commenced in the Court of Milan. The FRN was admitted as a civil claimant by a court decision on July 20, 2018. On September 18, 2018, Shell was joined to the proceedings as the civilly responsible party for the/uni00A0damages caused by the alleged illegal acts of the four former Shell employees. Three other Shell entities (Shell UK Ltd, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd. and Shell Exploration and Production Africa Ltd.) also joined the proceedings as responsible civile for/uni00A0their respective former employees at that phase of the proceedings. On March 17, 2021, the Court of Milan acquitted the Shell entities and four former Shell employees of all charges on the grounds that there was no case to answer. The Court of Milan published the full grounds for its decision on June 9, 2021. The decision is under appeal.\n\nOn September 20, 2018, a guilty judgement was filed by the Milan Judge of the Preliminary Hearing in a separate OPL 245 fast-track trial of two individuals, neither of whom worked for or on behalf of Shell. That decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal which rendered its judgement on June 24, 2021, acquitting both individuals. Separate OPL 245 pre-trial criminal proceedings are pending against another individual who also did/uni00A0not work for or on behalf of Shell.\n\nIn February 2019, we were informed by the Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office (DPP) that they were nearing the conclusion of their investigation and preparing to prosecute Shell plc for criminal charges directly or indirectly related to the 2011 settlement of disputes over OPL 245 in Nigeria. On October 2, 2019, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) informed Shell that it was closing its inquiry into Shell in relation to OPL 245. We understand that the decision was based on the facts available to/uni00A0the DOJ, including ongoing legal proceedings in Europe. On April 22, 2020, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission notified us/uni00A0that it had also closed its inquiry into Shell in relation to OPL 245. There/uni00A0remains a high degree of uncertainty around the OPL 245 matters and contingencies discussed above, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell's financial condition. Accordingly, at this time, it is not practicable to estimate the magnitude and timing of any possible obligations or payments. Any violation of anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money laundering legislation could have a material adverse effect on Shell plc's earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Simplification of share structure\n\nOn December 20, 2021, the Board decided to proceed with the simplification (as outlined in Note 1). Preceding this decision, a proposed bill on the Dutch dividend withholding tax (DWT) exit tax charge and subsequent amendments were submitted to the Dutch Parliament imposing a DWT exit tax charge on any company that transfers its tax residence to/uni00A0a country that does not levy dividend withholding tax, such as the UK. The amended bill was submitted to the Dutch Council of State for advice and is at an early stage of discussion in the Dutch Parliament. Having considered a range of factors including legal advice, following the transfer/uni00A0of the Company's tax residence it is expected that the Company/uni00A0will ultimately not incur any DWT exit tax cost.\n\nt\n\ns",

In most ETS, governments set an emission cap for one or more sectors. Generally, entities in scope of/uni00A0the/uni00A0scheme are allowed to buy emission certificates to cover shortages or sell surplus emission certificates. In certain countries emissions are priced through a carbon tax. For Shell, the most significant carbon pricing mechanisms are established in Europe, North America, and Singapore.\n\n## Biofuel programmes\n\nBiofuel programmes are mandated schemes that set binding national targets on the share of renewables in fuel consumption or measures on reducing GHG emissions by fuel suppliers. Biofuels are blended with existing fuels such as gasoline and diesel to reduce net emissions. The share of biofuel in the/uni00A0total sales mix of fuel is used to comply with regulatory requirements. This can be achieved by the blending of biofuels in refineries and/or distribution depots (self-blending), through import of biofuels (for jurisdictions that grant biofuels certificates at the point of import) or by the purchasing of certificates from third parties (for jurisdictions that have a tradable biofuel certificates mechanism). Biofuel programmes include also regulatory requirements to pay a levy for the combustion of fossil fuels, based on CO/uni2082 emitted - mainly represented by the German Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) applying since January 1, 2021.\n\nt\n\ns",

These regulations are typically accompanied by schemes supporting investments in the renewable technology. Renewable power programmes generally use certificates to monitor compliance, where renewable power certificates are granted for each MWh of energy generated that meets the predefined renewable criteria. Shell's compliance obligation under renewable power programmes comes primarily from energy supply and results from regulations applying in Europe, North America and Australia.\n\n## Cost of emission schemes and related environmental programmes recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income\n\n|                         | 2021      | $ million 2020   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|------------------|\n| ETS and related schemes | 331       | 150              |\n| Biofuels [A]            | 2,609 [B] | 1,137            |\n| Renewable power         | 455       | 364              |\n| Total                   | 3,395     | 1,651            |\n\n- [A] Represents the cost of biofuel certificates required for compliance purposes over and above those generated from self-blending activities.\n- [B]  Includes the cost under the German Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) applying since January 1, 2021.\n\n## Purchased environmental certificates (presented under Other Intangible assets, see Note 8) [A]\n\n|                      | ETS and related  schemes   | Biofuels   | Renewable  power   | $ million Total   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------|------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| At January 1, 2021   | 157                        | 780        | 76                 | 1,013             |\n| Additions            | 292                        | 2,450      | 405                | 3,147             |\n| Settlements          | (115)                      | (754)      | (355)              | (1,224)           |\n| Other movements      | (50)                       | (114)      | (25)               | (189)             |\n| At December 31, 2021 | 284                        | 2,362      | 101                | 2,747             |\n\n## Obligation (presented under Other payables, see Note 16)\n\n|                                        | ETS and related  schemes   | Biofuels [B]   | Renewable  power   | $ million Total   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| At January 1, 2021                     |                            |                |                    |                   |\n| Current                                | (154)                      | (1,549)        | (290)              | (1,993)           |\n| Non-current                            | -                          | (54)           | (6)                | (60)              |\n|                                        | (154)                      | (1,603)        | (296)              | (2,053)           |\n| Additions                              | (781)                      | (2,756)        | (487)              | (4,024)           |\n| Additions covered by government grants | 456 [A]                    |                |                    | 456               |\n| Settlements                            | 150                        | 755            | 491                | 1,396             |\n| Other movements                        | 59                         | 160            | (10)               | 209               |\n|                                        | (116)                      | (1,841)        | (6)                | (1,963)           |\n| At December 31, 2021                   |                            |                |                    |                   |\n| Current                                | (270)                      | (3,262)        | (273)              | (3,805)           |\n| Non-current                            | -                          | (182)          | (29)               | (211)             |\n|                                        | (270)                      | (3,444)        | (302)              | (4,016)           |\n\n- [A] Emission certificates that were allocated free of charge at an equivalent fair value at grant date.\n- [B]  Includes the liability under the German Fuel Emissions Trading Act (BEHG) applying since January 1, 2021.",

In addition, a portfolio of environmental certificates is held for trading purposes and classified under inventory (see Note 2 and Note 13). Environmental certificates held for trading purposes can be redesignated for compliance purposes and then settle compliance obligations.\n\nCost recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents the compliance cost associated with emissions or with products sold during the year. The liability at year-end represents the compliance cost recognised over current and past compliance periods to the extent not settled to date. Liabilities are settled in line with compliance periods, which depend on the scheme and may not coincide with the calendar year.\n\nThe figures present compliance schemes only, excluding voluntary activities.\n\n## 32/uni00A0- POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\n\nOn January 20, 2022, Shell completed the sale of its interest in Deer Park Refining Limited Partnership, a 50:50 joint venture between Shell Oil Company and P.M.I. Norteamerica, S.A. De C.V. (a subsidiary of Petroleos Mexicanos) for a total of $596 million, consisting of a combination of/uni00A0cash/uni00A0and debt.\n\nOn January 21, 2022, the Company changed its name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to Shell plc.\n\nOn January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through assimilation of A shares and B shares into a single line of ordinary shares of the/uni00A0Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on dividends on/uni00A0A/uni00A0shares,/uni00A0no longer applies on dividends paid on the ordinary shares following assimilation.\n\nOn February 3, 2022, Shell announced the commencement of $8.5 billion of share buybacks for the first half of 2022. This comprises the remaining $5.5 billion of Permian divestment proceeds and $3.0 billion as part of the Company's capital allocation framework, which includes shareholder distributions in the range of 20-30% of cash flow from operations. In the first tranche of this buyback programme, the Company has entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a broker to enable the purchase of ordinary shares for a period up to and including May 4, 2022. The aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the initial programme is $4.0 billion. All shares repurchased as/uni00A0part of this arrangement will be cancelled.\n\nOn February 11, 2022, Shell Pipeline Company LP announced it had made a non-binding offer to purchase all remaining common units held by the/uni00A0public representing limited partner interests in Shell Midstream Partners, L.P. ('SHLX') for $12.89 per common unit in cash. At the date of the announcement, Shell and its affiliates owned approximately 68.5% of SHLX common units. The proposed transaction is subject to a number of contingencies, including the approval of the board of directors of SHLX and the satisfaction of any conditions to the consummation of a transaction set/uni00A0forth in any definitive agreement concerning the transaction. There can be no assurance that such definitive documentation will be executed or/uni00A0that/uni00A0any transaction will materialise on the terms described above or at all.\n\nRussia's recent invasion of Ukraine poses wide-ranging challenges. Given the evolving situation, there are many unknown factors and events that could materially impact our operations. These events have and continue to impact commodity prices, our supply chain, credit risks including those related to receivables, commodity trading, treasury and other factors. Any of these factors, individually or in aggregate, could have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nOn February 28, 2022, following Russia's invasion in Ukraine, Shell announced its intention to exit its ventures in Russia with Gazprom and related entities, and to end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. At the end of 2021, Shell had around $3/uni00A0billion in non-current assets in these ventures in Russia. In 2021, net income from Sakhalin Energy and Salym was $0.7/uni00A0billion.\n\nSubsequently, on March 8, 2022, Shell announced its intent to withdraw from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons, including crude oil, petroleum products, gas and LNG in a phased manner, aligned with new government guidance. As an immediate first step, Shell will stop all spot purchases of Russian crude oil. It will also shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia. At the end of 2021, Shell had around $0.4/uni00A0billion in non-current assets in its downstream operations in Russia.\n\nIt is expected that these decisions to start the process of exiting ventures with Gazprom and related entities, to end the involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and to shut down its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia will impact the carrying value of the related assets and lead to recognition of impairments in 2022. Details of Shell's interest in the respective ventures and operations are as follows.\n\n- \u25a0 Sakhalin-2: Shell has a 27.5% interest in Sakhalin-2, an integrated oil and gas project located on Sakhalin island, accounted for as an associate. Other ownership interests are Gazprom 50%, Mitsui 12.5%, Mitsubishi 10%.\n\n\u25a0\n\nSalym: Shell has a 50% interest in Salym Petroleum Development N.V., a joint operation with Gazprom Neft that is developing the Salym fields\n\n- \u25a0 Gydan: A joint operation with Gazprom Neft (Shell interest 50%) to explore and develop blocks in the Gydan peninsula, in north-western Siberia. The project is in the exploration phase, with no production.\n\nin/uni00A0the/uni00A0Khanty Mansiysk Autonomous District of western Siberia.\n\n- \u25a0 Nord Stream 2: Shell is one of five energy companies which have each committed to provide financing and guarantees for up to 10% of the total cost/uni00A0of the project, which is accounted for as a long-term loan.\n- \u25a0 Shell's downstream operations in Russia: Shell owns 100% of its downstream operations in Russia which consist of service stations, aviation fuels and/uni00A0lubricants operations.\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION - OIL AND GAS (UNAUDITED)\n\n## ABOUT THIS SECTION\n\nThe purpose of this section is to comply with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 'Extractive Activities Oil/uni00A0and Gas (Topic 932)'. Extractive activities for this purpose include exploration and production activities to extract oil, condensates, natural gas liquids, oil sands and natural gas from their natural reservoirs.\n\nIn Shell, extractive activities, or oil and gas exploration and production activities, are undertaken within the Upstream segment, Integrated Gas segment and Oil Products segment (oil sands). Shell's extractive activities do not represent the full extent of the Upstream, Integrated Gas and Oil Products activities and exclude downstream GTL, some LNG activities, Marketing business in Oil Products, Power and New Energies, trading and/uni00A0optimisation, as well as other non-extractive activities. As a result, the/uni00A0information in this extractive activities section is not suitable for modelling Shell's integrated businesses, for which we refer to the segment/uni00A0information. Full segment information to the Consolidated Financial Statements is available on pages 245-248.\n\nThe information set out on pages 285-301 is referred to as 'unaudited' as/uni00A0a/uni00A0means of clarifying that it is not covered by the audit opinion of the independent registered public accounting firm that has audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## PROVED RESERVES\n\nProved reserves estimates are calculated pursuant to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules and the FASB's Topic 932. Proved reserves can be either developed or undeveloped. The definitions used are in accordance with the SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X. We include proved reserves associated with future production that will be consumed in operations.\n\nProved reserves shown are net of any quantities of crude oil or natural gas that are expected to be (or could be) taken as royalties in kind. Proved reserves outside North America include quantities that will be settled as royalties in cash. Proved reserves include certain quantities of crude oil or natural gas that will be produced under arrangements that involve Shell subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in risks and rewards but do not/uni00A0transfer title of the product to those entities./uni00A0\n\nSubsidiaries' proved reserves at December 31, 2021, were divided into 80% developed and 20% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. For the Shell share of joint ventures and associates, the proved reserves at December 31, 2021, were divided into 88% developed and 12% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent basis./uni00A0\n\nProved reserves are recognised under various forms of contractual agreements. Shell's proved reserves volumes at December 31, 2021, present in agreements such as production-sharing contracts (PSC), tax/variable royalty contracts or other forms of economic entitlement contracts, where the Shell share of reserves can vary with commodity prices, were 1,835 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids, and/uni00A012,804 thousand million standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas.\n\nProved reserves cannot be measured exactly because estimation of reserves involves subjective judgement (see 'Risk factors' on page 26 and/uni00A0our 'Proved reserves assurance process' below). These estimates remain subject to revision and are unaudited supplementary information./uni00A0\n\n## PROVED RESERVES ASSURANCE PROCESS\n\nA central group of reserves experts, who on average have around 25 years' experience in the oil and gas industry, undertake the primary assurance of the proved reserves bookings. This group of experts is part of/uni00A0the Resources Assurance and Reporting (RAR) organisation within Shell./uni00A0A Vice President with 36/uni00A0years' experience in the oil and gas industry currently heads the RAR organisation. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and holds a BA in mathematics from Oxford University and an MEng in Petroleum Engineering from Heriot-Watt University. The RAR organisation reports directly to an Executive Vice President of Finance, who is a\n\nmember of the Upstream Reserves Committee (URC). The URC is a multidisciplinary committee consisting of senior representatives from the Finance, Legal, Integrated Gas and Upstream organisations. The URC reviews and endorses all major (larger than 20 million barrels of oil equivalent) proved reserves bookings and debookings and endorses the total aggregated proved reserves. Final approval of all proved reserves bookings remains with Shell's CEO, and all proved reserves bookings are reviewed by Shell's Audit Committee. The Internal Audit function also provides secondary assurance through audits of the control framework./uni00A0\n\n## CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL AND BITUMEN\n\nShell subsidiaries' proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs), synthetic crude oil and bitumen at the end of the year; their share of the proved reserves of joint ventures and associates at the end of the year; and the changes in such reserves during the year are set out on pages 285-287. Significant changes in these proved reserves are discussed below, where 'revisions and reclassifications' are changes based on new information that resulted from development drilling, production history, and changes in economic factors./uni00A0\n\n## PROVED RESERVES 2021-2020 Shell subsidiaries Asia\n\nThe net increase of 121 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Kashagan and Upper Salym.\n\n## USA\n\nThe net increase of/uni00A0119 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Mars and Stones.\n\nThe decrease of 136 million barrels in sales in place was in Permian.\n\nThe increase of 55 million barrels in extensions and discoveries was mainly/uni00A0in Whale Dev.\n\n## Canada\n\nThe net decrease of 90 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Jackpine Mine and Muskeg River mine.\n\n## South America\n\nThe net increase of 325 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications half of which was mainly in Mero.\n\nThe increase of 103 million barrels in extensions and discoveries was/uni00A0mainly in Mero.\n\n## Europe\n\nThe increase of 67 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Schiehallion and Val d'Agri.\n\n## Africa\n\nThe decrease of 53 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Nigeria.\n\n## PROVED RESERVES 2020-2019 Shell subsidiaries\n\nThe net increase of 181 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Kazakhstan and Oman.\n\n## Asia\n\n## USA\n\nThe net decrease of/uni00A0116 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications of/uni00A0which half was mainly in Permian and Belridge Light Oil.\n\n## Canada\n\nThe net increase of 55 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Jackpine Mine and Muskeg River mine.\n\n## South America\n\nThe net decrease of 82 million barrels in revisions and reclassifications was/uni00A0mainly in Brazil.",

In our view, the information so calculated does not provide a reliable measure of future cash flows from proved reserves, nor does it permit a realistic comparison to be made of one entity with another because the assumptions used cannot reflect the varying circumstances within each entity. In addition, a substantial but unknown proportion of future real cash flows from oil and gas production activities is expected to derive from reserves which have already been discovered, but which cannot yet be regarded as proved./uni00A0\n\n## STANDARDISED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED RESERVES AT DECEMBER/uni00A031\n\n## 2021 -

Shell's extractive activities do not represent the full extent of Integrated Gas, Upstream and Oil Products activities, and exclude downstream GTL, some LNG activities, Marketing business in Oil Products, Power and New Energies, trading and optimisation, as well as other non-extractive activities.\n\nThe earnings disclosed in this 'extractive activities' section are only a subset of Shell's total earnings and as a result are not suitable for modelling Shell's integrated businesses, for which we refer to the full segment earnings and descriptions of the Integrated Gas, Upstream and Oil Products businesses. These are available on pages/uni00A045, 50/uni00A0and 65 respectively.

Shell supports the EU's ambition to achieve climate neutrality by/uni00A02050 and welcomes measures to increase transparency and mobilise capital towards the energy transition.\n\nThe Taxonomy requires the disclosure of financial information about qualifying activities according to detailed criteria. Shell has followed these rules in preparing our disclosure. But in our view the resulting information does not provide a complete picture of our low-carbon activities because it excludes our interests in equity accounted joint ventures and associates, integrated value chains and spending on early-stage businesses. We/uni00A0encourage efforts to improve the Taxonomy so that it enables a full/uni00A0understanding of how companies in transition are adapting to the needs of their customers, who are progressing towards a low-carbon future at different speeds and via different pathways.\n\nShell supports efforts to develop sustainable finance tools that enable transitional and low-carbon projects to advance the energy transition. Such systems should be workable and inclusive, with all sectors and technologies encouraged to be part of the solution. We see these tools as/uni00A0a complement to energy and sectoral policies that create market incentives for businesses to innovate and invest in low-carbon solutions.\n\n## For more on our energy transition strategy, see 'Climate Change and/uni00A0Energy Transition' on pages 75-98.\n\n## The Taxonomy framework\n\nAs a UK company, Shell is not currently subject to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. We comply with its disclosure requirements on a voluntary basis/uni00A0and expect to come into scope following the adoption of the EU's proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which would extend/uni00A0the reporting obligation to third-country issuers like Shell that list/uni00A0on/uni00A0European exchanges.\n\nThe Taxonomy establishes technical criteria for sustainability across more than 90 economic activities and six environmental objectives. So far, criteria have been approved for the first two objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. These form the basis of our 2021 reporting. Criteria for the four remaining objectives - water, circular economy, pollution control and biodiversity - are expected to be adopted by the EU in 2022.\n\nAn activity is 'Taxonomy-eligible' if it is described in the regulation, irrespective of whether it complies with the technical screening criteria. An/uni00A0activity is 'Taxonomy-aligned' if it contributes substantially to one or/uni00A0more environmental objectives, does no significant harm to any of/uni00A0the/uni00A0other objectives, is carried out in compliance with minimum social/uni00A0safeguards and/uni00A0complies with the technical screening criteria.\n\nFor 2021, companies are required to disclose the share of eligible and non-eligible activities in their total turnover, capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenditure (opex). Starting in 2022, companies are required to assess their eligible activities against the technical screening criteria and provide breakdowns of their aligned and non-aligned turnover, capex and opex.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Scope of Taxonomy-eligible activities   | Scope of Taxonomy-eligible activities                                                                         | Scope of Taxonomy-eligible activities   | Scope of Taxonomy-eligible activities   | Taxonomy-eligible     | Taxonomy non-eligible   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| 3.14 3.17                               | Manufacture of chemicals Manufacture of plastics                                                              | Associates                              | Manufacturing                           | Non-eligible products | Trading                 |\n| 4.1 4.3                                 | Electricity from solar Electricity from wind                                                                  | Associates                              | Power generation                        | Trading               | B2B/B2C solutions       |\n| 7.6                                     | Installation of renewable energy technologies                                                                 | B2C solutions                           |                                         |                       |                         |\n| 3.10 4.13                               | Manufacture of hydrogen Manufacture of biogas and biofuels                                                    | Associates                              | Feasibility                             | Manufacturing         | Trading                 |\n| 1.4                                     | Conservation forestry                                                                                         | Projects                                | Non-eligible NBS projects               | Trading               |                         |\n| 5.11 5.12                               | Transport of CO2 Storage of CO2                                                                               | Feasibility                             | Transport and storage                   |                       |                         |\n| 6.15 7.4                                | Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport Installation of EV charging in buildings and parking spaces | Retail power                            | Infrastructure                          | B2B/B2C solutions     |                         |",

Chemicals and renewable power contributed the largest share of eligible activity, followed by biofuels and low-carbon transport. Our fossil fuel businesses are currently non-eligible under the regulation.\n\nIn addition, Shell engages in low-carbon activities that are outside the scope of the Taxonomy and therefore not included in our reporting. For example, our interests in equity accounted joint ventures and associates are out of scope, which has the effect of understating our participation in/uni00A0businesses such as renewable power and biofuels. The Taxonomy's definition of opex excludes early-stage spending on activities such as hydrogen and CCS, where we incur significant feasibility expenses prior/uni00A0to/uni00A0a final investment decision. It also excludes our purchases of/uni00A0low-carbon energy and investments in Nature-Based Solutions.\n\nWe believe the Taxonomy could be improved by allowing greater recognition of the role of integrated value chains in enabling decarbonisation at a sector level. For example, our renewable power business develops low-carbon solutions for business and residential customers by leveraging our portfolio of renewable generation, trading/uni00A0and retail assets. But under current rules, only the generation component is eligible. Similarly, our investments in sustainable aviation fuel/uni00A0rely on refineries to host biofuels facilities, distribution networks, access to airports and other assets. Presently, only the biofuels manufacturing activity is eligible.\n\nThe Taxonomy recognises activities and environmental performance levels consistent with the EU's environmental goals. According to the European Commission, early studies suggest many companies will have low levels of/uni00A0Taxonomy eligibility and alignment in the initial years of reporting. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0provider of energy and chemical products to customers who are also/uni00A0transitioning to a low-carbon future, Shell expects its Taxonomyeligible activities to evolve in line with the sectors we serve.\n\nThe EU has stated that the Taxonomy will develop over time. The fact that/uni00A0an activity is not recognised does not necessarily mean that it is not/uni00A0sustainable. In addition, not all activities with the potential to make a/uni00A0substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are yet included.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Taxonomy is still evolving and remains subject to interpretation in some areas. The EU has indicated that further guidance will be issued on/uni00A0the application of the reporting requirement. Shell has consulted externally in developing our reporting framework and will update our/uni00A0approach as appropriate.\n\nFor 2021, Shell's reporting method for the Taxonomy follows a systematic process to identify economic activities in scope for reporting and calculate eligible turnover, capex and opex.\n\nShell has assessed its business against the economic activities qualifying for/uni00A0the climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives. Activities are treated as in scope for reporting if they correspond to products or services offered by Shell. For 2021, this resulted in a total of 12 activities, all of which address the climate mitigation objective.\n\nTaxonomy eligibility is expressed as a share of revenue, capex and opex. The/uni00A0scope of each of these measures is defined by the regulation, with the/uni00A0eligible part consisting of amounts derived from products or services associated with Taxonomy-eligible activities. The reporting scope covers Shell's global business, not just activities in Europe.\n\nThe turnover measure comprises the Revenue line from the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe capex measure comprises the Additions line from Note 8 - Intangible Assets and the Additions line from Note 9 - Property, Plant and Equipment to/uni00A0the Consolidated Financial Statements. As the treatment of goodwill under the Taxonomy is uncertain, we exclude it from the capex measure. This/uni00A0measure is reconciled as follows.\n\n## EU Taxonomy capex\n\n|                                            | $ million 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Additions to property, plant and equipment | 21,719           |\n| Additions to intangible assets             | 5,220            |\n| Less: Goodwill                             | 1,546            |\n| Total EU Taxonomy capex                    | 25,393           |\n\nUnder the Taxonomy, opex is defined as costs associated with maintenance and repair, research and development, and short-term leases. This results in a total opex figure of $5.3 billion. The limited scope of the Taxonomy's opex measure differs from Shell's definition of operating expenses, and does not allow us to recognise all of our spending on otherwise eligible activities. This measure is reconciled as follows.\n\n## EU Taxonomy opex\n\n|                                                         | $ million 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Production and manufacturing expenses                   | 23,822           |\n| Selling, distribution and administrative expenses       | 11,328           |\n| Research and development                                | 815              |\n| Total operating expenses                                | 35,964           |\n| Less: Non-maintenance expenses                          | 19,981           |\n| Less: Selling, distribution and administrative expenses | 11,328           |\n| Add: Expenses relating to short-term leases             | 644              |\n| Total EU Taxonomy opex                                  | 5,299            |\n\nt\n\ns",

Because the activity boundaries defined in the regulation differ from our existing value chains, certain adjustments are necessary to calculate the allowed figures. For example, we exclude sales of third-party products, as well as trading and retailing as discrete activities. These are significant for Shell's integrated business model but are not eligible under the Taxonomy. Although intra-group sales are out of scope, sales to our trading and marketing business are used in certain circumstances to calculate the revenue attributable to Taxonomy-eligible parts of the value chain.\n\nWhen a reporting entity contains eligible and non-eligible activity, an allocation method is applied so that only the eligible part is counted. A/uni00A0reconciliation has been made to total revenue, capex and opex to avoid double counting.\n\nData for Taxonomy-eligible turnover, capex and opex are calculated in/uni00A0accordance with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Reporting on this basis differs from that applied for financial reporting purposes in the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' on pages 228-283 and elsewhere in this Report.\n\nIn addition to the required information provided in this section, Shell makes an additional disclosure in the table below to provide further insight into our Taxonomy-eligible activities.

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe Financial Statements of Shell plc (formerly Royal Dutch Shell plc) (the/uni00A0'Company') have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act'), and therefore in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. As applied to the Company, there are no material differences from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); therefore, the Financial Statements have been/uni00A0prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\nAs described in the accounting policies in Note 2, the Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain items measured at fair value. Those accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires management to/uni00A0exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nThe financial results of the Company are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 228-283. The financial results of the Company incorporate the results of the Dividend Access Trust (the 'Trust'), the financial statements of which are presented on pages 316-319.\n\nThe Company's principal activity is being the parent company for Shell, as/uni00A0described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 233).\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the shareholders of the Company supported the resolution to amend the Company's Articles of Association to enable the simplification of the Company. The simplification entailed the assimilation of the Company's shares into a single line, the alignment of the Company's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK and granting the Board the power to change the Company's name. On December 20, 2021, the Board decided to proceed with the proposal. On December 31,/uni00A02021, the first Board meeting of the Company took place in the UK, on/uni00A0January 21, 2022, the Company changed its name from Royal Dutch/uni00A0Shell plc to Shell plc and on January 29, 2022, the Company's shares were assimilated into a single line of shares (see Note 15).\n\n## 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Company's accounting policies follow those of Shell as set out in Note/uni00A02 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 233-241. The/uni00A0following are Company-specific policies./uni00A0\n\n## Presentation and functional currency\n\nThe Company's presentation and functional currency is US dollars (dollars).\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, net of any impairment. Investments are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those investments may not be recoverable. For the purposes of determining whether impairment of investments in subsidiaries has occurred, and the extent/uni00A0of/uni00A0any impairment loss or its reversal, management performs an/uni00A0assessment of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal. Management's conclusion may be determined using one or both of/uni00A0these/uni00A0methodologies as appropriate.\n\nThe original cost of the Company's investment in Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch) was based on the fair value of the shares transferred to the Company by the former shareholders of Royal Dutch in/uni00A0exchange for A shares in the Company during the public exchange offer in 2005. The original cost of the Company's investment in The 'Shell'/uni00A0Transport and Trading Company p.l.c., now The Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited (Shell Transport), was the fair value of the/uni00A0shares held by the former shareholders of The 'Shell' Transport and Trading Company p.l.c., transferred in consideration for the issuance of B shares as part of the Scheme of Arrangement in 2005. The Company's investments in Royal Dutch and Shell Transport subsequently became an investment in Shell Petroleum N.V. (Shell Petroleum); this change had no impact on the cost of investments in subsidiaries. On February 15, 2016, the Company acquired all the voting rights in BG Group plc via the issuance of shares and cash payments of a total fair value of $53,086/uni00A0million. In September 2016, the Company's shares in BG/uni00A0Group/uni00A0Limited (BG), formerly BG Group plc, were exchanged for/uni00A0an/uni00A0increased investment in Shell Petroleum. This change had no/uni00A0impact/uni00A0on the cost of investment in subsidiaries.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividends are recognised on a paid basis unless the dividend has been confirmed by a general meeting of Shell Petroleum, in which case income is recognised on the date at which receipt is deemed virtually certain./uni00A0\n\n## Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe fair value of share-based compensation for equity-settled plans granted to employees of subsidiaries under the Company's plans is/uni00A0recognised as an investment in subsidiaries from the date of grant over/uni00A0the/uni00A0vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\nIn the year of vesting of a plan, the costs for the actual deliveries are charged to the relevant employing subsidiaries. This is recognised as a realisation of the investment originally booked. If the actual vesting costs are higher than the cumulatively recognised share-based compensation charge, the difference is recognised in income./uni00A0\n\nSee Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 274) for/uni00A0information on the Company's principal plan./uni00A0\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe Company was tax-resident in the Netherlands up to December 31, 2021. For the assessment of corporate income tax in the Netherlands, the/uni00A0Company and certain subsidiaries form a fiscal unit. The recognition and derecognition of deferred tax assets and/or liabilities, as applicable, may be done either by the Company or by any of its subsidiary members. Any current tax receivable or payable (and deferred tax asset or liability) recognised by the Company for the fiscal unit as a whole is settled between the Company and other members of the fiscal unit at the balance sheet date. Balances not settled with the Company at the balance sheet date are recognised in the subsidiary member's financial statements and, to the extent they are material, are disclosed in the notes to the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe Company's tax charge or credit recognised in the income statement is/uni00A0calculated at the statutory tax rate prevailing in the Netherlands for/uni00A0current tax and statutory tax rate substantively enacted in the Netherlands for deferred tax.\n\nThe alignment of the Company's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK (see Note 1) resulted in recognition in 2021 of/uni00A0a/uni00A0taxable deemed disposal gain fully offset by taxable losses in the/uni00A0Netherlands.",

Management has therefore performed an impairment test/uni00A0to determine whether recoverable value exceeded the cost of investment recognised.\n\nFollowing the broader recovery in equity markets during the year, recoverable value was assessed by reference to fair value less costs of disposal. This/uni00A0was calculated by comparing the cost of investment with the Group's market capitalisation, adjusted to reflect a control premium. In determining the/uni00A0premium and costs of disposal, available data from recent market transactions in comparable industries, conducted at arm's length for similar assets,/uni00A0have been taken into account.\n\nThis resulted in a recoverable value exceeding the cost of investment recognised and is consistent with management's expectation of the future recoverability of the Company's investment in the Group. As fair value less costs of disposal exceeded cost, no separate value in use calculation was/uni00A0undertaken.\n\nThe recoverability of the Company's investment in the Group may be influenced by the risk factors of the Shell Group, including commodity prices, market supply and demand, expected production volumes and developments related to climate change and the energy transition (see Note 4 to the/uni00A0Consolidated Financial Statements on page 242).\n\n## 5 ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n\n|                                           | Dec 31, 2021   | Dec 31, 2021   | $ million Dec 31, 2020   | $ million Dec 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                           | Current        | Non-current    | Current                  | Non-current              |\n| Amounts due to subsidiaries (see Note 13) | 836            | -              | 874                      | -                        |\n| Accruals and other liabilities            | 901            | -              | 44                       | -                        |\n| Withholding tax payable                   | 121            | -              | 322                      | -                        |\n| Unclaimed dividends                       | 10             | -              | 10                       | -                        |\n| Total                                     | 1,868          | -              | 1,250                    | -                        |\n\nAccruals and other liabilities at December 31, 2021, principally comprise commitments for share repurchases undertaken on the Company's behalf under irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangements of $838 million (2020: nil).\n\nt\n\ns",

The Dutch Fiscal Unit has unrecognised unused tax losses amounting to $2,905 million (2020: $3,776 million) and unrecognised credits carried forward amounted to $356 million (2020: $349 million). Unused tax losses are available for relief against future taxable profits indefinitely, subject to certain restrictions, and to the extent not yet expired as at January 1, 2022. Following the alignment of the Company's tax residence with its country of incorporation in the UK, the Company's losses, or a portion thereof, may be transferred to other group companies remaining in the Netherlands. These losses will remain unrecognised.\n\n## 7 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost in the Company's Balance Sheet comprise amounts due from subsidiaries (see Note 13) and certain amounts reported within accounts payable and accrued liabilities (see Note 5). The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, approximates their carrying amount.\n\nInformation on financial risk management is presented in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see pages 268-273). Foreign currency derivatives are used by the Company to manage foreign exchange risk, which arises when certain transactions are denominated in a currency that is not/uni00A0the Company's functional currency. No derivative financial instruments were held at December 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020.",

This authority expires at the earlier of the close of business on August 18, 2022, and the end of the AGM to be held in 2022, unless previously renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in a general meeting.\n\nAt the May 18, 2021, AGM, shareholders granted the Company the authority to repurchase up to 780 million ordinary shares (excluding any treasury shares), renewing the authority granted by the shareholders at previous AGMs. The authority will expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 18, 2022, and the end of the AGM of the Company to/uni00A0be held in 2022. Ordinary shares purchased by the Company pursuant to this authority will either be cancelled or held in treasury. Treasury shares are shares in the Company which are owned by the Company itself. The minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is \u20ac0.07. The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be/uni00A0paid for an ordinary share is the higher of: (i) an amount equal to 5% above the average market value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out.\n\nB shares repurchased in 2021 under the Company's share buyback programme were all cancelled except for repurchases on December 30/uni00A0and December 31 which were cancelled in January 2022. No/uni00A0A/uni00A0Shares were repurchased.\n\nB shares ranked equally in all respects with A shares except for the dividend access mechanism described below. The Company, Shell Transport and BG can procure the termination of the dividend access mechanism at any time.\n\nThe sterling deferred shares are redeemable only at the discretion of the/uni00A0Company for \u00a31 each and carry no voting rights. There are no further rights to participate in profits or assets, including the right to receive dividends. Upon winding-up or liquidation, the shares carry a right to repayment of paid-up nominal value, ranking ahead of A and B shares.\n\nFor information on the number of shares in the Company held by Shell employee share ownership trusts and trust-like entities to meet delivery commitments under employee share plans, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see pages 274-275)./uni00A0\n\n## Dividend access mechanism for B shares General\n\nDuring the period, dividends paid on A shares had a Dutch source for tax purposes and were subject to Dutch withholding tax. Dividends paid on B shares were settled through the dividend access mechanism, with a UK source for UK and Dutch tax purposes. There was no Dutch withholding tax on such dividends.\n\nSubsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company completed the assimilation of A and B shares into a single class of share, following a change in tax residence to the UK with effect from December 31, 2021. As/uni00A0a result, it is anticipated that future dividend payments will be settled directly by the Company, with the use of the dividend access mechanism restricted to the settlement of amounts unclaimed in respect of dividends declared on Class B shares prior to assimilation.\n\n## Description of dividend access mechanism prior to the assimilation of A and B shares\n\nShell Transport and BG have each issued a dividend access share to Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited as Trustee. Pursuant to a declaration of trust, the Trustee arranges for disbursement of dividends to/uni00A0holders of B shares when claimed. Interest and other income earned on/uni00A0unclaimed dividends will be for the account of Shell Transport and BG and any dividends which are unclaimed after 12 years will revert to Shell Transport and BG once forfeited. Holders of B shares did not have any interest in either dividend access share and did not have any rights against Shell Transport and BG as issuers of the dividend access shares. The only/uni00A0assets held on trust for the benefit of the holders of B shares were dividends paid to the Trustee in respect of the dividend access shares.\n\nThe declaration and payment of dividends on the dividend access shares required board action by Shell Transport and BG (as applicable) and was/uni00A0subject to any applicable limitations in law or in the Shell Transport or/uni00A0BG (as appropriate) articles of association in effect. In no event was the aggregate amount of the dividend paid by Shell Transport and BG under the dividend access mechanism for a particular period to exceed the aggregate of the dividend announced by the Board of the Company on/uni00A0B/uni00A0shares in respect of the same period (after giving effect to currency/uni00A0conversions).\n\nt\n\ns",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued\n\n## 8 SHARE CAPITAL continued\n\nIn particular, under their respective articles of association, Shell Transport and BG were each only able to pay a dividend on their respective dividend access shares which represented a proportional amount of the aggregate of any dividend announced by the Company on the B shares in/uni00A0respect of the relevant period, where such proportions were calculated by reference to, in the case of Shell Transport, the number of B shares in existence prior to completion of the Company's acquisition of BG and, in/uni00A0the case of BG, the number of B shares issued as part of the acquisition, in/uni00A0each case as against the total number of B shares in issue immediately following completion of the acquisition of BG. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, it is not expected that any further dividends will be declared in/uni00A0respect of the dividend access shares.\n\n## Operation of the dividend access mechanism prior to the assimilation of A and B shares\n\nIf, in connection with the announcement of a dividend by the Company on B shares, the Board of Shell Transport and/or the Board of BG elected to declare and pay a dividend on their respective dividend access shares to the Trustee, the holders of B shares were beneficially entitled to receive their share of those dividends pursuant to the declaration of trust (and arrangements were made to ensure that the dividend was paid in the/uni00A0same currency in which they would have received a dividend from/uni00A0the/uni00A0Company).\n\n## 9 OTHER RESERVES\n\n|                          | Merger  reserve   | Share  premium  reserve   | Capital  redemption  reserve   | Share  plan  reserve   | Total   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| At January 1, 2021       | 234,231           | 154                       | 129                            | 905                    | 235,419 |\n| Repurchases of shares    | -                 | -                         | 10                             | -                      | 10      |\n| Share-based compensation | -                 | -                         | -                              | 59                     | 59      |\n| At December 31, 2021     | 234,231           | 154                       | 139                            | 964                    | 235,488 |\n| At January 1, 2020       | 234,231           | 154                       | 123                            | 1,053                  | 235,561 |\n| Repurchases of shares    | -                 | -                         | 6                              | -                      | 6       |\n| Share-based compensation | -                 | -                         | -                              | (148)                  | (148)   |\n| At December 31, 2020     | 234,231           | 154                       | 129                            | 905                    | 235,419 |\n\nIf any amount was paid by Shell Transport or BG by way of a dividend on/uni00A0the dividend access shares and paid by the Trustee to any holder of B/uni00A0shares, the dividend which the Company would otherwise have paid on/uni00A0B shares was reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to such/uni00A0holders of B shares by the Trustee.\n\nThe Company would have had a full and unconditional obligation, in the/uni00A0event that the Trustee did not pay an amount to holders of B shares on/uni00A0a cash dividend payment date (even if that amount had been paid to/uni00A0the Trustee), to pay immediately the dividend announced on B shares. The right of holders of B shares to receive distributions from the Trustee would have been reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any payment actually made by the Company on account of any dividend on/uni00A0B/uni00A0shares.\n\nIf for any reason no dividend was paid on the dividend access shares, holders of B shares would only have received dividends from the Company directly.\n\n## Operation of the dividend access mechanism subsequent to/uni00A0the/uni00A0assimilation of A and B shares\n\nAs a result of the assimilation of each A share and each B share into one ordinary share of the Company the dividend access mechanism will no longer operate to pay dividends to the holders of B shares in the future but amounts paid through the dividend access mechanism will be limited to the settlement of amounts unclaimed in respect of dividends declared prior to assimilation of Class B shares.\n\n$ million\n\nThe merger reserve was established as a consequence of the Company becoming the single parent company of Royal Dutch and Shell Transport and represented the difference between the cost of the investment in those companies and the nominal value of shares issued in exchange for those investments as required by the prevailing legislation at that time, section 131 of the Companies Act 1985. On February 15, 2016, the Company acquired all shares in BG Group plc by means of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the Act, via the issuance of 218.7 million A shares and 1,305.1 million B shares and cash payments. This resulted in an increase in the merger reserve, representing the difference between the fair value and the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company.\n\nOn January 6, 2006, loan notes were converted into 4,827,974 A shares. The difference between the carrying value of the loan notes and the nominal value of the new shares issued was credited to the share premium reserve. The capital redemption reserve was established in connection with repurchases of shares of the Company. The share plan reserve is in respect of equity-settled share-based compensation plans (see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and movement in share-based compensation for the year is the net of the charge to equity and the release as a result of vested awards./uni00A0",

There were no open foreign currency contracts at December 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Company settles general and administrative expenses of the Trust, including the auditor's remuneration.\n\nThe Company has guaranteed contractual payments totalling $54,653 million at December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020: $63,146 million), and related interest, in/uni00A0respect of listed debt issued by Shell International Finance B.V. The/uni00A0fair value/uni00A0of this guarantee was considered to be immaterial at/uni00A0initial recognition and since the likelihood of default is considered remote no subsequent expected credit losses have been recognised.\n\n## 14 AUDITOR'S REMUNERATION\n\nSee Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see pages 281).\n\n## 15 POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\n\nOn January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through assimilation of A shares and B shares into a single line/uni00A0of ordinary shares of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on dividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the ordinary shares following assimilation.\n\nOn February 3, 2022, Shell announced the commencement of $8.5 billion of share buybacks for the first half of 2022. This comprises the remaining $5.5 billion of Permian divestment proceeds and $3.0 billion as part of the Company's capital allocation framework, which includes shareholder distributions in the range of 20-30% of cash flow from operations. In the first tranche of this buyback programme, the Company has entered into an irrevocable, non-discretionary arrangement with a broker to enable the purchase of ordinary shares for a period up to and including May 4, 2022. The/uni00A0aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the initial programme is $4.0 billion. All shares repurchased as/uni00A0part/uni00A0of/uni00A0this arrangement will be cancelled.\n\nt\n\ns",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nIn our opinion the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the/uni00A0Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust's (the Trust) affairs as at December 31, 2021 and of its income for the year then ended; and have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report below. We are independent of the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Financial Statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a suitable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Trustee of/uni00A0Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust's (the Trustee) use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or/uni00A0collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern for a period until 31 March 2023 (the going concern period).\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Trustee with respect to/uni00A0going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this/uni00A0statement is not a guarantee as to the Trust's ability to continue as a/uni00A0going concern.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the Financial Statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Board of Directors of Shell plc (the Directors) are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise stated explicitly within this/uni00A0report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to/uni00A0determine whether there is a material misstatement in the Financial Statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we/uni00A0are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Trustee and the Board of Directors of Shell plc\n\nThe Trustee and the Board of Directors of Shell plc are responsible for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Trustee and the Board of Directors of Shell plc determine is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, the Trustee and the Board of Directors of Shell plc are responsible for assessing the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors of Shell plc either intends to liquidate the Trust or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a/uni00A0guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can/uni00A0arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or/uni00A0in/uni00A0the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the/uni00A0economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial/uni00A0Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\n- \u25a0 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks/uni00A0that are applicable to the Trust and determined that the/uni00A0most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (IFRS and the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934).\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or/uni00A0through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both the Trustee and those charged with governance of Shell plc and its/uni00A0management.\n\n- \u25a0 We understood how the Trust is complying with those frameworks by/uni00A0making enquiries of the Trustee, Shell plc management and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures over the Trust. We/uni00A0corroborated our enquiries through our review of Resolutions of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Trust Committee of the Trustee, papers provided to the Shell plc/uni00A0Audit/uni00A0Committee and correspondence received from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no contradictory evidence.\n- \u25a0 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to/uni00A0identify noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our/uni00A0procedures involved review of Resolutions of the Trust Committee of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Trustee and Shell plc Audit Committee minutes to identify noncompliance with laws and regulations, journal entry testing with/uni00A0a/uni00A0focus on journals meeting our defined risk criteria based on/uni00A0our/uni00A0understanding of the Trust and enquiries of the Trustee, Shell/uni00A0plc/uni00A0management and those responsible for legal and/uni00A0compliance/uni00A0procedures over the Trust.\n- \u25a0 We assessed the susceptibility of the Trust's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by regular meetings with the Trustee, Shell plc management and those responsible for/uni00A0legal and compliance procedures over the Trust to understand where it/uni00A0was considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We considered the programmes and design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls that the Trustee and Shell plc have/uni00A0established to prevent and detect fraud over the Trust and how/uni00A0the/uni00A0Trustee, Shell plc management and those responsible for/uni00A0legal/uni00A0and/uni00A0compliance procedures over the Trust/uni00A0monitor those programmes and controls.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part/uni00A0of our auditor's report.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Trustee and the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Shell plc as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Trustee and the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Shell plc those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or/uni00A0assume responsibility to anyone other than the Trustee and the Board of/uni00A0Directors and Shareholders of Shell plc as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## /s/ Mark Woodward\n\nfor and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP Statutory Auditor London March 9, 2022\n\nt\n\ns",

The Trust is governed by the applicable laws of England and Wales and is resident and domiciled in Jersey. The Trust is not subject to taxation. The Trustee of/uni00A0the Trust is Computershare Trustees (Jersey) Limited, registration number 92182 (the 'Trustee'), 13 Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE1 1ES. The/uni00A0Trust/uni00A0was established as part of a dividend access mechanism.\n\nShell Transport and BG Group Limited (BG) have each issued a dividend access share to the Trustee. Following the announcement of a dividend by/uni00A0the Company on the B shares, Shell Transport and BG may declare a/uni00A0dividend on their dividend access shares. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, it is expected that no further dividends will be declared on the/uni00A0dividend access share (see Note 9).\n\nThe primary purposes of the Trust are to receive, on behalf of the B shareholders of the Company and in accordance with their respective holdings of B shares in the Company, any amounts paid by way of dividend on the dividend access shares and to pay such amounts to the/uni00A0B/uni00A0shareholders on the same pro rata basis. The Trust is not subject to/uni00A0significant market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk.\n\nThe Trust shall not endure for a period in excess of 80 years from May 19, 2005, being the date on which the Trust Deed was executed.\n\n## 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe Financial Statements of the Trust have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on a going concern basis (see Note 9). The accounting policies described in Note 3 have been applied consistently in all periods presented.\n\nThe Financial Statements were approved and authorised for issue by the/uni00A0Trustee on March 9, 2022.\n\nThe financial results of the Trust are included in the Consolidated Financial/uni00A0Statements on pages 228-283 and Parent Company Financial Statements on pages 305-313.\n\n## 3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe Trust's accounting policies follow those of Shell as set out in Note 2/uni00A0to/uni00A0the Consolidated Financial Statements (see pages 233-241). The/uni00A0following are Trust-specific policies.\n\n## Presentation and functional currency\n\nThe Trust's presentation and functional currency is sterling. The Trust's dividend income and dividends paid are principally in sterling.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividends on the dividend access shares are recognised on a paid basis unless the dividend has been confirmed by a general meeting of Shell Transport or BG, in which case income is recognised on the date on which receipt is deemed virtually certain. Dividend income includes amounts receivable from Shell Transport and BG in respect of dividends declared but unclaimed (see Note 4).\n\n## Distributions made\n\nAmounts are recorded as distributed once a payment is made in the appropriate currency using various electronic transfer methods, or an unconditional payment obligation is established. Shell Transport or BG (as/uni00A0appropriate) may, each at their respective discretion, withhold any part of the funding relating to an unpayable dividend until such time as/uni00A0the/uni00A0relevant B shareholder provides accurate or complete details for/uni00A0payment of any such dividend.\n\n## 4 UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS\n\nUnclaimed dividends of \u00a37 million (2020: \u00a37 million) include any pre-electronic transfer dividend cheque payments that have not been presented, have expired or have been returned unpresented. Dividends are also classified as unclaimed where amounts have been withheld due to incomplete or incorrect electronic payment details. Dividends which are/uni00A0unclaimed after 12 years will unconditionally revert to Shell Transport and BG once forfeited.\n\n## 5 CAPITAL ACCOUNT\n\nThe capital account is represented by the dividend access share of 25 pence settled in the Trust by Shell Transport and the dividend access share of 10 pence settled in the Trust by BG. There have been no changes in the capital account in the current or prior year./uni00A0\n\n## 6 DISTRIBUTIONS MADE\n\nDistributions are made to the B shareholders of the Company in accordance with the Trust Deed. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see page 277) for information about dividends per share.\n\n## 7 RELATED PARTIES\n\nThe Trust recognised dividend income of \u00a31,437 million (2020: \u00a31,805 million; 2019: \u00a33,573 million) in respect of the dividend access share from Shell Transport and \u00a3764 million (2020: \u00a3972 million; 2019: \u00a31,911 million) in respect of the dividend access share from BG. The Trust made distributions of \u00a32,201 million (2020: \u00a32,777 million; 2019: \u00a35,484/uni00A0million) to the B shareholders of the Company.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Trust recorded amounts due from Shell Transport of \u00a35 million and BG of \u00a32 million relating to unclaimed dividends (see Note 4).\n\nThe Company pays the general and administrative expenses of the Trust, including the auditor's remuneration.\n\n## 8 AUDITOR'S REMUNERATION\n\nAuditor's remuneration for 2021 audit services was \u00a333,750 (2020:/uni00A0\u00a333,750; 2019: \u00a333,750).\n\n## 9 POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENTS\n\nOn January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through assimilation of A shares and B shares into a single line/uni00A0of ordinary shares/uni00A0of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or/uni00A0dividend entitlements. Dutch withholding tax, applied previously on/uni00A0dividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the/uni00A0ordinary shares following assimilation.\n\nIn relation to the assimilation of the Company's Class A and B shares, the Trust will continue in existence for the foreseeable future to facilitate the payment of unclaimed dividend liabilities for B shareholders, until these are either claimed or forfeited in line with the terms outlined (see Note 4).\n\nAs these unclaimed dividends relate to dividends that were announced by the Company during the period the Company was still named Royal Dutch Shell plc, and it is expected that the Company will not announce any further dividends on the dividend access shares, the Trust continues to be/uni00A0named The Royal Dutch Shell Dividend Access Trust.\n\nt\n\ns",

On October/uni00A027, 2004, the Company was re-registered as a/uni00A0public company limited by shares and changed its name from Forthdeal Limited to Royal Dutch Shell plc. On January 21, 2022, the Company changed its name from Royal Dutch Shell plc to Shell plc. The Company is/uni00A0registered at Companies House, Cardiff, under company number 4366849. The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) issued by the London Stock Exchange is 21380068P1DRHMJ8KU70. The business address for the Directors and Senior Management is Shell Centre, London, SE1 7NA.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, the Company became tax resident in the United/uni00A0Kingdom. Its primary objective is to carry on the business of a holding company. It is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and does not know of any arrangements that may result in a change of control of the Company.\n\n## NATURE OF TRADING MARKET\n\nEffective from January 29, 2022, the Company has one single line of ordinary shares, each having a nominal value \u20ac0.07. All shares are listed and able to trade at Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange. Furthermore, all shares are transferable between these two markets. This makes both these exchanges primary exchanges for the ordinary shares.\n\nOrdinary shares are traded in registered form.\n\nThe Company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange [A]. A depositary receipt is a certificate that evidences ADSs. Depositary receipts are issued, cancelled and exchanged at the office of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10179, USA, as depositary (the Depositary), under a deposit agreement between the Company, the Depositary and the holders of ADSs. Each ADS is equivalent to two ordinary shares of Shell plc deposited under the agreement. All ordinary shares are capable of being deposited with the Depository in exchange for the corresponding amount of ADSs which may be traded at the New York Stock Exchange. This makes the New York Stock Exchange the primary exchange for the Company's ADRs. More information relating to ADSs is given on pages 316-319.\n\n## Listing information\n\nEuronext\n\nLondon Stock\n\n| Identifiers               | Amsterdam       | Exchange       | NYSE         |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|\n|                           | Ordinary share  | Ordinary share | ADS [*]      |\n| Market                    | Primary         | Primary        | Primary      |\n| Ticker symbol             | SHELL           | SHEL           | SHEL         |\n| ISIN                      | GB00BP6MXD84    | GB00BP6MXD84   | US7802593050 |\n| SEDOL                     | BP6MXT4         | BP6MXD8        | BPK3CG3      |\n| CUSIP                     | G80827 101      | G80827 101     | 780259 305   |\n| Index weight at  31/12/21 | AEX: 12.9% (**) | FTSE: 7.39%    | -            |\n\n## SHARE CAPITAL\n\nOn January 29, 2022 as part of the Simplification announced on 20 December 2021, the Company's share capital was assimilated from ordinary A shares and ordinary B shares, into a single line of ordinary shares.

Holders of ADSs will not have shareholder rights. The rights of the holder of an ADS are specified in the Deposit Agreement with the Depositary and are summarised below.\n\nThe Depositary will receive all cash dividends and other cash distributions made on the deposited shares underlying the ADSs and, where possible and on a reasonable basis, will distribute such dividends and distributions to holders of ADSs. Rights to purchase additional shares will also be made/uni00A0available to the Depositary who may make such rights available to/uni00A0holders of ADSs. All other distributions made on the Company's shares will be distributed by the Depositary in any means that the Depositary thinks is equitable and practical. The Depositary may deduct its fees and/uni00A0expenses and the amount of any taxes owed from any payments to/uni00A0holders and it may sell a holder's deposited shares to pay any taxes owed. The Depositary is not responsible if it decides that it is unlawful or/uni00A0impractical to make a distribution available to holders of ADSs.\n\nThe Depositary will notify holders of ADSs of shareholders' meetings of the/uni00A0Company and will arrange to deliver voting materials to such holders of ADSs if requested by the Company. Upon request by a holder, the Depositary will endeavour to appoint such holder as proxy in respect of such holder's deposited shares entitling such holder to attend and vote at shareholders' meetings. Holders of ADSs may also instruct the Depositary\n\nto vote their deposited securities and the Depositary will try, as far as practical and lawful, to vote deposited shares in accordance with such instructions. The Company cannot ensure that holders will receive voting materials or otherwise learn of an upcoming shareholders' meeting in time to ensure that holders can instruct the Depositary to vote their shares.\n\nUpon payment of appropriate fees, expenses and taxes: (i)/uni00A0shareholders/uni00A0may deposit their shares with the Depositary and receive the corresponding class and amount of ADSs; and (ii)/uni00A0holders of ADSs may surrender their ADSs to the Depositary and have the corresponding class and amount of shares credited to their account.\n\nFurther, subject to certain limitations, holders may, at any time, cancel ADSs and withdraw their underlying shares or have the corresponding class and amount of shares credited to their account.\n\n## FEES PAID BY HOLDERS OF ADS s\n\nThe Depositary collects its fees for delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them. The Depositary collects fees for making distributions to investors by deducting those fees from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. The Depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are paid. See page 321.\n\n## PAYMENTS BY DEPOSITARY TO THE COMPANY\n\nJ.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Depositary, has agreed to share with the Company portions of certain fees collected, less ADS programme expenses paid by the Depositary. For example, these expenses include the Depositary's annual programme fees, transfer agency fees, custody fees, legal expenses, postage and envelopes for mailing annual and interim financial reports, printing and distributing dividend cheques, electronic filing of US federal tax information, mailing required tax forms, stationery, postage, facsimile and telephone calls and the standard out-of-pocket maintenance costs for the ADSs. From January/uni00A01, 2021, to/uni00A0February 21, 2022, the Company received $2,500,542.19 from the/uni00A0Depositary.\n\nn",

More information can be found by contacting the relevant provider.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Depositary may charge: (i) a dividend fee of $5.00 or less per 100 ADSs (or portion of 100 ADSs) for cash dividends or issuance of ADSs resulting from share dividends and (ii) an administrative fee of $5.00 or less per 100 ADSs (or portion of 100 ADSs) per calendar year. The Company and Depositary have agreed not to charge these fees at this time.\n\n## EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND OTHER LIMITATIONS AFFECTING SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nOther than restrictions affecting those individuals, entities, government bodies, corporations, or activities that are targeted by European Union (EU) or UK sanctions for example, regarding Syria, Russia or North Korea, and the general EU prohibition to transfer funds to and from for example, North Korea or Syria, we are not aware of any other legislative or other legal provision currently in force in the UK, the Netherlands, the EU or/uni00A0arising under the Articles restricting remittances to holders of the/uni00A0Company's ordinary shares who are non-residents of the UK, or/uni00A0affecting/uni00A0the import or export of capital.\n\n## TAXATION General\n\nThe Company is incorporated in England and Wales and was tax-resident in the Netherlands up to 31 December 2021. The Company's tax residence was moved to the UK with effect from 31 December 2021.\n\nAs a tax resident of the Netherlands, it is generally required by Dutch law to withhold tax at a rate of 15% on dividends on its ordinary shares and ADSs, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax convention or domestic law. Depending on their particular circumstances, non-Dutch tax-resident holders may be entitled to a full or partial refund of Dutch withholding tax. The following sets forth the operation of other provisions on dividends on the Company's various ordinary shares and ADSs to UK and US holders, as well as certain other tax rules pertinent to holders for the 2021 financial year. Holders should consult their own tax adviser if they are uncertain as to the tax treatment of any dividend./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Dividends paid on the dividend access shares\n\nAs part of the Simplification, the A ordinary shares and B ordinary shares were assimilated in to one single line of ordinary shares. Prior to the assimilation, there was no Dutch withholding tax on dividends on B shares or B ADSs, provided that such dividends are paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism (see 'Dividend access mechanism for B shares' on page 319). Dividends paid on the dividend access shares are treated as UK-source for tax purposes and there is no UK withholding tax on them.\n\nIn 2021, all dividends with respect to B shares and B ADSs were paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism.\n\n## Dutch withholding tax\n\nOn January 29, 2022, one line of shares was established through assimilation of each A share and each B share into one single line of ordinary shares of the Company. This assimilation had no impact on voting rights or dividend entitlements. Dutch dividend withholding tax, applied previously on dividends on A shares, no longer applies on dividends paid on the now assimilated ordinary shares following move of Company's tax residence to the UK.\n\nThe following applies to dividends paid in the 2021 and prior financial years:\n\nWhen Dutch withholding tax applies on dividends paid to a US holder (that is, dividends on A shares or A ADSs, or on B shares or B ADSs that are not paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism), the US holder will be subject to Dutch withholding tax at the rate of 15%. A US holder who is entitled to the benefits of the 1992 Double Taxation Convention (the Convention) between the USA and the Netherlands as amended by the protocol signed on March 8, 2004, will be entitled to a reduction in the Dutch withholding tax, either by way of a full or a partial exemption at source or by way of a partial refund or a credit as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 if the US holder is a company that holds directly at least 10% of the voting power in the Company, the US holder will be subject to Dutch withholding tax at a rate not exceeding 5%.\n- \u25a0 if the US holder is an exempt pension trust as described in article 35 of the Convention, or an exempt organisation as described in article 36 thereof, the US holder will be exempt from Dutch withholding tax; or",

        "page_content": "In general, the entire dividend (including any amount withheld) will be dividend income to the US holder and the withholding tax will be treated as a foreign income tax that is eligible for credit against the US holder's income tax liability or a deduction subject to certain limitations. A 'US holder' includes, but is not limited to, a citizen or resident of the USA, or/uni00A0a/uni00A0corporation or other entity organised under the laws of the USA or/uni00A0any of its political subdivisions.\n\nWhen Dutch withholding tax applies on dividends paid to UK tax-resident holders (that is, dividends on A shares or A ADSs, or on B shares or B/uni00A0ADSs that are not paid on the dividend access shares pursuant to the dividend access mechanism), the dividend will typically be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 15%. Such UK tax-resident holder may be entitled to a credit (not repayable) for withholding tax against their UK tax/uni00A0liability. However, certain corporate shareholders are, subject to conditions, exempt from UK/uni00A0tax on dividends. Withholding tax suffered cannot be offset against such exempt dividends. UK tax-resident holders should also be entitled to claim a refund of one-third of the Dutch withholding tax from the Dutch tax authorities in reliance on the tax convention between the Netherlands and the UK. Pension plans meeting certain defined criteria can, however, be entitled to claim a full refund or exemption at source of the dividend tax withheld. Also, UK tax-resident corporate shareholders holding at least a 5% shareholding and meeting other defined criteria are exempted at source from dividend tax.\n\nFor holders who are tax-resident in any other country, the availability of a whole or partial exemption or refund of Dutch withholding tax is governed by Dutch tax law and/or the tax convention, if any, between the Netherlands and the country of the holder's residence.\n\nThere may be other grounds on which holders who are tax-resident in the UK, the USA or any other country can obtain a full or partial refund of the Dutch withholding tax, depending on their particular circumstances; see 'Taxation: General' above.\n\n## Capital gains tax/uni00A0\n\n## Dutch capital gains taxation\n\nCapital gains on the sale of shares of a Dutch tax-resident company by/uni00A0a/uni00A0US holder are generally not subject to taxation by the Netherlands unless the US holder has a permanent establishment therein and the capital gain is derived from the sale of shares that are part of the business/uni00A0property of/uni00A0the permanent establishment.\n\n## Dutch succession duty and gift taxes\n\nShares of a Dutch tax-resident company held by an individual who is not a/uni00A0resident or a deemed resident of the Netherlands will generally not be subject to succession duty in the Netherlands on the individual's death.\n\nA gift of shares of a Dutch tax-resident company by an individual who is not a resident or a deemed resident of the Netherlands is generally not subject to Dutch gift tax.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nSales or transfers of the Company's ordinary shares within a clearance service (such as Euroclear Nederland) or of the Company's ADSs within the ADS depositary receipts system will not give rise to a stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) liability and should not in practice require the payment of UK stamp duty.\n\nThe transfer of the Company's ordinary shares to a clearance service (such/uni00A0as Euroclear Nederland) or to an issuer of depositary shares (such/uni00A0as ADSs) will generally give rise to a UK stamp duty or SDRT liability at the rate of 1.5% of consideration given or, if none, of the value of the shares. A/uni00A0sale of the Company's ordinary shares that are not held within a/uni00A0clearance service (for example, settled through the UK's CREST system of/uni00A0paperless transfers) will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or SDRT/uni00A0at the rate of 0.5% of the amount of the consideration, normally paid by the purchaser.\n\nFor the purposes of UK capital gains tax, the market values [A] of the shares of the former public parent companies of the Shell Group at the relevant dates were:\n\n|                                                                                                                                  |   March 31, 1982 | July 20, 2005   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (N.V.

These items are in/uni00A0some cases driven by external factors and may, either individually or/uni00A0collectively, hinder the comparative understanding of Shell's financial/uni00A0results from period to period.\n\nThe 'Adjusted EBITDA (CCS basis)' and 'Adjusted EBITDA (FIFO basis)' measures are introduced with effect from January 1, 2021. Management uses both measures to evaluate Shell's performance in the period and over time. We define 'Adjusted EBITDA (CCS basis)' as 'Income/(loss) for the period' adjusted for current cost of supplies; identified items; tax charge/ (credit); depreciation, amortisation and depletion; exploration well write-offs and net interest expense.

Under these rules, regular settlement will occur on a T+2 basis for trades occurring on or after the SEC's implementation date of September 5, 2017. As a result RDS A ADSs and RDS B ADSs traded on the NYSE markets will now settle in line with RDS A shares and RDS B shares traded on European markets, who moved to a T+2 settlement basis for trades in 2014, resulting in the same ex-dividend date for RDS A shares, RDS B shares, RDS A ADSs and RDS B ADSs. Record dates will not change. The timings of these are detailed above.\n- [E]  A different currency election date may apply to shareholders holding shares in a securities account with a bank or financial institution ultimately through Euroclear Nederland. This may also apply to other shareholders who do not hold their shares either directly on the Register of Members or in the corporate sponsored nominee arrangement. Shareholders can contact their broker, financial intermediary, bank or financial institution for the election deadline that applies.\n\n## CONTACT US\n\nThe best way to get in touch is via the 'Contact us' section of the Shell website www.shell.com/investors.
