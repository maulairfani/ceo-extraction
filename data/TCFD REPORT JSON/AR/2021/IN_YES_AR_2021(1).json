Shaping the next.\n\nYES BANK has emerged on the other side of its transformation journey with its market standing reinstated and is resolute and focused on its forward path. Our differentiated approach to growth aims at growing existing businesses and diversifying our loan profiles. Digitization has penetrated deep within our banking infrastructure, and our powerful digital frontend is helping to break open the market within the Retail, SME, Wholesale and Rural segments by extending both the ease and the reach of banking.\n\nThe last twelve months has seen the Bank return to full year net profitability of ' 1,066 crore, improved asset quality and successfully grown deposits. Likewise, we have consolidated our lead in the new-age digital payments space. YES BANK holds the highest market share in UPI transactions. Clients have renewed their confidence in us, and we have won back accounts  and  increased  our  share  of  wallet.  Our  stringent governance structures, oversight and accountability mechanisms and hard focus on recoveries have cumulatively helped to improve our GNPA ratios and led to more robust collateral coverage and credit evaluation for new loans. Thus, the strategic foundations that we have laid as a part of our reconstruction exercise are already bearing fruit.\n\nOur technology transformation has significantly contributed to our revival and will power our future growth. Our API-first approach has already enhanced the microservices business architecture enabling faster integration with B2B customers and  partners.  Work  is  underway  for  a  'Zero  Operations' journey, with data-led decisions enabled by AI/ML overlays. Progressive  cloud  adoption  will  accelerate  efficiency  and flexibility while reducing risk.\n\nWe  aggressively  focus  on  talent  management  to  fulfil our  ambitious  growth  agenda.  Keeping  sight  of  our  ESG commitments,  we  are  leading  the  path  to  sustainability within the Indian banking industry.

We have also launched the first  green  bond  and  green  fixed  deposit  amongst  the Indian banks.\n\nSeveral  aspects  of  our  transformation  are  converging  to build  favourable  traction  on  our  growth  journey  while  we continue to reimagine our business in view of the dynamic economic landscape.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the vaccination drive becoming entrenched and demand coming back in the second half of the year, the Bank swiftly changed gears and gained momentum in all business areas. This enabled the Bank to end on a strong note - as seen from various business metrics  -  deposits  and  advances  growth,  fee  income, digital product launches, stressed asset recoveries etc. The  Bank's  positive  financial  performance  reflects  its underlying solid fundamentals and growth potential.\n\nThe  Bank  stays  committed  to  executing  its  longterm  strategy  of  being  a  leading  Universal  Bank  and strengthening  its  market-leading  position  as  a  Banker to  the  'new  age'  economy  while  steadily  growing  its Retail,  SME and Wholesale businesses and diversifying income  streams.  At  the  same  time,  the  focus  of  the Bank's  management  is  to  build  an  institution  which has  the  highest  standards  of  governance,  strong  risk processes, and is financially strong and technologically powered to deliver the best value to its customers and all stakeholders.\n\nAccordingly, the Bank's key strategic objectives are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo achieve the long-term strategic objectives, the Bank has laid out a comprehensive Business Strategy for the next few years, which hinges on three key pillars:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Inclusive, customer centric, digital & analytics led growth\n\n- \u00b7 Granularizing the business model\n- \u00b7 Deepen and widen our reach\n- \u00b7 Creating value across Business ecosystem & capturing flows\n- \u00b7 Best in class 'digical' customer experience\n- \u00b7 Tap incremental business opportunities in stressed assets space\n\n## Market Leadership through value creation in the new age economy\n\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure rails to digital players\n- \u00b7 Banker to the new age businesses e.g., fintechs, startups\n- \u00b7 Reimagining banking through partnerships\n\n## Responsible franchise supported by People, Technology & Data\n\n- \u00b7 Highest  standards  of  business  ethics and integrity\n- \u00b7 Embedding  ESG  across  core  business functions\n- \u00b7 Build a purpose driven organization and strong employee value proposition\n- \u00b7 Build muscle in Technology & Data",

It will strive to become 'Bigger and  Better'  through  a  holistic  business  model  and granular  balance  sheet  growth,  led  by  a  focus  on  the Retail and SME segments. With customers at the centre of its actions, the Bank aims to strengthen its customer experience and service with greater empathy and digitize key  asset  and  deposit  journeys  to  build  segmented and personalized 'digital first' propositions. The Bank's complete product suite has been utilized for banking the entire life cycle of the customer.\n\nThe growth of retail distribution continues to be a core part of the Bank's strategy, driven by its pan-India branch network and strong digital capabilities and alliances. The Bank also recognizes the key role that Rural India will play in India's growth story and is fully committed to fulfilling its role in serving the Bharat ecosystem. The Bank has placed a significant thrust on identifying emerging rural markets to increase value growth and drive profitability.\n\nThe  Bank  has  also  been  a  strong  Wholesale  banking player in the industry and will continue on this glide path by growing with a calibrated approach. Key pillars of the wholesale banking strategy have been to focus on client & sector-specific lending opportunities with an eye on new customer  onboarding,  deepening  product  penetration and  cross-sell,  liability  growth  and  solutioning  based focus  on  government  banking  and  emerging  local corporates.  The  Bank  is  making  digital  investments and  focusing  on  knowledge  sector-driven  relationship management to achieve this strategy while maintaining the highest governance and risk management standards. The Bank is also targeting selective opportunities in the infrastructure lending space that are likely to get a boost from enhanced business prospects in the economy and government expenditure.\n\nThe  Bank  recognises  an  immense  opportunity  in relationship  banking  to  the  start-up,  e-commerce  and fintech  ecosystem.  The  Bank  aspires  to  be  the  Banker of  Choice  to  these  new-age  companies  by  providing niche, customised banking solutions and selective debt and equity participation. The Bank also plans to grow its Cash Management business further, primarily driven by FinTechs and the E-commerce segment and has become the preferred Banking Partner across India. At the same time,  the  Bank  will  focus  on  growing  its  Trade  Finance business through increasing non-credit flows and other initiatives  such  as  digital  analytics  based  cash  flow lending and supply chain financing.\n\nThe Bank continues to be a market leader in the digital payments space and has steadily invested in monetising these  capabilities.  The  Bank  processes  nearly  every third  digital  transaction  in  the  country    which  totals over 6 billion monthly. It has invested in the necessary infrastructure to introduce new  digital payment solutions  for  the  customers  and  partners,  including foraying into new areas such as Toll & Transit payments and collections. The Bank has also implemented the first of its kind cloud-native module to act as a sponsor bank for IPOs. It also foresees an opportunity in the Payment Aggregation (PA) space, wherein the Bank may provide a tech platform to fintech players to allow them to comply with regulatory guidelines.\n\nContinuing to focus on People and making investments in strengthening its Technology and Data infrastructure are pivotal  to  achieving  the  Bank's  strategic  objectives.  The Bank is future-proofing its technology platforms to further the  digital  agenda  of  the  Bank,  with  IT  infrastructure upgrades  as  required  to  cope  with  increased  scale  and volumes.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  building  new  muscle through initiatives such as introducing the Garage concept for  in-house  agile  development  &  API  banking  hub.  The Bank  is  also  strengthening  its  capabilities  across  data management, analytics, and artificial intelligence to deliver business value and growth.\n\nThe  Bank  is  committed  to  best-in-class  training  and capability  building  for  its  employees,  focusing  on  'role and  skill-specific  training  and  certifications  across  all levels. Additionally, the Bank has also launched the 'APEX Leadership  Program'  for  top  and  senior  management leaders focused on the theme of 'Conscious Leadership'. To  build  a  steady  stream  of  high-quality  talent  for  the Bank,  innovative  'train  and  hire'  programs  have  been launched in FY 2021-22, including the YES PROFESSIONAL BANKER program and YES FORCE program. The Bank also continued to invest in hiring top-end young talent from premier educational institutions through the flagship 'YES Professional Entrepreneurship Program'.\n\nLast but not least, the Bank recognizes that sustainable growth  is inextricably linked with environmental sustainability, social development, and good governance and, therefore, continues to integrate ESG considerations into its core business strategically.\n\n## Banker to the new age economy\n\n## Be good, Do good",

After deftly navigating a challenging macro  scenario  in  the  wake  of COVID-19 and other extraneous factors, your Bank is now well placed to deliver accelerated solid growth into the future in an inclusive and sustainable  way.  Despite  several challenges, the Bank turned a significant  corner  and  achieved  a historic  milestone  of  returning  to robust  profitability  after  a  gap  of two years.\n\nTo  ensure  seamless  and  quality  growth  from hereon, our top priorities would be to extend the boundaries  of  safe  and  easy  banking,  establish new paradigms of customer satisfaction, sharpen our operating performance, and foster innovation and digitisation that will give strong momentum to  our  fast-emerging  business  evolution.  Your Bank will continue to ensure that this quality and sustainable  growth  is  achieved  by  maintaining the highest standards of governance, compliance, and risk assurance.\n\n## EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT\n\nFY  2021-22  has  been  a  year  of  resurgence  for  the economy,  and  our  growth  curve  has  gained  from this  upswing.  After  a  year  of  contraction  of  6.6%  in 2020-21,  the  Indian  economy  is  back  on  track  in FY 2021-22 and has grown by 8.7%. Agricultural growth remained in the positive territory through the period of the COVID-19 restrictions. Manufacturing sector growth was at  9.9%  in  FY  2021-22,  after  being  in  a  contraction zone in  the  previous  year  while  Services  sector  growth was strong at 8.4% in FY 2021-22, recovering from a 7.8% contraction in FY 2020-21.\n\nThe new fiscal has started with its challenges as the world economy  remains  on  edge  against  global  inflationary pressures  and  the  unexpected  Russia-Ukraine  conflict and  its  broader  geopolitical  implications.  With  oil and  commodity  prices  ratcheting  up,  India's  macro fundamentals  are  also  likely  to  be  under  pressure, especially as inflationary contagion  worsens  and external  sector  vulnerability  increases.  Consequential potential adverse impact and volatility of fixed income and capital markets will need to be closely monitored. However, as per estimates by multilateral agencies, India would maintain its position among the fastest-growing economies globally, with RBI holding adequate stock of foreign  exchange  reserves  to  contain  external  sector vulnerabilities. Even with all these global uncertainties, we  expect  the  government  to  continue  its  reforms process and support robust economic growth through calibrated  public  capital  expenditure  and  continued policy modifications for ease of doing business.\n\nGiven  the  growing  uncertainties  over  global  and domestic  risks,  your  Bank  will  maintain  a  strong  vigil for  unexpected  risks.  Over  the  past  two  years,  we have  steered  through  a  very  complex  situation  and developed  robust  risk  processes.  Therefore,  the  Bank remains  confident  of  achieving  its  full  potential  in  the current financial year by tapping into emerging growth\n\nBalance  Sheet  crosses D 3  lakh crore  during  the  year  and  GNPA ratio improves to 13.9% vs 15.4% last year.\n\nopportunities and extending full support and services to the underserved.\n\n## TRANSFORMATION YIELDING STRONG RESULTS\n\nThe Bank's transformation journey is now near complete, and  the  restructuring  is  yielding  strong  results.  While the year that followed the start of this transformation was about building more robust internal structures, risk management mechanisms and growing public trust, this year's focus has been on delivering on the promise and setting a definitive growth agenda for the future.\n\nYour  Bank  has  performed  successfully  across  several key  parameters  despite  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and other  headwinds  that  slowed  economic  growth  over the year. The Bank reported a net profit of ' 1,066 crore in  FY  2021-22 - this is the first full year of profitability reported since FY19. Strong growth is reflected across total  assets,  advances,  deposits,  and  the  strategic objective of our advances mix between Retail and MSME to  Corporate  at  60:40  has  been  achieved.  Our  deposits growth  has  been  leapfrogging  ahead,  with  current account deposits growing by 39% and savings accounts deposits by 48% Yo Y .  Our retail book has become more diversified this year, and we continue to keep a hawk-eye focus on the quality and collections under this book. The Bank's balance sheet crossed ' 3  lakh  crore  for  the  first time  since  September  2019.  GNPA  ratio  has  improved to  13.9%  vs  15.4%  last  year.  These  positive  indicators",

Both our retail and wholesale businesses are designed to leverage this force multiplier.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nspotlight YES BANK's transformation after the turbulence of the recent years, and we are deeply grateful to all our stakeholders  for  standing  with  us  and  demonstrating faith  in  us.  We  endeavour  to  deliver  on  our  mission  of being a customer-centric, service-driven bank catering to the future needs of India. For tomorrow belongs to those who shape it today.\n\n## RIDING THE TECH WAVE\n\nThe next wave of digitisation in banking will be catalysed by  intelligent platforms  that  extend  serviceability and  unlock  new  customer  segments  and  business opportunities. Both our retail and wholesale businesses are designed to leverage this force multiplier. A strong foundation  has  already  been  built  with  an  extensive pan-India network of 1,122 branches. Our physical reach underpins the vast digital  ecosystem  that  we  carefully weld  together  as  our  digital  frontend.  The  full-service virtual front end includes the Loan in Seconds platform and automated service initiatives like YES Robot and the CRM platform - YES Genie, resulting in lower turnaround times and higher productivity. We are already witnessing the  gains,  and  in  FY  2021-22,  74%  of  our  new  CASA accounts were sourced digitally.\n\n## PRODUCT AND SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION\n\nA  digitally  advanced,  feature-loaded  frontend  also requires a different perspective on products and services. We  enable  this  through  our  indigenously  developed single banking interface Insights 2 Engage . It uses business intelligence  and  analytics  to  generate  personalized\n\ncustomer  experiences  and  service  differentiation. The interface intuitively transforms to create a service experience  and  cross-sell  opportunities  that  emanate from  an  intelligent  and  correlated  understanding  of customers' banking profiles, unique customer histories and demographics. Every customer is served with deep knowledge, in lesser time and with a higher conversion success. In this way, we are also transforming the sales and  customer  handling  functions,  making  them  more intimate, client-focused, and available on tap.\n\n## CUSTOMER SEGMENTS OF INTEREST\n\nThe  banking  space  in  India  is  ripe  for  disruptions,  big and small. One kind of disruption is to bring unbanked customers into the fold - either through first-time access or by making inroads through synergistic service lines. Rural  and  semi-urban  India  holds  enormous  promise for  driving  value  growth  and  profitability.  We  have been  deepening  our  branch  presence  in  rural  regions and strategically partnering with technology providers for co-origination and cross-sell retail and SME assets, insurance, securities, and wealth offerings. We are also working  as  an  ecosystem  co-creator  and  enabler.  YES BANK's Agri Infinity programme aims to co-developing digital  financial  solutions  for  the  food  and  agriculture ecosystem  by  mentoring  entrepreneurial  ventures  in the field.\n\nThe MSME segment continues to remain attractive for us.  The  micro,  small  and  medium  businesses  suffered the brunt of the COVID-19-related economic downturn. But  there  are  some  strong  positives  in  their  favour. They  are  also  early  and  intensive  users  of  tech-based banking.  MSMEs  have  been  able  to  pivot  around quickly  with  a  helping  hand  from  the  government. MSME business made up 24% of our advances base in FY  2021-22,  and  we  see  a  huge  potential  for  product volumes and customer size in this segment.\n\nWe  are  offering  our  entire  product  suite  across  all customer  segments  -  HNIs,  affluent,  NRIs,  mass,  rural and  inclusive  banking,  and  retain  the  flexibility  to  roll out tailor-made solutions for specific customer groups. This is easier with our tech-enabled functionalities and a fully loaded digital frontend. Self-assist digital tools like the MSME App, Trade-On-Net, and FX Online illustrate the  power  of  such  customizability,  helping  internal\n\nThe banking space in India is ripe for  disruptions,  big  and  small.

During the year, the Bank constituted a Board level Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Social & Governance Committee to strengthen ESG governance and enhance the integration of  environmental  and  social  considerations  into  its business.  To  align  with  India's  bold  target  of  achieving net  zero  emissions  by  2070,  the  Bank  has  pledged  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its operations to net-zero by 2030. The Bank has also developed a carbon intensity target mix for its renewable and non-renewable energy  generation  portfolio  to  align  with  global 1.5-degree decarbonisation pathways. It also continues to build capacities toward climate risk measurement and mitigation. YES BANK believes that financial institutions have  a  significant  role  in  building  a  climate-resilient, sustainable economy. The Bank continues to engage with stakeholders across the spectrum to create frameworks for mainstreaming sustainable finance and, in FY 202122,  co-led  the  workstream  'Building  Resilience  in  the Financial Sector' as part of the Task Force on Sustainable Finance,  constituted  by  the  Department  of  Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India.\n\n## REIMAGINING THE BANK\n\nIn  conclusion,  I  am  happy  to  report  that  the  Bank continues to make confident strides within the domestic banking  industry  while  simultaneously  charting  a  new course  of  reimagining  banking  for  India  -  and  Bharat. Our strategy is to touch the future through the building blocks that we lay now. The Bank's technologically solid architecture  has  made  us  light  on  our  feet,  prescient on  trends  and  opportunities,  and  quicker  to  closure, which  is  bearing  fruit.  YES BANK has  restored  market confidence through its performance in recent years - a feat recognised by rating agencies with outlooks turning positive  on  our  capabilities  as  we  continue  to  build businesses for the future.\n\n## OUR GRATITUDE\n\nWith  lessons  of  the  past  now  well  integrated,  we have  emerged  as  a  more  innovative  and  more  robust organization  that  is  keenly  aware  of  what  is  next  and how to get there. I remain grateful for the confidence you have shown both in the new leadership and in the Bank's capabilities, and in your willingness to evaluate us on the strength of our achievements. As we go on to discover newer  ways  of  creating  value  and  consolidating  our collective successes, I acknowledge and express gratitude for the trust placed on us by our esteemed customers, shareholders,  regulators  and  all  other  stakeholders. That has helped guide us on our extraordinary journey in rejuvenating your Bank over the last two years. All of this would  not  have  been  possible  without  the  exemplary commitment  and  conviction  displayed  by  24,346  YES BANKers, the enormous support of the regulators and my esteemed Board colleagues.\n\nOn behalf of YES BANK, I thank you for the opportunity to serve you and wish you continued success.\n\nBest Regards,\n\n## SUNIL MEHTA\n\nChairman",

Reflecting back, I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  24,346 YES BANKers, our shareholders, our customers, and other stakeholders who  have  supported  us  in  this transformational journey.\n\nThe  first  quarter  of  FY  2021-22  coincided  with the second wave of COVID-19 in India, which was more severe than the first wave. Having said that, the relative downside to the economy was lower than during the first wave as the government did not go in for a blanket lockdown of the economy. Restrictions  to  economic  activity  were  more localised  and  selective.  Economic  momentum was  seen  to  improve  over  the  various  quarters of  FY  2021-22,  and  real  GDP  growth  stands  at 8.7% after a contraction of 6.6% in the previous financial  year.  Both  the  government  and  the monetary  authorities  continued  their  efforts  to stabilise  the  economy.  RBI  kept  the  policy  rates unchanged  throughout  the  year  and  ensured the  availability  of  adequate  liquidity  to  meet credit  requirements  for  different  sectors.  The government  also  encouraged  credit  flows  to the  MSME  sector  through  its  ECLGS  scheme. The Union Budget announced in February 2022 signalled  a  fiscal  correction  for  FY  2022-23  but kept the government's capital expenditure push intact.\n\nIn  these  uncertain  times,  the  Bank  was  able  to post  one  of  its  strongest  annual  and  quarterly results. Maintaining that early momentum across\n\nMaximising market share growth in the digital payments space has been  our  concerted  strategy  in line with Digital India. In fact, the Bank processes nearly every third digital transaction undertaken in the country.\n\nall leading indicators, YES BANK has closed the year with a first Full Year profit of ' 1,066 crore and continued its efforts to build businesses across all areas of banking. This positive performance has resulted from unwavering teamwork and a culmination of the YES family's dedicated efforts towards achieving service excellence. Every YES BANKer has gone above and beyond in persevering to ensure that all vital business opportunities get realized to enhance value for our stakeholders.\n\nThe  Bank's  new  leadership  has  been  successful  in implementing positive changes and has delivered on the priorities set out in the last fiscal. During this time, the work of reconstructing the Bank's corporate governance, accountability, monitoring  and  oversight  and  risk management structures was also put in place. Business priorities  have  gained  precedence  on  the  foundation of  this  robust  and  transparent governance framework. During the year, sustained growth was recorded across many  key  parameters,  indicating  the  strengthening fundamentals, and firming up public confidence.\n\n## GROWTH IN DEPOSITS, ADVANCES, AND RETAIL ASSETS\n\nAt the end of the year, deposits stood at ' 197,192 crore, marking a growth of 21% over last year. Advances too demonstrated  a  significant  upward  trend  closing  at ' 181,052  crore  for  the  year,  an  8%  increase  over  last year's  figures.  A  strong  run-rate  has  been  maintained in  the  numbers  of  accounts  acquired,  with  a  total  of\n\n10  Lakh  CASA  accounts  opened and 11 Lakh retail FD accounts opened during the year. This uptick has been achieved despite prevailing low-interest rates offered by the banking sector.\n\nRetail assets continue to form a mixed portfolio spread across secured business loans, auto loans, commercial vehicle  loans,  personal  loans,  construction  equipment loans,  and  credit  cards.  The  Bank  reported  nearly ' 33,000 crore in new sanctions/disbursements in retail assets in FY 2021-22.\n\n## LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL PAYMENT ECOSYSTEM\n\nMaximising market share growth in the digital payments space  has  been  our  concerted  strategy  in  line  with Digital  India,  the  Government's  flagship  programme with  a  vision  to  transform  India  into  a  digitally empowered  society  and  knowledge  economy.  We  are in a leadership position in UPI and AePS, with a market share of 43% and 18% in FY2021-22, respectively. In fact, the Bank processes nearly every third digital transaction undertaken in India. We also have a reasonable market share  while  processing  payouts  through  NEFT  (14% market share), IMPS (12% market share) and Micro ATMs (3rd largest player with 10% market share). In pursuit of exploring newer areas, the Bank shall focus on digitising toll and transit areas. Annuity incomes continue to show strong growth from trade and cash management on the back of high API-led banking volumes. The Bank holds a leadership position in API banking, with 6,815 set-ups done for customers.\n\nOur early adoption of cloud-based services and AI-led analytics  has  created  this  advantage,  with  the  early leadership position enhancing our chances of growing revenues as platforms become ubiquitous. YES BANK is deepening its presence and raising its service standards on such platforms while extending its reach at very low operating costs as part of the Government's Digital India and Cashless India initiatives. Such a strategy also aligns with our growth strategy around rural banking, inclusive banking, small and micro enterprises.",

Bifurcating  the\n\nclients into large corporate, institutional clients, emerging\n\nIndia's MSMEs contribute to nearly one-third of the country's GDP through their domestic and international commerce, and  a  large  portion  of  them  are onboarding  onto  digital  modes of  operation.  The  Bank  reported nearly ' 18,000 crore in new sanctions/disbursement to the SME segment in FY 2021-22.\n\nlocal  corporates,  and  financial  market  players  have enabled the bank to address the specific needs of each segment  and  provide  tailor-made  solutions  with  the active engagement of a dedicated relationship manager.\n\n## STRATEGIC PUSH TOWARDS EMERGING RURAL MARKETS AND MSMEs\n\nWe foresee high growth potential within emerging rural markets and MSMEs. Currently, India's MSMEs contribute to  nearly one-third of the country's GDP through their domestic  and  international  commerce,  and  a  large portion of them are onboarding onto digital modes of operation. Industry data shows that Indian MSMEs are rapidly  adopting  digital  payments  over  cash,  with  72% of payments done through the digital mode compared to 28% of cash transactions. Within the Bank, both these segments  continue  to  perform  well  on  key  indicators. The Bank has seen steady growth in disbursements and an enhancement in cross-sell metrics. The Bank reported nearly ' 2,500  crore  new  sanctions/disbursements  in rural  and ' 18,000  crore  new  sanctions/disbursement to the SME segment in FY 2021-22. YES BANK has taken a  direct  approach  to  these  emerging  growth  areas with  dedicated,  high-quality  front-end  interactions, geographic spread and a diversified customer base with wide-ranging business and individual profiles.\n\nIn the rural segment, our portfolio is spread across ~225 districts in 14 states, and the total book size is ' 4,100 crore. The Bank's exposure to rural lenders is well distributed across the value chain, with the largest share of loanees under joint liabilit y group (48% share) and farmer financing (35% share). NPA at <2% is one of the healthiest across the Bank's entire loan portfolio.\n\nA similar strategy has been adopted for our MSME clients, where digital and analytics form the fulcrum of both new acquisitions  and  seamless  customer  service.  Analytics is  being  used  to  drive  prospective  client  identification, while the AI-powered Early Warning Signals framework helps to flag off incipient sickness and support frontline remedial management.\n\n## UNWAVERING FOCUS ON RECOVERIES\n\nThe Stressed Asset Management team of the Bank has been  instrumental  in  achieving  cash  recoveries  and upgrades amounting to ' 7,290 crore in FY 2021-22, which is on the back of ' 5,782 crore in FY2020-21. This has been a focus area of the Bank over the past two years, and the team has more than achieved its guidance. The strong push towards business generation has in no way taken away our focus on improving our loan book quality, with the  GNPA ratio  improving  to  13.9%  and  PCR,  including technical write-offs, at 81.5%.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Bank continues to deliver on its commitment to build a responsible franchise focused on sustainable growth. This year, the Bank announced a target to achieve netzero  emissions  from  its  operations  by  2030.  As  a  first step, it switched to sourcing renewable energy to power its headquarters in Mumbai. Ensuring that its branches and  offices  adhere  to  the  highest  environmental performance standards, the Bank continued to monitor and  enhance  its  Environmental  Management  System, with 732 of its facilities maintaining their ISO 14001:2015 certification  for  the  ninth  year  in  a  row.  Committed  to building a diverse and inclusive workplace, the Bank is targeting to increase the participation of women to 30% of its workforce in the next five years and is in the process of recruiting differently abled persons at select centres.\n\nThe  Bank  has  also  instituted  important  policies  to enhance  employee  work-life  balance  and  emphasize its commitment  to  respect  human  rights  within\n\nthe  organization  and  across  its  value  chain.  On  the portfolio  front,  the  Bank  continues  to  strengthen  the implementation  of  its  Environment  and  Social  Risk Management  System  through  specialized  training modules and is proactively taking steps toward climate risk measurement and mitigation in its endeavour to align with the recommendations of the Task Force on ClimateRelated Financial Disclosures. YES BANK continues to be the only Indian Bank to measure and report its financed emissions,  targeting  to  align  its  electricity  generation sector exposure to the global 1.5-degree decarbonization pathways. During the year, the Bank was recognized for its ESG and climate-related disclosures and performance with  its  inclusion  as  a  constituent  in  Morgan  Stanley Capital International's (MSCI) ACWI ESG Universal Index and ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index, among others. The Bank was also the only Indian Bank to be selected among the  100  Best  Emerging  Market  Performers  in  ESG,  as assessed by V.E, part of Moody's ESG Solutions.\n\nAs we consolidate on the growth momentum, organization-wide  initiatives  are  being  taken  up  to strengthen our long-term capabilities by ensuring critical skills in a diverse talent pool. Across the people hierarchy, we are aligning our people capabilities to deliver on the strategic  growth  pillars  identified  by  the  organization. We  continue  with  our  light-at-the-top  disaggregated approach,  with  close  to  21,000  of  our  24,346  strong workforce belonging to the junior management level. We have instituted a dedicated capability building function called the YES School of Banking for this very large group to  provide  specific  role  and  skill-focused  training  and certifications. Simultaneously, we continue to stress the importance of making YES BANK a nurturing workplace for our employees, with policies that provide creative and supportive  solutions  for  various  employee  needs.  Our hybrid and flexible working model are one such example; skill or goal-based employee training module is another. Our  efforts  to  create  a  wholesome  work  environment have been recognized -- we have been ranked second among the large-sized banks in the Best Places to Work in India 2021 awards, conducted by AmbitionBox.com.\n\nOur constant endeavour is to deliver the best value to our  stakeholders  and  to  honour  the  trust  they  have placed in us. To strengthen our commitment to all our stakeholders,  we  have  shared  our  strategic  objectives for FY 2022-23, which include CASA ratio at 35%, Retail & MSME Advances Mix to further improve by > 400 bps from the current 60:40, Advances YoY growth > 15% with\n\nYES BANK continues to be the only Indian Bank to measure and report its financed emissions, targeting to align its electricity generation sector exposure to the global 1.5-degree decarbonization pathways.

I  am  confident  that  we  will  grow stronger together as we welcome a more prosperous tomorrow.\n\nSincerely,\n\n## PRASHANT KUMAR\n\nManaging Director & CEO YES BANK",

        "page_content": "## ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Leading the transition to green\n\nYES  BANK  aims  to  integrate  environmental  sustainability  into every aspect of its business. The Bank continually endeavours to conserve natural resources, minimize the negative environmental impacts of its operations and lending activity, and mobilize finance to  spur  growth  in  climate-aligned  sectors.  The  Bank  is  also  a strong advocate for building awareness and sharing knowledge on  environmental  and  climate  issues.  The  Bank  works  with stakeholders across the spectrum, to develop ways to align its business with global environmental and climate goals.\n\n## OPERATIONS\n\nAs a public trust institution, YES BANK is highly cognizant of its dependence on natural ecosystems and takes its responsibility towards environmental conservation, seriously. The Bank monitors and tracks the key resources it uses in its operations, takes initiatives to minimize consumption while enhancing resource efficiencies, and reports its impacts and progress annually. Given its nature of business, the Bank's highest environmental impact comes from its Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3, Green House Gas emissions, as part of operating a pan India physical and digital presence with 11 major offices, 1,122 branches, and 1,244 ATMs / CRMS & BNAs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NATURAL CAPITAL\n\nThis  section  covers  the  Bank's interactions, initiatives, and performance  in  relation  to  its natural  capital,  as  part  of  its value  creation  journey.  It  also includes the finance it mobilizes to promote climate action.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MANUFACTURED CAPITAL\n\nThe  section  also  covers  the Bank's  initiatives  to  minimize the negative environmental impacts  of  its  tangible  and intangible  infrastructure,  such as  its  branches,  offices,  and operations.\n\n## SOURCES OF THE BANK'S SCOPE 1, SCOPE 2 AND SCOPE 3 GHG EMISSIONS\n\n## SCOPE 1\n\n## SCOPE 2\n\n## SCOPE 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmissions from diesel consumption  in  DG sets\n\nEmissions refrigerant from ACs\n\nfrom leakage\n\nIn FY 2021-22, Scope 1 emissions stood at 3,217.14 tCO2e* .\n\nScope 2 emissions from electricity consumption stood at 44,284.50 tCO2e* .\n\nEmissions  from  business air travel\n\nEmissions from paper consumption including couriers\n\nEmissions from employee commute\n\nEmission  from  external  data centre\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope  3  emissions  attributed  to  the Bank's  larger  value  chain  decreased  by 5.5% f r o m F Y 2020 -21 to reach 72,815.80 tCO2e* .\n\nFor more details on the Bank's GHG emissions, please refer the Bank's Sustainability Reports here .\n\n*Estimations for Scope 1,2,3 emissions for FY 2021-22 are unaudited\n\n## STEPS TOWARDS REACHING NET-ZERO EMISSIONS\n\nThe Paris Climate Agreement sets forth a goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, requires countries and businesses to bring down CO 2 emissions  to  a  net-zero by the year 2050. YES BANK has always been conscious of its climate related impacts. In order to align with the net zero pathways suggested by the IPCC, the Bank has pledged to reduce GHG emissions from its operations, across the country, to net zero by 2030. The Bank's net zero  emissions  target  covers  its  absolute  Scope  1  and Scope 2 emissions.\n\n## To meet the net-zero by 2030 target, YES BANK is taking a multi-pronged route covering:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nUse of renewable energy to power its facilities Use of energy efficient light fixtures and office equipment and appliances (with five-star ratings) Exploring quality carbon sequestration offsets\n\n## SOURCING RENEWABLE ENERGY TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT\n\nAs a first step towards achieving its net zero emissions target,  the  Bank  began  sourcing  renewable  energy to  power  its  headquarters,  YES  BANK  House  (YBH)  in Santacruz,  Mumbai,  from  January  1,  2022.  Emissions from  grid  electricity  consumption  (Scope  2  emissions) accounts  for  93.27%  of  the  Bank's  Scope  1  and  Scope 2 emissions, with YBH's electricity consumption representing  approximately  9%  of  the  annual  Scope  2 emissions for  FY  2021-22.  YBH  switching  to  renewable energy has led to the elimination of a significant portion (approximately  1,105  tCO2e*)  of  the  Bank's  Scope  2 emissions.\n\nThe  Bank  is  also  exploring  the  potential  of  using alternative sources of energy by installing a 5 kVA solar power  system  at  its  Pune  Bund  Garden  branch.  YES BANK will continue to explore such alternative sources of energy in future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsumption of grid electricity",

The specific initiatives were:\n\n- \u00b7 As  a  part  of  the  migration  to  LED  fixtures  over  the current  fiscal,  11,826  conventional  fixtures  and  CFL signages have been replaced with LED units across 288 branches. Estimated savings are to the tune of 1,072.85 GJ*  of  annual  energy  consumption.  The  estimated annual reduction in electricity consumption that may be  attributed  to  these  LEDs  is  2,98,015  kWh,  helping the Bank avoid 235.43 tCO2e emissions.\n- \u00b7 The  Bank  is  also  in  the  process  of  phasing  out  air conditioning systems that use ozone-depleting coolants. In the current reporting cycle, 1,212 tonnages* of R22 air conditioners across 141 branches have been replaced that are more than ten years old. In their place, energy-efficient (star rated) systems using eco-friendly coolants have been installed.\n\n## YES UDAAN (Utility for DigitAl Agreement and NACH)\n\nThrough  the  YES  UDAAN initiative, the Bank introduced paperless banking and developed  digital  solutions for  providing  E-NACH  and e-agreement along with e-stamping and e-sign Facilities.\n\n## Savings:\n\n## 85,050+\n\nsheets of  A4  paper  in FY2021-22  (equivalent  to avoiding 11.73 GJ* energy consumption)\n\n## SeVA (Service Value Added)\n\nThe Bank introduced the SeVA (Service Value Added), a digital solution  for  accepting  online post-loan disbursement service requests from customers  through  the  YES service  portal.  The  initiative eliminates the need for physical  interaction,  use  of request  forms,  branch  visits and KYC documents.\n\nSavings:\n\nClose  to\n\n55,610\n\nsheets\n\nof  A4  paper  in\n\nFY2021-22  (equivalent  to\n\navoiding\n\n7.67 GJ*\n\nenergy\n\nconsumption)\n\n## MANAGING E-WASTE\n\nYES BANK is a technology-intensive bank,  and  end-of-life  management of  our  electronic  equipment  is  a primary environmental concern. The Bank has empanelled Pollution Control Board  authorized thirdparty e-waste handlers for disposal of  its  e-waste  from  its  locations across India.\n\nE-waste recycled: Responsibly disposed of 35,675.10 kgs* of e-waste, including desktops, printers and  laptop  hardware,  UPS,  and server hardware.\n\n## Loan in Seconds\n\nIn  FY  2021-22,  the Bank enhanced its digital lending capabilities with its  Loan  in  seconds (LIS) platform for end-to-end digital loans.\n\nSavings: 2,986,920 sheets of  A4  paper (equivalent to avoiding 412.09  GJ* energy consumption)\n\nSavings: Approximately 36,467  A4  sheets of papers (equivalent to avoiding 5.03 GJ* energy consumption).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E-Statement of Accounts and Income Tax (IT Certificates)\n\nThe Bank has developed digital solutions for providing  E-SOA  and  IT Certificates.\n\nSavings: Close to 231,452 sheets of A4  paper  and 43,249 envelopes. (Equivalent to avoiding 37.9 GJ* energy consumption).\n\n## Post-disbursal documents go digital\n\nYES  BANK  has  launched the  YES  PDD  application, in  collaboration  with  the Bank's outsourced partner, which helps to reduce the use of paper used in postdisbursal  documentation like registration certificates, insurance, and  invoice  by  digitizing the documentation  and verification process.\n\nSavings: Over 71,307 sheets of  A4  paper  in FY2021-22 (equivalent to avoiding 9.84 GJ* energy consumption).\n\n## VAHAN Robotics\n\nThe Bank introduced a robotics  platform  for vehicle loan customers to download vehicle registration certificates through the government's VAHAN  website.  This has reduced the turnaround  time  for submitting vehicle registration certificates by 50%, from two days to one day.",

The Bank has been embedding environment and social considerations into its lending activity for several years.\n\n## ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL POLICY\n\nYES  BANK's  Environment  and  Social  Policy  (ESP), implemented in 2006, provides a structured approach toward  responsible  lending.  The  ESP  sets  out  the overarching  framework  for  identifying  and  managing potential  and/or  existing  Environmental  &  Social  (E&S) risks  commensurate  with  the  nature  and  scale  of transactions  and  their  potential  impacts.  Through  this policy,  the  Bank  integrates  environmental  and  social risks  into  its  overall  credit  risk  assessment  framework and  continues  to  mainstream  environment  and  social considerations across its lending.\n\n## SUPPORTING CLIMATE ACTION THROUGH LENDING PRIORITIES\n\nThe  Bank  has  also  accorded  a  high  strategic  priority to  climate  action  and  aims  to  proactively  address the  potential  climate  risks  and  impacts  of  its  lending activity,  limit  its  portfolio  emissions,  and  support climate-aligned sectors. The Bank  is guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures  (TCFD)  and,  in FY  2021-22,  is  working  towards  institutionalizing  a climate  risk  measurement  framework  for  measuring and  assessing  climate-related  physical  and  transition risks. The Bank continues to be the only Indian Bank to measure and report its financed emissions, targeting to align  its  electricity  generation  sector  exposure  to  the global 1.5-degree decarbonization pathways.\n\n## CLEAN AND RENEWABLE ENERGY LENDING\n\nIn FY 2021-22, financing solutions worth ' 1,769 crore were made available for renewable energy projects totalling about 562 MW.

This  wave  was  more virulent than the first and severely tested the country's health  infrastructure.  However,  the  wave  receded rapidly and had a relatively limited impact on aggregate demand. The strategies used to prevent the spread of the virus were more localised and region-specific than those employed during the first wave of the pandemic. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the loss of output was 40% less than in the first wave.\n\nCentral  Statistics  Office  estimated  the  real  gross domestic  product  (GDP)  to  have  risen  by  8.7%  in FY 2021-22. Official data also indicates that the private final consumption expenditure increased by around 8% compared to FY 2020-21. The value-added figures for the manufacturing sector was up by 9.9% while the valueadded for the services sector rose by 8.4% in FY 2021-22. High  global  commodity  prices  and  domestic  inflation, coupled  with  the  withdrawal  of  easy  monetary  policy by the RBI are likely to serve as headwinds to growth in FY 2022-23.\n\nConsumer  price  index  (CPI)  inflation  moderated  close to the target of 4% in April 2021 but remained volatile thereafter. In May and June 2021, CPI inflation breached the upper tolerance level of 6%, with a sharp pickup in food,  fuel  and  core  inflation.  However,  food  inflation then  ebbed,  and  headline  CPI  inflation  decreased  to 4.4%  by  September  2021.  Subsequently,  in  February 2022,  another  rise  in  food  inflation  led  to  an  increase in  headline  CPI  inflation  up  to  6.1%.  The  final  March reading  for  FY  2021-22  was  7%,  caused  by  a  trade shock due to increased global crude oil and edible oil prices. Global supply chains were disrupted as a result of the pandemic; therefore, major global central banks considered  inflation  transitory  and  hoped  that  supply chains would improve when the effects of the pandemic eased. However, recently, the geopolitical crisis between Russia  and  Ukraine  and  the  increase  in  virus  cases  in China have once again disrupted supply chains, leading to fears that elevated global inflation is likely to continue for a longer term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA  strong  and  well-functioning  financial  sector  fortifies the  foundations  of  growth  and  development.  During the  pandemic,  the  RBI  accorded  the  highest  priority to  preserving  financial  stability  by  taking  quick  and decisive  steps  to  ease  liquidity  constraints,  ensuring adequate  credit  flows  to  the  production  sector  and restoring market confidence. The RBI also strengthened the  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  for  both banking and non-banking financial sectors to proactively identify,  assess  and  deal  with  vulnerabilities.  Thus, despite pandemic-induced bouts of volatility, the Indian financial system remains resilient and is now in a better position to meet credit demands as recovery takes hold and  private  investment  activity  picks  up.  According  to the  RBI's  Financial  Stability  Report  (December  2021), Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) continued to bolster their capital, with a capital-to-risk assets ratio (CRAR) of 16.6%  in  September  2021.  Banks'  asset  qualities  also improved,  with  gross  non-performing  asset  (GNPA) and  net  non-performing  asset  (NNPA)  ratios  declining to 6.9% and 2.3%, respectively. The provision coverage ratio (PCR) increased from 67.6% in March 2021 to 68.1% in  September  2021.  The  RBI's  macro-stress  tests  for credit risks indicate that SCBs' GNPA ratio may increase to 8.1% by September 2022, but banks can still comply with minimum capital requirements under severe stress scenarios.\n\nThe assessment of macro conditions into FY 2022-23 will critically depend on the longevity of the current geopolitical problems  and  their  impact  on  commodity  prices.  Brent crude  oil  prices  showed  an  almost  70%  increase  by  the end of March 2022 compared to the end of March 2021. Faced with the rude shock of inflation, larger central banks will continue to tighten and normalise relevant monetary policies.  Sovereign  bond  yields  have  hardened  globally while emerging market economies are likely to see a spate of capital outflows and a weakening of their currencies. The World  Trade  Organisation  recently  reduced  its  forecasts for global trade, indicating that the geopolitical crisis could lead to food shortages in poorer countries, and 3% growth is expected in 2022 (down from the earlier expectation of 4.7%).\n\nAs  per  the  RBI's  assessment,  inflation  will  increase by  30  bps  if  oil  is  higher  than  the  baseline  of  USD100 per  barrel  by  10%,  or  vice-versa.  Inflation  risks  also emanate  from  longer-than-expected  supply  chain\n\ndisruptions  that  cause  a  larger  pass-through  of  input cost pressures to output prices in the event of stronger demand conditions and global financial market volatility arising from faster normalisation of monetary policy by advanced economies. The downside risk arises from the early mending of supply chains, which will cause muted pass-through of output prices and a correction in global commodity  prices.  The  RBI's  inflation  projection  for FY2022-23 is placed at 6.7% with Q1FY23 at 7.5%, Q2 at 7.4%, Q3 at 6.2% and Q4 at 5.8%.\n\nIndia  is  also  likely  to  see  downside  effects  on  growth due to higher commodity prices. On the one hand, the RBI's calculations assume crude oil will be 10% above the baseline  of  USD100  per  barrel,  and  domestic  growth  is likely  to  weaken by 20 bps. On the other hand, if crude prices  fall  below  the  baseline  by  10%,  this  could  boost growth by 20 bps. Rabi has good prospects that should lift rural demand, and the ebbing of the pandemic risk is likely to bolster the contact-intensive services sector. The government has also taken significant initiatives to boost private investments; for example, the Production Linked Incentive  Scheme  (PLI).  With  capacity  utilisation  levels now reported at  72.4%  for  Q3FY22  and  with  corporate balance sheets deleveraged, expectations are strong for private  sector  capacity  building.  The  downside  risks  to growth emanate from the surge in input costs, continued supply tightness of essential components, the tightening of global financial conditions and weakening global trade.\n\nThe  government's  capital  expenditures  are  likely  to continue to be important for the economy in maintaining its growth prospects by crowding in private investments. The budgeted capital expenditure of the Centre is ' 7.5 trillion for FY 2022-23, a sharp rise of 36% over the revised estimates (RE) for FY 2021-22. The multiplier effects of capital expenditures are much higher, at 1.29, than those for revenue expenditures, at 0.37. More importantly, the impulse response of capital expenditures (the number of  years  the  impact  of  a  rise  in  expenditures  is  felt)  is at 3.56 in the fourth year of incurring the expenditure. Even as near-term growth is poised for a moderation RBI estimates real growth at 7.2% for FY 2022-23, domestic growth  drivers  are  expected  to  improve  considerably in  the  longer  term,  supported  by  the  government's infrastructure push.",

The RBI undertook several  measures  to  deal  with  such  an  exceptional situation.  Borrowing  costs  fell  to  their  lowest  levels  in decades and spreads narrowed across rating cohorts. Record  levels  of  government  securities,  corporate bonds and debentures were issued. Corporate entities deleveraged  seamlessly  and  reduced  high-cost  debt while improving profitability and retaining earnings for future capex. Overall, the financial sector has remained fully functional and helped anchor the recovery process, while the RBI's policy actions have yielded the desired results in a smooth and orderly manner.\n\nAs these objectives are achieved on an ongoing basis, the RBI has turned its attention to dynamically rebalancing liquidity while maintaining adequate liquidity in support of  its  accommodative  stance.  This  rebalancing  has involved  two  sets  of  operations.  The  first  focuses  on rebalancing  liquidity  from  the  overnight  fixed-rate reverse  repo  towards  the  14-day  variable  rate  reverse repo  (VRRR)  auction  as  the  main  operation,  which  is supported  by  fine-tuning  auctions  of  varying  tenors. The  second  involves  conducting  repo  auctions  of  one to  three-day  maturities  to  meet  transient  liquidity mismatches and shortages.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs  a  result  of  the  RBI's  rebalancing  operations,  daily average  absorption  under  the  fixed  rate  reverse  repo moderated sharply since August 2021 when rebalancing started.  However,  overall  system  liquidity  remains  in a  large  surplus.  Reflecting  the  migration  of  surplus liquidity  from  the  overnight  window  to  longer  tenors, the effective reverse repo rate - the weighted average rate  of  the  fixed  rate  reverse  repo  and  the  VRRRs  of longer  maturity,  increased  from  3.37%  at  the  end  of August 2021 to 3.87% at February 4, 2022. With pressure building up as a result of inflation, the RBI says that it will remain focused on 'withdrawal of accommodation' and has already raised the repo rate by a cumulative 90 bps in May and June, 2022. The RBI has also instituted a Standing Deposit Facility (SDF), which is now the lower end of the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) corridor. SDF rate now stands at 4.65%.\n\nIn  the  forex  market,  the  Indian  rupee  ( ' )  is  resilient  in the face of global spillovers, even relative to emerging market  economy  peers.  The  sustainability  of  India's external sector is anchored by high FX reserve buffers amid  a  rise  in  the  current  account  deficit  (CAD). In  H1FY22,  the  CAD  was  0.1%  of  the  GDP  and  was underpinned by robust exports of goods and services. The  merchandise  trade  deficit  has  widened  in  recent months,  partly  due  to  elevated  crude  oil  prices  and  a rise  in  non-oil  imports  in  line  with  domestic  economic recovery.  Consequently,  the  CAD/GDP  widened  to 2.7% in Q3FY22 and is expected to stay at this level in FY  2022-23 if  oil  prices  average  at  USD100  per  barrel. Given  the  tightening  of  global  monetary  policy,  there is  a  balance  of  payment  deficit  for  FY  2022-23  that could comfortably be managed by the RBI with its large FX surplus.\n\nThe  stability  of  the  economy  and  a  focus  on  growth enable YES BANK to report advances growth of 8% YoY and deposits growth of 21% YoY, along with 44% growth in CASA. These figures indicate that the Bank has strong business  momentum,  and  it  is  on  track  to  achieve  its strategic objectives.\n\nO\n\nR\n\nP\n\nO\n\nRA\n\nT\n\nE\n\nOVERVIEW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RETAIL BANKING\n\nThe Retail business faced extremely challenging circumstances in the first half of the year, with normalcy returning in the second half. The business is directly linked to  consumption,  which  slowed  down  during  the  second wave  of  the  pandemic  but  has  since  normalised.  Retail advances  increased  by  30%  YoY,  and  CASA  +  retail  term deposits  increased  by  29%  YoY.

The Committee ensures that these are adequate and appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure and needs of the Bank, and its risk appetite.\n\nexecutives. In line with its responsible banking objectives and to ensure that employees have a say in making YES BANK  a  trusted  and  successful  institution,  the  Bank undertook  the  'Voice  of  YES  Employee  Survey'  during FY  2021-22.  Furthermore,  to  build  a  steady  stream  of high-quality talent, the Bank launched innovative 'train and hire' programmes in FY 2021-22, including the YES Professional  Banker  and  the  YES  Force  programmes. The  Bank  continues  to  invest  in  hiring  top-end,  young talent from premier educational institutions through its flagship YES Professional Entrepreneurship programme.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nA bank's long-term financial security and success are built on its risk management framework. Risk management at YES BANK is based on three lines of defence: business units,  independent  credit  and  control  functions  and internal  audit.  The  Bank's  Board  of  Directors  have overall responsibility for risk management, and the risk management  architecture  is  overseen  by  four  Boardlevel committees that have implemented specific policies, frameworks  and  systems  for  effectively  managing  the Bank's various risks, as illustrated below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit  risk  is  defined  as  potential  losses  associated with  diminution  in  the  credit  quality  of  borrowers  or counterparties.  Losses  stem  from  outright  default or  a  reduction  in  portfolio  value.  The  Bank  has  a distinct architecture of policies, procedures and systems for managing credit risk in both its retail and wholesale  businesses.  Wholesale  lending  is  managed on an individual and portfolio basis. In contrast, retail lending,  given  the  granularity  of  individual  exposures, is  managed largely on a portfolio basis across various products and customer segments. For both categories, robust front-end and back-end systems are in place to ensure credit quality and minimise loss from defaults. The  factors  considered  when  sanctioning  retail  loans include income, demographics, credit history, loan tenor and  banking  behaviour.  Furthermore,  multiple  credit risk  models  are  used  to  appraise  and  score  different customer  segments  based  on  portfolio  behaviour.  In wholesale  loans,  credit  risk  is  managed  by  capping exposures based on borrower groups, industry, credit rating grades and country, among others. This is backed by  portfolio  diversification,  stringent  credit  approval processes  and  periodic  post-disbursement  monitoring and  remedial  measures.  The  Bank  has  been  able  to ensure  strong  asset  quality  on  incremental  lending post-March  2020,  despite  volatile  times  in  the  lending environment, by stringently adhering to prudent norms and institutionalised processes.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank followed the RBI's directions and granted loan moratoriums backed by government-guaranteed schemes, and it carried out\n\na  one-time  restructuring  of  accounts.  The  Bank  was prudent and adaptive in ensuring higher risk standards and proactively reviewed risk thresholds with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. The Bank assessed the potential stress impact of the pandemic on its credit profile based on available information, accompanied by assumptions  and  judgemental  overlay.  On  March  31, 2022, the Bank's GNPA ratio improved to 13.9% vs 15.4% last year and Net NPA ratio improved to 4.5% vs 5.9% last year.  The  Bank  has  a  conservative  and  prudent  policy for  specific  provisions on NPAs that is higher than the minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the regulatory norms for standard assets.\n\nDriven by rapid advancements in technology, digitalisation is  becoming a key differentiator for customer retention and service delivery in the banking sector. Digital lending enables customers to secure loans at the click of a button i n a matter of minutes, if not seconds. However, attendant risks  are  associated  with  this,  and  the  Bank  has  put appropriate checks and balances in place to manage these risks. Such loans are sanctioned primarily to the Bank's existing customers who often avail of multiple products, thus, allowing the Bank ready access to their credit history and risk profile. This facilitates the evaluation of their loan eligibility, and most of the credit checks and scores used by the Bank involve process-based underwriting, which is replicated for digital loans. The Bank has an independent validation  unit  that  minutely  assesses  the  models  used to  generate credit scores for such loans. These models are  monitored,  reviewed  periodically,  back  tested,  and corrective action is taken when needed.",

YES BANK's market risk management is governed by  comprehensive  Board-approved  policies,  including market risk, investment, hedging, stress testing, derivative,  derivative  appropriateness  policy,.  These policies  have  been  benchmarked  with  industry-best practices and the RBI's regulations. They ensure that risks underwritten  across  business  activities  are  within  the stipulated risk appetite of the Bank and that similar risks are aggregated.\n\nThese  policies  cap  the  risks  on  different  desks  or various  securities  through  risk  limits  or  triggers.  The risk  measures include position limits, tenor restrictions, rating  thresholds.  sensitivity  limits  (e.g.  PV01),  the modified duration and option Greeks. Value-at-risk and stop-loss trigger levels are monitored on an end-of-day basis.  Additionally,  FX  open  positions,  currency  option delta  and  interest  rate  sensitivity  limits  are  computed and monitored on an intraday basis and supplemented by a Board-approved stress testing policy and framework that  simulate  various  market  risk  scenarios  to  measure losses and initiate remedial measures. The Bank's market risk capital charge is computed daily using a standardised measurement method that applies regulatory factors.\n\nThe Bank has an integrated, straight-through processing and  state-of-the-art  treasury  system  to  enable  better risk management. It measures currency and interest rate risks via various metrics based on regulatory guidelines or  using  internal  risk  models.  The  Bank  also  conducts regular  stress  testing  to  monitor  its  vulnerability  to plausible or unfavourable shocks. The Bank monitors and controls its risks using various internal and regulatory risk limits, which are set according to several criteria, including economic scenarios, business strategy, peer analysis and the  Bank's  risk  appetite.  The  risk  reporting  mechanism comprises disclosures and reporting to ALCO and Board level committees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational  Risk  is  the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from inadequate  or  failed  internal  processes,  people  and\n\nsystems  or  external  events.  For  management  of Operational Risk, the Bank has put in place a framework that  is  commensurate  with  its  size,  nature  of  business activities  and  complexity  of  operations.  The  framework includes  a  proactive,  forward  looking  approach,  with adoption of industry best practices to enable operational resilience  and  minimal  operational  risk  events  and losses. The Bank promotes a culture of risk awareness, continuous control improvement and risk mitigation, and encourages its employees to promptly identify, escalate, report and resolve operational risk events.\n\nOperational  Risk  Management  is  supervised  by  the Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) at the management level, and by the RMC at the Board level. An independent Operational Risk Management Unit (ORM) is responsible for enabling and ensuring the development and  implementation  of  policies,  procedures,  tools  and techniques to identify, measure, evaluate, monitor, report and control/mitigate operational risks. The business line (including  support  units  and  operations)  are  ultimately responsible  for  managing  operational  risk  in  their respective units. This includes identification of risks and implementation  of  policies,  procedures  and  internal c o n t r o l s  i n  m a n a g i n g  t h e  d a y - t o - d a y  a c t i v i t i e s .  E x a m p l e s  o f some prevalent controls include the traditional four-eyes principle, effective segregation of business and support functions,  segregation  of  duties,  call  back  processes, reconciliation and exception, and periodic management information system (MIS) reporting. Controls are tested as part of the control testing framework.\n\nThe  Bank  has  a  whistle  blower  and  vigilance  policy as  well  as  a  central  vigilance  team  that  oversees the  implementation  of  fraud  prevention  measures. The identified frauds are investigated to identify the root cause, and relevant corrective steps are taken to prevent a  recurrence.  A  Fraud  Monitoring  Committee  at  senior management and Board level also deliberate on material fraud events and provide advice on preventive actions. Periodic reports are submitted to the Board and senior management committees.\n\nT h e  B a n k  h a s  p u t  i n  p l a c e  a n  O u t s o u r c i n g  R i s k  M a n a g e m e n t Framework,  under  the  aegis  of  the  Outsourcing  policy, which sets forth details around Oversight and Governance Structure, Minimum  Standards  applicable  to  Due Diligence, Risk Management, Monitoring and Reporting, Contingency  Planning,  Customer  Grievance  Redressal,\n\nConfidentiality and Security standards, Vendor Selection, Categorisation, Empanelment guidelines. etc.\n\nThe Bank acknowledges and recognises the importance of  ensuring  resiliency  in  its  business  operations  and maintaining the trust and confidence of its stakeholders, including customers, regulators, employees, and public at large. To minimise impact to its activities during disasters/ disruptions,  the  Bank  has  put  in  place  a  Business Continuity Plan (BCP) for ensuring resiliency in its business operations. The implementation of this plan is overseen by the Operational Risk Management Committee, chaired by  the  CRO.  The  Banks  business  continuity  plan  is  ISO 22301 certified\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ALM risk\n\nALM  risk  arises  on  account  of  Liquidity  risk  and interest rate risk. Liquidity risk is the risk that a bank may not be able to meet its short-term financial obligations due  to  an  asset-liability  mismatch  or  interest  rate fluctuations. Further, asset liability mismatch also lead to interest rate risk to the Bank. The Bank has an assetliability management policy for liquidity and interest rate risk  management that is implemented, monitored and periodically  reviewed by the Asset Liability Committee ALCO.\n\nAs  part  of  this  process,  the  Bank  has  various Board-approved  limits  for  both  liquidity  and  interest rate  risks.  While  maturity  gap  and  stock  ratio  limits help  manage  liquidity  risk,  net  interest  income  and market  value  impacts  help  mitigate  interest  rate  risk. This is reinforced by a comprehensive Board-approved stress testing programme covering liquidity and interest rate risk.\n\nThe  Bank  conducts  various  studies  to  assess  the behavioural  pattern  of  non-contractual  assets  and liabilities and embedded options available to customers that are used while managing maturity gaps. The Bank also has the necessary framework to manage intraday liquidity risk.\n\nThe  liquidity  coverage  ratio  (LCR)  is  a  global  standard used  to  measure  the  Bank's  liquidity  position.  LCR seeks to ensure that the Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered  high-quality  liquid  assets  (HQLA)  that can  be  easily  and  immediately  converted  into  cash  to meet its liquidity needs under a 30-day calendar liquidity stress scenario.\n\nIn addition to LCR, the Bank also has been maintaining net stable funding ratio (NSFR) which was effective from October 1, 2021 as per RBI guidelines. The NSFR seeks to ensure that the Bank maintains a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of its assets and off-balance sheet activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nCompliance risk is defined as the risk of impairing the Bank's  integrity,  resulting  in  damage  to  its  reputation, legal  or  regulatory  sanctions,  or  financial  loss  as  a result  of  a  failure  (or  perceived  failure)  to  comply  with applicable laws, regulations and standards. YES BANK's compliance  policy  ensures  the  highest  standards  of compliance. A dedicated team of subject matter experts in  the  compliance  department  works  with  business and  operations  teams  to  ensure  active  compliance risk management  and  monitoring.  The  team  also provides  advisory  services  on  regulatory  matters  and focuses  on  identifying  and  reducing  risk  by  rigorously testing  products  and  putting  robust  internal  policies in place. Products that adhere to regulatory norms are tested after rollout, and shortcomings, if any, are fully addressed until the product stabilises. Internal policies are reviewed and updated periodically as per the agreed frequency  or  based  on  market  actions  or  regulatory guidelines.  The  compliance  team  also  seeks  regular feedback  on  regulatory  compliance  from  the  product, business and operation teams through self-certification and monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate risk\n\nYES BANK recognises climate risk as a significant risk and refers  to  the  Financial  Stability  Board's  (FSB)  Taskforce on Climate related Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations for  adoption  of  best  practices  around  managing  and disclosing  climate  risk.  YES  BANK  broadly  categorises climate risks into physical and transitional risks. Physical risks  are  a  consequence  of  direct  physical  impacts  of climate  change  and  range  from  acute  risks  (such  as extreme  weather  events)  to  chronic  risks  (like  gradual rise  in  sea  level  and  temperature).  Transition  Risks arise  from  external  efforts  to  address  climate  change including,  but  not  limited  to,  regulatory  and  policy changes, technological advancement or shifts in investor sentiment and consumer behaviour.",

        "page_content": "## Management Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe Bank considers climate risk as a material Pillar II risk in its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) document  and  in  it  details  its  overall  governance  and control framework. From a governance point of view, the Bank's CSR and ESG Committee provide oversight of its sustainability strategy that includes climate change and Risk Management Committee covers the entire gamut of risk  management for the organisation as outlined in its ICAAP. In FY 2020-21, Bank instituted an executive level Committee, Sustainability Council to provide management oversight on performance and implementation of Bank's sustainability strategy including focus on climate change. Further,  pertinent  aspects  of  climate  risks  are  also covered in various other committees, based on relevance.\n\nThe Bank has adopted appropriate policies, procedures and  controls  across  the  entire  organisation  to  ensure effective  management  of  climate-related  risks.  These include instituting of a robust Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions of its operations, accelerating climate finance, maintaining  a  well-diversified  portfolio,  broadening  of environment and social risk management of the Bank's lending to include climate risk aspects, measuring and reducing financed emission of carbon intensive sectors in  line  with  decarbonisation  scenarios,  community action  on  environmental  sustainability,  and  thought leadership  and  policy  advocacy  at  national  and  global level.  The  Bank  has  aligned  its  annual  disclosures  to TCFD recommendations since FY 2018-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cyber security and data risk\n\nThe  risk  of  cyber-attacks  on  the  Bank's  systems  via hacking,  phishing,  ransomware  or  other  means,  could result in the disruption of its services or the theft or leak of sensitive internal data or customer information. Every specific cyber threat, including data privacy, is assessed based on a framework (identify, prevent/protect, detect, respond and recover), and controls that include firewalls, anti-malware,  anti-advance  persistent  threats,  data loss  prevention,  Red  Teaming,  intrusion  prevention/ detection,  digital  rights  management,  24/7  security operation centre and forensics solutions have been put in place. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has also been implemented across relevant operations.\n\nThe  Bank  is  compliant  with  ISO  27001:13,  ISO22301:19 and PCI DSS standards.\n\nRecently, the financial sector has witnessed a significant increase  in  adoption  of  and  investment  in  digitisation, which  has  led  to  the  implementation  of  cutting-edge technologies.  However,  with  the  rise  in  digitisation, security risks can occur due to breaches of confidentiality, integrity  and  the  availability  of  classified  data  such  as customers' personal and financial information. Customer information is of critical importance to YES BANK, and it is committed to protecting privacy through its information security unit, which sits under the risk management unit. The Bank has put a governance structure in place, and a Board-level committee provides guidance and direction on  information  security.  The  Bank  also  has  a  Security Council,  which  is  a  management-level  committee  that is  constituted  with  cross-functional  representation  at the leadership level and meets quarterly to review the implementation of the information security management system  in  the  Bank.  The  Bank  has  adopted  Global Information  Security  Standard  ISO  27001:2013  and implemented Board-approved information security and cyber security policies to protect its information assets. The Bank implements a multi-layered defence to protect against  cyber-attacks  and  adopts  a  cyber  securityresilient framework to manage cyber security risk. The framework rides on four pillars: protect, detect, respond, and recover. To monitor cyber security risks, the Bank's Security  Operations  Centre  (SOC)  maintains  vigilance over  actionable  threat  intelligence  and  suspicious network traffic and events to detect any anomalies and help respond to potential incidents promptly. The Bank raises awareness of global cyber security threats among employees,  customers  and  other  stakeholders,  and issues  guidance  on  using  digital  platforms  safely  and securely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reputation risk\n\nReputation Risk is the current or prospective indirect risk to earnings and capital arising from adverse perception of the Bank on the part of stakeholders, viz. customers, counterparties,  shareholders,  investors  or  regulators. Reputation  Risk  has  an  indirect  impact  on  capital  and profitability. Its effect mainly materializes in the form of deterioration of goodwill and lost earnings.\n\nReputation Risk may originate due to lack of compliance with industry service standards and regulatory\n\nguidelines,  failure  to  deliver  on  commitments,  lack  of customer-friendly  services  and  fair  market  practices, low or inferior service quality, unreasonably high costs, a  service  style  that  does  not  harmonize  with  market circumstances or customer expectations, inappropriate business conduct or unfavorable authority opinion and actions,  increased  customer  litigation,  poor  financial performance, high employee attrition rates, etc.\n\nReputation  Risk  threats  and  incidents  shall  be  of  high priority  to  be  responded  to  urgently,  addressing  the concerns of all stakeholders. Escalating reputation risk threats on a day-to-day basis shall be the responsibility of the individuals/units.\n\nThe Bank has established an Enterprise Risk, Reputation Risk and Model Assessment Committee (ERMC) to review Reputation Risk Profile and manage Reputation Risk in the Bank. The Bank also has in place a comprehensive Reputation  Risk  Management  policy  framework  for tracking reputational risk indicators and an exhaustive scorecard for assessing the reputational risk across the Bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Attrition risk\n\nYES  Bank  runs  an  attrition  risk  which  is  the  reduction in employee numbers that occurs due to retirement or resignation, which is a phenomena across the banking industry. Given the transformational journey of the Bank over the past 2 years and with stability in the financial performance,  the  Bank  is  seeing  a  gradual  reduction in this risk. However, the Bank continues to undertake many  employee  friendly  measures  and  initiatives  to contain this risk, for eg. first Bank to implement a formal ' Working from Anywhere Policy' effective July 2021 for flexibility and well-being of employees, job rotation and larger responsibilities have been provided to employees basis  role  fitment,  alumni  outreach  initiatives  have been implemented to re-hire  ex-YES  BANKers,  various employee  engagement  initiatives  such  as  Unplugged, Y-Factor, sports events, online fitness sessions, wellbeing webinars etc. have been conducted for better health and camaraderie of employees.\n\n## ICAAP\n\nYES  BANK  has  a  structured  management  framework in  the  Internal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment  Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess and manage all risks that may have a material adverse impact on its business/financial\n\nposition/capital  adequacy.  The  ICAAP  framework  is guided by the Board-approved ICAAP policy. The Bank also has in place Board approved Risk appetite statement for key risks identified under the ICAAP. The Bank has put in place internal policies and frameworks to ensure that the Bank operates within its risk appetite thresholds.\n\nThe Bank implements a Board-approved stress testing policy  and  framework  that  forms  an  integral  part of  ICAAP.  Stress  testing  involves  the  use  of  various techniques to assess the Bank's potential vulnerability to extreme but plausible stressed business conditions. The changing levels of Pillar I and select Pillar II risks, along with changes in the on- and off-balance sheet positions of  the  Bank  are  assessed  under  assumed  stressed scenarios and sensitivity factors. Typically, these relate to  the  impact  on  the  Bank's  profitability  and  capital adequacy.  The  Bank  also  conducts  event-based  stress testing as an when required.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe  Bank's  Internal  Audit  Department  (IAD),  which is ISO 9001:2015 certified (Quality Management System),  provides  independent,  objective  assurance and  consulting  services  to  add  value  and  improve  the Bank's risk and control environment. The IAD monitors the  adequacy, effectiveness and adherence to internal controls,  processes  and  procedures  instituted  by  the Bank's management and extant regulations.\n\nThe IAD reports to the Audit Committee ('AC')of the Board for audit planning, reporting and review, and the Head of the IAD reports directly to the AC of the Bank's Board of Directors. The IAD has unlimited and unrestricted access to all relevant data, systems, personnel and information to achieve its objectives. The IAD is staffed with qualified team  members  with  relevant  certifications,  and  its training programme ensures that all team members are upskilled at frequent intervals.\n\nThe  IAD  has  adopted  a  risk-based  approach  to  internal auditing as per regulatory guidelines and internationally established best practices. A risk-based audit plan (RBAP) is prepared annually and is duly approved by the AC. The IAD  audits  various  businesses,  operations,  information security/systems  and  support  units  as  per  the  RBAP. The IAD prepares a report for each audit, recommends mitigation  plans  for  the  risks  identified  and  ensures compliance  with  all  the  recommendations.  The  AC monitors the progress of the RBAP, at least quarterly.",

Concurrent  auditing  covers  core activities, including operations (including credit), financial markets, data centres and branches in compliance with regulatory guidelines. All audit reports are circulated to the relevant management teams and the AC.\n\n## Compliance\n\nEnsuring  compliance  with  regulatory  requirements, promoting compliance culture among YES BANK ers and building  trust  among  all  stakeholders  is  an  overarching consideration  at  YES  BANK.  The  dedicated  Compliance Department strives to be at the forefront of  regulatory changes  and  continues  to  work  closely  with  all  of  the Bank's  businesses  and  operations  to  be  compliant  with existing and new requirements. To further this objective, the Chief Compliance Officer at the Bank reports directly to the AC. The key functions of this department align with various  RBI  guidelines,  including  the  RBI  circular  dated September 11, 2020, which includes identifying effective procedures, corresponding controls to support the Bank's business divisions and the dissemination of key regulatory updates  affecting  the  Bank's  various  businesses.  The department  also  reviews  new  products  and  processes from  a  regulatory  compliance  perspective,  provides guidance on compliance-related matters, conducts\n\ncompliance  reviews  and  delivers  training  to  employees on compliance aspects. The Bank has also put in place KYC  and  anti-money  laundering  policies  approved  by the Board of Directors as well as transaction monitoring procedures as per the regulatory guidelines.\n\n## Sustainable Finance\n\nThe Sustainable Finance team co-develops and implements  YES  BANK's  sustainability  strategy.  The team  works  to  integrate  environmental,  social  and governance  (ESG)  considerations  into  the  Bank's  core business,  focusing  on  building  resilience  against  ESGrelated  risks  and  mainstreaming  sustainable  finance. The  team  aligns  the  Bank's  business  to  the  objectives of  the  National  Guidelines  for  Responsible  Business Conduct  (NGRBC),  Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement and the Principles for  Responsible  Banking  (PRB).

In FY 2021-22, the Bank strengthened its ESG governance by constituting a Board-level Corporate Social  Responsibility  (CSR)  and  ESG  Committee  to oversee the Sustainability Council and guide the Bank's overall ESG agenda.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYES  BANK  is  aware  of  its  environmental  impacts  and responsibility towards climate action, and it continually endeavours  to  conserve  its  use  of  natural  resources and  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions.  In FY  2021-22,  the  Bank  announced  a  target  to  reduce its  GHG  emissions  to  net-zero  by  2030  and  began sourcing  renewable  energy  to  power  its  head  office, YES BANK House (YBH) in Mumbai, thereby eliminating approximately 1,105 tCO 2 e of emissions during the year. The Bank has adopted an environment and social policy (ESP) based on the International Finance Corporation's (IFC)  performance  standards  to  assess  and  address potential environmental and social risks associated with its lending activities. In FY 2021-22, the Bank launched a  specialised  training  module  to  upskill  RMs  and strengthen the implementation of its ESP.\n\nThe  Bank  aims  to  address  the  potential  climate  risks and  impacts  of  its  lending  activity,  limit  its  portfolio emissions and support sustainable sectors by adopting TCFD recommendations, and developing a climate risk measurement framework for measuring and assessing climate-related  physical  and  transition  risks.  The  Bank continues  to  be  the  only  Indian  Bank  to  measure  and report  its  financed  emissions  and  is  targeting  the alignment of its electricity generation sector exposure to global 1.5-degree decarbonisation pathways. In FY 202122, the Bank began identifying and defining green and social activities as part of its internal sustainable finance taxonomy.  The  Bank  continues  to  develop  targeted products  for  green  financing;  for  example,  offering loans  to  MSMEs  for  the  adoption  of  roof-top  solar panels, promoting solar water pumps for farming under the  PM  Kusum Scheme, offering bank guarantees and commercial vehicle financing to urban waste collectors and processors, financing equipment manufacturers of effluent  treatment  and  sewage  treatment  plants,  and supporting the electric vehicle ecosystem by financing auto ancillaries and charging infrastructure players.\n\nThe Bank continues to work with stakeholders across the spectrum as a leading voice for sustainability and climate transition. In FY 2021-22, YES BANK was inducted as a core member of the Task Force on Sustainable Finance, set up by the Department of Economic Affairs, and coled the development of a white paper on 'Building ESG Resilience  within  the  Financial  Sector'.  The  Bank  also worked with the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi to develop two research papers aimed at assessing the impact of climate change across different climatic zones in India.\n\nYES  BANK  is  committed  to  achieving  the  highest standards  of  governance  in  all  aspects  of  its  business and conforming to global standards of ethics, integrity and transparency. Going beyond compliance, the Bank intends  to  address  key  ESG  issues  around  diversity, human rights and climate change, and make voluntary disclosures  on  how  it  integrates  sustainability  into  its operations and governance structures. During FY 202122, The Bank committed to achieve 30% gender diversity over the next 5 years. The Bank also developed policies on work-from-anywhere options for employees, human rights and responsible tax practices.\n\nTo  enable  employees  to  contribute  to  community development, the Bank launched its Employee Volunteering  Virtual  Experience  (EVOLVE)  initiative in  FY  2021-22,  through  which  over  2,000  employees contributed  nearly  3,000  volunteering  hours,  reaching out  to  support  COVID  patients,  rural  farmers  and underprivileged  youth.  The  Bank  also  instituted  a volunteering policy where employees could access paid time off to volunteer for a social cause.\n\nIn  FY  2021-22,  YES  BANK  was  the  only  Indian  bank  to be  selected  among  the  '100  Best  Emerging  Market Performers'  in  social  responsibility,  human  rights, employment practices, environmental protection, corporate governance, business ethics and contributions to  social  and  economic  development,  as  assessed by  VE,  part  of  Moody's  ESG  Solutions.

This  strategy  is  implemented  via  the  Bank's  social development  arm,  YES  Foundation,  and  will  catalyse employment  and  entrepreneurship  opportunities  for 100,000 young people by 2026.\n\n## Employability\n\nThe  Bank  aims  to  capitalise  on  the  demographic advantage India has in its younger generations. Through the  YES  Foundation  and  in  partnership  with  Trust  for Retailers  and  Retail  Associates  of  India,  Friends  Union for  Energising  Lives,  Nudge  LifeSkills  Foundation  and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTata  Community  Initiative  Trust,  over  2,000  young people have already been trained for the service sector in  FY  2021-22.  Skills  training  included  work  readiness modules, which were delivered by employee volunteers during structured sessions.\n\n## Entrepreneurship\n\nTo strengthen local economies, develop newly commercialised  technologies  and  build  capacity  for import  substitution,  YES  Foundation  has  partnered with several non-profit organisations to incubate microenterprises  and  promote  nano-enterprises  with  a distinct focus on empowering women in rural areas. In FY 2021-22, 19 micro-enterprises from districts in Eastern Uttar Pradesh were incubated in partnership with Jagriti Sewa Sansthan. During the year, in partnership with the Watershed Organisation Trust, NM Sadguru Water and Development  Foundation,  Development  of  Humane Action  Foundation,  Mahashakti  Foundation,  Humana People  to  People  India  and  Society  of  Indian  Institute for Rural Development, YES Foundation engaged 10,000 community members from rural areas across six states in  nano-enterprises  via  training  and  capacity  building sessions,  market  linkage  modules  and  productivity enhancement initiatives for multiple crops.\n\n## Environmental Sustainability\n\nYES  BANK  leverages  its  CSR  initiatives  to  contribute positively  towards  environmental  protection.  Under the  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways'  'Adopt a  Green  Highway'  initiative,  YES  Foundation  adopted  a 40-kilometre stretch along the Mumbai-Nashik Highway. This endeavour will contribute towards achieving India's environmental sustainability commitment to creating an additional  carbon  sink  of  2.5  to  3  billion  tonnes  of  CO 2 equivalent by 2030. An endline assessment done for the project,  through  a  third  party,  reported  41,441  newly planted plants. The assessment pegged the survival rate at 97.75%, higher than the targeted 90%. In comparison to the Baseline Report, the avenue of plantation increased from  30,813  to  37,630.  In  air  testing,  it  was  found  that the  levels  were  within  the  limits  prescribed.  In  the  soil test it was found out that nutritional value of the soil has increased from the baseline, in all parameters.\n\nThrough YES Foundation, the Bank works on enabling MSMEs to integrate sustainability into their operations, reduce overall carbon footprint, enhance  global competitiveness in terms of output and efficiency and contribute to India's 'Zero Defect, Zero Effect' vision. In partnership with the Foundation for MSME Clusters, the\n\nEntrepreneurship  Development  Institute  of  India  and the Society of Energy Engineers & Managers, the project has grown and now covers 17 MSME sectors.\n\nSince  its  inception,  the  initiative  has  supported  over 55,000 MSMEs and benefited more than 100,000 workers across  57  cluster  locations.  The  initiative  has  also helped  MSMEs  reduce  carbon  emissions  and  improve occupational health and safety systems via multifaceted interventions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Workshops on promoting energy efficiency, renewable energy and clean technology\n- \u00b7 Energy audits of MSMEs\n- \u00b7 Structured occupational health and safety interventions, including health camps, first-aid training and safety training\n- \u00b7 Empowering MSMEs through financial literacy camps\n\nTo  tap  into  the  transformative  potential  that  drives positive  social  change,  it  is  vital  that  diverse  groups  in larger  communities  are  included  and  encouraged  to participate in the process. This collaborative, all-round approach enables the Bank to forge lasting associations with  all  of  its  stakeholders,  including  communities, non-profit organisations, governments, corporate peers  and  civil  society,  creating  a  broad  network  of relationships that multiplies the impact.\n\n## Central Data Analytics Group (CDAG)\n\nThe  Bank  continues  to  invest  in  the  analytics  function and there is a continuous focus in driving value through data driven decisions. During the year the Bank's captive analytics group has been successful in:\n\n- \u00b7 Building  a  unified  underwriting  framework  across all  sourcing  channels  to  create  a  unique  customer experience\n- \u00b7 Moving  away  from  judgemental  models  to  machine learning approach  in  customer  assessment  to increase  the  relevance  of  cross-sell  offers  to  the Bank's  customers as well  as  mitigate  risk  in  a  more robust way\n- \u00b7 Investing  and  partnering  with  credit  information companies to launch credit education for customers on  our  digital  platforms  wherein  customers  can simulate their credit score and influence their credit track record positively\n- \u00b7 Create analytics as a service wherein offers to both customers/prospects on our digital platform can be served real-time on the fly\n\n## Business and Digital Technology Solutions (BDTS)\n\nThe BDTS team helps accelerate business growth with the  most  appropriate  technology  and  partners  while keeping the customer experience as a central point of focus.  The  BDTS  team  achieves  its  objectives  with  the following:\n\n- \u00b7 API/microservices-based architecture: Business scale  requires  speed  and  security,  and  the  API/ microservices architecture provides the best business/ tech  model  with  the  right  framework  for  monetising services and penetrating new marketplaces.\n- \u00b7 AI  and  machine  learning  (ML): With  continual investment  in  AI  and  ML  and  the  development  of  a Centre of Excellence (COE), the Bank is creating new learning and growth.

This will help scale the cloud  and  adopt  low  code-no  code  practices,  hyperautomation  frameworks  and  new-age  technology support on the doorstep.\n- \u00b7 Data  and  analytics: Keeping the data-driven decision-making aspiration in mind, the Bank infuses its  business  strategy  with  data  and  analytics,  which helps  accelerate  the  Company's  digital  plans.  The Bank is making a relentless effort to focus on business value  by  linking  all  data  and  analytics  initiatives  to overall enterprise business strategy and stakeholder objectives.\n\nDuring FY 2021-22, systems were upgraded to the latest versions to support the growing needs of the Bank, and several  new  initiatives  were  completed  successfully, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Traydstream: a  project  to  automate  the  scrutiny  of trade finance documents",

The first year was the year of rebuilding the Bank while this year has been the year of growing the Bank.

The Bank is on track to achieve its Strategic Objectives and none of this would have been possible without the confidence reposed of the  Bank's  customers,  depositors  and  investors.  The confidence  of  stakeholders  has  not  only  been  seen through the improving financial performance of the Bank during the last year, but also through external validation in the form of Credit Rating upgrades, successful client win-backs  and  acquisition  strategy,  re-inclusion  of  the stock in marquee indices amongst others.\n\nThe  Bank  undertook  multiple  initiatives  to  grow  the Bank's business and launched tailored propositions for its customers -\n\n- \u00b7 Continued  to  deepen  customer  relationship  and wallet  share  for  existing  Bank  customers,  while focusing on attractive tailored propositions for new customers such as the newly launched Yes Private & YES Family programmes\n- \u00b7 Enhanced digital customer sales and servicing model and  enable  remote  interactions  for  key  processes such as the launch of video KYC for account opening, WhatsApp Banking, remote payment service for merchants.\n\n- \u00b7 Kickstarted and/or implemented many key initiatives in  customer  personalisation  using  Chatbots,  data analytics,  innovation  in  Cloud  platforms,  intelligent automation through robotics etc.\n- \u00b7 Committed to reduce green-house gas emissions to net zero by 2030\n- \u00b7 Ranked No. 2 amongst Large-Sized Banks in the Best places  to  work  in  India  2021  awards,  conducted  by AmbitionBox.com\n- \u00b7 Among the 100 Best Emerging Market Performers as assessed by VE, part of Moody's ESG\n\nThe  Bank  continued  its  efforts  towards  building  a stronger  retail  franchise  with  contribution  of  retail advances compared to total advances, increased to 36% in FY 2021-22 compared to 30% in FY 2020-21. Digitisation remains the Bank's key pillar to grow the Retail, MSME and the Transaction Banking businesses. The Wholesale Bank has seen new sanctions/disbursements of ' 16,000 crore  in  FY2021-22  with  focus  on  working  capital financing  to  higher  rated  corporates.  The  Bank  has significant presence within the new-age payments space with the highest market share of 43% in UPI transactions (by volume) in FY 2021-22.\n\n## STATE OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE BANK\n\nThe  Bank's  fundamentals  have  strengthened  and  it has emerged from the crisis as a financially sound, well capitalised,  well  governed  institution,  with  customer centricity and digital at the heart of its strategy. The Bank remains focused on its priorities and looks to continue this  momentum  onwards  and  upwards  so  that  it  can deliver on its strategic objectives while creating superior value for all its stakeholders.\n\n## Strategic Objectives for FY23 and Medium Term\n\n- 1. CASA  ratio  at  35%  for  FY23  and  >  40%  in  the medium term\n- 2. Granular Advances: Retail/MSME to further improve by > 400 bps in FY23\n- 3. Advances  Growth  of  >  15%  in  FY23  of  which Corporate growth of 10% and Medium Enterprises, SME and Retail to grow > 25%\n- 4. Focused Stressed Assets Recoveries and Upgrades > ' 5,000 crore in FY23\n- 5. ROA  >  0.75%  in  FY23  and  Medium  term  target  of 1%-1.5%\n\n## BUSINESS OUTLOOK\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate credit growth trajectory is expected to have an upshift on the back of significant increase in capex outlay in Union Budget with a sharp focus on public infrastructure as well as Production Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme announced for 13 key sectors by the government.\n- \u00b7 Improved  resilience  of  the  banking  system  is  likely  to  support  stronger  credit  growth  to  MSME's  and  retail segments. Home Loans will be a major driver of credit growth as demand for residential purchases is expected to continue growing. Unsecured Lending is also expected to see improvement as the segment will continue to be attractive on a risk-adjusted return basis.\n- \u00b7 Overall, the Indian Banking Sector is well positioned to fund faster credit growth, with healthy capital buffers, high profitability metrics, and waning asset quality pressures. These factors together with a strong deposits growth augur well for the Banking sector.\n- \u00b7 While, the above-mentioned are positive for the sector, there are also certain risks that could impact the sector, such as a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases on the back of new variants, continued geopolitical tensions that could impact many downstream sectors (some of which are already under pressure because of increased commodity prices); and, finally higher-than-expected slowdown in private consumption.\n\n## CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF BUSINESS\n\nDuring the year under review, there has been no change in the nature of business of the Bank.\n\n## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE (STANDALONE)\n\n| Particulars                                                                                | April 01, 2021 to  March 31, 2022   | April 01, 2020 to  March 31, 2021   | ( '  in million) Change   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Deposits                                                                                   | 1,971,917.33                        | 1,629,466.42                        | 342,450.91                |\n| Borrowings                                                                                 | 722,045.84                          | 639,490.85                          | 82,554.99                 |\n| Advances                                                                                   | 1,810,519.91                        | 1,668,929.94                        | 141,589.97                |\n| Total Assets/Liabilities                                                                   | 3,182,202.25                        | 2,735,427.65                        | 446,774.60                |\n| Net Interest Income                                                                        | 64,978.54                           | 74,286.02                           | (9,307.48)                |\n| Non Interest Income                                                                        | 32,624.69                           | 30,116.94                           | 2,507.75                  |\n| Operating profit                                                                           | 29,159.29                           | 46,482.81                           | (17,323.52)               |\n| Provisions and Contingencies                                                               | 14,800.81                           | 93,833.55                           | (79,032.74)               |\n|                                                                                            | 14,358.48                           | (47,350.74)                         |                           |\n| Profit before Tax                                                                          | 3,696.36                            | (12,728.47)                         | 61,709.22                 |\n| Provision for taxes                                                                        |                                     | (34,622.27)                         | 16,424.83                 |\n| NET PROFIT                                                                                 | 10,662.12                           |                                     | 45,284.39                 |\n| Add: Surplus/(Deficit) brought forward from last period Amount available for appropriation | (108,719.60) (98,057.48)            | (68,973.88)                         | (39,745.72)               |\n|                                                                                            |                                     | (103,596.15)                        | 5,538.67                  |\n| Appropriations                                                                             |                                     |                                     |                           |\n| Statutory Reserve under Section 17 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949                     | 2,665.53                            | -

The  Bank's  Risk  Management philosophy is guided by the Three Lines of Defence:\n- -First  Line  of  Defence  Business  Management: Each  business  segment  of  the  Bank  has  risk ownership  and  is  responsible  for  assessment and  management  of  risks  and  has  the  overall responsibility  of  the  management  and  mitigation of the  Risk.  The  segments  are  required  to implement  appropriate  procedures  to  fulfil  their risk governance responsibilities.\n- -Second Line of Defence Independent functions: The  Bank's  independent  oversight  functions, such  as,  Risk  Management,  Credit  Underwriting, Compliance,  Legal,  Fraud  Containment  Unit,  etc. set  standards  for  management  and  oversight  of risks,  including  compliance  with  applicable  laws, regulatory requirements and policies.\n- -Risk  Management: Risk  Management  team reporting into the Chief Risk Officer establishes policies  and  guidelines  for  risk  assessment and  management  and  contributes  to  controls and  tools  to  manage,  measure  and  mitigate risks  faced  by  the  Bank.  Risk  Management comprises units such as Enterprise Risk Market Risk,  Operational  Risk,  Legal  Risk,  Information Security,  Portfolio  Analytics,  Retail,  SME  & Rural Policy, Risk Secretarial Unit, etc which are responsible for independent review, monitoring and reporting of all risk control parameters and taking  appropriate  corrective  actions  where necessary.  These  units  also  ensure  compliance to internal policies and regulatory guidelines.\n- -Credit  Underwriting: The  Credit  Risk  team reporting  into  the  Chief  Credit  Risk  Officer ensures  an  independent  assessment  of  credit proposals  and  is  responsible  for  monitoring the  credit  quality  of  the  Bank's  portfolio  and undertaking  portfolio  reviews.  The  Credit  Risk team is a specialised function that is well staffed with individuals having the necessary experience as well as skillsets to provide a balanced view of credit proposals to the sanctioning authorities.\n\n- -Compliance: The Compliance unit is responsible  for  tracking  implementation  of  all regulatory circulars/communication, review of  new  products  &  processes  from  regulatory perspective,  conducting  compliance  reviews  to ensure adherence to regulatory guidelines and monitoring progress in rectification of significant deficiencies (if any) pointed out by regulators in inspection reports as well as implementation of recommendations  made  therein.  This  ensures that the overall Compliance Risk of the Bank is managed and mitigated.\n- -FCU & AML: The  Fraud  Containment Unit (FCU) is responsible  for  prevention  and  detection of  internal  and  external  frauds  in  the  areas  of Liabilities,  Product  and  Support  functions.  The unit  conducts  transaction  monitoring,  forensic scrutiny, employee  awareness  trainings  and vulnerability  assessments  to  help  achieve  the said  objective.  The  Anti  Money  Laundering  Unit (AML) is responsible for identifying and reporting of  suspicious  transactions  and  other  regulatory reports  such  as  Cash  Transaction  Report,  Cross Border  Wire  Transfer  Report,  Not  for  Profit Organisation Transaction report etc. as prescribed under PMLA Act/Regulators, across all Business segments of the Bank. The AML unit is equipped with  qualified,  trained  and  experienced  staff, which monitors various transactions undertaken by  customers  with  a  view  to  combat  financial crimes and prevents misuse of the accounts for money laundering.\n- -Third Line of Defence The Bank's Internal Audit Department  independently  reviews  activities  of the first two lines of defence based on a risk-based audit plan and methodology approved by the Audit Committee of the Board. Internal Audit Department provides  independent  assurance  to  the  Audit Committee  of  the  Board,  top  management  and regulators regarding the effectiveness of the Bank's governance and controls framework designed for risk mitigation.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Bank  has  overall responsibility for Risk Management. The Board oversees the Bank's Risk and related control environment, reviews and approves the policies designed as part of overseeing the Risk Management practices. The Board ensures that comprehensive policies, systems and controls are in place to identify, monitor and manage material risks at a Bank-",

PROVIDE THE DETAILS OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF CSR PROJECTS CARRIED OUT IN PURSUANCE OF SUB- RULE (3) OF RULE 8 OF THE COMPANIES (CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY POLICY) RULES, 2014, IF APPLICABLE (ATTACH THE REPORT)\n\nThe Bank had negative average net profit as per Section 135(5) for the financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22, and accordingly did not have any CSR obligation and /or CSR projects during the last two financial years. Therefore, the impact assessment requirement is not applicable to the Bank's CSR projects. However, as a best practice, a third-party impact assessment was conducted for the Bank's project on providing access to safe and clean drinking water to over 1000 rural households in Maharashtra. A detailed report, along with the outcomes of the study is disclosed on the Bank's website: (https://www.yesbank.in/pdf?name=Impact\\_Assessment\\_study\\_of\\_ YES\\_Bank\\_Swades\\_Foundations\\_access\\_to\\_safe\\_and\\_clean\\_drinking\\_water.pdf)",

The procedures  we  performed,  which  are  set  out  in  detail below,  were  based  on  our  professional  judgement and  included,  as  appropriate,  inquiries,  observation of  processes  performed,  inspection  of  documents, analytical  procedures,  evaluating  the  appropriateness of  quantification  methods  and  reporting  policies  and agreement or reconciliation with underlying records. We believe that the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained are sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.\n\n## To reach our conclusion we:\n\n- \u00b7 Checked  the  Issuer's  Green  Bond  Framework  that includes  processes,  systems  and  controls  in  place  for management of bond proceeds; investment areas for green bond proceeds and intended types of temporary investment  instruments  for  the  management  of unallocated proceeds;\n- \u00b7 Read sections of the bond disclosure documentation that  also  support  the  objects  of  the  green  bond issue,  investment  areas  for  proceeds  and  intended types  of  temporary  investment  instruments  for  the management of unallocated proceeds;\n- \u00b7 Conducted interviews with management and key staff responsible  for  the  green  bond  to  understand  how the  processes,  systems  and  controls  defined  in  the Green  Bond  Framework  have  been  implemented  in the financial year;\n- \u00b7 Checked the list of projects to which bond proceeds have  been  allocated  in  the  financial  year  and  their conformance  with  the  criteria  defined  in  the  Green Bond Framework; and\n\n- \u00b7 Recalculated  estimated  carbon  dioxide  emission reductions from projects using information collected by the Issuer.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe following conclusion is based on the work performed and evidence obtained, and the scope of our assurance engagement described above.\n\nNothing has come to our attention to suggest that the green bonds issued in February 2015, August 2015 and December  2016  by  the  Issuer  and  the  accompanying report 'Disclosures under Green Infrastructure Bonds' are  not,  in  all  material  respects,  conforming  to  the requirements of the Green Bond Principles, 2021, during the period April 01, 2021- March 31, 2022.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe  assurance  was  conducted  by  a  multidisciplinary team  including  professionals  with  suitable  skills  and experience  in  auditing  environmental,  social  and economic  information  in  line  with  the  requirements of  ISAE  3000  standard.

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT\n\n(The Report on Corporate Governance for the year ended March 31, 2022)\n\nIn  compliance  with  Regulation  34(3)  and  Clause  (C)  of Schedule  V  of  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 ('SEBI LODR'), a Report on Corporate Governance for the Financial Year 2021-22 is presented below:\n\n## 1. BANK'S PHILOSOPHY ON CODE OF GOVERNANCE\n\nYES BANK, now re-build and backed by rich legacy of fair, ethical, and transparent governance practice of India's best Public Sector Bank, is committed to achieve higher standards of Corporate Governance and has successfully re-gained the trust and faith of the stakeholders by strengthening its governance and disclosure practices.\n\nEffective  Corporate  Governance  is  the  interaction between various participants (Shareholders, Board  of  Directors,  and  Bank's  Management)  in shaping  Bank's  performance.  Transparency  and Accountability  are  the  fundamental  principles  to sound Corporate Governance, which ensures that the  organisation  is  managed  and  monitored  in  a responsible manner for 'creating and sharing value'.\n\nWith  a  view  to  bring  in  more  transparency  and accountability, the Bank upgrades its systems and policies  regularly,  to  meet  the  requirements  of dynamic  and  challenging  business  environment and to provide reasonable assurance with regards to  maintaining  of  proper  internal  controls  and monitoring  of  operations.  YES  BANK's  Board  is committed to adhere to highest standard of ethics, transparency,  disclosures  and  governance  and to  protect  the  interest  of  all  its  stakeholders.  The Board  is  focused  on  ensuring  both  the  Corporate Governance and Risk Controls of the Bank.\n\nYES BANK's  Corporate  Governance  framework ensures  that  timely  disclosures  are  made  and accurate  information  is  shared  regarding  the financial  performance,  operations  as  well  as  the leadership and governance of the Bank.\n\nDuring the past years, several Corporate Governance issues were raised by Stakeholders and Regulators. Taking  a  positive  note  of  such  observations,  the Bank  has  worked  effortlessly  to  strengthen  its governance and disclosure practices and promises to continue to be on the progressive path to nourish Corporate  Governance  practices  to  make  it  more effective from regulatory and market perspective.\n\n## Environmental, Social & Governance Rating\n\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance refers to the non-financial performance of an organisation on crucial issues such as climate change, environmental sustainability, social responsibility, ethics, institutional frameworks, and transparency, amongst others.\n\nGlobally,  there  is  an  emerging  awareness  that  an organisation's  overall  performance  is  linked  to non-financial, yet financially material issues, which pose significant material risks to long term returns. This has led to the emergence of ESG, a set of nonfinancial  metrics  or  parameters,  which  along  with financial  metrics,  provide  a  holistic  assessment  of an organisation's impact on three fronts - profits, people and planet.\n\nYES  BANK  views  the  emergence  of  ESG  as  an important  development  for  the  corporate  sector both  from  an  ethical  and  a  financial  perspective. The  Bank  has  always  endeavoured  to  integrate ESG  principles  into  its  core  business  strategy and adopt global best practices  in  ESG.  The  Bank continuously strives to align its business to global frameworks  on  sustainability  such  as  the  United Nation's  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB). The Bank has constituted an Executive level Sustainability Council chaired by the  Managing  Director  &  CEO  which  oversees  the implementation of the Bank's sustainability agenda, sets  long,  medium  &  short-term  sustainability targets and evaluates the Bank's ESG performance. In  FY  2021-22,  the  Bank  strengthened  its  ESG governance by change in nomenclature of a Board level, Corporate Social Responsibility Committee to Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Social  &  Governance  Committee  to  oversee  the Sustainability Council and guide the Bank's overall ESG agenda.\n\nYES BANK continues to disclose its ESG performance in  line  with  international  benchmark  disclosure frameworks such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards,  Integrated  Reporting  (IR)  Framework and Taskforce on Climate-related Financial disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. The Bank has consequently earned a place in prestigious  global ESG rankings and Indices. In FY 2021-22, YES BANK was selected among the 100 Best Emerging Market Performers as assessed by V.E, part of Moody's ESG\n\nSolutions.  The  ranking,  as  of  July  2021,  comprised the  top  100  performing  companies  listed  in developing markets with the most advanced scores in social responsibility, human rights, employment practices, environmental  protection,  corporate governance,  business  ethics  and  contributions  to social  and  economic  development  in  areas  where they  operate.  YES  BANK  continues  to  be  the  only Indian  Bank  in  the  ranking  (It  was  first  included in  the  V.E  ranking  from  December  2017-June  2019 period). YES BANK was included as a constituent in a number of Morgan Stanley Capital International's (MSCI)  flagship  global  equity  indices  aligned  with worldwide ESG benchmarks. As of December 2021, the Bank featured in the MSCI ACWI's ESG Universal Index, MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Leaders Index, MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index, MSCI ACWI Climate Change Index, and MSCI ACWI Climate Paris Aligned Index,  among others.

For  each  such  product,  provide  the  following details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of product (optional):\n\n## i. Reduction during sourcing/production/ distribution achieved since the previous year throughout the value chain?\n\nOn  account  of  the  nature  of  its  services,  the major  resources  consumed  at  the  Bank  are grid electricity and paper. During the reporting period,  the  Bank  has  launched  several  key initiatives and achieved significant traction on on-going initiatives, towards achieving internal resource  efficiencies,  focused  on  product and  process  digitisation,  greater  employee awareness, reduction in waste generation, and improved waste management.\n\nYES BANK has instituted a robust Environment Management  System  (EMS),  covering  732 facilities  (including  5  corporate  offices,  YES Securities  and  the  Abu  Dhabi  Representative Office) and which was certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant for the 9 th year in a row in FY 2021-22. The  certification  highlights  the  Bank's  efforts at  conserving  natural  resources,  improving key  resource  efficiencies,  and  reducing  its carbon footprint.\n\n## ii. Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) has been achieved since the previous year?\n\nGiven that the Bank's primary product offerings are  financial  services,  resource  consumption during usage by consumers is not a significant material issue for the banking sector in general. YES BANK has instituted a robust Environment Management  System (EMS) designed to conserve  the  use  natural  resources,  improve key resource efficiencies, and reduce its carbon footprint. The Bank's EMS covering 732 facilities (including  5  corporate  offices,  YES  Securities and the Abu Dhabi Representative Office) was certified ISO 14001:2015 compliant for the 9 th year in a row in FY 2021-22.\n\nThe  Bank  is  rapidly  adopting  technology  to digitise  its  operations  and  product  offerings and has witnessed a strong growth in adoption of  mobile  banking,  online  banking,  payment apps  and  chatbot  banking,  thus  reducing  the\n\nincidence  of  paper  usage  and  travel  among  its customers. The impact achieved through related initiatives is included in the Environment section (Page 26), as a part of this Annual Report.\n\n- 3. Does the Company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing (including transportation)?\n- i. If  yes,  what  percentage  of  your  inputs  was sourced  sustainably?  Also,  provide  details thereof, in about 50 words or so.\n\nGiven  that  the  Banking  sector's  primary product offering is financial services, the Bank does not have any raw material requirements. The primary resources consumed for its dayto-day  operations  are  paper,  grid  electricity, water and diesel for DG sets in locations with erratic  availability  of  electricity.  Such  DG sets  are  procured  centrally  based  on  request from  the  projects  teams,  and  negotiated  by the  Strategic  Procurement  Unit.  The  Bank strives to achieve greater transparency, compliance  and  adoption  of  environmental and  labour  best  practices  in  its  procurement process. YES BANK has switched to procuring recycled paper (A4) for internal operations and back-end  processes,  across  India.  Recycled paper  accounts  for  96%  of  the  Bank's  paper consumption. From January 01, 2022, the Bank began  sourcing  renewable  energy  to  power its  head office, YES BANK House (YBH), which represents  approximately  9%  of  the  Bank's overall  electricity  consumption  and  Green House Gas emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe  Bank  procured  renewable  energy  partly through open access, Power Purchase Agreements  (PPAs)  with  renewable  energy producers  along  with  subscribing  to  Green Power Tariff programmes.\n\n- 4.    Has the Company taken any steps to procure goods and services from local & small producers, including communities surrounding their place of work?\n\n## If yes, what steps have been taken to improve their  capacity  and  capability  of  local  and small vendors?\n\nYes.  The  Bank's  award-winning  product  for  the Bottom of the Pyramid - YES MONEY, is based on\n\nthe Business Correspondent (BC) model that enrols local small business owners as BC Agents (BCA) to provide digital financial services to local community. These BCAs are trained about basic banking services and related operations.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Bank's procurement carried out centrally  through  the  Strategic  Procurement  Unit, the Bank also has branches in all states and Union Territories  in  India,  and  procures  locally  for  daily use  items  and  services  such  as  stationary,  food and  beverages  and  local  transport.  It  works  with most  local  vendors  to  align  them  with  the  Bank's procurement  requirements  and  standards.  The Bank has defined Procurement Policy and practices which govern such engagement models.\n\n- 5. Does  the  Company  have  a  mechanism  to recycle products and waste? If yes, what is the percentage of recycling of products and waste (separately as <5%, 5-10%, >10%).\n\n## Also, provide details thereof, in about 50 words or so.\n\nYes. As the Banking sector's primary product offering is financial services, majority of its waste is related to  paper,  municipal  waste,  and  electronic  waste. The Bank has strong policies and practices in place for responsible disposal of all such waste through authorised  third-party  vendors.  For  waste  paper disposal,  the  Bank  has  local  authorised  vendors to ensure recycling of waste paper in all corporate locations  across  India  and  branches  in  Mumbai. For  e-waste  handling,  the  Bank  has  a  national authorised  vendor  for  centralised  collection  and handling of e-waste to ensure >10% of its e-waste is responsibly disposed/ recycled.\n\nThe Bank's  waste  management  practices  are included  in  the  Environment  section  (Page  26),  as part of this Annual Report.\n\n## Principle 3\n\n- 1.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report:\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Auditor's Response\n\nIncome Recognition and Asset Classification of Advances and Investments (IRAC) and Provisioning as per regulatory norms Please  refer  to  schedule  5,  schedule  8,  schedule  9,  read  with Note nos. 17.5.11, 17.5.19 and 17.5.13(ii) relating to provisions and  contingencies,  Asset  Quality  in  respect  of  movement  of Non-Performing  Assets  (NPAs)  and  related  provisions  and Our  audit  approach  included  testing  the  design,  operating  effectiveness of internal controls and substantive audit procedures in respect of income recognition,  asset  classification  and  provisioning  pertaining  to  advances and investments.

The volume  of  transactions  processed  and  recorded  is  huge. Moreover,  a  transaction  may  be  required  to  be  recorded across  multiple  applications  depending  upon  the  process and each application has different rules and a different set of user access and authority matrix. These applications are interlinked using different technologies so that data transfer happens in real time or at a particular  time  of  the  day;  in batches or at a transaction level and in an automated manner or manually. The Core Banking Solution (CBS) itself has many interfaces,  such  that  there  exists  a  risk  that  gaps  in  the  IT control environment could result in the financial accounting and reporting records being materially misstated. The Bank has  a  process  for  identifying  the  applications  where  the controls are embedded. It also has a process to ensure that systems, processes and controls remain relevant. The Bank's IT  control  framework includes automated, semi-automated and manual controls designed to address identified risks. IT controls are stated in Entity Level Controls (ELC), IT General Controls  (ITGC)  and  IT  Application  Controls  (ITAC).  Such controls  contribute  to  risk  mitigation  of  erroneous  output data.\n\nWe  have  identified  IT  Controls  Framework  as  a  Key  Audit Matter  as  the  Bank's  business  is  highly  dependent  on technology,  the  IT  environment  is  complex  and  the  design and  operating  effectiveness  of  IT  controls  have  a  direct impact  on  its  financial  reporting  process.  Review  of  these controls  allows  us  to  provide  assurance  on  the  integrity and  completeness  of  data  processed  through  various  IT applications which are used for the preparation of financial reports.\n\n- \u00b7 We  have  planned,  designed  and  carried  out  the  desired  audit procedures  and  sample  checks,  taking  into  consideration  the IT  systems  of  the  Bank.  As  part  of  our  IT  controls  testing,  we have tested ITGC as well as ITAC. The focus of testing of ITGCs was  based  on  the  various  parameters  such  as  Completeness, Validity, Identification/Authentication, Authorisation, Integrity and Accountability.  On  the  other  hand,  focus  of  testing  automated controls from applications was whether the controls prevent or detect unauthorised transactions and support financial objectives including  completeness,  accuracy,  authorisation  and  validity  of transactions. The procedures adopted by us are, in our opinion, adequate to provide reasonable assurance on the adequacy of IT controls in place. Towards this end, we obtained an understanding of Bank's IT environment.\n- \u00b7 In ITGC testing, on sample basis, we reviewed control areas such as  User  Management,  Change  Management,  Systems  Security, cyber security, interface testing, deployment of new applications, Incident Management, Physical & Environmental Security, Backup and  Restoration,  Business  Continuity  and  Disaster  Recovery, Service Level Agreement.\n- \u00b7 For  ITAC,  we  carried  out  on  sample  basis,  compliance  tests  of system  functionality  in  order  to  assess  the  accuracy  of  system calculations. We also carried out procedures such as validations and  limit  checks  on  data  entered  into  applications,  approvals, process  dependencies  and  restriction  on  time  period  in  which transactions may be recorded.\n- \u00b7 We  tested  the  control  environment  using  various  techniques such  as  inquiry,  walk-throughs  in  live  environment,  review  of documentation/ record/ reports, observation and re-performance. We  had  taken  adequate  samples  of  instances  for  our  tests considering the audit universe.\n- \u00b7 Wherever deviations were noted either the same were explained to  our  satisfaction  or  we  tested  compensating  controls  and performed  alternate  procedures,  where  necessary,  to  draw comfort.\n- \u00b7 In addition, we have also relied on IS audit conducted by internal audit department, and also the audit of Internal Financial Control over  Financial  Reporting  conducted  by  the  Operational  Risk Management department of the Bank.\n\n## Information  other  than  the  standalone  financial statements and Auditor's Report thereon\n\nThe  Bank's  management  and  Board  of  Directors  are responsible  for  the  Other  Information.  The  other information  comprises  the  Management  Discussion and Analysis, Directors' Report, including Annexures to Directors' Report and the Pillar III Disclosures under the New Capital Adequacy Framework (Basel III disclosures) (collectively  called  as  'Other  Information')  but  does not  include  the  standalone  financial  statements  and our  auditor's  report  thereon.  The  other  information  is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements,  our  responsibility  is  to  read  the  Other Information  identified  as  above  when  it  becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen  we  read  the  other  information,  if  we  conclude that  there  is  a  material  misstatement  therein,  we  are\n\nrequired to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.\n\n## Management's and Board of Director's Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe  Bank's  management  and  Board  of  Directors  are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Bank in accordance with the accounting principles generally  accepted  in  India,  including  the  Accounting Standards  specified  under  Section  133  of  the  Act, provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') from time to time, as applicable to the Bank. This responsibility also includes maintenance of  adequate  accounting  records  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of  the  Act  and  the  RBI  Guidelines for  safeguarding  of  the  assets  of  the  Bank  and  for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection  and  application  of  appropriate  accounting policies;  making  judgements  and  estimates  that  are reasonable  and  prudent;  and  design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness  of  the  accounting  records,  relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements,  the Management  and  Board  of  Directors  are  responsible for  assessing  the  Bank's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose  Board  of  Directors  are  also  responsible  for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  Auditor's  Report  that includes  our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit\n\nconducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgement  and  maintain  professional Skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under Section  143(3)(i)  of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the bank has adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  financial  statements  in  place  and  the  operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related  disclosures  in  the  standalone  financial statements  made  by  the  Management  and  Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and  Board  of  Directors  use  of  the  going  concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor's Report.  However,  future  events  or  conditions  may cause a Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.",

These  responsibilities  include  the design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for  ensuring  the  orderly  and  efficient  conduct  of  its business, including adherence to the Bank's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of  frauds  and  errors,  the  accuracy  and  completeness of  the  accounting  records,  and  the  timely  preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act').\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Guidance  Note  and the  Standards  on  Auditing  ('the  Standards'),  issued  by the  ICAI  and  deemed  to  be,  prescribed  under  Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting, both issued by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal  financial controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  were\n\nestablished and maintained and whether such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial  statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on  the  auditor's  judgement,  including  the  assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained is  sufficient  and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit  opinion  on  the  Bank's  internal  financial  controls with reference to standalone financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nA  Bank's  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to standalone  financial  statements  is  a  process  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Bank's internal  financial  control  with  reference  to  financial statement includes those policies and procedures that\n\n- 1. pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Bank;\n- 2. provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  Bank  are  being made  only  in  accordance  with  authorisations  of management and directors of the Bank; and\n\n- 3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  timely  detection  of  unauthorised  acquisition, use,  or  disposition  of  the  Bank's  assets  that could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  standalone financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or improper  management  override  of  controls,  material misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud  may  occur  and not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation of  the  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to standalone  financial  statements  to  future  periods  are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference  to  standalone  financial  statement  become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Bank has maintained, in all respects, an  adequate  internal  financial  control  system  with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial  statements  were  operating  effectively  as  at March 31, 2022, based on internal control with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note.\n\n## For M P Chitale & Co.\n\n## For Chokshi & Chokshi LLP\n\nChartered Accountants (Firm Regn.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTES FORMING PART OF THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2022\n\n## 17.1 Background\n\nYES BANK is a publicly held bank engaged in providing a wide range of banking and financial services. YES BANK is a banking company governed by the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The Bank was incorporated as a limited company under the Companies Act, 1956 on November 21, 2003. The Bank received the licence to commence banking operations from the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') on May 24, 2004. Further, YES BANK was included to the Second Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 with effect from August 21, 2004. Also, the Bank has a branch at International Financial Services Centre ('IFSC') at GIFT City, Gujarat ('IBU'). The Bank classifies transactions undertaken by IBU as overseas operation.\n\n## 17.2 Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with requirements prescribed under the Third Schedule (Form A and Form B) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The accounting and reporting policies of the Bank used in the preparation of these financial statements conform to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in India (Indian GAAP), the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time to time, the accounting standards notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2016 to the extent applicable and practices generally prevalent in the banking industry in India. The Bank follows the accrual method of accounting and the historical cost convention, unless otherwise stated by RBI guidelines.\n\n## 17.3 Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the management to make estimates and assumptions that are considered while reporting amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as of the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The impact of any revision in these estimates is recognised prospectively from the period of change.\n\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a nation-wide lockdown in April-May 2020. This was followed by localised lockdowns in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. In FY2022, India witnessed two more waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the re-imposition of localised/regional lock-down measures in certain parts of the country. Currently, while the number of new COVID-19 cases have reduced significantly and the Government of India has withdrawn most of the COVID-19 related restrictions, however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Bank's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are uncertain.\n\n## Significant Accounting Policies\n\n17.4.1  Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Bank and the revenue can be reliably measured.\n\n- \u00b7 Interest income is recognised in the profit and loss account on accrual basis, except in the case of non-performing assets. Interest on non-performing assets is recognised as per the prudential norms of the RBI. Penal Interest for covenant breach is recognised upon certainty of its realisation. Late payment penalty on retail loans is recognised on cash basis.\n- \u00b7 Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n- \u00b7 Commission on Guarantees and Letters of Credit ('LC') issued by the Bank is recognised as income over the period of the Guarantee and LC respectively.\n- \u00b7 Income on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is recognised over the tenure of the instrument on a straight line basis. In case of coupon bearing discounted instruments, discount income is recognised over the tenor of the instrument on yield basis.",

The options granted to employees vest in a graded manner and these may be exercised by the employees within specified periods.\n\n## STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2022\n\nMeasurement  of  the  employee  share-based  payment  plans  is  done  in  accordance  with  the  Guidance  Note  on Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014. RBI, vide its clarification dated August 30, 2021 on Guidelines on Compensation of Whole time Directors/ Chief Executive Officers/Material Risk Takers and Control Function Staff, advised Banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on the date of grant should be recognised as an expense for all instruments granted after the accounting period ending March 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Bank has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked instruments granted after March 31, 2021. The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using BlackScholes model is recognised as compensation expense over the vesting period.\n\nOptions granted till March 31, 2021, the Bank measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using the intrinsic value method. Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the underlying stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options) over the exercise price. The exercise price of the Bank's stock option is the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options and accordingly there is no compensation cost under the intrinsic value method.\n\n## Compensated  absence\n\nThe employees of the Bank are entitled to carry forward a part of their unavailed/unutilised leave subject to a maximum limit. The employees cannot encash unavailed/unutilised leave. The Bank provides for leave encashment /compensated absences based on an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases, interest rates and leave utilisation.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe Bank provides for gratuity, for all employees. The Gratuity is payable to an employee as per Payment of Gratuity Act. The Bank accounts for the liability for future gratuity benefits using the projected unit cost method based on annual actuarial valuation.\n\nThe defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service costs.

Current tax comprises of the amount of tax for the period determined in accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 and the rules framed there under.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates at the balance sheet date. The impact of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realized in future. Deferred tax assets in case of unabsorbed depreciation/ losses are recognized only if there is virtual certainty that such deferred tax asset can be realized against future taxable profits.

If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources would be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Bank or a present obligation that arises from past events that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. The Bank does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements.

This was followed by localized lockdowns in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. In FY2022, India witnessed two more waves of the COVID-19 pandemic and the re-imposition of localised/regional lock-down measures in certain parts of the country. Currently, while the number of new COVID-19 cases have reduced significantly and the Government of India has withdrawn most of the COVID-19 related restrictions, however, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Bank's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are uncertain.",

The fair value of the stock-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes model and is recognised as compensation expense over the vesting period. As a result, 'Employees cost' for the year ended March 31, 2022 is higher by ' 82.4 million and 'Nil' for the year ended March 31, 2021. The Bank has adopted the Fair Value method (based on Black-Scholes pricing model), for pricing and accounting of options for the year ended March 31, 2022. If the Bank had adopted the Fair Value for all the options granted till March 31, 2021, the net profit after tax would have been lower by ' 175.95 million (the net loss after tax would have been higher by ' 338.86 million in previous year), the basic earnings per share would have been ' 0.42 (Previous year: ' (1.65)) per share instead of ' 0.43 (Previous year: ' (1.63)) per share; and diluted earnings per share would have been ' 0.42 (Previous year: ' (1.66)) per share instead of ' 0.43 (Previous year: ' (1.65)) per share.\n\nThe following assumptions have been made for computation of the fair value of ESOP granted for the year ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021:\n\n|                         | For the year ended March 31, 2022         | For the year ended March 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Risk free interest rate | 4.06%-6.75%                               | 3.73%-6.21%                         |\n| Expected life           | 1.5 years-7.5 years 1.5 years - 7.5 years |                                     |\n| Expected volatility     | 41.73%-60.75%                             | 43.18%-77.70%                       |\n| Expected dividends      | 1.10%                                     | 1.10%                               |\n\nIn computing the above information, certain estimates and assumptions have been made by the Management.\n\n## Other Disclosures\n\n17.5.58 Disclosure on Remuneration\n\n## (a) Composition of the N&RC of the Bank as on March 31, 2022 is as follows:\n\n| Mr. Mahesh Krishnamurti   | Non-Executive Director (Chairman)       |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Mr. Sunil Mehta           | Non-Executive Director                  |\n| Mr. Atul Bheda            | Non-Executive Director                  |\n| Mr. Ravindra Pandey       | Nominee Director of State Bank of India |\n| Ms. Rekha Murthy          | Non-Executive Director                  |",

STATEMENTS\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2022\n\n## Qualitative Disclosure:\n\nThe Bank measures and monitors the LCR in line with the Reserve Bank of India's circular dated June 09, 2014 and November 28, 2014 on 'Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards - Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools and LCR Disclosure Standards' as amended for 'Prudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards' dated March 31, 2015. The LCR guidelines aims to ensure that a bank maintains an adequate level of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs) that can be converted into cash to meet its liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day time horizon under a significantly severe liquidity stress scenario. At a minimum, the stock of liquid assets should enable the bank to survive until day 30 of the stress scenario, by which time it is assumed that appropriate corrective actions can be taken. Banks are required to maintain High Quality Liquid Assets of a minimum of 100% of its Net Cash Outflows as prescribed by regulator.\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank endeavours to meet the LCR requirement on an ongoing basis. The adequacy in the LCR maintenance remains a conscious strategy of the Bank towards complying with LCR mandate.\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors of the Bank have empowered ALCO (Top Management Executive Committee) to monitor and strategise the Balance Sheet profile of the Bank. In line with the business strategy, ALCO forms an Interest Rate/Liquidity  view  for  the  bank  with  the  help  of  the  economic  analysis  provided  by  the  in-house  economic research team of the bank. ALCO of the Bank channelises various business segments of the Bank to target good quality asset and liability profile to meet the Bank's profitability as well as Liquidity requirements with the help of robust MIS and Risk Limit architecture of the Bank.\n- \u00b7 Funding strategies are formulated by the ALCO of the Bank. The objective of the funding strategy is to achieve an  optimal  funding  mix  which  is  consistent  with  prudent  liquidity,  diversity  of  sources  and  servicing  costs. Accordingly, BSMG (Balance Sheet Management Group) of the Bank estimates daily liquidity requirement of the various business segments and manages the same on consolidated basis under ALCO guidance. With the help of Liquidity Statement prepared by the Bank, BSMG evaluates liquidity requirement and takes necessary action. Periodical reports are also placed before the ALCO for perusal and review.\n- \u00b7 The Bank's HQLA comprises of Excess CRR, Excess SLR, eligible foreign sovereign investments, Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) and Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FALLCR) as permitted under prudential guidance and eligible Level 2 investments. The Bank has a very limited exposure to liquidity risk on account of its Derivatives portfolio. Further, the Bank believes that all inflows and outflows which might have a material impact under the liquidity stress scenario have been considered for the purpose of LCR. Further, SLR investments as well as Corporate Bond portfolio of the Bank considered for HQLA is also well diversified across various instruments and Liquid Asset Type Mix and should provide the Bank with adequate and timely liquidity.\n- \u00b7 The daily average LCR for quarter ending March 31, 2022 is 114.6% which is well above the prudential requirement of 100%.",

In the backdrop of the global financial crisis that started in 2007, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) proposed certain reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity regulations with the objective of promoting a more resilient banking sector. In this regard, the Basel III rules text on liquidity - 'Basel III: International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring' was issued in December 2010 which presented the details of global regulatory standards on liquidity. Two minimum standards, viz., Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for funding liquidity were prescribed by the Basel Committee for achieving two separate but complementary objectives. The NSFR promotes resilience over a longer-term time horizon by requiring banks to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance/limits set by the Board.\n\nThe guidelines for NSFR maintenance were made effective from October 01, 2021. The NSFR is defined as the amount of  available  stable  funding  relative  to  the  amount  of  required  stable  funding.  'Available  stable  funding'  (ASF)  is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends to one year. The amount of stable funding required ('Required stable funding') (RSF) of a specific institution is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets held by that institution as well as those of its off-balance sheet (OBS) exposures.\n\n## 17.5.63 Intra-Group Exposures to Subsidiaries\n\nThe  Bank  had  three  subsidiaries  viz.

Forward  exchange contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the  contracted rate. Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/ principal in one currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps  are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts  of financial instruments of such foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis  for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but do not necessarily  indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments  and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank's exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative  instruments become favourable (assets) or unfavourable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations  in market rates or prices relative to their terms.

Guarantees generally represent irrevocable  assurances that the Bank will make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its  financial or performance obligations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|          4 | Other items for which the  Bank is contingently liable                                         | Purchase of securities pending settlement, capital commitments, amount deposited with  RBI under Depositor Education Awareness Fund (DEAF), bill re-discounting, Foreign Exchange  Contracts (Tom & Spot), Undrawn partial credit enhancement facilities, When Issued ('WI')  securities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n\nRefer Schedule 12 for amounts relating to contingent liability.\n\n## Prior period comparatives\n\nPrevious year's figures have been regrouped where necessary to conform to current year classification.\n\n## For M P Chitale & Co.\n\nChartered Accountants Firm's Registration No. 101851W\n\n## Anagha Thatte\n\nPartner\n\nDirector\n\nMembership No. 105525\n\n(DIN: 03502424)\n\n## For and on behalf of the Board of Directors YES BANK Limited\n\n| Prashant Kumar          | Sunil Mehta     |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|\n| Managing Director & CEO | Chairman        |\n| (DIN: 07562475)         | (DIN: 00065343) |\n\n## For Chokshi & Chokshi LLP\n\nChartered Accountants Firm's Registration No. 101872W/W100045\n\n## Vineet Saxena\n\n## Mahesh Krishnamurti\n\nNiranjan Banodkar\n\n## Shivanand R.

We performed the following audit procedures as part of our controls testing:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluation  of  the  policies  used  for  recognition  and  measurement  of deferred  tax  assets  in  accordance  with  AS  22  Accounting  for  Taxes  on Income;\n- \u00b7 assessed the probability of the availability of future taxable profi ts based on assumptions and other parameters used by the Management including the probable impact of Covid-19 pandemic against which the Bank will be able to use this deferred tax asset in the future with reference to forecast as noted by the Board of Directors while adopting the consolidated fi nancial statements.\n- \u00b7 assessed  the  method  for  determining  the  Deferred  Tax  Asset  with reference to applicable tax rates and tested the arithmetical accuracy.\n\nand its  consolidated  cash  fl ows  for  the  year  ended  on that date.\n\n## Basis of opinion\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the Standards  on  Auditing  ('SAs')  specifi ed  under  Section 143 (10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those SAs are  further  described  in  the  'Auditor's  Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in  accordance  with  the  Code  of  Ethics  issued  by  the Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  ('the  ICAI') together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  fi nancial  statements under the provisions of the Act, and the Rules thereunder, and  we  have  fulfi lled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities in  accordance  with  these  requirements  and  the  Code of  Ethics.  We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have obtained, is suffi  cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated fi nancial statements.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our professional  judgement,  were  of  most  signifi cance  in the  audit  of  the  consolidated  fi nancial  statements  of the  current  year.  These  matters  were  addressed  in the  context  of  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  fi nancial statements  as  a  whole,  and  in  forming  our  opinion thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate  opinion on  these  matters.  We  have  determined  the  matters described  below  to  be  the  key  audit  matters  to  be communicated in our report:",

When  we  read  the  other information,  if  we  conclude  that  there  is  a  material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance.\n\n## Management's and Board of Director's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe  Bank's  management  and  Board  of  Directors  are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and presentation of  these  consolidated  financial  statements  that  give a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  consolidated  financial position, consolidated financial performance and consolidated  cash  flows  of  the  Group  in  accordance with  the  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in India,  including  the  Accounting  Standards  specified under Section 133 of the Act, provisions of Section 29 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and the circulars and guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') from time to time, as applicable to the Bank. The respective Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  included  in  the Group  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines, for safeguarding of the assets  of  the  Group  and  for  preventing  and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and  estimates  that  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  and design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the accounting  records,  relevant  to  the  preparation  and presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements, the  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  included  in the  Group  are  responsible  for  assessing  the  Group's ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as applicable, matters related to going concern and using\n\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe  respective  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group.\n\n## Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  SAs  will always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional  judgement  and  maintain  professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  Under Section  143(3)(i)  of  the  Act,  we  are  also  responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the bank has adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  financial  statements  in  place  and  the  operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures in the consolidated financial\n\n- statements  made  by  the  Management  and  Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and  Board  of  Directors  use  of  the  going  concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate, to  modify  our  opinion.  Our  conclusions  are  based on  the  audit  evidence  obtained  up  to  the  date  of our  Auditor's  Report.  However,  future  events  or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate  the  overall  presentation,  structure  and content  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated  financial  statements  represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business  activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an opinion  on  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For  the  other  entities  included  in  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements,  which  have  been  audited  by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for  the  direction,  supervision  and  performance  of the  audits  carried  out  by  them.  We  remain  solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in para (a) of the section titled 'Other Matters' in this audit report.\n- \u00b7 We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  obtained  by  us along with the consideration of audit reports of the other  auditors  referred  to  in  sub-paragraph  (a)  of the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of  the  Bank  and  such  other  entities  included  in  the\n\nconsolidated  financial  statements  of  which  we  are  the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit  findings,  including  any  significant  deficiencies  in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant ethical  requirements  regarding  independence,  and  to communicate  with  them  all  relationships  and  other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated financial  statements  of  the  current  year  and  are therefore  the  key  audit  matters.  We  describe  these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  we  determine  that a  matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- (a) The  Bank  has  sold  its  entire  stake  in  its  wholly owned subsidiaries YES Asset Management (India) Limited  and  YES  Trustee  Limited  on  November 01,  2021.  Accordingly,  the  consolidated  financial statements include figures of these two subsidiaries till  October  31,  2021.  The  interim  financial  results of  these  subsidiaries  for  period  up  to  September 30,  2021  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements have been reviewed by other independent auditors on which we have relied upon. The  interim  financial  results  of  these  subsidiaries for a period of October 01, 2021 till October 31, 2021 included  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements have  been  reviewed  by  one  of  the  joint  statutory auditors. These interim financial results included in the statement reflects total revenues of ' 99.86 lakh and total net loss after tax of ' 741.79 lakh for the seven months ended October 31, 2021 respectively as considered in the Annual Consolidated Financial Results.\n\nOur opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, is not modified in respect of the above matters  with  respect  to  our  reliance  on  the  work",

        "page_content": "## ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\nof even date on the consolidated financial statements of YES BANK Limited for the year ended March 31, 2022\n\n(Referred to in paragraph 3(f) under 'Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements' in the Independent Auditor's Report of even date to the members of YES BANK Limited on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022)\n\n## Report  on  the  Internal  Financial  Controls  with reference  to  the  aforesaid  consolidated  financial statements  under  Clause  (i)  of  sub-section  3  of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act')\n\nWe  have  audited  the  internal  financial  controls  with reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  of  YES BANK Limited ('the Bank') and its subsidiary company, which is companies incorporated in India as of March 31, 2022, in conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended on that date.\n\n## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls\n\nThe  respective  company's  management  and  Board of Directors  are  responsible  for  establishing  and maintaining  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to  consolidated  financial  statements  based  on  criteria established  by  the  Bank  and  respective  companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting ('the Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ('the  ICAI').  These  responsibilities  include  the  design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls  that  were  operating  effectively  for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including  adherence  to  the  respective  Company's policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its  assets,  the  prevention and  detection  of  frauds  and  errors,  the  accuracy  and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act').\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements  of  the  Bank  and  its  subsidiary  companies, which  are  companies  incorporated  in  India,  based  on our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with the  Guidance  Note  and  the  Standards  on  Auditing ('the Standards'), issued by the ICAI and deemed to be, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India\n\nwith  reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to consolidated  financial  statements  were  established and  maintained  and  whether  such  controls  operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements  and  their  operating  effectiveness. Our  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists, and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  auditor's judgement,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of  the  respective  subsidiary  companies,  in  terms  of their report referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference  to  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the Bank and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nA  Bank's  internal  financial  controls  with  reference to consolidated  financial  statements  is  a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles.  The  Bank's  internal  financial  control  with reference  to  consolidated  financial  statement  includes those policies and procedures that\n\n- 1. pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of the Bank;\n- 2. provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  Bank  are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Bank; and\n- 3. provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or  timely  detection  of  unauthorised  acquisition, use,  or  disposition  of  the  Bank's  assets  that could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or improper  management  override  of  controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk  that  the  internal  financial  control  with  reference to consolidated  financial statement  may  become inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Holding Company (the Bank) and its subsidiary company, which is incorporated in India, have maintained, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial control system with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to the consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on  internal  control  with  reference  to  consolidated financial statements criteria established by the Bank and the  respective  subsidiary  companies  considering  the essential  components  of  internal  control  stated  in  the Guidance Note.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nOur aforesaid reports under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on  the  adequacy  and  operating  effectiveness  of  the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial  statements  in  so  far  as  it  relates  to  one subsidiary  company,  is  based  on  the  corresponding report of the auditor of this company.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## For M P Chitale & Co.\n\n## For Chokshi & Chokshi LLP\n\nChartered Accountants\n\n(Firm Regn.

The  Bank  classifies transactions undertaken by IBU as overseas operation.\n\nThe Bank had three wholly owned subsidiaries namely Yes  Securities  (India)  Limited,  YES  Asset  Management (India) Limited and YES Trustee Limited. On November 1, 2021, the Bank has completed the sale of its entire stake in its wholly owned subsidiaries YES Asset Management (India) Limited and YES Trustee Limited to GPL Finance and Investments Limited.\n\nYES  Securities  (India) Limited  ('the  Company') was  incorporated  on  March  14,  2013,  as  a  wholly owned subsidiary of YES Bank Limited ('YBL' / 'Holding Company'). The Company is a securities broker registered with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  since July 8, 2013. The Company also got SEBI registration as Category  I  Merchant  Banker  w.e.f.  September  3,  2015 and  as  a  Research  Analyst  w.e.f.  November  30,  2015. The Company also got SEBI registration as Investment Adviser w.e.f. March 20, 2017. The Company offers, inter alia,  trading  /  investment  in  equity,  merchant  banking and  other  financial  products  along  with  various  value added services. The Company is member of the National Stock Exchange ('NSE') since May 2, 2013 and the Bombay Stock Exchange ('BSE') since June 11, 2013 and MCX since February 5, 2019, NCDEX since February 6, 2020.\n\n## 17.2 Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe Bank has sold its entire stake in its wholly owned subsidiaries YES Asset Management (India) Limited and YES Trustee Limited on November 01, 2021. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements include figures of these two subsidiaries till October 31, 2021.\n\nThe  Bank  consolidates  its  subsidiaries  in  accordance with Accounting Standard ('AS') 21, Consolidated Financial Statements notified under section 133 of the Companies  Act  2013,  read  together  with  paragraph  7 of  the  Companies  (Accounts)  Rules  2014  issued  by  the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to the extent applicable on a line-by-line basis by adding together the like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure.\n\n## 17.3 Basis of preparation\n\nThe  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in accordance  with  requirements  prescribed  under  the Third  Schedule  (Form  A  and  Form  B)  of  the  Banking Regulation  Act,  1949.  The  accounting  and  reporting policies  of  the  Bank  used  in  the  preparation  of  these financial  statements  conform  to  Generally  Accepted Accounting  Principles  in  India  (Indian  GAAP),  the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from time  to  time,  the  accounting  standards  notified  under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013 and Companies (Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2016 to the extent  applicable  and  practices  generally  prevalent in  the  banking  industry  in  India.  The  Bank  follows  the accrual  method  of  accounting  and  the  historical  cost convention, unless otherwise stated by RBI guidelines.\n\n## 17.4 Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires  the management to make estimates and assumptions that are considered while reporting amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as of the date of  the  financial  statements  and  income  and  expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that the  estimates  used  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could  differ  from  these  estimates.  The  impact  of  any revision in these estimates is recognised prospectively from the period of change.\n\nThe  outbreak  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  had  led to  a  nation-wide  lockdown  in  April-May  2020.  This was  followed  by  localized  lockdowns  in  areas  with  a significant number of COVID-19 cases. In FY2022, India witnessed  two  more  waves  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic and  the  re-imposition  of  localised/regional  lock-down measures  in  certain  parts  of  the  country.  Currently, while the number of new Covid-19 cases have reduced significantly and the Government of India has withdrawn most of the Covid-19 related restrictions, however, the extent  to  which  the  COVID-19  pandemic  will  continue",

Recoveries  from  bad  debts  written-off  are recognised in the Profit and Loss account and included under Provisions and Contingencies\n\nIn case of loans sold to asset reconstruction company, if  consideration is more than net book value, the Bank records the security receipts as investment at Net Book Value as per RBI guidelines.\n\nThe Bank has in place a Country Risk management policy as  part  of  its  Board  approved  Credit  policy,  which  is based on extant regulatory guidelines and addresses the identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting of  country  risk.  Countries  are  categorized  into  seven risk  categories,  viz.  Insignificant,  Low  Risk,  Moderately Low Risk, Moderate Risk, Moderately Risk, High Risk and Very High Risk. The Bank calculates direct and indirect country risk in line with the policy requirements. Indirect exposure  is  reckoned  at  50%  of  the  exposure  in  case of  countries  where  the  net  funded  exposure  exceeds 1% of the Bank's total assets. Further, if the net funded exposure of the Bank in respect of each country exceeds 1% of the Bank's total assets, provisioning is required to be made on exposure to such countries. Depending on the risk category of the country, provisioning is done on a graded scale ranging from 0.25% to 100%.\n\n## 17.5.4 Transactions involving foreign exchange\n\nForeign  currency  income  and  expenditure  items  of domestic  operations  are  translated  at  the  exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Income and  expenditure  items  of  integral  foreign  operations are translated at the daily average closing rates and of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches) at the monthly average closing rates.\n\nPremia/discounts on foreign exchange swaps, that are used to hedge risks arising from foreign currency assets and liabilities, are amortized over the life of the swap.\n\nMonetary  foreign  currency  assets  and  liabilities  are translated  at  the  balance  sheet  date  at  rates  notified by  the  Foreign  Exchange  Dealers'  Association  of  India ('FEDAI').  Foreign  exchange  contracts  are  stated  at net  present  value  using  risk-free  rates  ('RFRs')/SWAP curves  of  the  respective  currencies  with  the  resulting unrealised  gain  or  loss  being  recognised  in  the  Profit\n\nand Loss Account and correspondingly in other assets (representing  positive  Mark-to-Market)  and  in  other liabilities (representing negative Mark-to-Market ('MTM')) on a gross basis.\n\nFinancial conduct  authority  ('FCA')  of  the  United Kingdom has phased out London interbank offered rate ('LIBOR')  on  December  2021,  replacing  it  by  Alternate Reference  rate  ('ARR').  Libor  was  used  by  the  Bank  as benchmark for funded as well as Non-funded exposure. Accordingly,  MIFOR  (derived  with  LIBOR  and  forward premium in  forex  markets)  has  also  been  replaced  by Modified MIFOR.\n\nRBI vide the press release CO.FMRD.DIRD. S39/14.02.001/2021-22 on July 08, 2021 has encouraged the Banks to cease entering into new financial contracts that  has  reference  LIBOR/MIFOR  as  a  benchmark  and instead  use  widely  accepted  ARR.  Bank  has  started offering new transaction based on ARR curve w.e.f Jan 1, 2022 except existing underlying transactions linked to LIBOR/MIFOR as permissible by the regulations.\n\nIn  accordance  with  AS  11  'The  Effects  of  changes  in Foreign Exchange Rates', contingent liabilities in respect of  outstanding  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts, derivatives, guarantees, endorsements  and  other obligations are stated at the exchange rates notified by FEDAI corresponding to the balance sheet date.\n\nBoth  monetary  and  non-monetary  foreign  currency assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations are  translated  at  closing  exchange  rates  notified  by FEDAI at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss arising from exchange differences are accumulated in  the  Foreign  Currency  Translation  Account  until  the disposal  of  the  net  investment  in  the  non-integral foreign operations.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  RBI  clarification,  the  Bank does  not  recognise  in  the  profit  and  loss  account  the proportionate  exchange  gains  or  losses  held  in  the foreign currency translation reserve on repatriation of profits from overseas operations.\n\nCurrency  future  contracts  are  marked  to  market  daily using  settlement  price  on  a  trading  day,  which  is  the closing price of the respective future contracts on that day.  While  the  daily  settlement  prices  is  computed  on the  basis  of  weighted  average  price  of  such  contract, the final settlement price is taken as the RBI reference rate on the last trading day of the future contract or as may be specified by the relevant authority from time to time. All open positions are marked to market based on\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2022\n\nthe settlement price and the resultant marked to market profit / loss is daily set.\n\n## 17.5.5 Earnings per share\n\nThe Group reports basic and diluted earnings per equity share in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS) 20, 'Earnings per Share' notified under section 133 of the Companies  Act  2013.  Basic  earnings  per  equity  share have  been  computed  by  dividing  net  profit  after  tax for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding for the period.\n\nDiluted earnings per equity share have been computed using  the  weighted  average  number  of  equity  shares and dilutive potential equity shares options outstanding during  the  period  except  where  the  results  are  anti -dilutive.\n\n## 17.5.6 Accounting for derivative transactions\n\nDerivative transactions comprises forward rate agreements,  swaps  and  option  contracts.

The corresponding gain or loss is recognised as cash flow hedge reserve. Further to match profit/ loss on account of revaluation of foreign currency borrowing,  the  corresponding  amount  is  recycled  from cash flow hedge reserve to Profit and Loss account.\n\nThe  Bank  follows  the  option  premium  accounting framework prescribed by FEDAI SPL-  circular  dated  Dec\n\n14,  2007.  Premium  on  option  transaction  is  recognized as income/expense on expiry or early termination of the transaction. Mark to market (MTM) gain/loss (adjusted for premium received/paid on option contracts) is recorded under 'Other Income'.\n\nThe  amounts  received/paid  on  cancellation  of  option contracts  are  recognized  as  realized  gains/losses  on options.  Charges  receivable/payable  on  cancellation/ termination  of  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  and swaps are recognized as income/ expense on the date of cancellation/ termination under 'Other Income'.\n\nValuation of Interest Rate Futures (IRF) is carried out on the  basis  of  the  daily  settlement  price  of  each  contract provided by the exchange.\n\nThe requirement for collateral and credit risk mitigation on  derivative  contracts  is  assessed  based  on  internal credit  policy.  Overdue  if  any,  on  account  of  derivative transactions  are  accounted  in  accordance  with  extant RBI guidelines.\n\nAs per the RBI guidelines on 'Prudential Norms for Offbalance  Sheet  Exposures  of  Banks'  a  general  provision is  made on the current gross MTM gain of the contract for  all  outstanding  interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange derivative transactions.\n\nThe Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts Act, 2020 (the Act), has been notified by the Government of I n dia and subsequent to this the RBI through circular dated March 30, 2021 allowed netting of the Qualified Financial Contracts  (QFC).  The  Bank  shall  work  progressively  on classification  of  multiple  permissible  transactions  into a  netting  set  which  may  result  in  reduction  in  capital requirement due to these transactions over the period.\n\n## 17.5.7 Fixed assets\n\nFixed  assets  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated depreciation, amortization and accumulated impairment losses.  Cost  comprises  the  purchase  price  and  any cost  attributable  for  bringing  the  asset  to  its  working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only when it increases the future benefit /functioning capability from / of such assets.",

Impairment loss, if any, is provided in the Profit and Loss Account  to  the  extent  the  carrying  amount  of  assets exceeds their estimated recoverable amount.\n\n## 17.5.10 Employee benefits\n\n## Employee Stock Option Scheme ('ESOS')\n\nThe  Employee  Stock  Option  Scheme  ('the  Scheme') provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares of The Group to its employees. The options granted to employees vest in a graded manner and these may be exercised by the employees within specified periods.\n\nMeasurement  of  the  employee  share-based  payment plans is done in accordance with the Guidance Note on Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments issued by  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (ICAI) and SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014. RBI, vide its clarification dated August 30, 2021 on Guidelines  on  Compensation  of  Whole  Time  Directors /  Chief  Executive  Officers  /  Material  Risk  Takers  and Control Function Staff, advised Banks that the fair value of share-linked instruments on  the date of grant should be recognized as an expense for all instruments granted after  the  accounting  period  ending  March  31,  2021. Accordingly, the Group has changed its accounting policy from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method for all share-linked instruments granted after March 31, 2021.  The  fair  value  of  the  stock-based  compensation is  estimated  on  the  date  of  grant  using  Black-Scholes model  is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2022\n\nOptions granted till March 31, 2021, the Group measures compensation cost relating to employee stock options using the intrinsic value method. Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the fair market price of the underlying stock (i.e. the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options) over the exercise price.  The exercise price of the Bank's stock option is the last closing price on the stock exchange on the day preceding the date of grant of stock options and accordingly there is no compensation cost under the intrinsic value method.\n\n## Compensated absences\n\nThe  employees  of  the  Group  are  entitled  to  carry forward a part of their unavailed/unutilized leave subject to  a  maximum  limit.  The  employees  cannot  encash unavailed/unutilized  leave.  The  Group  provides  for leave  encashment  /  compensated  absences  based  on an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions about demographics, early  retirement,  salary  increases,  interest  rates  and leave utilisation.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe Group provides for gratuity, for all employees. The Gratuity is  payable  to  an  employee  as  per  Payment  of Gratuity  Act.  The  Group  accounts  for  the  liability  for future  gratuity  benefits  using  the  projected  unit  cost method based on annual actuarial valuation.\n\nThe  defined  gratuity  benefit  plans  are  valued  by  an independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of  AS-15,  Employee Benefits, to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service  costs.  Under  this  method,  the  determination is based  on  actuarial  calculations,  which  include assumptions  about  demographics,  early  retirement, salary increases and interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss account.\n\n## Provident fund\n\nAll  employees  of  the  Group  are  covered  under  the Employees Provident Fund, a defined contribution plan in  which  both  the  employee  and  the  Bank  contribute monthly. Contribution to provident fund are recognized as expense as and when the services are rendered. The Group has no liability for future provident fund benefits other than its annual contribution.\n\n## National Pension System (NPS)\n\nThe  NPS  is  a  defined  contribution  retirement  plan. The  primary  objective  is  enabling  systematic  savings and  to  provide  retirees  with  an  option  to  achieve financial  stability.  Pension  contributions  are  invested in the pension fund schemes. The Bank has no liability for  future  fund  benefits  other  than  the  voluntary contribution made  by  employees  who  agree  to contribute to the scheme.\n\n## 17.5.11 Leases\n\nLeases where the lessor effectively retains substantially all  risks  and  benefits  of  ownership  are  classified  as operating  leases.    Operating  lease  payments  are recognized as an expense in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term in accordance with Accounting Standard -19, Leases.\n\n## 17.5.12 Income taxes\n\nTax  expense  comprises  current  and  deferred  tax. Current tax comprises of the amount of tax for the period determined  in  accordance  with  the  Income-tax  Act, 1961 and the rules framed there under. Deferred taxes reflect the impact of timing differences between taxable income and accounting income for the current year and reversal of timing differences of earlier years and carry forward  losses.  Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are recognised  for  the  future  tax  consequences  of  timing differences  between  the  carrying  values  of  assets  and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss  carry  forwards.  Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities are  measured  using  the  enacted  or  substantively enacted tax rates at the balance sheet date. The impact of  changes  in  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  only  to  the  extent there  is  reasonable  certainty  that  the  assets  can be  realized  in  future.  Deferred  tax  assets  in  case  of unabsorbed depreciation/ losses are recognized only if there is virtual certainty that such deferred tax asset can be realized against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets are recognized and reassessed at each balance sheet  date  based  upon  management's  judgement  and appropriately  adjusted  to  reflect  the  amount  that  is reasonably certain to be realised.",

If it  is  no  longer  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources would be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from  past  events  whose  existence  will  be  confirmed by  the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of  one  or  more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Bank or a present obligation that arises from past events that is not recognized because it is not probable that  an  outflow  of  resources  will  be  required  to  settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. The Bank does not recognize a  contingent  liability  but  discloses  its  existence  in  the financial statements.\n\nContingent  assets  are  not  recognized  in  the  financial statements.    However,  contingent  assets  are  assessed continually  and  if  it  is  virtually  certain  that  an  inflow of  economic  benefits  will  arise,  the  asset  and  related income  are  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  the change occurs.\n\n## 17.5.14 Cash and Cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, balances with RBI, balances with other banks and money at call and short notice.\n\n## 17.5.15 Corporate social responsibility\n\nExpenditure towards corporate social responsibility,  in accordance with Companies Act, 2013, are recognised in the Profit and Loss account.\n\n## 17.5.16 Debit and credit cards reward points\n\nThe  Bank  estimates  the  probable  redemption  of debit and credit card reward points and cost per point using  actuarial  valuation  method  by  employing  an independent actuary, which includes assumptions such as mortality, redemption and spends.\n\nProvisions for liabilities on said reward points are made based  on  the  actuarial  valuation  report  as  furnished by  the  said  independent  actuary  and  included  in other liabilities.\n\n## 17.5.17 Bullion\n\nThe  Bank  imports  bullion  (gold  and  silver  bars)  on  a consignment  basis  for  selling  to  its  customers.

Forward exchange  contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate.  Currency swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest/principal in one  currency against another, based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to  exchange fixed and floating interest rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments  of such foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments  recognized on the balance sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows  involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Group's  exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments become favorable (assets) or unfavorable  (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices relative to their terms. The aggregate  contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which  instruments are favorable or unfavorable and, thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial  assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly. |\n|          3 | Guarantees given on  behalf of constituents,  acceptances,  endorsements and  other obligations | As a part of its commercial banking activities the Bank issues documentary credit and guarantees on  behalf of its customers. Documentary credits such as letters of credit enhance the credit standing of  the customers of the Bank. Guarantees generally represent irrevocable assurances that the Bank will  make payments in the event of the customer failing to fulfill its financial or performance obligations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|          4 | Other items for  which the Group is  contingently liable                                        | Purchase of securities pending settlement, capital commitments, amount deposited with RBI under  Depositor Education    Awareness Fund (DEAF), bill re-discounting, Foreign Exchange Contracts (Tom &  Spot), undrawn partial credit enhancement facilities, When Issued (WI) securities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\nRefer Schedule 12 for amounts relating to contingent liability.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfor the year ended March 31, 2022\n\n## 17.6.21 Divergence in Asset Classification and Provisioning for NPAs\n\nIn terms of the RBI circular no.
